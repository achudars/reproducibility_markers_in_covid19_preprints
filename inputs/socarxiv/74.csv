The number of works examining the impact of economic crisis, natural disasters or even terrorist attacks are numerous. However, the literature addressing the political effects of the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is still in its infancy. Definitively, the pandemic has constituted an unpredictable external shock not only affecting the health of millions around the planet but also damaging the economic and social stability of most countries. Politically, it has forced electoral authorities in some countries to postpone elections (e.g. Kiribati, North Macedonia, Sri Lanka), to suspend voting rights for those infected with the virus (e.g. Galicia and Basque Country in Spain) or to adapt postal vote regulations (e.g. Bavaria in Germany) in order to guarantee citizens’ voting rights and diminish electoral fraud. Trying to fill a lacuna in the literature, the goal of this article is to give a first and nuanced examination on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted electoral participation all over the world. To that end we have collected data on all parliamentary, presidential and regional elections held worldwide during the first seven months since the COVID-19 outbreak became recognized as a health emergency of global scope and started to affect the organization of elections (March 1st-September 30th, 2020). Our results show that while voter turnout has not generally declined in comparison with those elections held before the pandemic, electoral participation is lower in polities hit by the pandemic the most, both in terms of infections and – especially - deceases. This seems to point to the fact that when faced with a choice (civic duty vs. personal risk), the fear of becoming infected will constrain voters to opt for the former.",TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|Elections|External shocks|Voter turnout,2020-11-18T22:43:22.908042,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-18T17:29:15.856337,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Andrés Santana; José Rama; Fernando Casal Bértoa,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/citation/,3d4ny,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fb40311def8eb01c3e7a69f/,5fb40311def8eb01c3e7a69f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3d4ny/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3d4ny

We analyzed data from 3,215 participants between 40 and 79 years gathered at three measurement occasions between the start of the nation-wide lock-down mid-March 2020 and its lifting early August 2020 in an online survey in Germany. The survey focused on everyday experiences during the COVID-19 crisis and collected various satisfaction ratings (e.g., general life satisfaction, satisfaction with family life, satisfaction with social contacts). Participants also provided retrospective satisfaction ratings for their situations before the COVID-19 crisis at baseline. For a small sub-sample of 29 participants (48–78 years), we explored how attitudes toward own aging (ATOA) measured prior to the crisis may have played a role in satisfaction ratings during the crisis. Both mid-aged and older participants experienced the greatest decreases in satisfaction in the social domain, with more pronounced decreases seen in mid-aged participants. We also observed a partial recovery effect in all measures at T3, and this effect was more pronounced in older adults. More negative ATOA prior to the crisis was associated with lowered psychosocial adaptation. Although ageism arose during the pandemic in the sense that older adults were labeled as a “risk group” particularly at the outbreak, we found in accordance with other studies that mid-aged adults’ satisfaction decreased to a greater extent than older adults’.

The reproduction number R is a key indicator to characterize the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic and to assess the effect of control strategies that frequently have extremely high social and economic costs.    Despite having an analog in demography’s net reproduction rate, demographers may not be familiar with the concept and measurement of R in the context of Covid-19.   

OBJECTIVE
To provide a primer for demographers for understanding and estimating R for Covid-19.  

METHODS
In order to demystify the complexities of estimating this important indicator, we present a simple method for its calculation, following well-known procedures in demography, a discipline in which an analog of R -- the net reproduction rate -- has been routinely computed for a century.   

RESULTS
We show that R can be estimated as a quotient between the numbers of new cases today divided by the weighted average of cases in previous days.  We present two alternative derivations for these weights: based on how risks change over time (constant vs exponential decay).  We provide estimates of these weights and demonstrate their use in calculating R to trace the course of the Covid-19 pandemic in several countries.   

CONTRIBUTION
This primer for demographers demonstrates a method for estimating the reproductive number R for the Covid-19 pandemic derived using familiar demographic techniques.  The strengths of the proposed approach are the transparency of the assumptions and the simplicity of the procedure.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-17T06:46:01.662294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-17T06:45:47.286960,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,Luis Rosero-Bixby and Tim Miller,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/citation/,u6ey9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fb301e55502ac017d8c6c41/,5fb301e55502ac017d8c6c41,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6ey9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u6ey9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u6ey9

For that, we rely on the data collected through Telegram’s API and a combination of network analysis and computational text analysis. We find that the Telegram-based network was cohesive ensuring the efficient spread of protest-related information. Content spread through Telegram predominantly concerned discussions of future actions and protest-related on-site information (i.e., police presence in certain areas). We find that the Telegram network was dominated by different actors each month of the observation suggesting the absence of one single leader. Further, traditional protest leaders - those prominent during the 2014 Umbrella Movement, - such as media and civic organisations were less prominent in the network than local communities.

This finding highlights the importance of distinguishing between religious ideologies and practices when considering how religion affects politics. Using a national sample of US adults, we analyze immigrant views by measuring levels of agreement or disagreement that undocumented immigrants from Mexico are “mostly dangerous criminals.” We find that Christian nationalism is inversely related to pro-immigrant views for both the religiously active and inactive. However, strongly pro-immigrant views are less likely and anti-immigrant views are more likely among strong Christian nationalists who are religiously inactive compared to strong Christian nationalists who are religiously active.

In this paper, we test these hypotheses by examining the long-term labor market returns to track choice in upper secondary education in Denmark using an instrumental variable approach that relies on random variation in school peers’ educational decisions. We report two main findings. First, VET diverts students on the margin to the academic track away from higher-status but not higher-paying occupations. Second, VET protects students on the margin to leaving school from risks of non-employment and unskilled work, also leading to higher earnings. These results suggest that in countries with a highly compressed wage structure, a strong VET system benefits students unlikely to continue to college, while causing few adverse consequences for students on the margin to choosing academic education.",TRUE,FALSE,earnings|educational tracking|instrumental variables|labor market outcomes|peer effects|vocational education,2020-11-17T06:44:02.134247,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-17T06:43:34.544072,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Jesper Fels Birkelund and Herman G. van de Werfhorst,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/citation/,tujz7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fb26bcd77aa65010094a29b/,5fb26bcd77aa65010094a29b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tujz7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tujz7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tujz7

A Comparison of Heterosexuals’ and Sexual Minorities’ Sociopolitical Attitudes,"Few researchers have examined the influence of sexuality on individuals’ sociopolitical attitudes. Using data from the 1991-2012 General Social Surveys (GSS) and 2008 American National Election Survey (ANES), I compare the social and political attitudes of heterosexuals and sexual minorities across a wide array of domains. Examining sixty measures of sociopolitical attitudes in the GSS, I find evidence that sexual minorities are significantly more liberal than their heterosexual counterparts across both sexual (e.g., sexual morality) and non-sexual (e.g., civil liberties, environmentalism) domains. In comparing the effect of sexuality on attitudes to the effects of gender, race, and education, I find that the influence of sexuality is comparable to these other well-documented sociodemographic predictors of attitudes. However, unlike these other sociodemographic characteristics, sexuality consistently predicts more liberal attitudes among sexual minorities compared to heterosexuals. Expanded analyses using 278 attitudinal items in the GSS and 64 in the ANES yield similar results.

Candidate characteristics can shape how leaders use – and how voters react to – nonverbal cues. Drawing on role congruity expectations, we focus on how gender shapes the use of and reactions to facial, voice, and textual communication in political debates. Using full-length debate videos from four German national elections (2005–2017) and a minor debate in 2017, we employ computer vision, machine learning, and text analysis to extract facial displays of emotion, vocal pitch, and speech sentiment. Consistent with our expectations, Angela Merkel expresses less anger and is less emotive than her male opponents. We combine second-by-second candidate emotions data with continuous responses recorded by live audiences. We ﬁnd that voters punish Merkel for anger displays and reward her happiness and general emotional displays.",TRUE,FALSE,emotions|gender|images as data|text analysis|TV debates,2020-11-17T06:41:41.084551,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-17T06:41:33.478577,FALSE,NA,no,"The paper is under review.

Learning analytics/educational data mining (LA/EDM) has access to big observational unstructured data captured from educational settings and relies mostly on unsupervised machine learning algorithms to make sense of such type of data. Generalised additive models of location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) are supervised statistical learning approaches that allow modelling all the parameters of the distribution of the response variable w.r.t. the explanatory variables.

Analysis of observations and themes suggests that campaigners used street mobilization to do two things. First, they used it to build solidarity with supporters through accessibility, use of shared social spaces, and collectively showing respect for losses. Second, they used it to protest in a way that challenged negative stereotypes and projected their power to the authorities, who could not ignore such a large and dignified mobilization. Whereas previous social psychology research on disaster communities focuses on the determinants of immediate responses of people who experienced a disaster, we show the strategic aspects to such disaster communities.",TRUE,FALSE,campaigning|disaster|disaster communities|Grenfell Tower fire|injustice|justice|silent walk|social identity|street mobilization,2020-11-16T16:09:21.038272,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-16T16:09:08.948939,FALSE,NA,no,"interview data is not being publicly shared because in the consent form that our participants signed, we guaranteed that their information will be treated as strictly confidential.
