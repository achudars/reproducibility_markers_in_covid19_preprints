However, despite the steady growth of studies that employ web and app time diaries, there is little research on their comparability with traditional paper-administered diaries that have long been regarded as the “gold standard” for measurement in time-use research. This paper rectifies this omission by investigating diary mode effects on data quality and measurement, drawing on data from a mixed-mode large-scale time diary study of adolescents in the United Kingdom. After controlling for selection effects, we find that web and app diaries yield higher quality data than paper diaries, which attests to the potential of new technologies in facilitating diary completion. At the same time, our analysis of broad time-use domains does not find substantial mode effects on measurement for the majority of daily activity categories.

To overcome this problem, the current study (N=5200) used latent profile analysis to uncover six profiles, including two micro-communities of vaccine skeptical people that have the potential to jeopardise vaccine-led herd immunity. The most vaccine-skeptical group (1.14%) was highly educated and expressed strong liberal tendencies. This group were also the most skeptical about genetically modified crops and nuclear energy, and most likely to receive news about science from the internet.

Using difference-in-differences estimation and data from the Socio-Economic Panel, I examine whether inequalities in secondary school track attainment increased after the implementation of the so-called ‘Hartz IV’ reform. The findings suggest that children whose parents receive the newly created scheme ALGII instead of Arbeitslosenhilfe for unemployment assistance experienced a significant and considerable drop in their chances to attend the academic track. Changes in parents’ socio-demographic characteristics due to stricter eligibility criteria and lower household incomes as a result of lower benefit levels account for half of the observed decline. By contrast, reductions in parental life satisfaction due to increased benefit conditionality and stigma are unlikely to mediate the reform’s documented effects. Focussing on an important outcome in Germany’s highly stratified educational system, the study is hence the first to provide evidence on the intergenerational effects of Hartz IV, shedding light on the role of social security and welfare institutions in the transmission of inequalities from parents to their children.",TRUE,FALSE,|difference-in-differences|educational attainment|Germany|Hartz IV|intergenerational inequalities|parental benefit receipt|parental unemployment,2021-03-04T18:55:03.557312,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T18:54:38.804550,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/citation/,acuwn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60411ff967386c04136224d3/,60411ff967386c04136224d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acuwn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/acuwn

If this is true then individuals should be motivated to both observe, and copy, common social behaviours (social norms). Previous economic experiments, using the public goods game, have suggested individuals are motivated to follow social norms. However, natural selection should favour individuals whom prefer to discover and copy successful behaviours, and previous experiments have often not shown examples of success. Here we test, on 489 participants, if individuals are more motivated to learn about, and more likely to copy, either common or successful behaviours. Using the same cooperative game and instructions, we find that individuals are primarily motivated to copy successful rather than common behaviours. Consequently, social learning disfavours costly cooperation, even when individuals can observe a stable, pro-social, norm.

One of the most significant developments with the use of ICT in higher education over the last decade has been the integration and application of e-learning systems to support the processes of teaching and learning. The implementation of ICT into the classroom should not be seen as merely an add-on, but should be included with purpose: meaningfully implemented based on pedagogy. Despite the suggested power of ICT in educating students for a modern future, the implementation of these technologies into the classroom is not as widespread as expected; debate still abounds as to what role ICT should play in the classroom. This research examined a variety of dependable attributes that assessed the engagement of undergraduate students (n1=87) through virtual whiteboards. This quantitative inquiry revealed that students perceived virtual whiteboards as beneficial for their learning and improved their engagement level in the classroom. Furthermore, a correlation between the level of engagement and the year of study was revealed as the primary implication of this research.",TRUE,FALSE,Active Learning|E-Learning|Information and Communication Technology,2021-03-04T14:23:28.945695,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T14:22:54.651692,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/citation/,jdprf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040e5a2035cf7042ec8715b/,6040e5a2035cf7042ec8715b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jdprf/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.182,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jdprf

However, there is yet no concrete evidence that the students’ pre-university academic accolades determine their performances at university level. In this article, we explored the findings of earlier studies that examined the relationships between entry grades and the academic performance of university students. The study was undertaken to collate the literature on the relationships between the students’ entry grades and their university academic performance in order to validate earlier assertions, if any, as well as to identify opportunities for further research in this field. During the study, we carried out a systematic review of 59 articles that we drew from different online electronic databases including, among others, the Free Scientific Publication, the Worldwide Science.org, and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The majority of these reviewed studies were drawn from America and Europe. Only a few of them were conducted in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of the 59 reviewed articles, only 53 of them met our inclusion criteria and our key findings showed, among others, that out of the 53 reviewed articles, 26, 4 and 13 of them revealed the existence of positive, negative, and mixed correlations respectively between the entry grades and the academic performance of university students. The remaining 10 articles, however, did not reveal any significant correlations between the two variables; instead, they alluded to the existence of difference in these relationships between male and female students; thus, suggesting for the need for affirmative action schemes. Overall, the study revealed that there is yet no consensus over whether pre-university academic performances of students predict their performances at university level; thus, indicating the need for further research in this field.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Performance|Admission|Cumulative Grade Point Average|Entry Grades|University,2021-03-04T14:25:43.507771,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T14:25:19.582431,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/citation/,vsneq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040e497441575041a57f480/,6040e497441575041a57f480,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vsneq/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.181,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vsneq

We develop two measures of network tension: the relative frequency and the strength of strong, open triads. Our results show that in recorded jazz music–a uniquely synergistic domain of collective creativity—tension is more prevalent than expected, and it is a predictor of several success measures, including deep success, while brokerage and closure are not. We also measure the structural availability of tension to each session and show that unexpected tension (where musicians go beyond chance to bring imbalance into their bands) has an additional contribution to deep success. We discuss implications for project teams and organizations where collective innovation is crucial.",TRUE,FALSE,innovation|jazz|social networks|teams|tension,2021-03-04T14:25:06.183806,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T14:24:44.736124,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/citation/,bpxwa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xb3tv/,xb3tv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040e43f67386c0405621cdf/,6040e43f67386c0405621cdf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpxwa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bpxwa/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bpxwa
