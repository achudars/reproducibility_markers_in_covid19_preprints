Universities worldwide have established distance learning, which demanded combining and improving both traditional and innovative education forms. The article offers a comprehensive analysis of pre-recorded mini-lectures in the educational space of distance learningfor different scientific-educational Internet projects (Coursera, PostNauka, Udacity, edX, LinguaLeo, EdEra, etc.). Mini-lectures are complete pieces of speech limited in time and accessible to multiple reproductions; that is why they are quite a representative material for the research of the generation of cognitive processes and perception of a verbal educational message in asynchronous online learning. The significant results of the study include: the definition of invariable characteristics of virtual mini-lectures (distance, virtuality, mediation, situational incorrigibility, multimodality), defining cognitive strategies of the speaker and the listener in an asynchronous lecture interaction, finding the points of contact (motivation and interest in transferring and receiving information) between them.

This study used a qualitative case study to obtain data from the instructor’s e-feedback in three linguistic courses as delivered, practiced by the single English language instructor. The instructor’s e-feedback via Blackboard and WhatsApp platform and the follow-up interview were analyzed qualitatively. The findings indicate that (1) the highest number of instructor’s e-feedback focused on global issues as compared to local issues, (2) the instructor composed his e-feedback in the form of eight main categories: explanations, suggestions, clarifications, questioning, repetitions, statements, praises, and commands, (3) the instructor used more screencasts for providing e-feedback, followed by written and audio modes respectively. The thematic analysis (4) revealed the instructor’s positive impression on providing e-feedback through these interactive modes (written, audio, and screencast) and a range of challenging issues such as students’ preference issues, technical issues, timing issues, financial and areal issues. This study is significant because it provides us with a comprehensive picture of the patterns of the feedback content, the formulation of the e-feedback, the multimodality of the instructor’s e-feedback, and the significant issues that emerged from the instructor’s e-feedback practices.

It should be admitted that higher education worldwide is changing, and institutions face challenges when adapting to the new COVID-19 reality – blended digital teaching and learning. They are tackling several issues connected with the essence of virtual education, its technical aspect, and students’ learning environment. During COVID-19 lockdown, teachers have to prepare and deliver their classes from home, simultaneously coping with numerous professional and technical challenges, often without any appropriate support. In addition to that, they were lack of technology literacy, professional knowledge, and experience needed for successful E-teaching. Besides, a new mode of blended digital teaching and learning also made them consider technical and administrative aspects of the current educational process, namely to use new educational platforms and tools, organize active workflows, and work out critical educational principles to design and facilitate practical online experiences. Along with the challenges that the teachers face in such conditions, they should be able to cope with the stress and psychological disorders of pupils and students. The article emphasizes the abnormal psychology of youngsters (pupils and students) as the result of stress and anxiety that appeared during Covid lockdown – the application of psychological science to understanding and treating mental disorders – and the use of video as a productive means of avoiding psychological disabilities. The research objective is to prove that video is an effective educational tool for avoiding psychological difficulties in blended digital learning during COVID-19 lockdown while teaching foreign languages, literature, and culture. Special attention is paid to psychological strategies of overcoming stress during COVID-19 lockdown, as well as to effective ways to students’ adapt to a virtual learning environment, development and implementation of anti-stress methods, which heighten their motivation.

Following the call of Oman Vision 2040 to emphasize educational practices that promote the development of higher-order cognitive processes, this study raises the following question: Can an online multiple choice question (MCQ) quiz tap into the higher-order cognitive skills of apply, analyze and evaluate? This question was also critical at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic when Omani universities switched to the online learning mode. The researchers administered an online MCQ quiz to 35 undergraduate students enrolled in an ESP course for Engineering and Sciences. The results showed that MCQ quizzes could be developed to tap into higher-order thinking skills when the stem of the MSQ is developed as a task or a scenario. The study also revealed that students performed better on MCQs that tap into low-level cognitive skills. This result can be attributed to the prevalent practice in Oman to develop assessment tools that tap only into a level of Bloom’s taxonomy, which involves the cognitive process of retrieving memorized information. The significance of the study lies in its pedagogical applications. The study calls for the use of teaching and assessment practices that target the development of higher-order thinking skills, which is aligned with the country’s strategic direction reflected in Oman vision 2040.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-05-20T14:56:08.819712,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T14:55:49.713237,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/citation/,q5pyd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5e3728b826b01458c02fb/,60a5e3728b826b01458c02fb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5pyd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q5pyd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q5pyd

Thus, a new movement towards widespread e-learning emerged with unknown consequences for learners and educators alike. The situation in Saudi Arabia was no exception. The purpose of this study is to explore how English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching and learning at the tertiary level in Saudi Arabia was impacted negatively and positively by the move to online learning. It reviews research published since the onset of the pandemic, with a specific focus on English language teaching at Saudi universities, to analyze the challenges faced by Saudi EFL teachers and learners since the shift to e-learning. One of the biggest challenges observed was students’ lack of motivation, which upon further review was found to be linked to other contributing factors, such as technological issues, inapt learning environments, and students’ mental health.

In this regard, this paper aims to explore the teachers’ challenges while implementing a reading strategy-based instruction for beginners during the Covid-19 pandemic, taking the Algerian middle schools as a case in point. It highlights the difficulties to achieving quality in developing learners’ procedural knowledge and strategic awareness in EFL reading classes. The leading approach to the issue is the interactive approach. To attain the objective of the research, the qualitative method was adopted. Classroom observation and structured interviews were used to collect data. The population targeted was composed of 20 teachers from 16 middle schools in Tizi-Ouzou. The collected data were subjected to qualitative content analysis. The results of the study reveal that most teachers are aware of the importance of reading strategy-based instruction. However, they do not teach them systematically or consistently. Indeed, lack of targeted teacher training, time constraints, and disregard of metacognitive instruction are likely to be obstacles to the efficient implementation of reading strategy-instruction. Furthermore, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown up several psychological and cognitive learners’ difficulties, including decreased motivation and lack of cognitive focus, making the teaching process more challenging.

This precipitous move to online teaching has radically altered our teaching practices, where teachers have had to either completely do away with traditional practices or modify them in significant ways. One of the primary concerns of online teaching voiced by many teachers is to hold students’ interest and keep them engaged in the virtual classroom. Another challenge has been to make students interact with each other and the teacher. The authors of this paper believe that Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) addresses these concerns head-on. There are two reasons for this: first, its emphasis on real-life language through meaningful tasks; and second, it is student-centered. This paper provides a brief background of TBLT and technology-mediated TBLT. It will show how some coursebook materials could be used in TBLT to help online learners improve their language skills. The paper also outlines with examples how technology-mediated tasks could be deployed to encourage learners to use language in productive ways. Finally, the authors discuss some of the anticipated challenges concerning the application of TBLT in online teaching and learning contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-05-20T14:57:46.623582,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T14:57:15.839652,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/citation/,w54hn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5df7c8b826b01448bdc32/,60a5df7c8b826b01448bdc32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w54hn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w54hn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w54hn

The authors describe teaching English in Ukraine during the global pandemic caused by the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19 in early spring 2020. The study aims at reviewing the most important works of Ukrainian and foreign scholars. They describe the most modern methods of teaching English in higher educational institutions of Ukraine. The scholars pay particular attention to the description of the latest English teaching methods, which they use at Uzhhorod National University. The observation process allowed us to summarize information about the features of distance learning at Uzhhorod National University. Analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, abstraction generalization, and the descriptive method are applied. The study found out the educational process has been reformed in Ukrainian universities by European quality requirements for education: informatization-globalization of academic space, integration of functions in modern education, establishing Ukrainian universities cooperation with European and Eastern educational institutions in the field of education and research as well as changes in the educational process associated with the rapid spread of Covid-19, which forced the entire civilized world to seek new types of learning, new methods, and tools. During the pandemic, it is vital to provide personality-oriented education. This knowledge provides optimal conditions for the harmonious development of each student.

It focuses on the students’ preferences for devices and platforms, and gender differences influencing their choices. The study is of significance because it considers the student-centered learning approaches.  The paper also seeks to answer the question as to the factors that lead students to make their preferences for the online teaching tools and devices. A total of 150 students, both men, and women, participated in the study. An online survey was carried out in the form of questionnaires to elicit their responses. The results showed that laptop computers were the dominant devices students used and preferred. They also revealed that the Zoom platform came first in students’ preferences, followed by Blackboard. Also, the findings showed that although participants used smartphones in their ERL, they did not recommend it, and it came last compared to laptops, tablets, and desktop computers in their order of preference.  Gender differences existed in preferences to desktops and tablets in ERL. Another gender difference existed in preferences to platforms. Women students preferred Blackboard to Zoom while men students expressed the opposite.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-05-20T14:58:25.142578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T14:57:51.194518,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/citation/,xf2vh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5dd932cb36e0140c17956/,60a5dd932cb36e0140c17956,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf2vh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xf2vh/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xf2vh
