Examined from George Lakoff's perspective in the field of cognitive science, this dichotomy appears to be based on family-oriented archetypes which he labels Strict Father Model versus Nurturing Parent Model. Philosopher and developmentalist Ken Wilber offers an integral perspective contextualizing this framework within a process of psychosocial evolution. He suggests that the differences represent unfolding of stages of growth characterized in their early levels by a lack of compassion for outsiders but in later levels by greater empathy and inclusiveness. This can create consternation among occupants of the less developed levels who don't grasp the value of showing compassion to those outside their own group.

We focus on Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes (LTNs) introduced during Covid-19. These mainly involve ‘modal filters’ that restrict through motor traffic from residential streets. Such approaches to traffic management are traditional in the Netherlands, but relatively new in London and other global cities such as Barcelona. LTNs are often controversial, with one criticism being that they are implemented in affluent areas and hence benefit richer residents. London represents an excellent opportunity to investigate the extent to which these rapidly introduced schemes have so far been equitably distributed.

We focused on LTNs introduced between March and September 2020 and still present at the end of October 2020. Having generated datasets representing these new LTN locations and their boundary roads, we matched these to Output Areas (OAs, administrative areas containing around 300 residents). We then examined the extent to which LTN implementation was associated with age, ethnicity, disability, employment and car ownership (Census 2011) and small-area deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019). 

We estimated that 3.7% of all Londoners live inside a new LTN, and 8.8% live within 500m walking distance of a new modal filter. Across London as a whole, people in the most deprived quarter of OAs were 2.7 times more likely to live in a new LTN, compared to Londoners in the least deprived quarter. While overall Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people were slightly more likely than White Londoners to live in a new LTN, this varied by ethnic group. Specifically, Black Londoners were somewhat more likely, and Asian Londoners somewhat less likely than White people to live in a new LTN. Car-free households were more likely to live in a new LTN. 

Within London’s districts – which lead the implementation of LTNs - there was wide variation, with people in more deprived areas and/or ethnic minorities more likely to live in an LTN in some districts, less likely in others. In the median (‘typical’) district, people in more deprived areas were more likely to live in an LTN than people in less deprived areas, suggesting that, on average, individual districts have prioritised their more deprived areas. However, in the median district, BAME residents were slightly less likely to live in an LTN than White residents. Finally, at the micro level, residents living in LTNs were demographically similar to neighbours living in OAs that touched an LTN boundary road. 

We conclude that LTN implementation has been broadly equitable at the city level and at the micro level, but not always at the district level. Such metrics should be used in policy and research to monitor and improve the equity of active travel interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,equity|low traffic neighbourhood|motor traffic reduction|superblock|traffic calming|traffic management,2021-02-26T06:57:20.960277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-26T06:56:58.040974,TRUE,"The authors have previously and/or currently been funded to carry out research on active travel interventions, including by Department for Transport and Transport for London; such as the People and Places Survey.

Nevertheless, the theoretical mechanisms by which unemployment leads to long-lasting negative consequences for SWB are still under debate. Thus, we theorize that unemployment can have an enduring impact mainly through (i) the experience of unemployment as an incisive life event that, for example, affects health and (ii) unemployment as a driver of future unemployment. Using advanced longitudinal modeling that controls for group-specific trends, we estimate SWB scarring through unemployment using German panel data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our results consistently show a large negative effect of unemployment on SWB as well as significant lasting scarring effects (for both men and women as well as for short- and long-term unemployment spells). Further analyses reveal that repeated periods of unemployment drive these effects, implying that there are hardly any adaptations to unemployment that buffer its effect on SWB. We conclude that scarring effects through unemployment mainly work through unemployment increasing the probability of future unemployment. Regarding policy implications, our findings suggest that preventing unemployment, regardless of its duration, is beneficial for individual well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,fixed effects|life satisfaction|panel data|power analysis|unemployment,2021-02-25T14:48:47.572382,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-25T14:47:52.193922,FALSE,NA,no,after signing a data sharing agreement,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/citation/,t57cd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cer9s/,cer9s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6037b29d035cf700adc7f8aa/,6037b29d035cf700adc7f8aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t57cd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t57cd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t57cd,NA

This paper examines how heightened fears of contracting the virus, financial impacts, and social isolation contribute to declining mental health among this already vulnerable group. This paper investigates how increases in anxiety, stress, and despair are associated with concerns about getting infected, COVID-19-induced financial hardship, and increased social isolation as a result of adhering to protective measures among people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. This study uses original national quota-based online survey data (n=1,027) collected in June 2020 from people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Three logistic regression models investigate the relationship between COVID-19's effects on finances, concerns about contracting the virus, changes in loneliness and belonging, and measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 and reports of increased anxiety, stress, and despair, net of covariates. Models show that increased anxiety, stress, and despair were associated with negative financial effects of COVID-19, greater concerns about contracting COVID-19, increased loneliness, and decreased feelings of belonging. Net of other covariates, increased measures taken to combat COVID-19 was not significantly associated with mental health outcomes.

Supposedly, personal exposure reduces the subjectively perceived spatial and temporal distance to climate events, and thus increases the belief in climate change and environmentally friendly behaviour.
This study exploits the variation in temporal and spatial distance to floods and periods of extreme temperature, and estimate the effect of personal experience on climate change belief and self-reported pro-environmental behaviour. Therefore, I connect individual-level panel data of up to 120,852 observations from 67,547 individuals to floods across England and heatwaves across the UK between 2008 and 2020. I control for large-scale spatial patterns and pre-existing differences between affected and non-affected individuals using person-fixed effects estimators.
Results reveal that individuals are more likely to believe in climate change when they are affected by floods or heatwaves, and the effect is stronger for spatially and temporally proximate events.

We do so by studying the interplay of global socio-technical regimes and technological innovation systems (TIS). Building on institutional theory, we develop a theoretical framework for TIS-regime interaction and apply it to the case of the industrial heat pump (IHP) in the Netherlands. Based on a qualitative, historical analysis over the past 30 years, we show how the heat pump TIS is at odds with the global process industry regime and identify several mechanisms through which the regime’s coercive, normative and mimetic institutional pressures influence TIS dynamics. We furthermore discuss how actors respond to and strategically deal with these pressures. We show that the institutionalization of a new logic in the global regime can outpace the rate of technological development of the radical innovation, causing it to become less attractive over time even though the technology’s performance increases. The paper thus provides a better understanding of the effects of global sectoral structures on radical low carbon innovation in particular places and industries. It offers valuable insights into the dynamics of sustainability transitions, especially in regard to the (limits to) effectiveness of policy interventions geared towards a particular TIS at the national level.",TRUE,FALSE,global regimes|institutional isomorphism|institutional logics|isomorphic pressures|sustainability transitions|technological innovation systems,2021-02-26T06:56:41.171596,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-26T06:56:19.163400,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Joeri Wesseling|Alco Kieft|Lea Fünfschilling,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/citation/,v9d3r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60376036035cf7008bc7fe9f/,60376036035cf7008bc7fe9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9d3r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v9d3r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v9d3r,NA

Are contemporary movements to reform, defund, or abolish the police likely to succeed? Answering this question, in part, requires understanding how the mass public interprets these efforts, and what they believe each seeks to accomplish. This note presents novel survey and experimental evidence to inform theoretical and empirical research in this domain. We find strong support for police reform, but efforts to defund or abolish the police generate opposition both in terms of slogan (e.g., “defunding the police”) and substance (e.g., “reduce police budgets and reallocate funding to social services”). We do not find evidence that these differences can be explained by differing beliefs about each movement’s association with violent protest, racial makeup, or specific programmatic changes targeting police administration or officer behavior. Movements to defund and abolish the police are, however, perceived to seek reduced involvement of police in traditional crime control roles and cuts in police numbers. On average, the public opposes the former and is fearful of the latter. These findings suggest that public support for changes to American policing is contingent on the perceived implications for crime and public safety.",TRUE,FALSE,abolition|defunding|policing|protest|public opinion|reform,2021-02-25T03:34:42.661385,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-25T03:34:32.341982,FALSE,NA,no,Replication archive upon publication,,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/citation/,rc7hd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6036c1708a6998000ddd8698/,6036c1708a6998000ddd8698,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc7hd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rc7hd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rc7hd,NA

By analysing SNB holdings in the 100 most polluting companies in the world, I find that the share of assets owned by the SNB is responsible for at least a quarter of Switzerland’s domestic CO2 emissions. This represents as much as the greenhouse gas emissions of all Swiss households combined or 0.05% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Using two different estimation methods, I find that the SNB’s portfolio generates between 12 and 20 million metric tons of CO2 per year.
