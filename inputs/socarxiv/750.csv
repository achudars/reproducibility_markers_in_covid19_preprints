Regulators, much like market actors, rely on categorical distinctions to understand and act on the market. Innovations that are ambiguous to regulatory categories but not to market actors present a problem for regulators and an opportunity for innovative firms to evade or upend the existing order. We trace the history of one class of innovative financial derivatives—interest rate and foreign exchange swaps—to show how these instruments under- mined the separation of commercial and investment banking established by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. Swaps did not fit neatly into existing product categories—futures, securities, loans—and thus evaded regulatory scrutiny for decades. The market success of swaps put commercial and investment banks into direct competition, and in so doing undermined Glass-Steagall. Drawing on this case, we theorize some of the political and market conditions under which regulations may be especially vulnerable to disruption by ambiguous innovations.",TRUE,FALSE,derivatives|economic sociology|finance|organizations|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:49.110471,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-03T15:39:23.414000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/citation/,wpwe6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7x9vs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/relationships/node/,7x9vs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/586bc4ec9ad5a10208ba7491/,586bc4ec9ad5a10208ba7491,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wpwe6/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839214554830,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wpwe6

This article moves away from the focus on the ways interactions in public go awry and focuses on how individuals account for the mundane, everyday exchanges they have with strangers who seek their help. Based on interview data (N = 31) and qualitative analysis of data from an Internet survey (N = 110), this article suggests that the presence of beggars does not inherently symbolize urban decay to passersby and does not necessarily elicit anxiety, but instead provides a valuable texture of urban life. Further, the article argues that individuals, when justifying their responses to requests for help from needy persons (beggars) in urban spaces, use a variety of cultural strategies to maintain their perception of themselves as moral persons, both when they choose to help and when they refuse. Drawing from these findings, the article suggests that urban sociology and the sociology of risk would benefit from sensitizing their studies of public interactions to the diverse meanings individuals assign to them, rather than presupposing annoyance, anxiety, or fear as their predominant characteristic.",TRUE,FALSE,beggars|broken windows|cultural sociology|sociology of morality,2018-07-02T10:45:08.139282,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-03T10:32:18.304000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/citation/,2fn99,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fu8yk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/relationships/node/,fu8yk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/586b7d086c613b01f5e9af43/,586b7d086c613b01f5e9af43,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fn99/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2fn99/,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1573-7861.2012.01359.x,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2fn99

Many were left stunned that the agents of a liberal democracy would perpetrate such horrific acts against individuals in the state's control. Such shock makes sense if one believes that liberal democratic institutions constrain leaders from acting on the utilitarian incentive to employ torture during interrogations. While such a belief is apparently widespread, is it consistent with the recent historical record? Extant theories of repression and global evidence about torture suggest that it is not. We distinguish among three mechanisms that might constrain the use of torture in liberal democracies: voice, veto, and freedom of expression. We then argue that voice is unlikely to have a strong effect when the state is faced with violent dissent, and that the effect of veto and freedom of expression will be substantially reduced when the state is faced with a violent challenge. To test our hypotheses we use data from 146 countries covering the years 1980-1999 and investigate the extent to which voice, veto, or freedom of expression inhibit countries' use of torture both in times of quiescence and in times when dissidents challenge the state with violence. We find that rather than being aberrant, state-sponsored torture like that in Abu Ghraib is perfectly consistent with both theory and previous experience. More specifically, democratic institutions reduce the probability that a state uses torture in only limited circumstances.",TRUE,FALSE,Democracy|Human Rights|Institutions|Repression|Torture,2018-07-02T10:51:02.735041,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-31T01:58:53.702000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/citation/,hg43x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zhnwb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/relationships/node/,zhnwb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58670f059ad5a10206ba711a/,58670f059ad5a10206ba711a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg43x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hg43x/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hg43x

In this paper, we argue that in the standard account of the gambler's fallacy, the gambler's fallacy fallacy can arise: The irrational belief that all beliefs pertaining to the probabilities of sequences of outcomes constitute the gambler's fallacy, when, in fact, they do not. Specifically, the odds of the probabilities of some sequences of outcomes can be epistemically rational in a given decision-making situation. Not only are such odds of probabilities of sequences of outcomes not the gambler's fallacy, but they can be implemented as a simple heuristic for avoiding the gambler's fallacy in risk-related decision-making. However, we have to be careful not to fall prey to a variant of the gambler's fallacy, the gambler's fallacy fallacy (fallacy), in which we do not calculate odds for the probabilities of sequences that matter, but rather simply believe that the raw probability for the occurrence of a sequence of outcomes is the probability for the last outcome in that sequence.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive biases|cognitive heuristics|gambler's fallacy|probability|risk perception,2018-07-02T10:53:50.848091,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-30T09:47:31.038000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognition and Perception|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/citation/,xdsxg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9n27j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/relationships/node/,9n27j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58662c2d6c613b01fae9aa5a/,58662c2d6c613b01fae9aa5a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdsxg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xdsxg/,https://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2017.1378248,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xdsxg

We propose to call such fake online grassroots activity digital astroturfing, and we define it as a form of manufactured, deceptive and strategic top-down activity on the Internet initiated by political actors that mimics bottom-up activity by autonomous individuals. The goal of this paper is to lay out a conceptual map of the phenomenon of digital astroturfing in politics. To that end, we introduce, first, a typology of digital astroturfing according to three dimensions (target, actor type, goals), and, second, the concept of digital astroturfing repertoires, the possible combinations of tools, venues and actions used in digital astroturfing efforts. Furthermore, we explore possible restrictive and incentivizing countermeasures against digital astroturfing. Finally, we discuss prospects for future research: Even though empirical research on digital astroturfing is difficult, it is neither impossible nor futile.",TRUE,FALSE,astroturfing|digital astroturfing|fake grassroots|grassroots|online communication|persuasion|propaganda|trolling,2018-07-02T10:46:32.602084,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-30T09:42:08.720000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/citation/,7ucsh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bbpdm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/relationships/node/,bbpdm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57ff2796594d9001eb621aad/,57ff2796594d9001eb621aad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ucsh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7ucsh/,https://doi.org/10.24434/j.scoms.2018.01.005,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7ucsh

Based on the theoretical model of bounded rationality, we call these potential effects brute force effects. During the last month of the election campaign of the Swiss federal election of 2015, we have tracked the presence of all 873 candidates in the canton of Zurich, the most populous canton, in a broad sample of mass media. Additionally, we have tracked those candidates' activity on Facebook and Twitter. The results of our multilevel Bayesian estimates show that mass media presence has a consistent non-trivial impact on different aspects of electoral outcome. Furthermore, social media activity also has a non-trivial impact, but only in terms of resonance (reactions to candidates' social media activity). Overall, our results suggest that brute force effects of of mass media presence and social media activity can have substantial impact on voting behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral economics|brute force effects|election|elections|mass media|media effects|parliament|social media|Switzerland,2018-07-02T10:53:50.327947,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-30T09:40:38.859000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/citation/,x66vj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2q6pa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/relationships/node/,2q6pa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58007e1a6c613b01ee3b83c3/,58007e1a6c613b01ee3b83c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x66vj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x66vj/,https://doi.org/10.1080/19331681.2017.1374228,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x66vj
