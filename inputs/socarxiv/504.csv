A case study was used as the design of this study with six teachers of Islamic Elementary School in Semarang, Indonesia, were chosen by using purposive sampling. A questionnaire with the Likert Scale of 1 to 4 was distributed to the respondents after implementing lesson study. A deep interview was also given to the teachers to explore their awareness of pedagogical knowledge. The quantitative data were analyzed statistically and they were used to support the qualitative data got from the interview. The result showed that the teachers had a new perspective in the pedagogical context in which a preparation of teaching could be prepared well by formulating and designing the lesson collaboratively with the other teachers to achieve the learning goal.

Twelve of them are written by non-native Iraqi female students and the rest by native American female students. To do so, the researchers have set two aims: examining the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in terms of nativity and major and comparing the usages of metadiscourse markers’ types and subtypes in terms of nativity. To achieve the present aims, Hyland’s model (2005) is adopted. It aids in classifying the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in both data. The findings show that the Iraqi and American researchers use the interactive resources more than the interactional ones but the American researchers are capable of engaging their readers since their use of the interactional markers is higher than their counterparts. The field has no effect on the use of metadiscourse markers. There is diversity in the usage of the interactive resources in Iraqi data.

Several studies have discussed the transfer issues in language learning, yet a few of them focus on the transfer relationships between Arabic and English language writing skills. Regardless of the huge linguistic distinction between the English language and Arabic language, it is presumed that Arabic and English writing skills positively, negatively, and neutrally transferred in a dynamic relationship. The researcher has conducted observations and interviews with Fatimah, the participant of this study, and analyzed her texts in both languages to illustrate how dynamic relationships between L1 and L2 in the composition skills is and what the effects of language transfer in the composition skills between L1 and L2 are. The data were collected and analyzed in January 2018. The results demonstrate effects of L2 on L1 as the following; first, a reverse or backward transfer implemented in three ways; positive, negative, and neutral transfer. Second, they indicate that there is a dynamic relationship between second language performance and first language proficiency in composition particularly. It is hoped that this knowledge will assist students in being aware of the effects of L2 on L1 specifically in composition and taking the advantages to accelerate the rate of language learning.

Gathered data was analyzed using interactional sociolinguistics analysis and statistics to arrive at results. The findings of the study indicate that the most frequent shifts of topics occurred after a pause where speakers introduced a new topic. These shifts were performed by using discourse markers such as asking questions, seeking explanations, or telling personal stories.

Thai Students’ Attitudes towards Five Different Asian Accents,"This research aims to explore how Thai speakers of English perceive their Asian peers’ accented English and evaluate the acceptability of their accents namely Burmese English, Chinese English, Indian English, Japanese English, and Vietnamese English. The participants were eighty undergraduate students at an International University in Thailand where English is used as a medium of instruction. They were asked to listen to five recorded speech extracts taken from five different intermediate-level reading passages. A triangulated study is used to examine the data from different angle including a questionnaire survey in a Likert-type scale and a follow-up semi-structured interview. The Index of Item Objective Congruence (IOC) and Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient were also applied to assure the content validity of the research methodology. The results in this study indicated that Thai student participants were easily able to identify that five speakers were all non-native speakers of English. The majority preferred Indian accented English to other accented Englishes. Most participants showed negative attitudes towards Japanese and Burmese accented English. It is somewhat conclusive that the participants still believe that a native-like accent is overvalued their perceived English accents.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian accents|Asian Englishes|attitudes|English as a Lingua Franca,2019-01-05T04:51:01.299685,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:50:26.246943,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/citation/,7mxhg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c2397a7c0a70018403fe5/,5c2c2397a7c0a70018403fe5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mxhg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7mxhg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7mxhg

It employs Google Docs as an educational tool to engage Saudi EFL students in online peer review to address some challenges faced instructors when they implement peer review in class. The main goals of the study are examining what kinds of corrective feedback that Saudi EFL students provide when they edit their peers’ texts in Google Docs, how they can improve their texts based on the collaborative online peer review, and what their attitudes are toward using Google Docs as an online peer review tool.  The study utilizes Google Docs, an online questionnaire, and an interview as research tools; after thematic analysis, the results show that Saudi EFL students focus on local and global writing issues and provide different types of corrective feedback that aid them to improve their writing. They have positive attitudes toward using Google Docs in peer review. This tool allows them to engage in an online social environment outside the classroom, feel as critical editors, adjust their writing, and avoid embarrassment. The results also suggest that hierarchical power in the classroom and students’ prior beliefs and experiences can impact their responses to the given feedback from teachers and peers. This study recommends instructors to integrate online peer review as a genre and move beyond low-stakes genre in EFL writing courses at the university level.",TRUE,FALSE,corrective feedback|EFL writing|Google Docs|online peer review|Saudi EFL students,2019-01-05T04:50:27.138421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:50:12.470889,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/citation/,3dbsg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c22d70e8efd0017d0b30d/,5c2c22d70e8efd0017d0b30d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dbsg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3dbsg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.20,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3dbsg

Yet throughout the developing world, authoritarian, ethnosectarian, and clientelist political parties often intervene in university politics, particularly through competition in student elections. We argue this intervention limits the liberalizing effect of participation in university associational life. To test this argument, we measure the effect of political party intervention in university life using a panel survey experiment conducted at the American University of Beirut (AUB) during the university's annual student elections. Using a choice-based conjoint experiment embedded in a difference-in-differences design--the first of its kind--we estimate the causal effect of participation on non-partisan students. We find that processes of university socialization reproduce status quo politics and limit the ability of these environments to encourage critical, tolerant, and liberal-minded citizens.",TRUE,FALSE,conjoint analysis|elections|ethnic politics|Lebanon|Middle East|survey analysis|voter behavior,2019-01-02T18:50:21.062463,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-02T18:50:00.267619,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/citation/,jtvp2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/659wp/,659wp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c000c0e8efd0019cde8c7/,5c2c000c0e8efd0019cde8c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtvp2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jtvp2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jtvp2
