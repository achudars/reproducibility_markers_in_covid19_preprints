Although scholars recognize that party leaders dominate the structure and content of meetings, little empirical research examines the extent of their agenda setting role. Who gets to speak and whose preferences get represented? Adapting theories of legislative agenda setting to the intra-party context, we hypothesize that party candidates are less likely to be chosen as speakers at party conferences when the party’s leadership most demands unity due to their incumbency status. Using self-placements from candidate surveys, we predict the likelihood that MPs and leaders speak at parties’ national meetings in the U.K. We then link candidates’ self-placements to the content of speeches using automated text analysis. These results add to a broad theory of party decision-making which perceives parties’ national meetings as a forum for information sharing, intra-party competition and deliberation. More broadly, evidence in line with this approach suggests that treating parties as unitary actors in a range of settings overlooks important intra-party divisions.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-09-24T17:31:00.921935,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-24T17:30:39.122983,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/citation/,8f562,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3e7pg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/relationships/node/,3e7pg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba56a689108ce0016f2bd5d/,5ba56a689108ce0016f2bd5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8f562/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8f562/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8f562,NA

Considering segregation as a social form of entropy resolves that struggle and introduces a family of related measures that offer means of analysing segregation at both the local (neighbourhood) level and the greater (city/region) area. A case study of Philadelphia's level of segregation from 1990 to 2010 illustrates the benefits of the new measures. While Philadelphia has diversified, it remains racially segregated. Further, the new measures show the growing importance of Hispanic segregation and a shift from segregation being visited upon the city's Black residents to being driven by a White population that grows more segregated as its population share shrinks. Integrating measures of segregation and diversity into studies of residential racial patterns enhances our understanding of racial segregation patterns in a multiracial context.",TRUE,FALSE,entropy|methodology|segregation,2018-09-22T05:03:29.218650,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-21T20:35:50.796001,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/citation/,dmkjs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2tpf7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/relationships/node/,2tpf7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba554bb11fc4b0019187cbd/,5ba554bb11fc4b0019187cbd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmkjs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dmkjs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dmkjs,https://doi.org/10.1111/tesg.12306

Yet, undergraduate enrollment trends by demographic background at selective institutions reveal that the institutions enrolling the highest levels of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous students are not necessarily those that consider race. We use fixed effects modeling to analyze the association between stated admissions policies and enrollment trends by student racialized background between 1990 and 2016 at 1,127 selective colleges and universities. This analysis shows that the relationship between considering race and enrollments strongly depends on institutional status. We find that considering race was associated with increased Black student enrollments at the most selective institutions, but with a decrease in Black student enrollments and increases in Non-U.S. resident student enrollments at less selective institutions. Additionally, we identify many close-to-zero estimates of the relationship between considering race and enrollment trends of other student backgrounds. Elaborating a theory of racialized organizations with middle- status conformity theory, we argue that the racialized policy of affirmative action admissions is a constitutive element of the field’s status order, but not tethered to enrollment outcomes. These findings underscore the need for research on educational inequality and admissions outside higher education’s higher-status tier, especially at institutions across the status hierarchy that educate the largest proportions of racially marginalized students.",TRUE,FALSE,affirmative action|enrollment|higher education|race,2018-09-21T20:33:41.182750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-21T20:33:13.575817,FALSE,NA,no,"Mix of publicly-available (IPEDS, Census) and private/licensed (College Board's ASC).",,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,Prabhdeep Kehal Singh|Daniel Hirschman|&amp; Ellen Berrey,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/citation/,8z629,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2s75g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/relationships/node/,2s75g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba554a411fc4b0019187ca8/,5ba554a411fc4b0019187ca8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8z629/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8z629/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8z629,NA

Recent scholarship has drawn attention to the way that the occupations involved with cultural production, brought together under the banner of cultural and creative industries (CCIs), do not reflect the demographics of British society. In particular, research has demonstrated significant exclusions based on gender (e.g. Conor et al 2015), race and ethnicity (e.g. Saha 2018, Nwonka and Malik 2018), and class (e.g. Hesmondhalgh 2018). This paper seeks to understand how these inequalities are maintained by looking at a comparatively under-researched group: senior men in positions of power making decisions in CCIs. The paper presents data from 32 interviews with senior men across a range of CCI occupations, conducted as part of a larger set (N=237) of interviews on inequality and careers in CCIs. The analysis shows that misrecognition and outright rejection of inequalities is now unusual; that ‘inequality talk’ and the recognition of structural barriers for marginalised groups is a dominant mode for senior CCI men; that gentlemanly tropes and the idea of luck, rather than structural advantages, were used by senior men to explain their own success and separate and distance them as individuals from the inequalities they described; and that men felt they had limited capacity to effect genuine change in the context of a set of occupations they understood as fairer than other professions. Overall, the analysis shows how ‘inequality talk’ and the awareness of structural issues differs significantly from senior CCI men’s own accounts of their career success. This difference, and the distance between the discourse of career luck and ‘inequality talk’ helps to explain the persistence of exclusions from the workforce for those who are not white, middle class origin, men. This has important implications for inequality in other professions and areas of social life.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural and creative industries|inequality|senior men|sociology of culture,2018-09-21T13:37:20.903007,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-21T13:26:22.844935,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Orian Brook|Dave O'Brien|Mark Taylor,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/citation/,y6db7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vhpqu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/relationships/node/,vhpqu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba4f0bf15b1070019b4cbf8/,5ba4f0bf15b1070019b4cbf8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y6db7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y6db7,NA

In this article, we evaluate potential gender biases of commercial image recognition platforms using photographs of U.S. members of Congress and a large number of Twitter images posted by these politicians. Our crowdsourced validation shows that commercial image recognition systems can produce labels that are correct and biased at the same time as they selectively report a subset of many possible true labels. We find that images of women received three times more annotations related to physical appearance. Moreover, women in images are recognized at substantially lower rates in comparison with men.

the earnings advantage over never-married workers -- more than three-times the premium for white women.
Hispanic women have no cohabitation premium. White men have the largest marriage premium, and each
other group except white women also has a significant marriage premium. There is a significant cohabitation
benefit for white men, black men, and Hispanic men. Substantial differences in observed effects across groups
suggest the need for models that are more complicated than previously used. Research into marital status
effects on earnings is misleading when restricted to white men.",TRUE,FALSE,cohabitation|earnings|ethnicity|gender|inequality|marriage|race,2018-09-19T14:26:01.630588,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-19T14:21:07.331906,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/citation/,z6qc9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7ws6h/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/relationships/node/,7ws6h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba25a1f8f9564001938a1fd/,5ba25a1f8f9564001938a1fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6qc9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z6qc9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z6qc9,NA

We first discuss how governance over security and the protection of critical infrastructure has increased the focus on the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in addressing issues of cybersecurity. We continue by highlighting three sector-led bodies—the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council, and the Financial Systemic Analysis and Resilience Center—and how each facilitates PPPs to address cyber challenges primarily in the areas of information sharing, policy coordination, and threat analytics, respectively. The chapter concludes with a discussion of lessons learned and remarks on future research avenues in the area of cybersecurity governance. These lessons include: 1) validation of the PPP model, with some important caveats, 2) the need to extend PPPs beyond information sharing to address systemic risks, and 3) the limitations of PPPs in regulated industries like finance.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-09-19T14:24:22.354907,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-19T14:20:50.030358,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law,Wiley,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/citation/,ybqgm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jq547/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/relationships/node/,jq547,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba241938f95640019387a96/,5ba241938f95640019387a96,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybqgm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ybqgm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ybqgm,NA

The former is held to be evidence that a policy brings about the desired outcome, and the latter concerns how it does so. Although agreeing with the spirit of this proposal, we argue that the underlying conception of mechanistic evidence as evidence that is different in kind from correlational, difference-making or statistical evidence, does not correctly capture the role that information about mechanisms should play in evidence-based policy. We offer an alternative account of mechanistic evidence as information concerning the causal pathway connecting the policy intervention to its outcome. Not only can this be analyzed as evidence of difference-making, it is also to be found at any level and is obtainable by a broad range of methods, both experimental and observational. Using behavioral policy as an illustration, we draw the implications of this revised understanding of mechanistic evidence for debates concerning policy extrapolation, evidence hierarchies, and evidence integration.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral policy|evidence-based policy|evidence integration|extrapolation|mechanistic evidence|meta-synthesis,2018-09-19T10:40:02.214688,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-19T10:39:49.153916,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/citation/,4ufbm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ys6n9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/relationships/node/,ys6n9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba207888f9564001938357f/,5ba207888f9564001938357f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ufbm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ufbm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4ufbm,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2018.08.003
