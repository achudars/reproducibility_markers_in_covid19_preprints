A Multilevel Analysis of Elite and Mass Attitudes,"Despite its global rise in popularity, a significant number of people still oppose democracy. The current study evaluates three competing theories of opposition to democracy – developmentalist, culturalist, and elitist – using a series of multi-level regression models that combine individual- and country-level variables. Results of our statistical analyses suggest that: 1) country-level indicators of social, political, and economic development are not consistently related to individual support for democracy; 2) macro-cultural factors have mixed effects on individual support for democracy; and 3) individual income and education have strong effects on individual support for democracy, but this relationship is mediated by country-level economic development. Specifically, we find that high-income individuals in relatively underdeveloped countries are more likely to oppose democracy than high-income individuals in wealthier countries. These results suggest that economic, social, and political development do not necessarily go together.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-03-15T00:46:46.506391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:46:19.270899,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Brandon Gorman|Ijlal Naqvi|and Charles Kurzman,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/citation/,crkqz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c896ddb1d73810019c19cee/,5c896ddb1d73810019c19cee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crkqz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/crkqz/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0731121418785626,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/crkqz

But, what happens when privileged families’ interests conflict with schools’ stated goals? Focusing on the case of homework, and drawing insights from organizational theory, cultural capital theory, and research on parent involvement in schools, I examine how schools’ dependence on higher-SES White families influences their enforcement of rules. Using a longitudinal, ethnographic study of one socioeconomically diverse public elementary school, I find that teachers wanted to enforce homework rules, but they worried doing so would lead to conflict with the higher-SES White “helicopter” parents, on whom they relied most for support. Thus, teachers selectively enforced rules, using evidence of “helicopter” parenting to determine which students “deserved” leeway and lenience. Those decisions, in turn, contributed to inequalities in teachers’ punishment and evaluation of students. Broadly, these findings suggest privilege-dependence leads schools to appease privileged families, even when those actions contradict the school’s stated goals. These findings also challenge standard policy assumptions about parent involvement and homework, and they suggest policies aimed at reducing the power of privilege are necessary for lessening inequalities in school.",TRUE,FALSE,children|education|ethnography|family|homework|inequality|interviews|organizations|parental involvement|parenthood|qualitative|rules|schools|teachers,2019-03-15T00:44:41.741227,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:44:22.633061,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/citation/,vk8bt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c89673e1d73810017c64512/,5c89673e1d73810017c64512,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vk8bt/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vk8bt

Low-income racial minority students may have additional personal and academic issues associated with demonstrating grit and overcoming barriers to entry (i.e. institutional racism) over the course of their lives. When the campus environment is not socially or culturally supportive of racial minority and first-generation college students, there is an added risk of mental health deterioration stemming from isolation for these students. The struggle to persist in college, and do so alone, can lead many to experience symptoms of impending “burnout,” or disengagement from academic settings. Drawing from a sample of interviews with low-income racial minority strivers—students who were once highly engaged—this paper offers insight into both causes and solutions for college burnout. Findings suggest that it is important to understand how experiences of isolation manifest to better support minority student populations and foster their academic reengagement to achieve at high levels. This paper outlines recommendations for improving the college experiences of racial minority and first-generation students, including examples of resources and recommendations to improve the higher education landscape towards more inclusivity and equity.",TRUE,FALSE,Agency|Burnout|College Persistence|Cultural Competency|Equity|Grit|Higher Education|Mental Health,2019-03-15T00:43:27.170438,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:42:52.481917,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,Anindya Kundu,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/citation/,5pyhq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c893e8766b44d001c75f714/,5c893e8766b44d001c75f714,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5pyhq/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11256-019-00501-w,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5pyhq

We re-examine this issue by taking a more nuanced look at the inquiry scale in PISA 2015. Previous studies using PISA and other ILSA assume that scales measuring inquiry-based instruction are invariant across regions/countries. This study tests whether measurement invariance could indeed be established, and if not, what regional patterns of instructional practice exist. This study also examines whether the association between inquiry and learning outcomes depend upon the provision of teacher guidance. Participants were 151,721 students from 5,089 schools from 10 highest and 10 lowest science performers in PISA 2015. Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses found that measurement invariance cannot be established, suggesting substantial regional variation in the pattern of inquiry-based instruction. Exploratory factor analyses confirm that at the measurement level, inquiry takes different forms in each region. However, at the conceptual level many regions exhibit a pattern which contrasted between “Guided inquiry” and “Independent inquiry”. Results of structural equation modelling show that inquiry is positively associated with outcomes when it incorporates teacher guidance, and negatively when it doesn’t. This pattern of association is remarkably consistent across the 20 regions examined. These findings are in line with current theories regarding the importance of scaffolding in learning from inquiry. This study suggests that it would be misguided to use PISA findings to support arguments to scale back inquiry and other constructivist approaches to teaching science.",TRUE,FALSE,epistemic belief|inquiry-based instruction|intrinsic motivation|large-scale assessment of learning|measurement invariance|science achievement|scientific literacy,2019-03-15T00:41:27.940578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:40:44.113983,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/citation/,aqsbj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c89225b245c0a001ad392d1/,5c89225b245c0a001ad392d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aqsbj/,https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2020.1716093,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aqsbj

Its first vehicle, the Model T, introduced the concept of mass production and automobile affordability to the masses.  Today, the market is full of domestic and foreign competitors, yet, Ford has struggled to remain competitive, even though it promotes itself as America’s best-selling brand. Its stock was recently downgraded, and recently, it announced its intentions to only sell sports utility vehicles, trucks, Mustangs and Focus, in other words, it will stop selling most of its passenger cars. Conversely, Toyota continues to lead the market in passenger car sales, while newcomer Tesla struggles to deliver on its backlog of 500,000 electric vehicle orders. 
Ford has strong brand equity, has automated production facilities and a large franchised dealer network across the globe. Yet, it is rapidly losing passenger car market share, its profits are eroding, and its new vision is confusing. Furthermore, the company is facing a significant threat from well capitalized new competitors entering from the tech industry. 
The company, on the other hand, has enjoyed significant success in mainland China, where the demand for American automobiles continuous to be strong. Yet, the company needs to assume a cost leadership position and attempt to use this strategy to increase market share.

Academic and popular discussions of populism frequently suggest that this is the case, and that anger and anxiety in particular, are crucial explanatory factors for the continued appeal of populist parties.  But despite the often-posited link between negative emotions and populism, few studies have explored this relationship empirically.  
This paper aims to fill this gap and answer three related questions: Firstly, to what extent is the relationship between negative affect and populist party support unique to these parties and do we observe differences between left and right-wing populism? Secondly, what is the temporal relationship between affect and populism?  Do voters support populist parties because they are anxious or does support for these parties create these negative emotions? And finally, are populists angry, scared, or both? In other words, to what extent do we need to distinguish between specific types of negative affect, such as anger and anxiety, when discussing the emotional underpinnings of populism? 
Comparing panel data from Austria and Germany, this paper investigates the relationship between anger and anxiety on the one hand, and support for populist parties on the other. Using a random-intercept, autoregressive cross-lagged design, the paper has three findings. 
First of all, the reinforcing pattern of increased negative emotions and increased party support is unique to (right-wing) populists. Secondly, this relationship is self-reinforcing. While negative affect leads to greater support for right wing populist parties, the reverse relationship is more consistent and of larger magnitude.  Negative emotions trigger populist support, but they are more important for maintaining it. Finally, it is important to distinguish between anger and anxiety. While only anxiety is consistent in its ability to trigger populist support, subsequently both anger and anxiety are increased.",TRUE,FALSE,AfD|Anger|Anxiety|Austria|Emotions|FPO|Germany|Panel Models|Populism,2019-03-13T13:27:41.589091,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-13T13:26:58.837375,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/citation/,e2wm6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6mh82/,6mh82,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c88928266b44d001b789ea1/,5c88928266b44d001b789ea1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2wm6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2wm6

Nonetheless, by standard classification metrics the discipline seems to have made little progress. Although some remedy is promised by particular cross-validation strategies and machine learning tools, which increase accuracy rates substantively, predictions over time remain challenging. In this research note we provide evidence that the predictive performance of conflict models is plagued by temporal residual error. We demonstrate that standard classification metrics for binary outcome data are prone to underestimate model performance in a Binary-Time-Series-Cross-Section context when temporal prediction error is high. We approach this problem as a Modifiable Temporal Unit Problem and propose to evaluate the predictive performance of this type of model in differently sized temporal windows. While retaining the ability of models to leverage disaggregated data for prediction, we provide a parsimonious aggregation approach that allows researchers to evaluate the time frame in which predictive models perform best. We demonstrate this procedure in Monte Carlo experiments and with existing empirical studies.",TRUE,FALSE,Binary Outcome Models|Civil War|Duration Models|Forecasting|Prediction,2019-03-13T13:30:06.881439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-13T13:29:29.486844,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/citation/,tvshu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mzspw/,mzspw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c883f13245c0a0018d3e750/,5c883f13245c0a0018d3e750,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvshu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tvshu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tvshu

Studying children’s time use cross-nationally provides new understandings of the micro-macro drivers of children’s daily activities with critical implications for their personal development, future lifestyles and identity formation. The study uses rich time-diary data from 2008-2015 for a pooled sample of children aged 10-17 from Finland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (N = 6,556), applying multiple linear regression models addressing (i) between-country and (ii) within-country variations. Findings are consistent with the Cross-Cultural Hypothesis by revealing that Finnish children spend the lowest time with parents and the highest time alone and with ‘others’, after accounting for multiple factors. In Italy and Spain, children’s time with parents is the highest, and time alone and with others clearly lowest. The UK lies somewhere in between the Scandinavian and Mediterranean models. In ‘family-oriented’ Italy and Spain, children spend more time eating (i.e., having dinners), while in more ‘individualistic’ Finland and UK screen-based time is highest (i.e. mobile phone use). The Structural Opportunities Hypothesis receives little support. Parental education generally leads to more time in educational activities in all four countries, while maternal employment generally weakly predicts children’s time use across activities and national contexts. Overall, the strong cross-national differences observed in child and adolescent time use do not seem driven by simple structural or socioeconomic opportunity contexts, but rather by cross-cultural differences in values around family relations and individuals’ daily routines.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-03-13T13:29:08.486141,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-13T13:27:46.036535,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/citation/,ks6vg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c883d741d73810019c0c59d/,5c883d741d73810019c0c59d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ks6vg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ks6vg
