Applying hierarchical cluster analysis with four established indicators of gender norms, we find that these local cultural environments are best conceptualized with a multilevel framework describing gender norms across varying levels of detail. Broadly, commuting zones can be differentiated between those that are egalitarian and those that are traditional. Within these general categories, however, exist more complex dimensions. Gender traditional areas may be distinguished between traditional-breadwinning and traditional-essentialist, while egalitarian areas are separated into those that are liberal-egalitarian and egalitarian-essentialist. Examining the factors sustaining this spatial variation, we test the role of compositional and contextual effects. We find limited support for compositional effects, as commuting zone demographic makeup explains little variation in gender norm indicators. Instead, we find evidence that local gender norms are sustained through contextual effects where the experience of living in a particular environment shapes residents’ attitudes and behaviors. Contextual effects are exceptionally strong in areas with traditional gender norms, where residents who would otherwise hold gender egalitarian perspectives (e.g. the highly educated) have more traditional outlooks than those who share the same characteristics, but reside in places with egalitarian gender norms.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|family|gender norms|inequality|space|work,2020-09-04T06:04:49.915135,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-04T06:04:16.099214,FALSE,NA,no,"Some of the data used in this article are derived from Sensitive Data Files of the GSS, obtained under special contractual arrangements designed to protect the anonymity of respondents.

Drawing on data from in-depth interviews with 127 landlords in Baltimore, Dallas, and Cleveland, we ask how landlords think about their role as purveyors of affordable housing. We find that landlords think about their tenants in moral terms, drawing upon cultural categories to describe and define their tenants. Landlords see renting to the urban poor as a social good insofar as it facilitates a civilizing mission that houses those in need on the condition of their moral reform. We identify two components of this strategy: exclusion and reform. On the one hand, landlords pursue profit through exclusionary tactics such as screening and eviction. While recent research has focused on this component, this article explores how landlords also invest resources in “training” tenants, attempting to mold them into a profitable ideal, rather than replacing them. Using both incentives and surveillance, landlords seek to create a tenant class that conforms to mainstream notions of responsibility and self-reliance. We argue that exclusion and reform are two sides of the same coin, that is, complementary components of paternalistic poverty governance. Landlord paternalism carries special salience in today’s increasingly privatized federal housing policy, where landlords have a great deal of discretion and little oversight.",TRUE,FALSE,housing|landlords|paternalism|poverty|poverty governance,2020-09-03T15:38:42.937318,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-03T15:38:15.800933,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",Eva Rosen and Philip Garboden,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/citation/,5musy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f510bd3ae5a9500df6dcc63/,5f510bd3ae5a9500df6dcc63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5musy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5musy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5musy

REDI achieves this through random cold-deck imputation from a real world reference dataset (here, the Current Population Survey ASEC).

Despite many previous studies on this topic, relatively little is known of the actual effect of social capital given that different studies define and measure social capital differently. We rely strictly on Robert Putnam’s theory and understand it as a combination of social networks, trust, and norms of reciprocity. We measure well-being with two context-free scales: a one-dimensional overall life satisfaction scale and a five-dimensional Student’s life satisfaction scale. The analysis is done with linear and unconditional quantile regression. The results indicate that all three dimensions of social capital are significantly associated with well-being. Of the three, trust is the strongest predictor explaining over 30% of the variance in both well-being scales. Quantile regression suggests that while social capital is important for young people across the quantiles, trustful relations with family members are particularly important for those who fare poorly otherwise. For those who are satisfied with their lives, the importance of family members is lower, albeit still significant, but for them relationships with other people gain greater importance.",TRUE,FALSE,reciprocity|social capital|social networks|trust|well-being|young people,2020-09-03T08:28:04.541264,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-03T08:27:48.603914,FALSE,NA,no,"The data on the third wave of the International Survey of Children’s Well-Being will become openly accessible in June 2021.

2016. As previous research has stated that annual variation has increased over time, we aim to
improve previous research by focusing on gross, net, and financial wealth gaps between
cohorts. The opening of the Finnish financial markets and the introduction of new types of
investment instruments since the late 1980s created entirely new circumstances for business
and financial markets. We utilise the time series of the Official Statistics of Finland’s (OFS)
Household Assets. We use the marginal effects method with a generalised linear model (GLM),
and interaction terms. The results show that inter-cohort wealth inequality in gross- and net
wealth has not increased over time, and all differences are attributed to within-year variations.
As a new finding, financial wealth shows variations among three distinct investment groups,
and higher investment interest can be associated with decreasing initial investment ages among

Health varies by U.S. region of residence. Despite regional heterogeneity in the outbreak of COVID-19, regional differences in physical distancing behaviors over time are relatively unknown. This study examines regional variation in physical distancing trends during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigates variation by race and socioeconomic status (SES) within regions.

Data from the 2015-2019 five-year American Community Survey were matched with anonymized location pings data from over 20 million mobile devices (SafeGraph, Inc.) at the Census block group level. We visually present trends in the stay-at-home proportion by Census region, race, and SES throughout 2020 and conduct regression analyses to statistically examine these patterns.

From March to December, the stay-at-home proportion was highest in the Northeast (0.25 in March to 0.35 in December) and lowest in the South (0.24 to 0.30). Across all regions, the stay-at-home proportion was higher in block groups with a higher percentage of Blacks, as Blacks disproportionately live in urban areas where stay-at-home rates were higher (0.009 [CI: 0.008, 0.009]). In the South, West, and Midwest, higher-SES block groups stayed home at the lowest rates pre-pandemic; however, this trend reversed throughout March before converging in the months following. In the Northeast, lower-SES block groups stayed home at comparable rates to higher-SES block groups during the height of the pandemic but diverged in the months following. 

Differences in physical distancing behaviors exist across U.S. regions, with a pronounced Southern and rural disadvantage. Results can be used to guide reopening and COVID-19 mitigation plans.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Regional disparities|Social distancing|Socioeconomic Disparities,2020-09-03T08:24:42.117036,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-03T08:24:18.770130,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology","NA",2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/citation/,e6msz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4e887a0f9a080171ad92fa/,5f4e887a0f9a080171ad92fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e6msz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e6msz
