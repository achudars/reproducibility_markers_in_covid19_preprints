To test our framework, we conducted four experiments and also drew on a sample of 961 Kickstarter campaigns. Our results show that two campaign characteristics – the product’s development stage and the indicated time to product delivery – determine the psychological distance that supporters experience in response to a campaign, and that psychological distance, in turn, inhibits individual campaign contributions and cumulative campaign success.

Here, we study the effect of social comparison on the dispersion and predictability of individual performance. We hypothesize that the effects of social comparison on effort will differ for top-performers and bottom-performers in a way that the inequality between the two increases. We use a quasi-experimental design to test our predictions with data from Topcoder, an online crowdsourcing platform that publishes computer programming contests. We find that in contests where the submitted code is evaluated against others' submissions, rather than using an absolute scale, top-performers increase their effort while bottom-performers decrease it. As a result, relative scoring leads to a higher dispersion and somewhat higher predictability of performance, strengthening the status quo and precluding under-performers from engaging and learning.

These changes can be explained by two distinct forces. The first was the expansion of human rights in the spheres of imprisonment and healthcare, largely through legal decisions. The second force can be called queer theory, which inspired activists and eventually shaped media coverage. Sustained pressure on the government led in 2016 to regulations which facilitated the transfer of males to the women’s estate. Predictably, one sexually assaulted female inmates.

In 1934, Hayek started a two-volume book on capital theory, completing only one volume in 1941. Curiously, Hayek (1941) cites Hicks’ (1939) Value and Capital but not the financial measure of roundaboutness that Hicks suggested as a substitute for Böhm-Bawerkian roundaboutness. In 1967, Hicks criticized the inexplicable lags in The Hayek Story. Hayek maintained his view that consumption was sticky and responded to Hicks with a mound-of-honey analogy. Nevertheless, Hayek maintained that his business cycle theory was fundamentally correct and continued to hope that others might someday discover a capital structure theory to undergird it.

A Series of Bivariate Analyses of the Impact of Electoral Characteristics Upon the Predictability of British National Elections from 1945 to 2017.,"Despite a wealth of literature existing with regards to electoral prediction, no pieces exist that address whether certain elections are more predictable than others. Indeed, the existing literature invariably focuses upon the accuracy and efficacy of the methods used to predict elections, without addressing the nature of the elections that are being predicted. Consequently, a fundamental avenue of enquiry remains unexplored within the current literature, resulting in a stark and surprising lacuna and rendering the dominant paradigm problematic. To remedy this deficiency, this paper addresses whether certain elections are more predictable than others and ascertains which characteristics cause their predictability to vary. Owing to both temporal and spatial limitations, electoral predictability is addressed with a specific focus on British national elections from 1945 to 2017.  In order to achieve its aims, this paper engages in a series of bivariate analyses between measures of predictive accuracy and electoral characteristics. Specifically, the correlation between the total dichotomous and total mean absolute error exhibited by pre-election polls conducted for the twenty-three studied elections and six specified electoral characteristics is ascertained and utilised to draw conclusions. Ultimately, this paper finds that certain elections are indeed more predictable than others, with certain characteristics having a greater impact on the studied measures of predictability than others. However, due to both the small size of the utilised data set and its limited scope, it is accepted that the conclusions drawn are only indicative in nature. Despite this, owing to the unique nature of this paper, it is hoped that the conclusions drawn will provide a foundation for the future exploration of this hitherto unexplored avenue of enquiry to further our collective understanding of the predictability of elections.",TRUE,FALSE,Elections|Electoral Context|Political Science|Politics|Polling Accuracy|Polling Error|Polls|Prediction|Pre-election Polls|United Kingdom,2020-05-17T05:11:08.239615,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-17T05:10:45.126996,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/citation/,h58pz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebec253b9daae000d504067/,5ebec253b9daae000d504067,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h58pz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h58pz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h58pz

In addition to physical health problems, COVID-19 is increasingly reported to be associated with mental health problems across populations. Evidence from the current pandemic and earlier infectious disease outbreaks suggests that several psychosocial factors, including fear and susceptibility of infection, stigma, lack of awareness, pre-existing health problems, and poor social support affect the mental health status among the vulnerable individuals and populations.

Exploiting variations across artificial regions (i.e., grids of 50x50km) within an ethnicity's historical homeland, we document that both the intensive and extensive margins of contemporary conflict are concentrated close to historical ethnic borders. Following a theory-based instrumental variable approach, which generates a plausibly exogenous ethno-spatial partition of Africa, we find that grid cells with historical ethnic borders have 27 percentage points higher probability of conflict and 7.9 percentage points higher probability of being the initial location of a conflict. We uncover several key underlying mechanisms: competition for agricultural land, population pressure, cultural similarity and weak property rights.",TRUE,FALSE,Africa|Borders|Conflict|Development|Economic Development|Ethnic Borders|Ethnic Conflict|Historical Homelands|Landownership|Migration|Population Pressure|Property Rights|Territory|Thiessen Tesselation|Voronoi Tesselation,2020-05-15T00:10:01.211061,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-15T00:07:06.963349,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Terrorism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Peace and Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Defense and Security Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/citation/,375db,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g962t/,g962t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebdcfc94d27c5001777bf2b/,5ebdcfc94d27c5001777bf2b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375db/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/375db/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/375db

Upon entering the U.S. context, the disease was immediately subject to the process of affective polarization, with clear partisan splits forming around perceptions of its risks that did not relate to science. We explore whether firms’ preexisting political positioning affected how they voluntarily disclosed to their investors on a novel, affectively polarized issue by examining whether firms’ disclosure of COVID-19 risks covaries with their partisan political giving.
