The identified gap was addressed using multilevel logistic regression models.
Methods: Pooled 2008 and 2013 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Surveys datasets were used. Single level logistic regression analyses were conducted on 24,032 women, and multilevel logistic regression models were performed on 23,329 women. Statistical significance was pegged at p≤0.01 and p≤0.05.
Results: About 22.1% of the reproductive age women ever used a modern contraceptive. The best-fitted model indicated that the effects of individual, household, and geo-residential level factors on the use of modern contraceptives among Sierra Leone Women vary from one community to another. The woman’s age, marital status, educational qualification, listening to the radio, recent sexual activity, household wealth, place of residence, and region of residence were the statistically significant predictors of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age Sierra Leone women.
Conclusion: The study provided in-depth insight into the significant factors that account for the variability in women use of contraceptives in Sierra Leone.

that resemble traditional editorial decisions. However, the decisions for social media may
deviate from traditional ones because they are often made outside the newsroom and guided
by audience metrics. This study focuses on selective link sharing as quasi-gatekeeping on
Twitter – conditioning a link sharing decision about news content. It illustrates how selective
link sharing resembles and deviates from gatekeeping for the publication of news stories.
Using a computational data collection method and a machine learning technique called
Structural Topic Model (STM), this study shows that selective link sharing generates a
different topic distribution between news websites and Twitter and thus significantly revokes
the specialty of news organizations. This finding implies that emergent logic, which governs
news organizations’ decisions for social media can undermine the provision of diverse news,

Much of this gap has be attributed to industrial composition, however employment composition also likely plays a key role. Underemployment and labor force non-participation have been become significant issues in rural areas. This study uses data from the Current Population Survey for 1970 to 2018 to understand how poverty rates among 6 employment groups —(1) not in the labor force, (2) discouraged workers, (3) unemployed workers, (4) low hours workers, (5) low income workers, and (6) adequately employed workers— can explain the persistent gap in poverty between urban and rural areas. Demographic standardization and decomposition techniques reveal that majority of the poverty gap is explained by differences in poverty rates for the employment groups.

This allows us to define a Scale Threshold for societies, beyond which growth in information processing becomes paramount, and an Information Threshold, which once crossed permits additional growth in scale. Polities diverge from one another in sociopolitical feature space prior to crossing the Information Threshold, but then reconverge.

Child maltreatment is one context in which changes to a child’s care and living arrangements, introduced when a child is placed in foster care, could actively improve a child’s wellbeing. In this study, I analyze a nationally representative sample of child welfare-involved youth to examine whether the association between foster care and instability in care and living arrangements is driven by children’s placement in foster care or by the selectivity of foster youth. I find that compared to children who do not enter foster care, those who do are more likely to experience change in their primary caregiver, availability of a secondary caregiver, and their living arrangement. When I treat the initial transition into foster care as necessary, excluding it from my measures of change, foster care appears to stabilize the structures of children’s care arrangements, while their constitutive relationships remain substantially less so.

The study principally aimed to highlight the strategies used by the translator to overcome the problem of no equivalence in the target language. Baker's strategies for translating idioms (1992) formed the basis of the theoretical part of the study. The analytical part comprised Agatha Christie's novel, Appointment with Death (2001) and the translation of the novel by Ameen from English into Arabic. The study concentrated on the most dominant translation solutions when translating idioms from English into Arabic. A lack of equivalent idioms in the Arabic language was one of the outcomes of this study. Further investigations showed that the most prevailing translation strategy used by the translator encompassed paraphrasing. The translated version highlighted the challenges of switching between different cultural, conceptual and linguistic frames of reference.",TRUE,FALSE,idioms|source language|strategies of translation idioms. target language,2019-07-19T19:20:02.612210,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:19:34.659780,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/citation/,7x9a4,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdce8d0c2ae0b001b4ebb4f/,5cdce8d0c2ae0b001b4ebb4f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7x9a4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7x9a4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7x9a4,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.230

In the presence of such confounders, the natural direct and indirect effects of treatment on the outcome, into which the total effect can be additively decomposed, are not identified. An alternative but similar set of effects, known as randomized intervention analogues to the natural direct effect (R-NDE) and the natural indirect effect (R-NIE), can still be identified in this situation, but existing estimators for these effects require a complicated weighting procedure that is difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new method for estimating the R-NDE and R-NIE that involves only a minor adaption of the comparatively simple regression methods used to perform effect decomposition in the absence of treatment-induced confounding. It involves fitting linear models for (a) the conditional mean of the mediator given treatment and a set of baseline confounders and (b) the conditional mean of the outcome given the treatment, mediator, baseline confounders, and the treatment-induced confounders after first residualizing them with respect to the observed past. The R-NDE and R-NIE are simple functions of the parameters in these models when they are correctly specified and when there are no unobserved variables that confound the treatment-outcome, treatment-mediator, or mediator-outcome relationships. We illustrate the method by decomposing the effect of education on depression symptoms at midlife into components operating through income versus alternative factors. R and Stata packages are available for implementing the proposed method.",TRUE,FALSE,causal inference|confounding|effect decomposition|mediation,2019-05-16T02:59:12.746714,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-16T02:58:39.646760,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/citation/,86d2k,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdc5ec82d1b9e0019a524cf/,5cdc5ec82d1b9e0019a524cf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86d2k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/86d2k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/86d2k,NA
