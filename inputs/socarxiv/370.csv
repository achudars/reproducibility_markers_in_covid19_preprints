We examine the changes and consider some implications. We suggest that the adoption of co-citation as underpinning principle for the measurement of knowledge structures has led to re-designation of the value of knowledge and knowledge producers in increasingly quantitative terms. We use notions of ‘institution’ and ‘logic’ to better understand such a change and its implications. Under a new logic that is gradually embedding itself across the higher education sector, the ‘constitutive rules’ concerned with the value of research now prioritize quantification, and tangibility of output, and quality is increasingly equated with citation. Whilst the scientific disciplines have traditionally been closer to this model, albeit with significant national variations, subjects within the Social Sciences and Humanities are now being affected. We present evidence from a small study of the UK higher education sector of university regulation of doctoral degree submission format in two disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences (History and Sociology). Our evidence shows the recent and gradual adoption of a practice, previously more common in scientific disciplines, that allows the doctoral thesis to be constituted by a series of publishable papers, known by a variety of names, the most common being ‘Thesis by Published Papers’, ‘Journal Format Thesis’, ‘Alternative Format Thesis’, and ‘Integrated Thesis’.

We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that allows for collateralization adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out differences in asset prices due to collateralized counterparty risk. This framework is very useful for pricing outstanding defaultable financial contracts. By using a unique data set, we are able to achieve a clean decomposition of prices into their credit risk factors. We find empirical evidence that counterparty risk is not overly important in credit-related spreads. Only the joint effects of collateralization and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of financial contracts.

The higher the risk preference of capitalists, the greater the ratio of capital goods to safe assets in savings, the labor demand in the capital goods sector will increase, some workers will move from the consumer goods sector to the capital goods sector, the marginal product of labor will rise in both sectors, and workers’ real wages will increase. In this model, a sudden increase in capitalists’ risk aversion can cause a recession. In addition, this model is used to analyze monetary policy, suppression of an overheating economy, and two positive externalities from capitalists to workers.",TRUE,FALSE,capital goods|capital income taxation|consumer goods|externality|overheating|real wage|recession|risk preference|safe asset|Two-sector model,2019-10-19T09:02:21.882263,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-19T09:02:07.954383,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,Yuuki Maruyama,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/citation/,rvne2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da9decaec1775000ffe9daf/,5da9decaec1775000ffe9daf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rvne2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rvne2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rvne2

Yet as admission to selective colleges has become increasingly competitive, a market for services to help students succeed in the application process has rapidly expanded. When is participation in this market understood to be morally legitimate? Research on moral markets has examined how participants distinguish legitimate from illegitimate markets, and how relational strategies can hide or purify illegitimate transactions. Less attention has been paid to why groups define a market as legitimate, particularly when its existence conflicts with other group values. Drawing on digital ethnography of an online forum for current and prospective Taiwanese international students and interviews with forum participants, we find that participants define the purchase of college admissions services as moral when it is compensating for collective disadvantage, yet reject its morality in other contexts. Paying to beat a “meritocratic” system becomes legitimate when one recognizes one’s systematic disadvantage in that system. Yet recognizing group disadvantage along one dimension does not imply awareness of individual (dis)advantage along other dimensions, nor does it undermine a broader faith that the system is meritocratic.",TRUE,FALSE,economic sociology|higher education|international students|internationlization|meritocracy|moral markets|Taiwan|worth,2019-10-18T09:05:01.049736,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-18T09:04:50.178418,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/citation/,5t2c4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da91e2bd9fac4000aa3e62c/,5da91e2bd9fac4000aa3e62c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2c4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5t2c4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5t2c4
