First, the exposition of a scientific interpretation of Yin-Yang and Wu Xing (the Five Elements theory) provides a connection between Eastern and Western philosophy and illuminates the underlying laws of the complex system. Second, there is a presentation of the ubiquitous natural driving force embedded in our objective material world. A comprehension of the natural driving force is the basis for an understanding of the evolutionary trend of nature and its integration with nature. Third, an explanation of the underlying nature of life is offered, with an emphasis on the need for a deeper interpretation of life to expand its possibilities, remove constraints, and achieve true freedom. Fourth, there is a discussion of the composition and characteristics of the conscious environment. The self in the conscious environment is the true self.  Therefore, the construction of the conscious environment is the most important work of human beings. Finally, there is a section on the rational reconstruction of the spiritual world. The most pressing problems currently faced by society and individuals are rooted in the spiritual world that has yet to be reconstructed.

We use administrative records from Baltimore City and suburban Baltimore County public elementary schools (2011-2015) to generate a network of schools based on student transfers. We then apply repeated calculations of the Louvian method of community detection to estimate emergent sets of schools that are likely to be considered by similar parents – which we term emergent consideration sets – and use gravity models to explore the role of social structure, demographics, and geography in observed enrollment patterns. We find that our network-derived emergent consideration sets are better defined by structural boundaries than student composition or proficiency alone. Within consideration sets, students tend to avoid schools with relatively higher levels of free- and reduced-price meal eligibility and flock towards schools with higher proficiency levels. School racial composition, however, plays a much smaller role in predicting movement between schools, in part because structural constraints generate racially homogeneous consideration sets. Together, these findings highlight how regional social and geographic organization shapes school segregation processes and the policies used to combat them.",TRUE,FALSE,decision-making|school mobility|segregation|social networks,2020-07-20T17:49:41.812536,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T17:49:20.775323,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,Julia Burdick-Will|Jeffrey A.

A case study of Vietnamese teachers’ self-efficacy in relation to teaching English as a Foreign Language,"The study looked at factors that influenced the self-efficacy in teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) of a group of university teachers in Vietnam. This study explored the relationship between Vietnamese teachers’ discourses of effective teaching practices and their self-efficacy beliefs, the influence of Vietnamese culture and context on teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs, and whether participating in the research led to a change in the self-efficacy beliefs of the teacher participants and of myself as researcher.The research took the form of a qualitative case study. Participants were eight university teachers of the English language at a technical university in Vietnam. Data collection lasted six months. Data collection tools included focus group discussions, individual interviews, journaling, and observations. An inductive coding process and thematic analysis were used for analysing data. Findings indicate that social persuasion was the most influential source of self-efficacy information. The study shows that different sources of self-efficacy information interacted with one another to influence the two dimensions of self-efficacy. Besides, it appears that teachers’ understanding of a number of environment and workplace factors appeared to constrain some teachers into adopting the Grammar Translation Method (GTM) approach and possibly reduced their self-efficacy in adapting a Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)-oriented approach. After participating in the study, the teaching approaches of study teachers and my own approaches seemed to be more CLT-oriented although most of us were characterised by a low sense of self-efficacy in adapting this approach in the Vietnamese classrooms. Findings also suggest that several aspects of Vietnamese culture, e.g. the concept of face, are likely to have influenced the way the study teachers selected, weighted and interpreted efficacy-building information. In addition, it is plausible that changes in context, e.g. teaching different kinds of students, led to a change in the way the teachers and I weighed and selected self-efficacy information. Self-reflection, self-doubt and self-regulation were other factors causing fluctuations in the study teachers’ and my self-efficacy. My study contributes to a widening understanding of how different aspects of culture can impact on self-efficacy. It provides examples to challenge the claim that the self-efficacy of experienced teachers is stable and the widespread view that a negative sense of self-efficacy induces individuals to give up and make less effort. The study shows the relationship between teacher self-efficacy beliefs and their discourses of EFL instruction, i.e. their self-efficacy in using different aspects of a communicative approach fluctuated at different stages of the study. The study points to the need to improve leadership practice and teaching conditions at the faculty and university. Preparing teachers for regulation strategies, encouraging them to work collectively, and offering more professional development programs are likely to develop a stronger sense of self-efficacy among teachers.",TRUE,FALSE,qualitative|teacher self-efficacy|TEFL|Vietnam,2020-07-20T17:40:42.351814,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T17:39:13.281271,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://awej.org/index.php/theses-dissertations/1688-can-i-teach-these-students-a-case-study-of-vietnamese-teachers-self-efficacy-in-relation-to-teaching-english-as-a-foreign-language,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/citation/,pjez5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f15d5a80870f2011d0977fd/,5f15d5a80870f2011d0977fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjez5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pjez5/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.254,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pjez5

However, translators sometimes mistranslate them. Thus, this study sheds light on the translation quality assessment of proverbs. These proverbs are collected from One thousand and one English proverbs translated into Arabic by Omar Jabak. This study aims at pointing out the most frequently used strategies for translating proverbs, and investigating how far Na Pham's error analysis model is appropriate for the description and assessment of the strategies used in translating these proverbs. Na Pham's error analysis model is used to identify comprehension, linguistic and translation errors. Moreover, this study aims at detecting the most common errors under each strategy used. The findings of this study show that Na Pham's error analysis model is appropriate for the assessment. It also reveals that there are certain types of errors which are committed more often than others. In addition, it uncovers that the types of errors detected when translating proverbs using partial equivalence and paraphrasing are very similar. Comprehension errors, giving an inaccurate meaning, and distorting the meaning are the most frequently detected errors when translating proverbs using partial equivalents and paraphrasing.

It is argued that disparities in record keeping regulation across communication mediums disincentivizes the use of technology capable of generating records for consumer retention, while incentivizing the use of technology which shields financial advisors from accountability. Experimental evidence is provided in support of this argument. Further, it is argued that regulation disparities across communication mediums may result in more wrongful accusations of advisor misconduct, less reporting of genuine misconduct, less self-policing among industry members, and greater unrectifiable consumer harm. Objections to these arguments are considered, along with practical guidance for consumers, regulators, and policy makers.",TRUE,FALSE,Communication|Consumer harm|Consumer protection|Financial advice|FINRA|Record keeping|Regulation|SEC,2020-07-21T04:56:26.399474,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-21T04:56:11.895099,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,Derek T.

The study used a descriptive study design, with a selected sample of 300 male and female English language teachers from elementary and middle schools. The research conducted a group-wide comparison using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings illustrate that educational qualification, career status, job experience and training courses substantially affect application of the SIOP model in the classroom. Results also show that technical, financial capabilities and teachers' qualifications enable the SIOP implementation in the Saudi classroom. The study suggests the implementation of the SIOP model for the sake of transitioning from the traditional English language education system to more advanced methods concerned with the systematic evaluation of English language teachers and classroom environment standards. The recommendation includes training teachers on the SIOP model and emphasizes providing other countries with the guidelines related to SIOP implementation in the English classroom.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-07-20T17:45:05.021992,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T17:42:16.844970,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/citation/,md2au,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f15cebf0596f60114798c21/,5f15cebf0596f60114798c21,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md2au/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/md2au/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/md2au
