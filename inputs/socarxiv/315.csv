Over-time change in the social mobility of children from unskilled working-class backgrounds in Germany,"Research on intergenerational social mobility tends to focus on examining the level of overall social fluidity in society. However, from a social justice perspective it can be argued that the type of social fluidity that matters most is upward mobility from the lowest rung of the social ladder. This article examines the labour market chances of children from parents in unskilled working-class positions, relative to children from skilled working-class and higher social class backgrounds, and how they have changed across four birth cohorts in post-WWII Germany. We find that individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds have substantially lower labour market chances than individuals from skilled working-class backgrounds or higher social class backgrounds. Moreover, we find that the gap in labour market chances between indi- viduals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and individuals from more advantaged backgrounds has not narrowed but, if anything, has widened across the four birth cohorts we examine. Our results suggest that an important factor underlying this sustained labour market inequality is a persistently high level of educational inequality between these groups.",TRUE,FALSE,disadvantaged youth|Educational inequality|equality of opportunity|Germany|Intergenerational social mobility|intergenerational transmission of inequality|Social inequality|social justice,2019-09-17T14:39:45.297982,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-17T14:39:22.686322,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/citation/,6vyr7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d80a4159defac001a19142d/,5d80a4159defac001a19142d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vyr7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vyr7,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001699319868524

Sonless families did grow as fertility declined; the percentage sonless reached 10% in India as a whole in 2015 and approached 20% in states with earlier fertility declines. I also identify a substantial influence of children’s gender on mothers’ expectations of old age support. Using panel data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS), I compare women’s expectations after they had children to earlier expectations when they did not yet have children.

To better understand suicide attacks, we use a data set of 2,923 individual fighter-level observations of combatants for the Islamic State. These data include individual demographic data and the fighter's role for the Islamic State; including if they volunteered to be a suicide fighter. Through these data, we test several extant theories of suicide combatant mobilization (i.e., ideational or economic incentives) compared to the effect of primary socialization.

This is not the case for election campaigns, but for the time in-between elections due to reasons for raising funds and other resources. These processes often rely on the digital sphere. Parties are not only challenged by relocating their communication strategies in normal times into new vessels, but also to encounter increased interactional demands by their target groups - members and supporters (Scarrow 2015). This comes along with the well-researched decline of established parties due to different societal causes (van Biezen, Poguntke 2014; Whiteley 2011, Montigny 2015). Parties’ adaptation of information and communication technologies (ICT) poses another challenge: How to migrate into the digital without losing those who are already engaged offline? How can parties manage to get the best out of both worlds – online and offline – and meet the demands of their adherents? These questions are connected to the research of intra-party democracy (e.g. Close et al. 2017; Faucher and Boy 2018; Bernardi et al. 2017) and leadership (Poguntke and Webb 2005; Musella 2018) as well as to research on parties’ virtual presence (e.g. Römmele 2003).
We seek to understand how parties operate online in terms of building relationships between the organization and its members as well as fostering relationships between individual adherents. To grasp what is going on, we analyze parties’ websites and Facebook fan pages. We follow a comparative approach by conducting a pair-comparison. Our cases are the British Conservative Party and the German Christian Democratic Union with a panel data set from 2013 to 2018. Both parties hold governmental responsibility and face national turmoil within their countries. We analyze websites because we assume them serving as a hub of information and exchange for members and supporters.

Background: Wealth can be an important resource to deal with the adverse economic consequences of union dissolution. Marital property regimes usually ensure that both partners receive a share of the couples’ wealth following a divorce. The dissolution of cohabiting unions is not governed by such rules in most countries, including Germany, which may lead to a more unequal division of wealth following the dissolution of cohabitation as compared to marriage.
Method: The analysis consists of multivariable fixed-effects regression models based on longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (N = 6,388 individuals) for the years 2002 to 2017.
Results: Changes in wealth are relatively similar for men and women after the dissolution of marriage. The dissolution of cohabiting unions is related to losses in wealth for women, but not for men. Controlling for post-dissolution processes, gender inequality increases after the dissolution of cohabitations.
Conclusion: Union dissolution is associated with wealth losses. The legal protection of the economically weaker spouse in marriage prevents gender inequality in these wealth losses.

To understand this phenomenon, this paper uses novel data consisting of 4,101 individual foreign fighter data of Islamic State volunteers fighting in Iraq and Syria. Islamic State fighters are better educated and have similar rates of unemployment compared to males in their home countries. Further, Islamic State fighters also come from areas with better economic conditions and regions with politically marginalized and ethnically excluded groups. The effect of economic activity and group exclusion are statistically significant and positive across several sensitivity checks. These analyses suggest that Islamic State fighters are motivated by group grievances, in the form of relative ethnic group ranking, as opposed to economic incentives.",TRUE,FALSE,grievances|mobilization|political violence|terrorism,2019-09-16T19:14:25.465267,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-16T19:14:07.699309,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/citation/,5qdnx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7ea1369defac00191816b9/,5d7ea1369defac00191816b9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qdnx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5qdnx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5qdnx,NA
