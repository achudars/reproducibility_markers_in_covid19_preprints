Using Kenya as a case study, this paper uses natural capital (NC) and infrastructural capital (IC) to compare the enabling environments of entrepreneur vs. government run off-grid electrification projects, explores the role that NC and IC can play in determining wealth creation post-electrification, and develops a micro-enterprise development (MED) index indicating regions in Kenya that could be well positioned for wealth creation (and thus, persistent demand) post-electrification. A comparison between the MED index and a nightlights GDP per capita proxy finds that their local differences are informative towards the management and use of local resources, suggests that a nightlights proxy could provide a large underestimate, and sheds light towards regions where the gap between achieved and unrealized potential may be large. We hypothesize that the large discrepancy between our MED index and the night lights income proxy is due to an underestimate of economic activity by night lights (most of the economic activity in rural areas happens during the day), the nature of the MED index being a measure of ‘potential’, and several other factors that could affect both variables such as local climate and environmental conditions, population stress on natural resources, quality of infrastructural capital (not only access), local corruption, and ethnic favoritism.

Thinking with Margulis about humans as holobionts, our species is both constituted by and embedded within communities of organisms and ecologies. As holobionts we may not be able to live outside of these communities and systems or away from Earth, even if we can temporarily survive without them. Placed within an evolutionary framework, techno-capitalist imaginaries of space settlement limit conceptions of planetary reproduction to heteronormative models of ecopoiesis which promote competition as a key driver of evolution instead of cooperation. Technologically mediated survival along with forced reproduction of holobionts within Earth-like systems and could lead to suffering and isolation like David Vetter’s forced survival in a bubble. I propose alternative liberatory modes of conceptualizing and materializing space migration (including queer and decolonized forms of reproduction) which better respect the Earth, its inhabitants, as well as extraterrestrial planets, landscapes, lives, and possibilities.

Given the long-running debate on the positive relationship between education and health, the question arises how this development in doctor–patient relations affects social inequalities in health. First, we test to what extent egalitarian (e.g. discussing treatment decisions with patients) doctor–patient relations are underlying the education–self-reported health association. Second, we test whether egalitarian and paternalistic (e.g. withholding some information from patients) doctor–patient relations show differential effects on self-reported health across educational groups. Analyses of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2004/2005 for 24 countries demonstrate that a more egalitarian doctor–patient relationship does not substantially reduce educational inequalities in self-reported health. However, some direct positive effects of egalitarian and direct negative effects of paternalistic doctor–patient relations on health ratings can be found. Finally, results show how the health status of the lower educated can improve with a more egalitarian and less paternalistic doctor–patient relationship.",TRUE,FALSE,doctor-patient relations|health care|health inequalities|patient-centered care|Physician–patient relations|self-rated health,2018-07-02T10:51:43.219090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-01T17:36:51.663000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/citation/,mv7mf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b4mp2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/relationships/node/,b4mp2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58921905594d9001faed1f97/,58921905594d9001faed1f97,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mv7mf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mv7mf,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001699316670715

To help resolve this puzzle, we analyze a sample of college entrants in Germany with a discrete choice design that allows for social learning from the experiences of others. We make at least two contributions to the state of research. First, we test whether essentialist gender stereotypes affect major selection mostly through internalization or rather as external constraints that high school graduates adapt their behavior to. Empirically, we find that internalized vocational interests better explain gendered major choices than conformance with friends’ and parents’ expectations does. Second, we scrutinize whether segregation results from women’s anticipation of gendered family roles or from their anticipation of sex-based discrimination, but we find no evidence for either of these hypotheses.

A Test of Devaluation, Human Capital, and Gender Role Theory","As men are overrepresented in lucrative fields and women disproportionately graduate from disciplines that yield low wages in the labor market, horizontal sex segregation in higher education contributes significantly to economic gender inequality. But what underlies the association between sex composition and wages in fields of study? We draw on data from the German HIS Graduate Panel Study 1997 (N=4092) and use hierarchical linear models to adjudicate between devaluation theory and explanations based on differential sorting processes: human capital and gender role theory. The resulting evidence for both human capital and devaluation theory is scant. Consistent with gender role theory, differences in the attractiveness of fields to students with a careerist approach to higher education and the labor market in turn explain most of the association between field of studies’ sex composition and wage levels. We therefore conclude that gendered patterns of self-selection which derive from men’s socialization into the breadwinner role rather than valuative discrimination or rational anticipation of career interruptions underlie the association between fields’ sex composition and wage levels.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:46:25.852067,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-01T09:05:31.457000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/citation/,5u2nn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t4kc5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/relationships/node/,t4kc5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5891a3236c613b01fbcadee6/,5891a3236c613b01fbcadee6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5u2nn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5u2nn,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcu060

Background: Modern couples confront tensions between ideals of mutual interests and values of economic autonomy, a departure from fitting themselves into culturally expected family arrangements of the past. This study teases apart the conditions under which people might prioritize one cultural value over another.

Method: The author conducted a nationally representative survey experiment (N = 3,986 individuals). The respondents selected an income allocation arrangement for a fictional couple with varied relationships investments (i.e., marriage, parenthood, length of relationship) and earning disparities.

Results: Although stronger relationship investments were associated with greater support for sharing all income, the most commonly selected income allocation arrangement was a hybrid arrangement of sharing some income and keeping the rest separate. When respondents preferred some amount of financial autonomy, the primary earner was expected to maintain ownership of a greater amount of the total household income. The preferred level of withholding income was slightly larger in magnitude when women were shown as the primary earner when compared with men shown as the primary earner.

Conclusion: The pursuit of economic autonomy, in combination with beliefs about gender, are important dimensions of gender inequality located within families.",TRUE,FALSE,cohabitation|family|gender inequality|intrahousehold finances|marriage|PAA2017,2018-07-02T10:46:27.780578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-31T20:42:39.531000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/citation/,6aqse,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xtz69/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/relationships/node/,xtz69,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5890f6269ad5a102167a1377/,5890f6269ad5a102167a1377,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6aqse/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6aqse,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12554

It seems to be a strong tendency towards community formation in online personal, social networks: somebody’s friends are usually also friends between them, forming subgroups of more densely connected nodes. Research on community structure in social networks usually focuses on the networks’ statistical properties. There is a need for qualitative studies bridging the gap between network topologies and their sociological implications. To this direction, visual representations of personal networks in social media could be a valuable source of empirical data for qualitative interpretation. Most of the personal social networks’ visualizations in the present study are very highly clustered with densely-knit overlapping subgroups of friends and interconnected between them through wide bridges. This network topology pattern seems to be quite efficient, allowing for a fast spread and diffusion of information across the whole social network.",TRUE,FALSE,community structure|Facebook|friendships network|Gephi|social network analysis|social network visualization,2018-07-02T10:47:29.112347,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-30T20:13:47.557000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/citation/,8aaxa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dq2ad/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/relationships/node/,dq2ad,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588f9c5c594d9001fc9fbccb/,588f9c5c594d9001fc9fbccb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8aaxa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8aaxa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8aaxa,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.237086

Accordingly, in the area of foreign language education, English teachers need more than ever to incorporate intercultural awareness and cross-cultural understanding in their syllabi. This article reports on a case study that involves the use of many research instruments including questionnaires, classroom observation, and assessment of assignments and exam sheets. This paper tends to suggest a cultural teaching based on standards for intercultural learning elicited from related literature in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) setting, addressed to English as a Foreign Language (EFL) Master students approaching the end of their course of study and getting ready to enter the world of job-market. It proposes ways of instilling multicultural awareness into these language learners through the implementation of intercultural activities, helping them better understanding diversity and developing positive attitudes in the workplace. The research goals comprise increasing students’ intercultural global awareness, promoting their tolerance, and helping them remedy negative attitudes towards the target culture and other alien cultures. Findings of the study show that the proposed intercultural approach stimulates students’ thinking, helps them better comprehend how to immerse in diverse perspectives on complicated international issues, and how to become global citizens able to deal effectively with multiculturalism in the work environment.",TRUE,FALSE,ESP teaching|intercultural communicative competence|master students|multiculturalism|workplace,2018-07-02T10:51:50.486167,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-30T00:59:39.579000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/citation/,qjcq5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fm3kp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/relationships/node/,fm3kp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588e8f296c613b01fa6ad304/,588e8f296c613b01fa6ad304,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjcq5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qjcq5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qjcq5,NA
