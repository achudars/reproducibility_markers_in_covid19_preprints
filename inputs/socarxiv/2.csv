One of the most significant developments with the use of ICT in higher education over the last decade has been the integration and application of e-learning systems to support the processes of teaching and learning. The implementation of ICT into the classroom should not be seen as merely an add-on, but should be included with purpose: meaningfully implemented based on pedagogy. Despite the suggested power of ICT in educating students for a modern future, the implementation of these technologies into the classroom is not as widespread as expected; debate still abounds as to what role ICT should play in the classroom. This research examined a variety of dependable attributes that assessed the engagement of undergraduate students (n1=87) through virtual whiteboards. This quantitative inquiry revealed that students perceived virtual whiteboards as beneficial for their learning and improved their engagement level in the classroom. Furthermore, a correlation between the level of engagement and the year of study was revealed as the primary implication of this research.",TRUE,FALSE,Active Learning|E-Learning|Information and Communication Technology,2021-03-04T14:23:28.945695,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T14:22:54.651692,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/citation/,jdprf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040e5a2035cf7042ec8715b/,6040e5a2035cf7042ec8715b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdprf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jdprf/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.182,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jdprf

However, there is yet no concrete evidence that the students’ pre-university academic accolades determine their performances at university level. In this article, we explored the findings of earlier studies that examined the relationships between entry grades and the academic performance of university students. The study was undertaken to collate the literature on the relationships between the students’ entry grades and their university academic performance in order to validate earlier assertions, if any, as well as to identify opportunities for further research in this field. During the study, we carried out a systematic review of 59 articles that we drew from different online electronic databases including, among others, the Free Scientific Publication, the Worldwide Science.org, and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The majority of these reviewed studies were drawn from America and Europe. Only a few of them were conducted in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of the 59 reviewed articles, only 53 of them met our inclusion criteria and our key findings showed, among others, that out of the 53 reviewed articles, 26, 4 and 13 of them revealed the existence of positive, negative, and mixed correlations respectively between the entry grades and the academic performance of university students. The remaining 10 articles, however, did not reveal any significant correlations between the two variables; instead, they alluded to the existence of difference in these relationships between male and female students; thus, suggesting for the need for affirmative action schemes. Overall, the study revealed that there is yet no consensus over whether pre-university academic performances of students predict their performances at university level; thus, indicating the need for further research in this field.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Performance|Admission|Cumulative Grade Point Average|Entry Grades|University,2021-03-04T14:25:43.507771,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T14:25:19.582431,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/citation/,vsneq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040e497441575041a57f480/,6040e497441575041a57f480,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsneq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vsneq/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.181,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vsneq

We develop two measures of network tension: the relative frequency and the strength of strong, open triads. Our results show that in recorded jazz music–a uniquely synergistic domain of collective creativity—tension is more prevalent than expected, and it is a predictor of several success measures, including deep success, while brokerage and closure are not. We also measure the structural availability of tension to each session and show that unexpected tension (where musicians go beyond chance to bring imbalance into their bands) has an additional contribution to deep success.

Recent literature on framings in political discourse have re-directed attention from static models of issue ownership to more interactive models of strategic framing contests. This article proposes a robust action approach, and tests hypotheses about the dual repertoires of local action: First, we test for the presence of exploratory local action, when discourse positions are altered in response to positions by others, and second, we show evidence for the presence of role claim behavior, when a dominant discourse position is taken that silences others. Using the case of economic policy discourse in Hungary in 1997, we show how the “GDP growth” discourse position silenced opposition positions on the right, mostly built from stigmatizing frames. Discourse positions beyond the one built around growth did not silence alternative framings, but elicited discourse shifts. We coded 8632 utterances over 100 days of discourse into a two-mode network of speech acts and statements and used a two-mode blockmodeling approach to identify positions and frames. We used a pooled time series approach to test hypotheses of local action dynamics.

The participants who were purposively sampled to partake in the study included 105 second- and third-year undergraduates from various faculties who were enrolled in a functional reading course, of which 46 was assigned to the control group and 49 was treated as the experimental group. One-on-one and group oral assessments were administered to both groups at the end of the course after IRCT implementation. The results showed IRCT had a very positive effect on the oral communication skills of the students in the experimental group, significantly improving their confidence and motivation toward speaking English. The students’ opinions from a questionnaire also revealed high speaking improvement, reinforced by evidence from close observations, interviews, and student work samples.

This condition illustrates that the social rehabilitation mechanism for drug abusers in Indonesia still has the opportunity to present shameless. Therefore, this study seeks to see the significance of Lifestyle-related shaming as an important part of the mechanism for implementing shaming for the shameless, especially drug relapse offenders in urban areas. This study was conducted based on the analysis of John Braithwaite's shaming theory which states that the public's response to perpetrators is divided into 2 (two) namely reintegrative shaming which means re-acceptance of the shameless by giving shame to them and stigmatization which means treating the shameless by giving a negative stigma permanently. The method used here was literature review by utilizing and trying to develop existing theories (grounded theory) by presenting concepts (variables) in accordance with the affordability of study data so as to produce new findings regarding the significance of Lifestyle-related shaming in its role for drug relapse offenders. Lifestyle-Related Shaming is part of a combination of reintegrative shaming theory, desistance theory and routine activity theory. In the literature study conducted, the combination of (3) three macro theories produces Lifestyle-related shaming which is closely related to urban lifestyle. It is expected that later, this study will be able to provide a broad understanding to the government to prepare the best program for solving shameless phenomenon, especially drug abuse in Indonesia.

An exploratory analysis of Perdiz arrow points from the ancestral Caddo area of the American Southeast,"Temporal assignments carry substantive weight, and archaeologists regularly assume that artefacts from discrete temporal units may differ in ways that convey changes in preference or behaviour. Similarly, archaeologists regularly assume that raw material differences articulate with stone tool morphology, and the role of differential raw material quality and preference associated with Caddo lithic technology remains largely unexplored. Whether a particular artefact is found in or outside of burial contexts is a sensitive and regularly discussed topic in the archaeological literature, providing valuable insights related to prehistoric burial practices, as well as generational shifts in aesthetics, design, and raw material preferences. These assumptions were tested using geometric morphometrics, yielding results in support of the hypothesis that Perdiz arrow point shape is protean, and that significant differences existed in shape by time, raw material, and burial context.",TRUE,FALSE,computational archaeology|digital archaeology|digital humanities|elliptical Fourier analysis|museum studies|NAGPRA|STEM,2021-03-04T12:34:29.224340,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T12:34:00.875961,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://aksel-blaise.github.io/perdiz/|https://github.com/aksel-blaise/perdiz|https://osf.io/dej74/,no,The study was not preregistered.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/citation/,ncfje,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dej74/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/relationships/node/,dej74,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040c6c067386c0404619cdb/,6040c6c067386c0404619cdb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncfje/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncfje/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ncfje

As a group of 20 diseases, NTDs are typified by their prevalence among the poor, excluded, and marginalised within society. In the absence of quality healthcare provision, many NTDs lead to long term disability, disfigurement, and stigma, which in turn act to reinforce the exclusion and poverty experienced by the afflicted. The path leading to illness is often determined by a widespread lack of access to formal education, timely healthcare, adequate living conditions, employment and nutrition. The reasons for such deprivation are complicated, but ultimately reduce to a persistence of inequalities in affected regions. These inequalities can manifest differently depending on the demographic being studied: gender, ethnicity, geographic location, level of formal education, can all determine the ease with which NTDs are transmitted, diagnosed or treated. Yet, regardless of contextual differences, NTDs continue to persist because individuals within endemic regions experience a healthcare system that is, either directly or indirectly, inequitable. The healthcare system referred to in this context is not confined to simply formal healthcare settings. Rather, it encompasses local healers, community healthcare professionals or volunteers, drug administration programmes, community mental health provision, the formal education system, and, in extension, even the infrastructure that exists to physically connect individuals to their healthcare provider. Failing to ensure parity across each of these components for every citizen equates to a discriminatory healthcare system which fails to recognise the individual’s basic human right to “a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of themselves and of their family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services” (Article 25- Universal Declaration of Human Rights). To ensure NTDs are managed in a way that is sustainable in the long term, the underlying societal inequalities which allow them to persist must be first understood.",TRUE,FALSE,equality|equity|gender|gender equality|health equity|human rights|Neglected Tropical Disease|NTD|poverty|universal healthcare,2021-03-04T13:10:43.083421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T13:10:25.817193,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",Kirsty Mackinlay,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/citation/,m7kpu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040c3ca035cf70425c80956/,6040c3ca035cf70425c80956,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m7kpu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m7kpu

It uses a nationally representative survey experiment to estimate how the various components of the Green Industrial Revolution affect public support, and which policy proposals are most popular.

Executive Summary:

- The Prime Minister has recently unveiled a ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution to meet net-zero emissions targets.
- We conducted an original survey experiment to causally identify the public’s support for particular points of this plan and their overall level of support.
- Public support is increased substantially by consumer grants for electric vehicles, funding of electric public transport, planting of trees, and wind power.
- Investment in air and sea vehicles and nuclear power does not meaningfully increase the public’s support.
- An ambitious version of the Green Industrial Revolution sees majority support amongst the public, while taking no action is widely opposed.
- This ambitious version of the Green Industrial Revolution sees support across party lines, being similarly popular amongst Conservative and Labour supporters.
