In the UK, actual uptake of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has exceeded expectations formed from studies conducted in 2020. However, it remains lower among members of other than white ethnic groups, and among younger people. Some evidence exists to suggest that the ethnic gap in vaccine uptake might be partially explained by lower trust, while one study carried out before the vaccination programme rollout suggested that variation in vaccine hesitancy can be explained by differences in trust and healthcare experiences, without reference to demographic variables such as age and ethnicity.

Methods
In April 2021, data were collected from 4885 UK-resident adults, of whom 3223 had received the invitation to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. Logit models were used to estimate the association between probability of vaccine uptake and age, gender, ethnicity, household income, NHS healthcare experiences, and trust in government, scientists, and medical professionals. Mediation analysis was conducted in order to probe the relationship between ethnicity, NHS healthcare experiences, trust, and uptake.

Results
Gender and household income were not predictive of vaccine uptake. Age and ethnicity were predictive of uptake, even after controls: younger people and members of other than white ethnic groups are less likely to have taken up the invitation to be vaccinated. NHS healthcare experiences appear to mediate a relationship between ethnicity and trust, and also to mediate some of the relationship between ethnicity and uptake (via trust).

Conclusions
Members of other than white ethnic groups report inferior NHS healthcare experiences, which may explain their lower trust in government, scientists, and medical professionals. However, this does not fully explain the ethnic gap in coronavirus vaccination uptake.",TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|Ethnicity|Experiences of healthcare|Inequality|Public health|SARS-CoV-2|Trust|Vaccination|Vaccine hesitancy,2021-05-26T13:16:03.404144,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:15:19.589542,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made available following the conclusion of the project's period of funding.,,available,NA,https://osf.io/dfr3m,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Daniel Allington|Siobhan McAndrew|Bobby Duffy|Vivienne Moxham-Hall,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/citation/,9vaeq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ac36da8a5d3d02490cf61f/,60ac36da8a5d3d02490cf61f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9vaeq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9vaeq

Evidence From Five Decades of Swedish Taxation Data,"As with many social transfer schemes, pension systems around the world are often progressive: individuals with lower incomes receive a higher percentage of their income as a subsequent pension. On the other hand, it is well known that those with lower earnings have higher mortality and thus accumulate fewer years of pension income. These opposite factors, therefore, both contribute to the progressiveness of a given pension system. Thus far, empirical research efforts to disentangle the effects of mortality inequality on lifetime pension income have been scarce. To close this gap, we use Swedish taxation data linked with death registers from 1970 to 2018 to study how education and pre-retirement earnings relate to lifetime pension income from age 60 onwards, as well as how inequalities in mortality between groups contribute to overall inequalities in lifetime pension income. The results show that both a progressive replacement structure and mortality differentials contribute to the overall distribution of life-course pension payments. A substantial proportion of the total inequality in lifetime pensions can be attributed to the fact that socially advantaged groups live longer, and this is particularly true for men. Mortality differences can explain up to 28% of the lifetime pension benefits between socioeconomic groups. We conclude that inequalities in mortality play an important part in determining the overall degree of between-group income transfers in a pension system.",TRUE,FALSE,mortality inequality|pension progressivity|Sweden,2021-05-25T10:29:43.234502,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:29:31.411720,FALSE,NA,no,Registration data not publicly available.,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/citation/,b78e9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60abe6dd0b6c69023c9b819c/,60abe6dd0b6c69023c9b819c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b78e9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b78e9

With growing availability of multi-wave surveys, social scientists are increasingly turning to latent trend models applied to survey data for examining changes in social and political attitudes. With the aim of facilitating this research, our study compares different approaches to modeling latent trends of aggregate public opinion: splines, Gaussian processes, and discrete autoregressive models. We examine the ability of these models to recover latent trends with simulated data that vary with regard to the frequency and magnitude of changes in the true trend, model complexity and data availability. Overall, we find that all three latent trend models perform well in all scenarios, even the most difficult ones with frequent and weak changes of the latent trend and sparse data. The two main performance differences we find include the relatively higher squared errors of autoregressive models compared to the other models, and the under-coverage of posterior intervals in high-frequency low-amplitude trends with splines. For all models and across all scenarios performance improves with increased data availability, which emphasizes the need of supplying sufficient data for accurate estimation of latent trends.",TRUE,FALSE,autoregressive models|Gaussian processes|latent trend models|public opinion|splines|survey data,2021-05-25T10:22:07.261227,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:21:41.520959,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/citation/,gauvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j45er/,j45er,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60abcdbf8a5d3d02250cc599/,60abcdbf8a5d3d02250cc599,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gauvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gauvx

Through the work of extraction studies, we know that much of this matter is violently pulled from the groundâ€”the metals in electronic devices, for instance, were cut out of the earth. Previous work in new materialist STS has critiqued the construction of the â€˜objectâ€™ as obscuring how things work and are made, yet the role of extraction in things has gone largely unacknowledged. In this paper, I argue that extraction is a core element of contemporary technoscience. I define the term dis-origining to analytically describe the way that objects are made to seem as if they come from nowhere, within and far beyond the STS literature, comparing this term with related concepts including Harawayâ€™s (1988) god-trick and Marxâ€™s commodity fetish. Seeing extraction in the world around us and naming the ways that socio-ecologies have been invisibilized may help us address the immense violences wrought in making contemporary technosciences.",TRUE,FALSE,extraction|new materialism|place|science and technology studies,2021-05-25T10:21:22.015983,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:21:04.996298,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/citation/,8hxj7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60abc7dda480c6020f0d525a/,60abc7dda480c6020f0d525a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hxj7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8hxj7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8hxj7
