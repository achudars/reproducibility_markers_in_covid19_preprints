Europe is confronting an unprecedented combination of environmental, economic, and social challenges. Reducing carbon emissions to zero fast enough to avoid catastrophic global warming is difficult; doing so while also reducing economic inequality so as to avert social disintegration and democratic backsliding is very difficult. Addressing this twin challenge will require the state – and the European Union – to deploy all economic policy instruments already at its disposal, and to develop new ones and coordinate their use in new ways. The paper proceeds in three steps. The first section discusses three distinct challenges – legal, political, and ideational – for the debate on the future of central banking. The remainder of the paper will tackle the two main ideational challenges, namely, institutional amnesia (forgetting past realities of central banking) and strategic ignorance (ignoring present realities of central banking). To overcome institutional amnesia, the second section briefly reviews the history of central banking, showing that the price stability is only one of several goals that central banking has, historically, been associated with.

These studies focus on both supply side factors that concern the traits of populist actors and demand side factors in the form of characteristics of the supporters. However, we still lack a solid understanding of how these supply and demand side factors interact to explain the support of populist leaders. We contribute to this literature by examining the interplay of two central supply side factors, people-centeredness and nativism, and two demand side factors, political dissatisfaction and generational differences, in determining populist support. We test these explanations by leveraging a choice-based conjoint analysis embedded in a representative sample of the Finnish population (n=1030). The results show that while both people-centeredness and nativism enhance the favourability of prospective political leaders, it is only nativism that it more appealing to the politically dissatisfied. In contrast to recent studies, we find no evidence that populist leader traits would be more favoured by younger generations.

Sexual stigma and prejudice exist in sport and leisure (Herek, 2009). This study employs descriptive and regression analyses of the National Sports and Society Survey (N = 3,993) to examine the patterns and implications of sexual stigma and prejudice in sports contexts by focusing on U.S. adults’ reports of sports-related mistreatment and involvement. Results indicate that about 1/3 of adults perceive sports as unwelcoming to LGBT athletes and nearly 40% report experiencing sports-related mistreatment; adults who identify as a sexual minority are particularly likely to perceive sports as unwelcoming and to report personal mistreatment. They are also less likely than self-identified heterosexuals to play, spectate, and talk about sports; sports-related mistreatment and childhood sports histories do not explain these patterns. Overall, the findings suggest that more action is needed to offset the presence and influence of sexual stigma and prejudice and to provide more welcoming sports environments for all.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|sexualities|sports involvement|sports mistreatment,2021-02-17T14:56:42.196855,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-17T14:51:52.356408,FALSE,NA,no,Data for the National Sports and Society Survey is in the process of being prepared for public release.,,no,IRB approval received; see nsass.org and DOI:10.31235/osf.io/mv76p for research design and analysis plan details.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/citation/,tfmp3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602c794a38d71900b1744efa/,602c794a38d71900b1744efa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tfmp3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tfmp3,NA

This paper presents the results of a systematic review that finds a schism in the literature showing theoretical and empirical treatment of project delivery risk polarises into considering either the effect of complexity or the inside view; rarely are they considered jointly.

To determine the difference in the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths between Muslim-majority and non-Muslim countries, and investigate reasons for the disparities. All Muslim-majority countries are considered partly or completely not free (in war), and 80% are LMICs (low- and middle-income countries). 
Methods
The 50 Muslim-majority countries have more than 50.0% Muslims with an average of 87.5% Muslims. The non-Muslim country sample consisted of 50 countries with highest GDP while omitting any Muslim-majority countries listed. Their average percentage of Muslims was 4.7%. All data was pulled on September 18, 2020. To measure incidence of COVID-19, three different Average Treatment Methods (ATE) were used to validate the results. 
Results
Non-Muslim countries had significantly more COVID-19 cases, 3-times that of Muslim-majority countries. Non-Muslim countries had 1.86-times more COVID-19 deaths than Muslim-majority countries. These percentages were obtained by applying the simulation method to ATE’s results.
Conclusion
Despite most Muslim-majority countries being poor and all considered partly or completely unfree, 34/50 (68%) countries had shown a decline in active COVID-19 cases. This study shows that Muslims’ practice of tahara (purity or cleanliness) is similar to many COVID-19 containment measures and tawakkul (trust in Allah) helps them remain resilient and hopeful during difficult unpredictable times, such as living through a pandemic.

We conducted a field experiment to study two technologies that allow teachers to outsource grading and feedback tasks on writing practices of high school seniors. The first technology is a fully automated evaluation system that provides instantaneous scores and feedback. The second one uses human graders as an additional resource to enhance grading and feedback quality in aspects in which the automated system arguably falls short. Both technologies significantly improved students' essay scores in a large college admission exam, and the addition of human graders did not improve effectiveness in spite of increasing perceived feedback quality. Both technologies also similarly helped teachers engage more frequently on personal discussions on essay quality with their students. Taken together, these results indicate that teachers' task composition shifted toward nonroutine activities and this helped circumvent some of the limitations of artificial intelligence. More generally, our results illustrate how the most recent wave of technological change may relocate labor to analytical and interactive tasks that still remain a challenge to automation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-17T14:44:42.128673,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-17T14:42:29.952908,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3729,prereg_both,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,Bruno Ferman|Lycia Lima|and Flávio Riva,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/citation/,qw249,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602bcf2338d719006674552a/,602bcf2338d719006674552a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qw249/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qw249,NA

Decades of research in social sciences have variously offered insights into understanding how such bold transformations might occur. However, these insights remain disjunct and of limited scope, providing only partial explanations on the processes of change required for solving global environmental challenges. Reductionist approaches tend to focus on micro-level changes within the individual, largely assuming that social structures and norms would shift incrementally as a result of individual behavior change. On the other hand, holistic, social structural approaches tend to describe how macro-level changes occur, while generally glossing over individual differences in terms of values, motivations and personal characteristics. There is an urgent need to integrate these two approaches in order to understand how individual actions influence and are in turn influenced by social structures and norms. In this paper, we synthesize a range of insights across these two different schools of thought and integrate them in a novel framework for transformative social change. One key distinction we make to bridge individual and collective perspectives lies between individual actions that comprise the practice itself and those that push for a broader societal change in practice. Our conceptual framework explains the interconnected relationships among individual behaviors, collective actions, and social-structural arrangements and suggests how these interdependent processes can together instigate both behavioral and societal change. We apply this general framework in the context of global wildlife trade and identify a variety of pathways towards transformative change.",TRUE,FALSE,Collective action|Global wildlife trade|Integrative framework|Pro-environmental behavior|Social-ecological systems|Social norm|Transformative social change,2021-02-16T06:12:41.339309,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-16T06:12:21.994967,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,Rumi Naito,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/citation/,5zmxd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602ad3e938d71900097440dd/,602ad3e938d71900097440dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5zmxd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5zmxd,NA

Although emissions leakage across emissions-regulated and -unregulated areas may depend on regional market design, and the extent of trading between market designs, previous studies of leakage from regional climate policies have focused on market power and market efficiency within only a centralized region following market rules. I develop a theoretical model which considers a second-best problem where a climate policy to correct for a negative externality from carbon emissions can be distorted by another market failure from the market design itself. My model allows for several types of non-overlapping climate policies and electricity market designs, and generates leakage predictions for these combinations.",TRUE,FALSE,Air Pollution|Electric Utilities|Environmental Economics|Government Policy|Market Structure,2021-02-15T19:11:22.313764,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-15T19:08:49.238020,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization,Brittany Tarufelli,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/citation/,x96ge,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602aaa6973c9fe0364078309/,602aaa6973c9fe0364078309,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x96ge/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x96ge/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x96ge,NA
