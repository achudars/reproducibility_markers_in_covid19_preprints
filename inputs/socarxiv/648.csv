To address these challenges, this article presents OSMnx, a new tool to make the collection of data and creation and analysis of street networks simple, consistent, automatable and sound from the perspectives of graph theory, transportation, and urban design. OSMnx contributes five significant capabilities for researchers and practitioners: first, the automated downloading of political boundaries and building footprints; second, the tailored and automated downloading and constructing of street network data from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of network topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks to disk as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street networks, including calculating routes, projecting and visualizing networks, and calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network.

Chaos describes certain nonlinear dynamical systems that have a very sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are always deterministic and may be very simple, yet they produce completely unpredictable and divergent behavior. Systems of nonlinear equations are difficult to solve analytically, and scientists have relied heavily on visual and qualitative approaches to discover and analyze the dynamics of nonlinearity. Indeed, few fields have drawn as heavily from visualization methods for their seminal innovations: from strange attractors, to bifurcation diagrams, to cobweb plots, to phase diagrams and embedding. Although the social sciences are increasingly studying these types of systems, seminal concepts remain murky or loosely adopted. This article has three aims. First, it argues for several visualization methods to critically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. Second, it uses these visualizations to introduce the foundations of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity and the limits of prediction.

While Honolulu has supportive density and topography for rail transit, questions remain about its ability to effectively integrate urban design and accessibility across the system. Every transit trip begins and ends with a walking trip from origins and to destinations: transportation planning must account for pedestrian safety, comfort, and access. Ildefons Cerdà’s 19th century utopian plan for Barcelona’s Eixample district produced a renowned, livable urban form. The Eixample, with its well-integrated rail transit, serves as a model of urban design, land use, transportation planning, and pedestrian-scaled streets working in synergy to produce accessibility. This study discusses the urban form of Honolulu and the history and planning of its new rail transit system. Then it reviews the history of Cerdà’s plan for the Eixample and discusses its urban form and performance today. Finally it draws several lessons from Barcelona’s urban design, accessibility, and rail transit planning and critically discusses their applicability to policy and design in Honolulu. This discussion is situated within wider debates around livable cities and social justice as it contributes several form and design lessons to the livability and accessibility literature while identifying potential concerns with privatization and displacement.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|barcelona|cerda|eixample|hawaii|honolulu|land use|livability|public transit|rail|social justice|spain|transportation|urban design|urban form|urban planning,2018-07-02T10:51:43.591113,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-24T16:52:52.583000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/citation/,mzsb2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hxeas/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/relationships/node/,hxeas,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d54e5cb83f6900495455ab/,58d54e5cb83f6900495455ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsb2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mzsb2/,https://doi.org/10.17418/planext.2016.3vol.02,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mzsb2

Temescal could not achieve LEED-ND certification due to technical disqualifications yet residents of the neighborhood rated its livability very highly.

However, its dynamics are complex and often difficult to understand. This paper presents an agent-based model of urban settlement, agglomeration, displacement, and sprawl. New settlements form around a spatial amenity that draws initial, poor settlers to subsist on the resource. As the settlement grows, subsequent settlers of varying income, skills, and interests are heterogeneously drawn to either the original amenity or to the emerging human agglomeration. As this agglomeration grows and densifies, land values increase, and the initial poor settlers are displaced from the spatial amenity on which they relied. Through path dependence, high-income residents remain clustered around this original amenity for which they have no direct use or interest. This toy model explores these dynamics, demonstrating a simplified mechanism of how urban displacement and gentrification can be sensitive to income inequality, density, and varied preferences for different types of amenities.",TRUE,FALSE,ABM|agent-based model|agglomeration|complexity|complex systems|displacement|economic development|emergence|gentrification|housing|inequality|land use|modeling|self-organization|simulation|social justice|urban planning|urban sprawl|zoning,2018-07-02T10:51:42.853255,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-23T21:07:07.289000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/citation/,mkq7d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wkarz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/relationships/node/,wkarz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d43848b83f690209be9ca6/,58d43848b83f690209be9ca6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mkq7d/,https://doi.org/10.3390/urbansci2030076,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mkq7d

The theory proposes that certain large systems are characterized by the nonlinear, dynamic interactions of their many constituent parts. These systems then behave in novel and unpredictable ways—ways that cannot be divined by examining the components of the system. Complexity theory problematizes traditional reductionist, linear methods of scientifically analyzing and predicting cities. It also opens up a new world of scholarship to researchers keen to formulate new kinds of sciences that take complexity into account. These attempts usually follow Kuhn’s theory of paradigm shifts: new evidence and modes of thinking undermine an established science, and a new science emerges to replace it.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|chaos|cities|complexity|complex systems|fractals|modeling|network analysis|networks|nonlinear|simulation|street networks|urban design|urban form|urban planning,2018-07-02T10:51:43.526504,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-23T21:01:52.216000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/citation/,mxngm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wf4nh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/relationships/node/,wf4nh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d4374d6c613b0206758ab9/,58d4374d6c613b0206758ab9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxngm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mxngm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mxngm

Inmate groups enforce property rights, regulate illicit markets, and promote cooperation when the state is unable or unwilling to act. Prison gangs are relatively new to the United States, and are best understood as unintended consequences of recent shifts in inmate demographics and the gradual erosion of the convict code.

However, we do not know the extent to which these strategies impact change at the neighborhood scale across the U.S. In this chapter, we examine the relationship between the growth and locations of craft breweries and the incidence of neighborhood change. We rely on a unique data set of geocoded brewery locations that tracks openings and closings from 2004 to the present. Using measures of neighborhood change often found in the gentrification literature, we develop statistical models of census tract demographic and employment data to determine the extent to which brewery locations are associated with social and demographic shifts since 2000. The strongest predictor of whether a craft brewery opened in 2013 or later in a neighborhood was the presence of a prior brewery. We do not find evidence entirely consistent with the common narrative of a link between gentrification and craft brewing, but we do find a link between an influx of lower-to-middle income urban creatives and the introduction of a craft brewery. We advocate for urban planners to recognize the importance of craft breweries in neighborhood revitalization while also protecting residents from potential displacement.",TRUE,FALSE,beer|brewing|displacement|economic development|gentrification|land use|neighborhood|revitalization|urban economics|urban planning|zoning,2018-07-02T10:53:44.604753,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-23T17:55:31.112000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/citation/,v88hh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8ddgv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/relationships/node/,8ddgv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d40b4b6c613b02067589fb/,58d40b4b6c613b02067589fb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v88hh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v88hh/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v88hh
