Moreover, with the development and persistence of the economic and financial crisis within the EU, immigration has been linked to growing opposition and criticism towards the European Union. In a country in which Euroscepticism has historically been high compared to countries in continental Europe, EU immigration-related statements connected to EU free-border agreements became more widespread. For this reason, we expect immigration to be a prominent issue in the electoral campaign of the upcoming 2014 European Parliament elections in the media. By covering EU immigrants and EU immigration issues in a certain way, media tend to promote or restrain certain ideas of immigration, that might eventually affect public’s views. In fact, we know from previous studies that immigration, particularly in times of economic crisis, is a challenge for society that can be framed not only in positive or negative terms, but also in economic or cultural terms.
This study first considers the salience of coverage of EU immigrants and EU immigration issues in UK newspapers
in the three months preceding the EU elections of May 2014. It further explores whether news coverage of different newspapers is framed in terms of economic or cul-
tural terms. In addition, we mine information from social media to discover how the immigration debate is framed by politically engaged members of the public on these platforms.",TRUE,FALSE,immigration|media|migration|text mining|topic modeling,2020-02-13T18:20:02.299971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-13T18:19:45.289805,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/citation/,e39g5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h5scb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/relationships/node/,h5scb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e457e3e3e86a800a26e4ca5/,5e457e3e3e86a800a26e4ca5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e39g5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e39g5

To answer this question, we construct a new database containing the number of conditions applied to over 500 IMF loans since 1970 and analyze how the distance from a borrowing country to its closet communist neighbor affected the IMF conditionality. We show that the fund imposed fewer conditions on loans to countries geographically closer to the communist bloc. Results are stronger when neighboring communist countries were not part of the Warsaw Pact. This pattern persisted during the 1990s, when the fund helped former communist countries in their transition to market economies.

In a highly competitive global economy, employee diversity offers a proven route for innovation and organizational performance. While it is generally accepted that the gender should be no barrier on equal pay for work requiring equal skills, efforts, responsibilities, and working conditions, women are still under-represented at all levels of the companies around the world. Furthermore, unequal pay for equal job implemented by both qualified men and women results in gender discrimination in the career development of women in the labor market. Gender discrimination holds capable women from further personal growth and contribution to economic development. This problem particularly revals itself in the banking and financial sector. This study examines the impact of the Great Recession on the gender wage gap. Using the U.S. Census American Community Survey microdata for bank employees from 2001 to 2017, the study will analyze the changes in the pay gap between male and female employees in the financial sector, before and after the Great Recession.",TRUE,FALSE,Banking Sector|Gender|Pay Gap|Recession,2020-02-13T18:08:41.949120,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-13T18:08:17.542797,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d05|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Women's Studies",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/citation/,hgzev,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e44a300d66221003599118a/,5e44a300d66221003599118a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hgzev/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hgzev

This study examines the emergence of the crack epidemic in the mid-1980s and city-to-suburb mobility between and within ethno-racial groups. Using the 1980 and 1990 IPUMS data, I compare the mean and dispersion of city-to-suburban mobility before and during the period of the crack epidemic in cities with high intensity of the epidemic relative to cities with low intensity. The results suggest that the crack epidemic increased black and Hispanic flight to the suburbs, but it did not increase white flight. Furthermore, the crack epidemic increased disparity in city-to-suburb mobility among blacks. I find that the source of this heterogeneity is middle-class black migrants who fled to the suburbs. Supporting evidence is consistent with the idea that the crack epidemic changed the location of business establishments from the inner-city to the suburbs, which results in greater economic returns to city-to-suburb migration among selective demographic groups who were heavily affected by the crack epidemic but had resources to migrate. Given the historically lower rates of suburbanization among blacks and Hispanics, the results suggest that the crack epidemic decreased suburbanization inequality between minorities and whites but increased suburbanization inequality among blacks.",TRUE,FALSE,between and within group inequality|city-to-suburb mobility|crack epidemic|quasi-experiment|residential attainment,2020-02-13T18:17:01.566386,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-13T18:16:31.479567,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/citation/,wkxqv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4461b7d66221000998f4ea/,5e4461b7d66221000998f4ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wkxqv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wkxqv

Second, as the hearing pivot becomes more extreme, dispositional majorities shrink and rulings are more polarized. When the median justice becomes more extreme without changing the hearing pivot, rulings become more extreme as the majority opinion shifts. Yet, the set of cases heard changes very little.

Throughout the past two decades, the United States has experienced consistent growth in the number of multigenerational households, seemingly correlated with cultural and economic changes across the country. According to one Census report, more than 4.3 million households, or roughly 5.6\% of all households in the United States, are multigenerational. Surprisingly, the political behavior of such a significant demographic subgroup has yet to be analyzed in any meaningful way. It is unknown if and how such households differ from traditional households with regard to political participation and engagement. Using data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series Current Population Survey (IPUMS-CPS) Voter Supplement for years 2000-2016 and Civic Engagement Supplement for the years of 2008-2011 and 2013, I am able to identify the individuals living in multigenerational households and assess their propensity to engage in a variety of political acts. Across a multitude of regression models and specifications of participation, I show that those living in multigenerational households participate at a significantly lower rate than those living in traditional households controlling for key demographics variables that have previously been shown to influence participation. Additionally, the panel structure of the IPUMS-CPS microdata creates the unique opportunity for a conditional differences-in-differences analysis with matching, so those who were not living in a multigenerational household at time $t$ but were in time $t+1$ can be compared to similar individuals who don't live in such a household in either time period. Those living in multigenerational households vote at a lower rate in presidential, midterm, and local elections, and are also less likely to engage in other forms of political engagement such as talking to family about politics, contacting an elected official, and being a part of organizations.",TRUE,FALSE,CPS|IPUMS|multigenerational|political participation|voting,2020-02-11T17:45:41.517390,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:45:21.384753,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,Mark Hill,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/citation/,2nsbh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e42d0b5a057ec006ab08d11/,5e42d0b5a057ec006ab08d11,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2nsbh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2nsbh
