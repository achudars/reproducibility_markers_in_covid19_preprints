It is a key element in almost every commercial transaction over time and might be one of the main explanations of economic success and development. In Europe, the determinants of (generalized) trust have been investigated in the past. Most scholars have focused on aggregate (national) levels of trust. However, it can be assumed that driving forces, which foster or diminish trust, act at a sub-national level. Regional clusters remain undetected. With the use of the European Social Survey 6 and modern spatial diagnostics, this work examines the individual and regional determinants of trust in 88 European NUTS1 regions in 26 countries. There are two main findings. First, wealth, linguistic fragmentation, and religious ideologies shape trust on a regional level, education, income, and membership in associations foster trust on an individual level. Secondly, the study unravels regional dispersions in different types of ""trust regimes"" in Europe. Regional clusters of generalized trust are confirmed by spatial diagnostics.

Rather, powerful actors in these institutions determine the worthiness of candidates by evaluating whether those candidates engage in the work and social life of the institution. Those evaluations are shaped by race and social class distinctions, and perceptions of engagement are important for the candidate’s future successes.

The apparent lack of literature regarding the Aetas’ view on Usog and the health implications of this phenomenon prompted the researchers to explore the concept of Usog among the Aetas of Nabuclod, Pampanga. In this qualitative study, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data from the respondents. Purposive sampling was used in the selection of subjects and informed consent was sought. Following the individual interviews with five different Aeta families, thematic analysis was done so as to identify the common emerging concept of Usog. It was found that the Aetas of Nabuclod see Usog as a transmittable mystical force primarily inflicted by humans and not by spirits. This force is said to be transferred unintentionally through eye or physical contact. Similarly, this usually affects infants, with crying fits as the most common symptom. The Aetas’ primary treatment for Usog was the use of Amyong as incense or decoction. The saliva of the inflictor of Usog, when applied on the abdomen or forehead of the afflicted infant was also seen as an effective remedy. The Aetas of Nabuclod, Pampanga see Usog as a transmittable mystical force unintentionally inflicted by humans through eye or physical contact, thereby producing physical symptoms among its victims.

An Empirical Investigation on Europe's Regional Social Capital,"Aiming to explain the European divide with respect to social and political values, scholars in the past have relied on a simplified four- (or even two-) dimensional regime model which tranches the continent according to the social capacities of its inhabitants. This ""cartography"" of ""Social Europe"" proves to be outdated by the results presented in this study which re-measures the social capital landscape in Europe. In this work, we apply a factor analysis model to the most commonly used approximations of social capital on the European Social Survey.
In addition, we explore, as a novelty in social capital literature, a classification tree to model generalized trust. The analysis shows that three distinct dimensions of social capital measures are important in Europe: additionally to generalised social capital, which is usually approximated by generalised trust, there is one dimension of civic engagement and one of communitarian values. This distinction leads to a new social landscape of Europe, which highlights the relevance of considering regional and cross-border clusters in all relevant social capital dimensions.The results of the non-parametric model reveal that Protestantism and education are good benchmarks to classify trust on an individual level. Based on these findings we argue for the necessity of policies with a regional focus that take the different sub-national structures of social capacity in Europe into account.

This is much higher than the 6.4% of women and 3.6% of men aged 15-45 who self-identify as LGB.

Maximum lifespans and the equality of lifespans are also considered.  
Methods: Demographic data on age-specific mortality are used to estimate life expectancy. Validated data on exceptional lifespans are used to study the maximum length of life. Findings of the most significant publications are critically summarized.
Results: In the countries doing best, life expectancy started to increase around 1840 at a pace of almost 2.5 years per decade. This trend has continued until the present. Contrary to classical evolutionary theories of senescence and contrary to the predictions of many experts, the frontier of survival is advancing to higher ages. Furthermore, lifespans are becoming more equal, with octogenarians and nonagenarians accounting for most deaths in countries with high life expectancy. Extrapolation of the trend indicates that most children born this millennium will celebrate their 100th birthdays. Considerable uncertainty, however, clouds forecasts of life expectancy and maximum lifespans: life expectancy and maximum lifespan might increase very little if at all or longevity might rise much faster than in the past. 
Conclusions: Substantial progress has been made over the past three decades in deepening understanding of how long humans have lived and have long they might live. The social, economic, health, cultural and political consequences of further increases in longevity are so significant that the development of more powerful methods of forecasting is a priority.",TRUE,FALSE,Forecasts|Life expectancy|Lifespan equality|Maximum lifespan|Mortality,2019-08-25T02:49:02.950521,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-25T02:48:34.992966,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/citation/,gdjtv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d614adc8f8fe50016156d7d/,5d614adc8f8fe50016156d7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjtv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gdjtv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gdjtv,NA
