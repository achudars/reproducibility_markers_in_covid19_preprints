The results indicate that high creative intensity of work is a strong predictor of an R&amp;D employee being satisfied with flexible rather than fixed working schedules. Women and employees with less creative and more administrative tasks perceive more constraints on the timing of their work due to jealousy of colleagues and they are more likely to feel that their creativity is adversely affected by their working time arrangements. Employees with flexibility in both the timing and place of doing their work are significantly less likely to perceive working time related constraints on their creativity or jealousy of their colleagues as a restraint on their working time choices than are those with a fixed working time and place. The higher the salary level of the employee, the more likely they are to feel that the nature of their work constrains their working time choices.

Blood donor populations have been susceptible to change, often showing a trend towards feminization while remaining ethnically homogeneous, leading to an underrepresentation of young men and ethnic minorities. The aim of our study was to examine whether recruitment strategies are related to donor diversity and loyalty of specific demographic groups in the Netherlands. 

Materials and methods. Analyses were conducted using the Dutch blood donor database on whole-blood donors registered between 2013 and 2017 (n = 155,054). Chi-square tests were used to study relationships between donor characteristics (i.e., sex, age, and Duffy-negative antigen as proxy for donors from African descent) and recruitment strategies; linear and Cox regressions were used to study relationships between recruitment strategies, and number of donations and length of the donor career, respectively. 

Results. Most donors were recruited via other donors (44.6%) or became donor on their own initiative (28.4%). Young men were often recruited by other donors and Duffy-negative donors were often recruited via missing minorities campaigns. Donor-recruits-donor was associated with the highest number of donations; telephone recruitment was associated with the lowest number of donations. Although telephone recruitment was associated with the longest donor careers, it also showed the largest proportional stopping prevalence. Student recruitment and missing minorities campaigns were associated with the shortest donor careers. 

Conclusions. Our results showed proportional differences in how people from different sex, age and ethnicity are recruited, and how recruitment relates to donor loyalty. We advocate for more personalized, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies.",TRUE,FALSE,blood donation|diversity|donor recruitment|donor retention|ethnic minorities|loyalty|recruitment strategies,2018-09-12T13:14:41.889512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-12T13:14:22.664489,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/citation/,sahmr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b990647715bea0015511d32/,5b990647715bea0015511d32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sahmr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sahmr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sahmr,NA

This article focuses upon the legal defence of Australia before the WTO Panel. A key part of its defence has been the strong empirical evidence for the efficacy of plain packaging of tobacco products as a legitimate health measure designed to combat the global tobacco epidemic. Australia has provided a convincing case that plain packaging of tobacco products is compatible with the TRIPS Agreement 1994 – particularly the clauses relating to the aims and objectives of the agreement; the requirements in respect of trade mark law; and the parallel measures in relation to access to essential medicines. Australia has also defended the consistency of plain packaging of tobacco products with the TBT Agreement 1994. Moreover, Australia has provided clear reasons for why the plain packaging of tobacco products is compatible with GATT. The position of Australia has been reinforced by a number of third parties – such as New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Canada, and others - which have also been pioneers in tobacco control and public health.

Consensus on what identity is and what it does in relation to foreign policy does not exist and is unlikely to be ever forged. Some scholars investigate state identity—how it informs and shapes foreign policy processes while simultaneously being informed and shaped by international structures. Others use the concept of identification to examine what foreign policy means for the constitution of modern political subjectivities. Still others seek to bring together constructivist identity scholarship together with more established approaches in Foreign Policy Analysis. This article considers the contextual emergence and evolution of the “identity and foreign policy” scholarship in its many different and differing streams.

To flesh out our understanding of how heterogeneous educational gradients in health manifest across racial subpopulations in the U.S., I examine how income---a crucial, salubrious resource that is returned by education and experienced differently by race---mediates the relationship between college attainment and health status among Blacks and Whites. To this end, I describe how the association among college completion and health status would manifest among these racial groups if income were factored out of the education-health generative process. I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 7,222) and sequential g-estimation for this investigation. Results suggest that income plays a proportionally larger role in mediating the association among college completion and health status for Blacks and, as such, that racial differences in health-returns to college persist after controlling for income. Differences in how income behaves as a mechanism across racial populations hint that race(-ism) plays a dynamic role in structuring the underlying education-health generative process.",TRUE,FALSE,education|health disparities|population health|race|sequential g-estimation,2018-09-11T19:58:02.202744,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-11T15:38:04.618230,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Michael H.

Employing the concept of social dilemmas, this commentary describes analytically why scientists ¬in academia’s current incentive system work against their self-interest if they prioritize research credibility. Empirically, this article conducts a comprehensive review of meta-scientific research with a focus on quantitative political science, demonstrating that threats to the credibility of political science findings are systematic and real. Building on a framework to assess the credibility of scientific literatures, the review shows that a large fraction of the published literature makes itself inaccessible to intersubjective credibility assessments, fails tests of analytical robustness, or shows patterns of systematic deviation from true population estimates. Yet, the review also highlights the notable progress the discipline has made in recent years to secure research credibility. This commentary urges further steps toward the direction of research openness credibility. Specifically, it proposes specific institutional measures to better align individual researcher rationality with the collective good of verifiable, robust, and valid scientific results, such as dedicated verification procedures and the implementation of pre-registration and result-blind peer reviewing.",TRUE,FALSE,credibility|DA-RT|meta-science|open science|open social science|popper|publication bias|replicability|replication|reproducibility|robustness|transparency,2018-09-11T01:58:42.053801,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-11T01:58:22.956132,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/citation/,dq87w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e85s4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/relationships/node/,e85s4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b962fa7a58a18001d7a40c7/,5b962fa7a58a18001d7a40c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dq87w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dq87w,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11615-018-0131-7

Drawing inspiration from biology, we develop a metric called ""genotype"" by defining a series of indicators called attractors and detractors that form a category space or ""species"" for every user. These species are based on four main styles of music: latin, urban, rock and pop; the indicators assign weights to the genres based on the sociological subjective perspective of music fans from one category in relation to other music styles, i.e., how they view other types of music they don't feel affinity with. The result is a segmentation of users that finds application in the making of offers and promotions, which can in turn be coupled with association rules and market basket analysis to improve direct marketing campaigns (CTR) and maximize revenue.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-09-11T01:41:20.795086,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-11T01:41:09.328544,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/citation/,gvjfr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x4hgz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/relationships/node/,x4hgz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b96210e2c77f700177f223c/,5b96210e2c77f700177f223c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvjfr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gvjfr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gvjfr,NA

This division of Sociology into different subfields is to a large extent related to methodology and choices between qualitative or quantitative research methods. Relying on theoretical constructs of the academic prestige economy, boundary demarcation, and taste for research, we examine the methodological divide in generalist Sociology journals. Using automated text analysis for 8,737 abstracts of papers published between 1995 and 2017, we discover evidence of this divide, but also of an entanglement between methodological choices and different research topics. Moreover, our results suggest a marginally increasing time trend for the publication of quantitative research in generalist journals. We discuss how this consolidation of methodological practices could enforce the entrenchment of different schools of thought, which ultimately reduces the potential for innovative and effective sociological research.",TRUE,FALSE,research methodology|scientometrics|sociology of science|symbolic boundaries,2018-09-09T17:44:01.631987,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-09T17:43:37.776703,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/citation/,s59bp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/234wu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/relationships/node/,234wu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b95320ca58a18001a7b10ba/,5b95320ca58a18001a7b10ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s59bp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s59bp,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038519853146
