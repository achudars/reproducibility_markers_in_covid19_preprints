Ethnic groups are universal and unique to human societies. Such groups sometimes have norms of behavior that are adaptively linked to their social and ecological circumstances, and ethnic boundaries may function to protect that variation from erosion by inter-ethnic interaction. However, such interaction is often frequent and voluntary, suggesting that individuals may be able to strategically reduce its costs, allowing adaptive cultural variation to persist in spite of interaction with out-groups with different norms. We examine five mechanisms influencing the dynamics of ethnically-distinct cultural norms, each focused on strategic individual-level choices in inter-ethnic interaction: bargaining, interaction frequency-biased norm adoption, assortment on norms, success-biased inter-ethnic social learning, and childhood socialization. We use Bayesian item response models to analyze patterns of norm variation and inter-ethnic interaction in an ethnically-structured Amazonian population. We show that, among indigenous Matsigenka, inter-ethnic education with colonial Mestizos is more strongly associated with Mestizo-typical norms than is even extensive inter-ethnic experience in commerce and wage labor. Using ethnographic observations, we show that all five of the proposed mechanisms of norm adoption may contribute to this effect. However, of these mechanisms, we argue that changes in relative bargaining power are particularly important for ethnic minorities wishing to preserve distinctive norms while engaging in inter-ethnic interaction in domains such as education. If this mechanism proves applicable in a range of other ethnographic contexts, it would constitute one cogent explanation for when and why ethnically-structured cultural variation can either persist or erode given frequent, and often mutually beneficial, inter-ethnic interaction.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonia|Cultural evolution|Education|Ethnic boundaries|Indigenous peoples|Norms,2018-07-02T11:01:24.670982,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-22T11:56:52.442759,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d66|Education|Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/citation/,62kd9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7q4e5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/relationships/node/,7q4e5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/594bae15594d9000458188c9/,594bae15594d9000458188c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/62kd9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/62kd9,NA

While the admissions policies of elite institutions get the most political, scholarly, and media attention, little is known about the use of affirmative action in admissions across the broader field of selective higher education. Based on analysis of longitudinal panel data of almost 1,000 selective status colleges and universities, we find a dramatic shift in stated organizational policy starting in the mid-1990s. In 1994, 60% of institutions publicly declared that they considered race in undergraduate admissions; by 2014, just 35% did. Yet there is substantial variation depending on schools’ status (competitiveness) and sector (public or private). Notably, race-conscious admissions remain the stated organizational policy of almost all of the most elite public and private institutions. The retreat from race-conscious admissions occurs largely among schools relatively lower in the status hierarchy: very competitive public institutions and competitive public and private institutions. These patterns are not explained by the implementation of state-level bans. The findings suggest that both the diversity imperative and the diffuse impact of the anti-affirmative action movement are not consistent across strata of American higher education.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:01:24.570735,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-21T22:17:25.975307,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/citation/,gdjp6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2cruk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/relationships/node/,2cruk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/594aeffdb83f69022d270dbd/,594aeffdb83f69022d270dbd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdjp6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gdjp6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gdjp6,https://doi.org/10.15195/v4.a18

In critical security studies, the concept’s purview has become increasingly limited by an abiding theoretical and analytical focus on various practices of securitisation. We argue that there is a need to clarify the logic and stakes of different forms of militarism. Critical security scholars have provided valuable insights into the conditions of ‘exceptionalist militarism.’ However, if we accept that militarism and the production of security are co-constitutive, then we have every reason to consider different manifestations of militarism, their historical trajectories and their inter-relationships. To that end, we draw on the work of historical sociologists and articulate three more ideal types of militarism: nation-state militarism, civil society militarism, and neoliberal militarism. We suggest this typology can more adequately capture key transformations of militarism in the modern period as well as inform further research on the militarism-security nexus.",TRUE,FALSE,civil society militarism|Critical Security Studies|Exceptionalist militarism|Liberal Militarism|Martin Shaw|Michael Mann|Militarism|Nation-statist militarism|Security,2018-07-02T11:01:24.204115,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-21T12:59:52.450669,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Srdjan Vucetic,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/citation/,ezdqr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/desym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/relationships/node/,desym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/594a6cc66c613b022873c568/,594a6cc66c613b022873c568,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ezdqr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ezdqr,NA

The estimation of this work was the origin of a falsified chart on women's age-fertility profile that was featured in a high school health education material published in 2015 by the government of Japan. The author searched citation databases and collected 23 works citing the study. A review of the 23 works showed that biases and unreliability of the Bendel-Hua estimation had been pointed repeatedly.

This American aversion to consumption taxes has commonly been attributed to the embrace of a strongly progressive income tax, perfected during World War I. A comparison of tax revenues across all levels of government, however, shows that the United States had much lower levels of consumption taxes (compared to GDP and to total taxes) than Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as far back as 1902, even before the introduction of the income tax here. At the same time, American ability-to-pay taxes (including income and profit taxes, estate and inheritance duties, and corporate license and franchise fees) remained at the low end of the Anglo-world range until World War II. The most striking difference, though, is that local taxes (essentially equivalent to property taxes) were much higher here, taking around 50% or more of total American taxes until the Great Depression but accounting for only about 40% of total taxes in Canada and roughly 15% to 25% in the other three countries. In other words, American consumption taxes (raised by state and federal governments) were so low in the first third of the 20th century not because of the income tax, but because the American state was unusually reliant on local funding. It is only with the wide-spread property tax revolts of the early 1930s, together with the growth of the federal warfare state during the 1940s, that ability-to-pay taxes came to dominate the American tax system.",TRUE,FALSE,Comparative tax systems|Consumption taxes|Fiscal federalism|Income taxes|Property taxes,2018-07-02T11:01:23.549454,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-20T15:41:10.557368,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c19|Law|Taxation-Federal|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c65|Law|Taxation-State and Local|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/citation/,f4akh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vbxaw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/relationships/node/,vbxaw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59493f5c6c613b022a736de3/,59493f5c6c613b022a736de3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f4akh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f4akh,NA
