However, whether teachers adopt or reject technology in their teaching depends primarily on the way they perceive it. Consequently, the current paper intends to capture the various perceptions of English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers from the department of English at Chadli Bendjedid University, El Tarf (Algeria) towards the use and the integration of technology in their teaching practices. It also aspires to answer the question: to what extent is technology used in their teaching? In order to collect data for this study; a questionnaire was administered to ten teachers from the above-cited department. Although the findings revealed that all the participants have a positive attitude towards technology; they all face different barriers that impede them from integrating it.",TRUE,FALSE,Level of technology usage|problems of integration|teachers’ perceptions and attitudes,2018-07-02T11:03:34.193684,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T03:29:25.534277,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/citation/,kzq5s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6at8z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/relationships/node/,6at8z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972c60ab83f69022a30390d/,5972c60ab83f69022a30390d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzq5s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kzq5s/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kzq5s

There is a more or less agreement on what happens to teaching and learning processes in high and low power distance (PD) classrooms. However, there are some findings suggesting thesimultaneous existence of both individualism and collectivism (e.g. North Vietnam). In that case, individualism and collectivism have separate identities, rather than being mutually exclusive parts of a single dimension. There are some works in which Hofstede’s(1983, 1986) cultural dimensions could not explain observed differences in thelearning environment.  There are possibilities of learning-specific new sets of cultural dimensions in classrooms due to the attitudinal changes of students compared to the average culture of the general population.  In many works, a variety of approaches has been suggested for the teacher either to adapt to the culture of the classroom or to use methods of low PD and individualistic methods in high PD-collectivist classrooms in a cautious manner. Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) seems an effective alternative to Grammar-Translation Method (GTM). Contradictory findings have been reported on Japanese classrooms. In one, the students desire to study independently, which the high PD and the collectivist culture of Japan does not allow. Two, for the Japanese learners, group working is more effective due to the collectivist culture. The contradictions involved in the two contentions need to be resolved through more research.",TRUE,FALSE,classroom environment|EFL|English language learning|individualism-collectivism|power distance,2018-07-02T11:03:34.155577,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T03:25:59.589623,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/citation/,bphjm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k4mxr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/relationships/node/,k4mxr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972c51bb83f690228300a6e/,5972c51bb83f690228300a6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bphjm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bphjm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bphjm

It covers several aspects such as how interpersonal relationships relate to complimenting behaviour. In addition, it examines how the culture of complimenting is relevant with some conditions such as power relation, and gender. The significance of the study is to explore the cultural transfer might appearing in complimenting. The subjects of research in this study are EFL learners at State Islamic University of Maulana Malik Ibrahim, Indonesia. It employs ethnographical method to gain the explanation for the phenomenon underlying the complexities in complimenting behaviour. The complexities concern with the interference of culture, the influence of gender and power relation. The finding shows that female learners tend to use more complimenting strategies compared to males. The complimenting expression is also various affected by the relation with the hearers. Some variations occurring in complimenting cover overstatement, mixed language, non-sensical, no compliment and question. The context of Islamic institution also results in specific expression related to power display in complimenting strategies used. However, in EFL context, complimenting becomes an issue as there is lack of authentic English examples in course books and the inefficient instructions English learners receive which particularly expose them to variation in English compliments. Therefore, further studies are needed to develop teaching construct that accommodates the improvement of pragmatic competence particularly in complimenting for politeness awareness which today becomes a significant value.",TRUE,FALSE,complimenting behaviour|Indonesian EFL learners,2018-07-02T11:03:34.120846,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T03:22:05.119057,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/citation/,vhbez,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hbfjg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/relationships/node/,hbfjg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972c435b83f69022b3005e7/,5972c435b83f69022b3005e7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vhbez/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhbez

It further attempts to identify the effectiveness of certain patterns and tools of e-learning in student performance, using both descriptive and experimental approaches. To achieve these goals, researchers use a scale to measure the awareness of e-learning that includes twenty-five multiple choice questions and an evaluation card on e-learning applications in English. The study sample consists of sixty male and female students at the university. There are two primary outcomes. First, the degree of student awareness of English language e-learning is found to be relatively weak, with statistically significant differences in awareness among male and female students in favor of females. There are further statistically significant differences between students’ average scores before and after the development of an e-learning awareness program in favor of post application.

Dispersal of authority and activity away from national confines has spawned new transnational modes of organisation and competition amongst professionals. Studies of transnational professional competition explore how professionals broker normative, institutional and political change through these struggles in spaces ‘beyond the state’. This paper reviews existing work on transnational professional competition, focusing on two dominant streams: studies associated with Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory and studies associated with Andrew Abbott’s ecological theory. It discusses the key theoretical dynamics and empirical focus of each stream. Furthermore, the paper reviews the ongoing debate between the two streams, drawing out proposals for mutual learning at the intersection of field and ecology studies. It is argued that such a closer exchange has potential to address points of contention and exploit points of convergence, enhancing understanding of specifically transnational professional relations, institutional change, social contexts and social structures.",TRUE,FALSE,Competition|Ecology|Elites|Field|Power|Professionals|Transnational,2018-07-02T11:03:31.456737,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-19T12:51:40.657272,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/citation/,euqr3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mcuv7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/relationships/node/,mcuv7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596f554d594d90022b6c52b3/,596f554d594d90022b6c52b3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euqr3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/euqr3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/euqr3

Often dubbed the “baby Nobel Prize,” widely discussed by economists and covered in the press, it has become a professional and public marker of excellence for economic research.

Yet, after three initial unanimous choices of laureates (Paul Samuelson, Kenneth Boulding, Milton Friedman), the award was increasingly challenged. The prize was not awarded in 1953, almost discontinued three times, the selection procedure and the age limit also created issues. We show how economists in these years disagreed over the definition of merit and excellence. Many young economists felt the prize was biased toward theory and asked for the establishment of a separate “Wesley Clair Mitchell award” for empirical and policy-oriented work. We examine how the committee on honors and awards reacted to critique on the lack of diversity of laureates in origins, affiliations, fields and methods, and we provide a quantitative analysis of the evolving profile of laureates.",TRUE,FALSE,Economics|History of Economics|John Bates Clark Medal|Sociology of Economics,2018-07-02T11:03:31.332517,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-18T22:08:41.088010,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/citation/,bacmj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/my76e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/relationships/node/,my76e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596e84a49ad5a10045866843/,596e84a49ad5a10045866843,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bacmj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bacmj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bacmj

Inequality, Religion, and Political Ideology in the United States","This study considers the assertion that religion is the opiate of the masses. Using a special module of the General Social Survey, I first demonstrate that religion functions as a compensatory resource for structurally-disadvantaged groups—women, racial minorities, those with lower incomes, and, to a lesser extent, sexual minorities. I then demonstrate that religion—operating as both compensatory resource and values-shaping schema—suppresses what would otherwise be larger group differences in political ideology. This study provides empirical support for the general “opiate” claim that religion is the “sigh of the oppressed creature” and suppressor of emancipatory political values. I expand and refine the theory, however, showing how religion provides (1) compensatory resources for lack of social, and not just economic, status, and (2) traditional-values-oriented schemas that, rather than just distracting people, shape their politics in accordance with the content of religious belief systems.",TRUE,FALSE,ASA17|Class|Ethnicity|Gender|Inequality|Marx|Politics|Public Opinion|Race|Religion|Sexuality|Well-being,2018-07-02T11:03:31.081402,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-18T14:03:45.056717,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/citation/,dnz2w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v7ydj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/relationships/node/,v7ydj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596e13bcb83f69022c442287/,596e13bcb83f69022c442287,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnz2w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dnz2w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dnz2w
