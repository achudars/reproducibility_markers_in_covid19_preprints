Manchester: Manchester University Press. [Pre-review version]

June 30, 2006 marked the release of An Inconvenient Truth (AIT), a climate
change documentary presented and written by leading US Democrat politician
Al Gore. The film has contributed to making climate change expertise public
through a heady combination of scientific data with personal stories and
calls for political action that offered a particular social representation
of climate change. In this chapter we discuss AIT as an example of taking
climate change expertise out of the pages of science journals and into the
public sphere. We draw on the ideas of John Dewey and their elucidation by
Mark Brown to show how the notion of expertise is key in understanding the
film’s motivation, successes and critics. While the purpose of the
documentary was to persuade its audience of the consensual truth imparted
by climate science experts, its effect was to become a lightning rod for
dissent, critique and debate of that expertise. Overall, AIT created a
dominant representation of climate change, based on expertise that became a
touchstone for consent and dissent, action and reaction.

In the following we shall first provide some background to the film’s
emergence, highlighting its echoes of Dewey’s argument that expert
knowledge should be integrated in society. We then use the concept of
social representation to show how Gore combined scientific content with
personal and political context in order to provide a meaningful
representation of climate change expertise. We then highlight how AIT
sought to create its own public for scientific expertise, returning climate
science expertise to society as one of the many tools with which citizens
make sense of the world and solve problems. We then show how the very
elements that helped AIT towards establishing a dominant social
representation of climate change also contributed to the creation of a
counter-representation and counterpublic that questioned how AIT
represented climate science expertise. With AIT’s success in bringing
social context to scientific content came inevitable contestation. We
conclude with some tentative lessons for science communicators from the AIT
story.

ties and behaviors like smoking, but the role of social isolates is poorly
understood. Some theories predict isolated adolescents are protected from
peer influence that increases smoking, while others suggest isolates are
more likely to initiate smoking because they lack social control provided
by peer friendships. Building on a growing literature that seeks to explain
these contradictions by moving beyond a homogeneous understanding of
isolation, we identify the relationships between smoking and three distinct
dimensions of isolation: avoided (adolescents who do not receive ties),
withdrawn (adolescents who do not send ties), and externally oriented
(adolescents who claim close out-of-grade friends). We examine the
coevolutionary effects of these dimensions and cigarette smoking using an
autoregressive latent trajectory model (ALT) with PROSPER Peers, a unique,
longitudinal networks dataset. These data include students (47% male and
86% White) from rural Iowa and Pennsylvania, ranging successively from
grades 6-12 in eight waves of data. As a robustness check, we use a
stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to compare to results from the ALT.
We find avoided isolation and external orientation are associated with
decreased successive smoking in high school, while smoking increases
subsequent isolation along all three dimensions, with particularly strong
effects on withdrawn isolation.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:09.061263,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-23T21:41:21.015000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/citation/,surjx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5nfx7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/relationships/node/,5nfx7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e5a185594d9001f391929e/,57e5a185594d9001f391929e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/surjx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/surjx,https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2017.9

cohorts from the NSFG 1995 and 2006-10, the current study finds that marriage rates among
cohabitors have declined steeply among those with no college degree, resulting in growing
educational disparities over time. Moreover, there are no differences in marital intentions by
education (or race-ethnicity) among recent cohabitors. We discuss how findings of this study

This study examined the association between presence of e-cigarette specialty retailers near schools and e-cigarette use among middle and high school students in Orange County (OC), CA.

Methods. The OC subsample of the 2013-2014 California Healthy Kids Survey (N=67,701) was combined with geocoded e-cigarette retailers to determine whether a retailer was present within one-quarter mile of each public school in OC. Multilevel logistic regression models evaluated individual-level and school-level e-cigarette use correlates among middle and high school students.

Results. Among middle school students, the presence of an e-cigarette retailer within one-quarter mile of their school predicted lifetime e-cigarette use (OR = 1.70, 95% CI=1.02, 2.83), controlling for confounders but no effect for current use. No significant effect was found for high school students.

African autocrats appropriated the global discursive form of democracy by
altering its content. These leaders proposed that the special circumstances
of each country preclude any one-size-fits-all global definition of
democracy, whose imposition in their countries, they claim, would be
inappropriate, ineffective, or dangerous. Through their speeches, these
rulers redefined democracy by engaging in active ideological work, weaving
together discourses that combined global norms, state interests, and local
values. This suggests that, in addition to being a benchmark by which to
measure modes of governance, “democracy” is also a language game played
between actors on a global stage. By synthesizing theoretical frameworks
drawn from world polity and social movement studies traditions, this study
shows that peripheral actors may adapt global discourses purposefully and
strategically rather than encountering them as passive participants in a
purely mimetic cultural diffusion process. This has implications for a wide

In both datasets, we find that those who will eventually achieve a higher level of education are already more likely to participate in voluntary associations before they have completed their educational career. This implies that the relationship between education and participation in voluntary associations is partly due to selection effects. However, both datasets also reveal that increases in education are associated with increases in voluntary associations memberships, suggesting causative effects of education. The Dutch data reveal no causative effect of education on volunteering if selection into membership is taken into account.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:47.013066,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-20T16:00:06.764000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/citation/,p92th,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r7xuf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/relationships/node/,r7xuf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e15d08b83f6901db1974da/,57e15d08b83f6901db1974da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p92th/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p92th/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p92th,NA
