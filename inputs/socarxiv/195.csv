economy. Such pandemic effects also influence human behaviour; issues of panic buying
(overbuying) and noncompliance with government orders and law among individuals are
evident. However, the underlying understanding of such behaviours due to the pandemic remains
unclear. Therefore, this perspective paper adopts the social dilemma theory and microeconomics
concepts to analyse and explain the effects of COVID-19 on social behavioural reactions. It
attempts to address the questions of what and why are the behaviours of individuals shown during
the coronavirus pandemic and showcase how the theory is associated with the current social
phenomena. Real scenarios based on media reporting from the sociodemographic context of
Malaysia, concerning the following issues; (i) competition over daily essentials; (ii) self-honesty
of individuals; and (iii) adherence to government policies and measures enforcement
(governance) were discussed. A conceptual framework was developed to illustrate
interrelationships between social dilemma concepts and the phenomena. In essence, due to fear,
uncertainty, and greed, self-interest and opportunistic (defective/unethical) behaviours of most
individuals prevailing over societal collective interest amid the pandemic have been prevalently
observed in the above instances, although a cooperative choice can eventually result in a better
outcome for everyone. Not only do these non-cooperative behaviours of individuals create
inconveniences, dissatisfactions, and other forms of negative externalities, they also incentivise
others to act selfishly, if no restrictions are imposed, which may eventually cause government
intervention failures. This paper demonstrates the relevancy of the social dilemmas theory in
better understanding fundamental human behavioural reactions amid the health crisis and the
importance of incorporating the findings into government policymaking. These
sociopsychological considerations help the government formulate holistic measures, namely
stringent sanctions and monitoring enforcement, as well as incentivising cooperative and
compliant behaviours of the public, which then contribute to curbing the COVID-19 pandemic
more effectively.",TRUE,FALSE,effects of covd-19|Malaysia|Pandemic|Self-interest and opportunism|Social behaviours|Social Dilemma,2020-05-21T03:04:25.425670,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-21T03:03:54.517151,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/citation/,8duvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec56636c7d4ab00ea21bf26/,5ec56636c7d4ab00ea21bf26,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8duvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8duvx

We consider three types of inequalities at municipality-level: 1) economic development, i.e., unemployment rate, average income, immigrants proportion, and the prevalence of small residence; 2) health vulnerability, i.e., crude death rate and the proportion of elderly (aged 65 +) population; and 3) information communication, i.e., the proportion of people with tertiary education. In addition to the static analysis with the total sum of COVID-19 cases, the dynamic analysis with daily moving weekly sum of cases is conducted. The result draws a rather complex picture of relationships between contextual socioeconomic inequalities and the spread of COVID-19. Many indicators of economic inequalities imply the opposite relationship as intuitively suggested: economically disadvantaged municipalities tend to have less cases of confirmed infection than economically advantaged counterparts. The implications from health inequality indicators show mixed patterns: crude death rate is positively associated, but elderly population is negatively associated, with the number of confirmed cases. The indicator of information inequality shows a consistent tendency, i.e., municipalities with more university educated have less confirmed cases, but this tendency transforms across time: the negative association is particularly strong during the first month of Spanish “state of alarm” measure (mid-March to mid-April).

The observer can be involved as the correlative counterpart of the totality: An observer opposed to the totality externalizes an internal part outside. Thus the phenomena of an observer and the totality turn out to converge to each other or to be one and the same. In other words, the phenomenon of an observer includes the singularity of the solipsistic Self, which (or “who”) is the same as that of the totality. Furthermore, observation can be thought as that primary and initial action underlain by the phenomenon of an observer. That action of observation consists in the externalization of the solipsistic Self outside as some external reality. It is both a zero action and the singularity of the phenomenon of action. The main conclusions are: Mamardashvili’s philosophy can be thought both as the suffering effort to be a human being again and again as well as the philosophical reflection on the genesis of thought from itself by the same effort.

A substantial literature has documented the individual-level demographic, social, and political characteristics that are associated with the extent to which individuals favor government intervention to reduce inequality. However, less work has examined how the local social environments that individuals are embedded in shape attitudes regarding inequality remediation. Using data from the General Social Survey (2006-2012) and other data sources, we examine whether local economic and social characteristics are associated with individuals’ support for government intervention to address income inequality in the U.S. Specifically, we link restricted General Social Survey data with place-level identifiers to county-level data on local income inequality, racial segregation, and partisan leanings. Broadly, we find that while national and individual-level conditions are strongly correlated with perceptions about inequality remediation, most local-level characteristics were not strongly nor significantly associated with individual attitudes regarding government intervention to address inequality. These findings tend to suggest that individuals formulate policy stances regarding inequality based on national messaging, rather than on observations within their own communities.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudinal research|contextual effects|inequality|redistribution,2020-05-19T14:34:06.250750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-19T14:02:30.272625,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/citation/,tc28g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wuas7/,wuas7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec3e524edc58c00650a9b4d/,5ec3e524edc58c00650a9b4d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc28g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tc28g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tc28g

(2019)’s dataset. The key negative determinants of the bottom 50 percent are government consumption, trade openness and unemployment rate. The stable middle 40 percent is explained by the positive effects of government consumption, financial liberalisation and public indebtedness that compensate for the adverse effects of trade openness. Further, we find that government consumption, trade openness, and unemployment rate are positive determinants of the top 10 percent. More strikingly, trade openness disproportionately benefits the top 10 percent and this suggests that even China’s pragmatic world integration has been partial to business elites. Several policy ideas follow. First, China must overhaul its middle class urban-biased fiscal expenditure and second, the pension system must extend to the entirety of its income distribution. Third, stronger social welfare is required in the context of globalisation.",TRUE,FALSE,China|Inequality|Inter-Decile Ratios|Middle Class|Top incomes,2020-05-19T14:44:47.920726,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-19T14:13:31.501877,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/citation/,8sz64,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec3dbebf3e87e004d579459/,5ec3dbebf3e87e004d579459,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sz64/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8sz64/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8sz64
