This expansion in scope has, for the most part, moved away from quantitative methods in favor of more in-depth ethnographic approaches, situating the optimal analysis of the LL within careful consideration of the context(s) in which a sign may occur and/or bring about as well as the fluidity of interpretation researchers must allow in their assessments of signs’ significance (Banda and Jimaima 2015; Jaworski and Thurlow 2010; Malinowski 2010; Kallen 2010). In the face of such shifts towards contextualization over context or process over product, quantitative-based approaches which tend to rely on the establishment of discrete categories may be seen as problematic (Gorter and Cenoz 2015; Gorter 2006).

We draw on an earlier affordability exercise to evaluate how Americans might view these elements of health care reform.
Methods: Immediately prior to passage of the ACA, we conducted a telephone survey of a representative sample of U.S. households. Respondents were presented vignettes representing different insurance plans, each held by people with differing life characteristics. Respondents were then asked to assess the affordability of the presented plans given the characteristics of the policyholders. 
Results: Respondents felt that households should be expected to pay about 5% of income for health insurance coverage, irrespective of their income. They also tended to view older households as less able to afford coverage than younger households, and households with sicker occupants as less able to afford healthcare than households with healthy occupants. Results did not differ between respondents in red states and those in blue states.
Conclusions: Most Americans, including those who reside in red states, believe that subsidies for health insurance premiums should be based on a fixed percentage of household income, not a fixed dollar amount.  These perceptions may make it challenging to replace the ACA with a less costly alternative plan.",TRUE,FALSE,Affordable Care Act|Health Insurance|Health Insurance Reform|Health Policy|Obamacare|Ryancare|Tax Credits,2018-07-02T10:47:29.857430,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-16T18:25:38.439000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/citation/,8g4n6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/db4fv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/relationships/node/,db4fv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cad1c56c613b01fced82fd/,58cad1c56c613b01fced82fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8g4n6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8g4n6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8g4n6,NA

More specifically, we focus on living labs (LL) and vacancy in general, as well as on their potential role in fostering creative economy-fuelled gentrification. LL utilise Lo-Fi technologies to foster local digital innovation and support community-focused civic hacking, running various kinds of workshops and engaging with local citizens to co-create digital interventions and apps aimed at ‘solving’ local issues. Five approaches to LL are outlined and discussed in relation to vacancy and gentrification: pop-up initiatives, university-led activities, community organised venues/activities, citizen sensing and crowdsourcing, and tech-led regeneration initiatives. Notwithstanding the potential for generating temporary and independent spaces for transferring and fostering digital competences and increasing citizens’ participation in the SC, we argue that LL largely foster a form of participation framed within a model of civic stewardship for ‘smart citizens’. While presented as horizontal, open, and participative, LL and civic hacking are often rooted in pragmatic and paternalistic discourses and practices related to the production of a creative economy and a specific version of SC. As such, by encouraging a particular kind of re-use of vacant space, LL potentially contributes to gentrification pressures within locales by attracting the creative classes and new investment.

This exploratory mixed-methods study examines how people discuss and disclose the use of two different drugs—marijuana and heroin—in the popular online forum Reddit. In this study hermeneutic content analysis is employed in order to describe the type of comments people make in forums dedicated to discussions about illicit drugs. With inductive analysis, seven categories of comments were identified: disclosure, instruction and advice, culture, community norms, moralizing, legality, and banter. Our subsequent quantitative analysis indicates that although the amounts of disclosure are similar in each subreddit, there are more instances of instruction and advice in discussions about opiates, and more examples of banter in comments about marijuana use. In fact, both subreddits have high rates of banter. We argue that banter fosters disclosure in both subreddits, and that banter and disclosure are linked with information seeking behaviors in online forums.

One factor inhibiting data sharing is a concern about human participant protections and privacy. Protecting the confidentiality and safety of research participants is a concern for both quantitative and qualitative researchers, but it raises specific concerns within the epistemic context of qualitative research. Thus, the applicability of emerging protection models from the quantitative realm must be carefully evaluated for application to the qualitative realm. At the same time, qualitative scholars already employ a variety of strategies for human-participant protection implicitly or informally during the research process.

In this practice paper, we assess available strategies for protecting human participants and how they can be deployed. We describe a spectrum of possible data management options, such as anonymization and applying access controls, including some already employed by the Qualitative Data Repository (QDR) in tandem with its pilot depositors. Throughout the discussion, we consider the tension between modifying data or restricting access to them, and retaining their analytic value. We argue that developing explicit guidelines for sharing qualitative data generated through interaction with humans will allow scholars to address privacy concerns and increase the secondary use of their data.",TRUE,FALSE,data sharing|human participants|privacy|QDR Working Paper|qualitative data,2018-07-02T10:47:33.703037,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-15T20:31:03.826000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Archival Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/citation/,9n7w8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2sxtz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/relationships/node/,2sxtz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58c9a36a9ad5a1020202512e/,58c9a36a9ad5a1020202512e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9n7w8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9n7w8,NA

Although initially developed to understand contemporary urban systems, the method and theory of settlement scaling are particularly appropriate for archaeological data. The scaling framework can be seen as an outgrowth of existing archaeological research on demography and settlement patterns. Although developed independently, the ""social reactor"" model that explains observed patterning is, in fact, well grounded in anthropological and archaeological theory. The key process that drives change is “energized crowding,” or the social interactions among individuals within the built environment. The scaling framework is general enough to apply to settlements in all types of human societies; it does not require the institutions or behaviors of the contemporary capitalist economy. This is a thoroughly empirical line of research that generates propositions that can be rigorously tested against archaeological data. Our positive findings to date contribute to a richer and broader fundamental understanding of human settlements, their generative character, and their changes over time.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|settlement patterns|urban scaling,2018-07-02T10:49:08.621128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-12T20:33:54.202000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce0|Arts and Humanities|History|Social History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/citation/,fwxfs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6mza7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/relationships/node/,6mza7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58c5afcc9ad5a101fd55b701/,58c5afcc9ad5a101fd55b701,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwxfs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fwxfs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fwxfs,NA
