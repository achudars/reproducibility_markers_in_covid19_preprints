Racial groups are socially constructed in the process of political conflict and the creation of and challenges to structures of domination. Group names are never fixed and are always contested as the process of naming is itself part of the political contestation. This essay is based on the author’s reading and discussion with members of the groups in question.

This study uses original nationally-representative data (N=5,601) with strategic oversamples of minority groups to examine variation in how religion and gender intersect across ethnoreligious identities in Israel. We demonstrate that Israel diverges from the typical pattern of women appearing more religious than men. In fact, Israeli men are consistently more religious than Israeli women on commonly used measures and frequently more religious on a broader set of questions specific to Judaism and Israel. Subgroup analyses highlight the intersectional nature of gender and religion, showing that men’s greater religiosity in Israel is limited to Jews, and, more specifically, non-secular Jews. We suggest that gender gaps arise, at least in part, because religions are gendered institutions with gendered norms, expectations, and incentives, and that these norms, expectations, and incentives vary from religion to religion.",TRUE,FALSE,Christians|Druze|Ethnoreligious Identity|Gender|Intersectionality|Israel|Jews|Muslims|Religion,2018-07-02T11:21:50.289880,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-10T20:36:48.693332,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/citation/,n3cw5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r4h5m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/relationships/node/,r4h5m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a060cf3594d9002657c0518/,5a060cf3594d9002657c0518,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n3cw5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n3cw5,NA

Using nationally representative data from the 1973-2016 General Social Surveys (N = 20,620), and taking into account different ethno-religious histories with pornography as a moral issue, we examine how race, gender, and religion intersect to influence trends in pornography viewership over 43 years. Analyses reveal that black Americans in general are more likely to view pornography than whites, and they are increasing in their pornography viewership at a higher rate than whites. Moreover, black men are more likely to consume pornography than all other race-gender combinations, but only differ from white women in their increasing rate of pornography viewership. Lastly, frequent worship attendance only moderates trends in pornography viewership for white men. By contrast, regardless of attendance frequency, black men and women show increasing rates of pornography use while white women show flat rates.

Using the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), we assess the roles of a range of pathways through which educational advantage may lead to occupational attainment: cognitive development; private and selective secondary schools; school level qualifications; and higher education, including institution and field of study. Whereas past research has shown a residual direct effect of social origins on class destinations, we find that, once a sufficiently detailed picture of educational attainment is taken into account, education fully explains the link between social origins and top social class destinations.

Furthermore, many past studies rely on convenience samples of college students, or samples gathered outside the United States. Multivariate analyses of the 2012 General Social Survey – a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States – reveal that a slim majority of Americans still do not believe same-sex couples can parent as well as male-female couples and the religious beliefs, behaviors, and affiliations of Americans are significantly and at times differentially associated with appraisals of same-sex couples’ parenting abilities.

It will be argued that the behavioral-genetic concept is a generally useless quantity, while the standard biological concept is overly narrow and implies a false picture of the significance of genes in development. By suitably expanding standard heritability into a general causal concept based on its role in evolution, we will arrive at a general view of development that recognizes the causal parity of all determinants of phenotypic traits and shows why the behavioral genetic dichotomy of genes vs environment is fundamentally misguided.

But rather than engaging in debates over the democratic potential of digital technologies, it’s arguably more productive to look at the range of ways that this emerging ‘digital civics’ is reconfiguring how we conceptualize and practice citizenship in the era of big data. The chapter first turns to discussing how citizenship is increasingly defined in relation to data and data practices, and how these redefinitions have precipitated larger changes in the way citizenship is conceptualized and operationalized. Second, the chapter identifies three ongoing, interrelated changes to the digital civics landscape that are worthy of greater attention moving forward. These include the spatialization of digital civics, the corporatization of digital civics, and the growing prominence of oppositional uses of digital civics that seek to challenge the social and political status quo.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|citizenship|digital geographies|mapping|smart cities|smart citizens,2018-07-02T11:21:48.083563,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-09T17:30:02.194564,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/citation/,6jy49,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8gb24/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/relationships/node/,8gb24,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a04901f594d900266674f60/,5a04901f594d900266674f60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6jy49/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6jy49/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6jy49,NA

Rather than taking these ideas as a given and looking at their political consequences, I will ask what politics enters at their points of construction, where they are understood as being constructed computationally. This allows me to read across from the Anthropocene and resilience to the other forms of computational anticipation that are becoming pervasive at the level of everyday life. As truth claims that depend on algorithms, I will argue that all of these constructions derive their authority from an entanglement of computation and science. Under current conditions, this entanglement brings it's own political tendencies, which can be characterised as colonial. To counter this implicit colonialism I will draw on the feminist and post-colonial approaches of standpoint theory. I believe this offers an alternative to the current entanglements of anticipatory computation, and allows us to re-work it into a post-colonial politics of algorithms and atmospheres.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:21:47.815771,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-09T14:36:44.246654,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/citation/,pev7j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m26sk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/relationships/node/,m26sk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a04670b6c613b026570eb6b/,5a04670b6c613b026570eb6b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pev7j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pev7j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pev7j,https://doi.org/10.1080/21693293.2016.1240779
