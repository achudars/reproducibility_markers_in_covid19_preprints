The study also addresses the question whether out-of-class exposure such as watching TV, listening to radio or music, reading English books and using social media plays a significant role in the learning of collocations. The research participants were 46 Arabic-speaking young adult EFL learners. They were asked to read a modified text containing 10 pseudo-word collocations and to verify that all were unfamiliar to them. One week later, they read a text containing the actual 21 target collocations, which had been selected on the basis of appearing in instructional materials and a reference corpus, as well as of frequency. Participants were then asked to complete a meaning-recall cloze test in the form of a gap-filling task in which the 21 target collocations were embedded in sentences. Subsequently they were administered a self-report survey about any incidental exposure to English. The analysis of the quantitative results revealed that the target collocations can be learned incidentally through reading although the level of mastery was limited. The survey data showed a positive correlation between the learners’ knowledge of collocations and activities such as watching TV, listening to radio and reading English books. The study also confirmed that collocations are particularly difficult for adult EFL learners and is thus an aspect of vocabulary knowledge in need of further empirical investigations.",TRUE,FALSE,collocation|EFL|incidental learning|pseudo-words|reading,2018-07-02T11:57:41.407647,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:41:56.442666,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/citation/,x8krq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k92f8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/relationships/node/,k92f8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dd016daf8210013d3f0e5/,5b2dd016daf8210013d3f0e5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8krq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x8krq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x8krq

The sample includes the Smithport Plain bottles from the Webb collection, and four new bottles: two previously repatriated specimens in the Pohler Collection, and two from the Mitchell site (41BW4) to test whether those specimens align morphologically with the Belcher Mound or Smithport Landing specimens. Results indicate significant allometry and a significant difference in Smithport Plain body and base shapes for bottles produced at the Smithport Landing and Belcher Mound sites in northwest Louisiana. The Pohler and Mitchell specimens do not differ significantly from those found at Smithport Landing or Belcher Mound. Analysis of the aggregated sample indicates some significant relationships between bottle shape and size, bottle shape and type, and bottle shape and site, highlighting assemblage-level and type-specific variability. The test of morphological disparity by period indicates a possible gradual trend toward standardization, and the test of morphological integration indicates that Caddo bottles are significantly integrated, meaning that those discrete traits used to characterize their shape (rim, neck, body, and base) vary in a coordinated manner.

Our results produce distinct representations of political actors and institutions during elections: a narrow classification provides heuristics cuing race, party, and incumbent performance; a broad definition reflects policy and service concerns parties debated.

Snow’s The Two Cultures (1959) the divide between scientists and humanists is described as both practical and cultural. That is, scientists and humanists not only perform different jobs, but they also understand the world differently. Humanities for STEM: Using Archives to Bridge the Two Cultures Divide, a two-year research collaborative funded by New York University’s Center for the Humanities, re-investigates Snow’s thesis through the study of primary sources and archival research.

Archives, often thought to be squarely in the domain of the humanities, also contain primary source documents from the sciences and, therefore, can be used to enhance the understanding of STEM. Because this research collaborative posits that primary sources can aid STEM education and research, it becomes important to define what scientists and humanists understand primary sources to be. Is the term “primary source” part of the conceptual and cultural divide Snow describes?

In order to understand how a primary source is defined by various disciplines, research collaborative members created and disseminated a survey to faculty at New York University. The results of this survey led to an awareness that what is considered to be a primary source varies between disciplines. Although the notion that primary sources contain first-hand accounts of actual events was established across the disciplines, there was disagreement as to which formats were considered to be primary sources. Practitioners in STEM and social sciences considered journal articles and data sets to be primary sources. Humanities professionals were unique in their belief that “physical documents from an archive (eg., correspondence, photographs)” were one of the top forms of primary sources. With two working definitions of primary sources, it becomes clear that while faculty in most disciplines insist they are using primary sources, faculty from across the divide may disagree as to which documents are in fact primary sources. The differing definition of primary sources could lead to potential projects for either side: raw data and journal articles in historical contexts for humanities classrooms or innovative uses of letters, journals, and objects in STEM classrooms.",TRUE,FALSE,archives|conferenceproceeding|education|humanities|HumforSTEM2018|primary source|STEM,2018-07-02T11:56:49.477422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-22T15:49:51.877122,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/citation/,xz348,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/45yzh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/relationships/node/,45yzh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b202fc2ba5d13000d09249d/,5b202fc2ba5d13000d09249d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xz348/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xz348

Vogues in name usage can be easily shown on a case by case basis, by plotting the rise and fall in their popularity over time. However, individual name choices are not made in isolation and trends in naming are better understood as group-level phenomena. Here we use network analysis to examine onomastic (name) datasets in order to explore the influences on name choices within the UK over the last 170 years. Using a large representative sample of approximately 22 million chosen forenames from England and Wales given between 1838 and 2014, along with a complete population sample of births registered between 1996 and 2016, we demonstrate how trends in name usage can be visualised as network graphs.
By exploring the structure of these graphs, various patterns of name use become readily apparent, which can be interpreted in the context of historic events, such as known waves of migration. In general, we show that the topology of network graphs can reveal naming vogues, and that naming vogues are a reflection of social and demographic changes.
Many name choices are consistent with a self-correcting feedback loop, whereby rarer names become common because there are virtues perceived in their rarity, yet with these perceived virtues lost upon increasing commonality. Towards the present day, the comparatively greater range of media, freedom of movement, and ability to maintain globally-distributed social networks increases the number of possible names, but also ensures they may more quickly be perceived as commonplace. Consequently, contemporary naming vogues are relatively short-lived with many name choices appearing a balance struck between recognisability and rarity.

Despite the dependence of many rural communities in India on communal water sources and treatment plants for safe drinking water, they often fail to collectively manage these resources, resulting in abandoned water points and treatment systems with consequent health and mortality impacts. Results of public goods games framed in terms of the management of communal water treatment systems suggest that observability (public disclosure of behaviour) had the very significant effect of decreasing contributions to the public good. Analysis suggests this was mainly due to conformity to frequently-observed free-riding. Only when participants were actively encouraged to negotiate agreements, did cooperation increase significantly - albeit intermittently. These results show that the success of institutional design principles devised to increase cooperation depends on existing social norms and practices in the community of interest.

We find that in the aggregate, individuals positively condition their redistribution choices on the contributions of first-movers in their group, suggesting conformity to peers. However, examination of second-mover ‘types’ (classified using the full vector of individual contributions stated in response to a range of first-mover donations) indicates that only 17% can be classed as ‘conformists’; the remaining major 'types' include self-interested players (42%), unconditional givers (22%) and ‘compensators’ (8.3%). Most strikingly, the first observable amount presented to second-movers in the strategy game (the anchor) is found to influence the likelihood of choosing a giving strategy versus a self-interested strategy. Specifically, low anchors increase the likelihood of selecting self-interested strategies, whilst high anchors increase the likelihood of conformist and compensating strategies. The distribution of ‘types’ is therefore dependent on the initial conditions of play in the strategy game. Thus, not only is individual redistribution behaviour observed to be path dependent, but initial conditions strongly determine the path.",TRUE,FALSE,altruism|anchoring|conformity|dictator game|peer effects|redistribution,2018-07-02T11:56:48.872287,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-22T11:07:22.924832,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/citation/,28xwv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xg48b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/relationships/node/,xg48b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2ca495daf8210012d38c7d/,5b2ca495daf8210012d38c7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xwv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/28xwv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/28xwv

Pynamical facilitates defining discrete one-dimensional nonlinear models as Python functions with just-in-time compilation for fast simulation. It comes packaged with the logistic map, the Singer map, and the cubic map predefined. The models may be run with a range of parameter values over a set of time steps, and the resulting numerical output is returned as a pandas DataFrame. Pynamical can then visualize this output in various ways, including with bifurcation diagrams, two-dimensional phase diagrams, three-dimensional phase diagrams, and cobweb plots. These visualizations enable simple qualitative assessments of system behavior including phase transitions, bifurcation points, attractors and limit cycles, basins of attraction, and fractals.",TRUE,FALSE,attractor|bifurcation|chaos|chaotic|dynamical|fractal|geometry|mathematics|modeling|nonlinearity|nonlinear system|physics|prediction|python|simulation|systems analysis|visualization,2018-07-02T11:56:48.323225,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-22T11:05:59.582381,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/citation/,g8nsf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jqz3w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/relationships/node/,jqz3w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2c1f92d65eaa000fd8bc84/,5b2c1f92d65eaa000fd8bc84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nsf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g8nsf/,https://doi.org/10.21105/jose.00015,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g8nsf

GDA is distinct from Goal-Directed Progress (GDP), the mental process that underlies the pursuit of change in the current state of affairs. We argue that GDA plays a crucial role in human life, but that it has been largely overlooked in psychological research. We discuss the unique cognitive and motivational challenges that arise during GDA, and suggest strategies to overcome these challenges. Finally, we outline how acknowledging the distinction between GDA and GDP might contribute to the study and treatment of mental illness, and highlight several directions for future research.",TRUE,FALSE,goal pursuit|goals|maintenance|motivation,2018-07-02T11:56:47.920151,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-22T11:05:08.654438,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/citation/,7cj5a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fbk4v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/relationships/node/,fbk4v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2bcfacb3dd22000dfac506/,5b2bcfacb3dd22000dfac506,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cj5a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7cj5a/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7cj5a
