Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"In light of ongoing debates that discuss the link between Muslim migration and terrorist attacks in various European cities, this paper investigates how attitudes toward (Muslim) immigrants have been affected by these attacks. We draw on a German student survey conducted immediately before and after the attacks in Paris in November 2015. The experimental vignette design allows us to further differentiate between attitudes toward Syrian migrants from different religious backgrounds. We show that the attitudes towards immigration held by students who identify with conservative parties became more negative after the attacks. Immigrants’ religion also plays an important role depending on whether the issue in question is a social or political one. The attitudes of liberal students are hardly affected. This paper goes beyond existing studies that only measure attitudes in the aftermath of such attacks and focuses on attitudes regarding policy responses to terrorist attacks or attitudes towards immigrants in general. We show that such attacks do not lead to negative attitudes in general; they mostly do so for people who attach great importance to issues of national security. We also see that people differentiate between various migrant groups.",TRUE,FALSE,Muslims|party identification|religion|survey experiment|terrorism|threat,2018-07-02T11:22:47.351117,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-14T13:16:56.532271,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/citation/,eykw2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dzy57/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/relationships/node/,dzy57,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a0478956c613b026370ed57/,5a0478956c613b026370ed57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eykw2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eykw2/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1468796818757264,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eykw2

When treated improperly, such phenomenon may lead to biased estimates and incorrect inferences. This study extends the existing literature on single value inflated models, and develops a general framework to handle variables with more than one inflated values. To assess the performance of the proposed maximum likelihood estimator, we conducted Monte Carlo experiments under several scenarios for different levels of inflated probabilities under Multinomial, Ordinal, Poisson, and Zero-Truncated Poisson outcomes with covariates. We found that ignoring the inflations leads to substantial bias and poor inference if the inflations—not only for the intercept(s) of the inflated categories, but other coefficients as well. Specifically, higher values of inflated probabilities are associated with larger biases. By contrast, the Generalized Inflated Discrete models (GIDM) perform well with unbiased estimates and satisfactory coverages even when the number of parameters that need to be estimated is quite large. We showed that model fit criteria such as AIC could be used in selecting appropriate specification of inflated models. Lastly, GIDM was implemented to a large-scale health survey data to compare with conventional modeling approach such as various Poisson, and Ordered Logit models. We showed that GIDM fits the data better in general.

It primarily focuses on metaphors in his fiction, which lend a unique sense of translingualism and multiculturalism to his work. Hosseini’s overt and covert use of metaphors reveals an allegiance to several languages that are spoken in Afghanistan and the region, including Pashto, Persian, Arabic and Urdu. His double cultural and discursive belonging suggests a case for post-structural translingualism, a fluid bilingualism belonging simultaneously to all the languages in one’s repertoire.

The spread of MT entails a thorough analysis of translation produced by such translation systems. The present study evaluates the capacity of two MT systems-Google Translate and Microsoft Bing translator- in translation from   Arabic into English of Khalil Gibran’s literary masterpiece - The Prophet (2000).  The question that arises in the study is could we trust MT in the translation of literary masterpieces across languages and particularly from Arabic to English? How close does MT output to human translation? To conduct that, the study is adopted Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) of Papineni (2000).  MT output analysis showed that MT is not accurate, intelligible and natural in translating literary texts due to the difficulty of literary texts, as they are full of metaphors and cultural specifications. Besides, there are some linguistic errors: lexical, syntactic and misinformation. The study also found that both systems provided similar translation for the same input due to either the use of similar MT approach or learning from previous translated texts. Moreover, both systems in some instances, achieve good results at the word level, but bad results at collocation units. The study also showed that automatic translation is insufficient for providing a full analysis of MT output because all automatic metrics are misleading due to dependence on text similarity to a reference human translation. For future research, the study recommended conducting a correlative study that combines manual and automatic evaluation methods to ensure best analysis of MT output.

Precisely, this reflective analysis aims to discuss these two research questions: do foreign language teachers simply use some amateur translation activities to upgrade their learners’ linguistic proficiency? Or do they find it necessary to teach translation models and techniques proper, targeting translational proficiency along with linguistic ability? Drawing on the researcher’s experience and specialist authorship, translation approaches and techniques as related to foreign language teaching/learning and 2) translation pedagogy types that govern the appropriate selection of translation techniques are the foundational units of this analytic endeavour. This analysis revealed that the basics of most well-known translation approaches and techniques are genuinely present in diverse foreign language classes. Additionally, teaching these translation approaches and techniques for general linguistic aims and for specific professional purposes are two different contexts where the former is shaped by presenting some mere language-based translation techniques and the latter by teaching much more specialist and profession-related ones. This categorisation inescapably determines the quality and quantity of translation practice and the nature of the teacher-learner pedagogical contract, aiming at foreign language learning per se, translation proficiency or both.

Critical theorists like Adorno call it free time and warn of capitalism’s propensity to subvert it. Whereas boredom has traditionally been a boon for humanity in its propensity to force contemplation that leads to creativity, in modernity it has been succumbed to en masse and therefore no longer plays its role of detecting the human threshold preceding anger. Critical analyses have prompted many to search for a particular style of boredom, a pursuit of its quiddity in order to crack its style, which in a milieu where method and style is everything equates to numerous staid attempts. While genre identifying stylistic markers perhaps do exist in the generic sense that the plays and novels included in this proposed corpus are typically about white, privileged, and post-lapsarian moderns dealing with vertiginous existential issues, positing an exact style remains intractable. This paper, while not an exhaustive examination of the texts, posits=nevertheless that purported stylistic markers are not consistent or discernable. What is more plausible, rather, is that dispossession affects productions and critical readings.

The study illuminates certain features of Africana Womanism reflected in Nervous Conditions to explore the deep meaning of the African woman experience. Though it is created by an African American intellectual, Hudson-Weems, Africana Womanism transcends the borders of the United States to absorb the needs and aspirations of women from Africa. Reading the novel from the perspective of Africana womanism challenges the view of categorizing Dangarembga as a feminist and her novel in the mainstream of feminist literature on the one hand, and helps to gain more comprehensive understanding of the novel on the other; hence, lies the importance and novelty of the study. To execute this goal, the researcher highlights the most salient attributes of Africana womanism which the female characters in Nervous Conditions fictionally exhibit as: self-namer, self-definer, authentic, complete, and genuine in sisterhood, family centered, male compatible, mothering and nurturing. Utilizing the approach of Africana womanism, all marginalized women should cooperate in creating their own paradigm which stems from their own social reality and reflects their cultural autonomy and integrity.",TRUE,FALSE,Africana womanism|African literature|black woman writings|Dangarembga|Nervous Conditions,2018-07-02T11:22:43.038754,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T04:35:17.068506,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/citation/,dg64t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zdqc6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/relationships/node/,zdqc6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07cedb6c613b0264acfb36/,5a07cedb6c613b0264acfb36,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dg64t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dg64t

Following a review of the current state of the industry, the article examines the types of translation organizations found in the country and investigates the demands of today’s translation market in Saudi Arabia. The most striking finding was that there is a huge gap between academic training and the requirements of the Saudi translation market. This study provides new beneficial insights for improving university translator-training programmes.  It is suggested that the training programmes need to be constructed specifically to meet the demands of the Saudi translation market",TRUE,FALSE,Saudi translation market|translation competences|translation industry|translator training,2018-07-02T11:22:43.003659,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T04:31:17.670576,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/citation/,jq963,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/74kad/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/relationships/node/,74kad,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07ce1c6c613b0263acf613/,5a07ce1c6c613b0263acf613,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq963/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jq963/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jq963

It examines the condition of displacement and its effects on the identity of the female protagonists in two short stories written by Ahdaf Soueif: Sandpiper and Melody. The researcher’s investigation relies on recent postcolonial criticism provided by Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha. As such, this paper explores: the representation of the Arab culture in the the Western thought; the way linguistic hegemony is subverted through the use of a hybridized version of  English; and the agency of the subaltern through using the English language as a vehicle for the transmission of Diasporic Arab female voices and concerns. This paper concludes that Ahdaf Soueif succeeds in painting an original view of the effect of the state of displacement on the psyche of her female subjects, highlighting the semi-autobiographical aspect which is used as a means to express a quest for identity. The writer also succeeds in writing back to the colonial metropolis against the hegemonic imperialist discourse. Moreover, the writer goes beyond postcolonial writing in her literary endeavor as an appeal towards developing approaches for the modern-day challenges of globalization.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab women writing|diaspora|identity|postcolonial|representation,2018-07-02T11:22:42.963442,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T04:25:21.292970,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/citation/,8prxk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eamvr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/relationships/node/,eamvr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07ccb59ad5a1026e02b56d/,5a07ccb59ad5a1026e02b56d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8prxk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8prxk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8prxk
