Recently, however, changes in marital fertility have also contributed to the decline in fertility. While the influence of women's educational attainment on fertility has only been paid attention, since fertility involves two partners and so it is also possible to focus on the influence of the male partner’s social status. Moreover, not only can each partner’s socioeconomic status, but also their combining as a couple (assortative mating), influence fertility. In spite of theoretical significance to examine the relationship between educational assortative mating and fertility, scholars face a methodological problem in examining an interaction of two variables. In this study, applying diagonal reference model to event history analysis, I estimated the effect of educational assortative mating on having first and second childbirth in Japan. A series of analysis revealed that homogamy couples of the high educated are less likely to have their second child than other types of educational coupling.",TRUE,FALSE,educational assortative mating|fertility|japan|paa2018,2018-07-02T11:45:30.153381,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-26T15:31:12.456729,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",Fumiya Uchikoshi,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/citation/,p7hg8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/68mpw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/relationships/node/,68mpw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab8d15976e58c000ff975a5/,5ab8d15976e58c000ff975a5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p7hg8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p7hg8,NA

Robust savings rate coupled with good capital mobilization are the key macro economic variables, which play a significant role in economic growth.  A nation's savings and investment propensities also play a key role in achieving dynamic stability in the capital market. Per Capita Income in India has been on the rise since all of the last decade. With growth in the PCI, savings and investment in the country too has shown a northbound movement. At the same time, there has been a phenomenal rise in the youth population. This has made India the youngest nation with a demographic dividend appearing to be a reality. This young work force is expected to drive the engine of growth. 
In Economics, investment is generally held to mean formation of capital. As such, from a pure economics point of view, the formation of physical assets is important when considering investment.  However this study focuses on what is referred to as Financial Investment i.e. investment in shares and securities aimed primarily at earning income rather than enhancing production. By virtue of this the words savings and investment come closer in meaning than traditionally seen. However a slight difference still remains which is that while savings is simply setting aside funds for future, investment also involves mobilizing them so that somebody else may use it for productive purposes.
This study examines the savings and investment pattern of select college going students (Age: 17-25 years) in the city of Mumbai who has just begun to earn.  The study also looks into the basic financial literacy amongst the youth; how they go about educating themselves, and how do they look at risk, returns and various modes of investments and what determines the same. Primary data was collected using a survey method. The information generated during data collection was both qualitative and quantitative. The major objectives of the study were (1) To understand the youngsters’ income and saving pattern. (2) To know their long-term financial goals. (3) To find out risk appetite of youngsters.  (4) To find out whether the young investors are looking for long term growth or risk or return or liquidity. 
The study finds that safety and security, which were always important reasons for investment, are still influential in determining the direction of investment. Respondents liked to keep multiple options while choosing their investment options. However, returns on investment were obviously the most considered factor followed by risk. Saving accounts in banks appears to be the most common way of saving and investing for the respondents. Mutual fund has gained the favor of young investors. Investment in mutual funds through the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a favored investment option for the youngsters. This is especially true of the young salaried class, which has just started earning and does not have a fat bank balance as yet. Youngsters today do know about the options available to them due to the rapid spread of information in recent times; they are not always sure about how to go about investing in newer ways actively. 
An informed investor is a good investor; there is opportunity for providing them with guidance and information but it has to be done in a way that is in accordance with their lifestyle – seminars and workshops are no longer the kind of options to peruse. Podcasts, online videos, forums and tutorials are the way of learning of the young generation. The social media platforms specially Face Book, Twitter, LinkedIn along with e-groups and websites can be a medium to spread awareness about various options available for the young investors. Thus, investor education can play a vital role in improving the active participation of the investors in the market, which can help them in the informed investment and in getting good returns.",TRUE,FALSE,investment pattern|savings|youth,2018-07-02T11:45:29.769503,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-26T15:30:24.434130,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,BSE,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/citation/,gb7as,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e76pq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/relationships/node/,e76pq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab8702376e58c000ef908d8/,5ab8702376e58c000ef908d8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gb7as/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gb7as,NA

At the same time, this paper contributes to the strand of literature that deals with the economic elaboration of the idea of differential capacities for happiness, of which the works of Levy and Peart represent the most recent examples.

Randomized cluster sampling plan was used to sample 2186 secondary school students in their final school year with mean age of 18.6 years (SD = 0.7 years). The study employed the Child Sexual Abuse Questionnaire (Mohler-Kuo et al., 2014) consisting of multiple behavior-specific questions. The prevalence of CSA was analyzed separately for three clusters of CSA and gender. The self-reported lifetime prevalence of at least one form of CSA was 47.3% among girls and 22.0% among boys. The prevalence of noncontact forms of CSA was 40.6% among girls and 17.7% among boys. CSA with physical contact without penetration was reported by 30.2% girls and 11.6% boys. The prevalence of CSA with penetration was 5.6% among girls and 1.3% among boys. More than half of CSA occurred between 16-18 year of age in all three CSA cluster types. The severity of abuse was positively associated with the acquaintance with the perpetrator. Roughly 43-56% disclosed the abuse to another person. The majority of disclosed CSA was revealed to peers and partners. Negligible proportion of CSA instances were reported to the police. The results show that CSA is a widespread and considerably covert phenomenon within the population of Slovak late adolescents.

Despite these ambiguities, most would agree that Big Data and the methods for analyzing it represent a remarkable potential for advancing social science knowledge. In my Presidential address to the Southern Demographic Association, I argue that demographers have long collected and analyzed Big Data in a small way, by parsing out the points of information that we can manipulate with familiar models and restricting analyses to what typical computing systems can handle or restricted-access data disseminators will allow.

At the same time, it remains unknown how varying sources affect the reconstruction of individual life courses and families in databases. In this paper, we conduct individual-level comparisons of family and life course reconstructions of 495 individuals simultaneously present in two well-known Dutch datasets: LINKS-Zeeland and the HSN. The first dataset is based on a province’s full population vital event registration data; the other is based on a national sample of birth certificates, after which individuals were followed in population registers. We compare indicators of fertility, marriage, mortality, and measurements of occupational status of individuals found in both databases and conclude that reconstructions in both the HSN and LINKS reflect each other well. LINKS provides more complete family information on siblings and parents, whereas the HSN provides more complete life course information, especially for individuals who migrate out of Zeeland.",TRUE,FALSE,Civil registers|Databases|Demographic methods|Family history|Family reconstitutions|Family reconstruction|Historical demography|Life course|Microdata|Population registers,2018-07-02T11:45:27.350324,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-23T21:34:40.094060,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd8|Arts and Humanities|History|Genealogy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/citation/,h2w8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ar4nk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/relationships/node/,ar4nk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab4d24f5c0e6b0010bec6f3/,5ab4d24f5c0e6b0010bec6f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2w8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h2w8t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h2w8t,https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2020.1718186

Patterns of Intersectional Motivations Across the Resistance,"Can a crowd of individuals who are motivated by a range of issues related to racial identity, class, gender and sexuality mobilize around a shared issue, and, if so, how does this process work in practice?  To date, limited research has explored intersectionality as a mobilization tool for social movements.  This paper expands recent work on how intersectional motivations influence the constituencies at protest events by comparing across some of the largest events that have taken place in Washington, DC since the Resistance began. We explore patterns of motivations of participants in marches over the first year of the Trump Presidency.  Our analyses demonstrate how individuals’ motivations to participate represented an intersectional set of issues and how patterns of issues emerge.  However, when we look across the marches, we find that the patterns are not durable, indicating the limitations of interpretations of the Resistance as a unified intersectional movement.",TRUE,FALSE,activism|intersectionality|motivations|protest|social movements|the Resistance,2018-07-02T11:45:26.665547,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-23T01:12:45.627017,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Dana R.

The relative education hypothesis posits that when college degrees are rare, individuals with more education have less competition to enter highly skilled occupations. When college degrees are more common, there may not be enough highly skilled jobs to go around; some college-educated workers lose out to others and are pushed into less skilled jobs. Using new measurements of occupation-level verbal, quantitative, analytic skills, this study tests the changing effect of education on skill utilization across 70 years of birth cohorts from 1971-2010, net of all other age, period, and cohort trends. Higher education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and college-educated workers are at greater risk for underemployment in less cognitively demanding occupations. This raises questions about the sources of rising income inequality, skill utilization across the working life course, occupational sex segregation, and how the returns to education have changed across different life domains.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:45:26.232852,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-23T01:12:11.446655,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/citation/,fnqv7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j26vm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/relationships/node/,j26vm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab413dcd91831000e6271e2/,5ab413dcd91831000e6271e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnqv7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fnqv7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fnqv7,NA
