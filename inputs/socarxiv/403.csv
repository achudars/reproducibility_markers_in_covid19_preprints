The author establishes that the closest relations were between correspondents belonging to the same or almost same hierarchy level and who were bonded together by the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy educational system and school comradeship, eventually obtained high positions in the hierarchy. Communication within the boundaries of individual centers (the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, collegiums in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Pereiaslav, seats of Ukrainian bishops in Russia, etc.) depended on specificity of the environment. Predominant themes encountered in the letters of the Ukrainian bishops included needs of the alma mater, the Kyiv Academy, and the collegiums. The correspondence addressed issues of their legal status, academic staff, financial support, as well as the literary work and publishing activities of the hierarchs.

The analysis specifically covers the works of professors Stefan Solskyi, Kharysym Orda, Nikolai Drozdov, Afanasii Bulgakov, Mykola Makkaveiskyi, Vasylii Pevnytskyi, Arsenii Tsarevskyi, Volodymyr Rybinskyi, Dmytro Bohdashevskyi, and Aleksandr Glagolev. The author uses the metaphor of the Biblical world to describe the historically developed spiritual and cultural component of the European world, for which the Bible played the role of a normative and symbolic core. Affiliation with the Biblical world — as a way of broad social application of the Bible and assimilation of the norms and public behaviors sanctioned by this text — was and still is a stable symbolic marker as well as a cultural and ideological factor of integration with European civilization. The historical panorama of the reception of Biblical knowledge and the inculturation of Biblical morality by Christianized nations, reproduced in the writings of Kyiv academics, is presented as a field of centuries-old intercultural contacts and active inter-confessional interaction, and as an important ideological and moral factor of the socio-political integration and development of civil society. The issues addressed by Biblical studies in Europe and the rest of the world and considerations and solutions prompted by these issues proved to be fruitful for both the academic research and public practices in which academics of the Kyiv Theological Academy were engaged. The past and modern foreign experience related to the inculturation of the Bible was interpreted by the Kyiv researchers in the local context, more specifically, in the modernization attempts of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Therefore, the reflection of European and worldwide experience, though not fully implemented, was productive and was a potential factor that could have contributed to the European modernization of Kyiv cultural and religious life of the time and its integration into the global Biblical World.

Methods: The data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY-79). Population-averaged models were used to examine the associations between multiple measures of wealth and obesity among 6,979 respondents while controlling for education, occupation, income, and relevant sociodemographic variables.

Results: The analysis found a robust association between wealth and midlife obesity as well as heterogeneity in the wealth-obesity association across gender, race, and measure of wealth. With the exception of Black men, net worth generally had a significant and inverse relationship with obesity. The net worth-obesity association was largest among women and was driven primarily by home value—in addition to savings and debt for Black women. Although home value was significant for White men, the components of wealth were generally unrelated to obesity among men. 

Conclusions: The association between wealth can obesity was generally robust but also complex, depending on gender, race, and measure of wealth.

One significant transition was the media image of the New Warrior – a warrior who’s sacrifice no longer transformed the nation. The NRA, emerging from the 1970s with a more hardline stance toward Second Amendment absolutism, played an active role in reshaping the relationship between this new warrior culture, military service, and the Second Amendment. Building on a narrative of government betrayal of the soldiers in Vietnam, the NRA recast the ordinary gun owner into the New Warrior, an independent warrior who will go to any lengths to defend the sacred right to bear arms against corrupt agents of the government. But the deeper question of how the NRA has accomplished this transformation of cultural meaning remains largely unexplored. This paper argues that the NRA used the rhetoric of national failure following Vietnam and the blood sacrifice of American soldiers who died in the defense of the Constitution to transform the cultural meaning of the Second Amendment for ordinary citizens. Through the Second Amendment, ordinary men are transformed into Second Amendment warriors, defending the freedoms the American soldiers died to protect. As one of the original real life heroes of the post-Vietnam New War -  a retired soldier who operated outside of the law in order to defend the Nation– Oliver North’s ascension to the NRA presidency represents the fulfillment of the post-Vietnam New War archetype and merges the New War mythology with the blood sacrifice of Christian nationalism.",TRUE,FALSE,american rifleman|blood sacrifice|conquest narrative|discourse analysis|gun culture|gun culture 2.0|guns|new warrior culture|NRA|oliver north|Religious nationalism|sacrifice|support the troops|warrior culture,2019-08-13T20:39:42.164045,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-13T20:39:20.344149,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Jessica Dawson,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/citation/,2zyr6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d50ac4273347900196cca99/,5d50ac4273347900196cca99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2zyr6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2zyr6

Such a person will not discover the existence of "" the Word"" with which he commanded order to exist out of disorder which mankind enjoys today.  This ""Word"" is the power of God.  It is with this Word that he was able to bring order in the ""tohu wabohu"" he met (Gen. 1:2).  Let it be clear from the beginning that the phrase ""tohu wabohu"" has remained enigmatic and defies all translations.  It tries to explain the 'nothingness' of the situation before God began creating the universe.  It is through the ""Word"" that we were told that everything that exists came into being (John 1:3).  This same word became flesh (John 1:14) so as to bring back the strayed (Gen. 3:24) humanity back to their original root which is eternal communion with God.  The greatest problem is that humanity has not understood the meaning of that ""Word.""  The aim of this work is to show that God created the world through the Word and this Word  always appears for the good of mankind wherever it does.  To live in opposition to this Word is to create more problems for mankind and to live in communion with him is to understand the essence of the 'Word' and thus help in solving human problems.  This paper argues that if John 1:1-18 is properly understood, most misunderstandings as regards the creation of the world would be halted and appreciation of the 'Word' will increase in the world.

When seeking knowledge online on specific subject matter, one may encounter a wide assortment of material ranging from professional academic research to an everyman’s personal opinion – the spectrum of information available online is infinite (Hayat &amp; Hershkovitz, 2018). The emergence and popularization of social media and networking sites in particular have led to a change in digital dynamics, segueing from the norm of mass cultural consumption to that of mass production . Today, user generated content accounts for a generous portion of online resources, and has a notable affect on people’s thoughts and actions.
Changes in the electronic landscape have also revolutionized industries in addition to transforming cultural norms. The digitization of services and products has led to the decline of print publications, a drastic shift in consumer’s purchasing habits, and a metamorphosis in the music industry. With today’s song streaming services and free and readily available online audio content, the big business of record labels and album sales are antiquated and inaccurate representations of success in the market.
This work takes into account the heavy influence that the Internet has on the music industry, and aims to find a positive correlation between the volume of online discussion on a given song and the amount of Youtube views that song will have. In other words, to what extent does social media mentions predict the success of a song on Youtube? In Section 3 of this research we will detail existing work relating to this topic and discuss the changes of the Internet in the era of Web 2.0, as well as the importance of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and it’s impact on online consumer interactions. An account of our methodology in conducting this study, and an explanation of the data we used, can be found in Section 5. In Section 7, we discuss the implications of our results by drawing conclusions from the data we collected.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-11T13:06:22.037573,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-11T13:06:00.696933,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/citation/,7wqhd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d500c55733479001a6c653d/,5d500c55733479001a6c653d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wqhd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7wqhd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7wqhd

Since then, the theory has been widely adopted within both the sport and masculinities literature. Furthermore, a large number of other scholars not using the theory have also documented and labelled new masculinity types. There has also been refinement of Inclusive Masculinity Theory, alongside theoretical critiques. In this article, we provide an overview of the genesis of the theory and its refinement, before considering and responding to published and unpublished critiques of the theory.

God after creating them, he blessed them saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that move upon the earth” (Gen. 1:28). As mankind continued to live as was commanded, they turned inwards to subdue and dominate one another.  Man against woman; village against village, town against town; state against state; region against region and worst of all tribe against tribe. This domination can come in the form of “stronger persons” dominating the “weaker ones,” “the stronger families” dominating “weaker families,” or “the stronger tribes” dominating “weaker tribes” etc. Jesus Christ when he came as God made man, he noticed these divisions among mankind hence on his last supper with his apostles he prayed, “That they may be one” (John.17: 11). He said it at the last supper to show how dear that unity is to his heart. St. Paul in trying to re-echo Jesus’ teaching among the Corinthians says, “Has Christ been divided?” (1Cor1:13). Whenever you gather among yourselves as Christians, there should be neither Jew nor Gentile, male or female, you are all one before God (Gal 3:28).The story of Good Samaritan is one of the ways through which Christ tried to tell us that we ought to look at one another fundamentally as image and likeness of God. The presence among Christians of tribal sentiments and loyalty to one’s ethnic group must be a scandal of great proportion to all of us who claim to be the agents for spreading Christ’s kingdom of love, and brotherhood in the world. Since we are now the authentic image of God, there ought not to be any form of division among us.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-13T20:45:03.928562,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-13T20:44:37.333097,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76caf|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Biblical Studies,,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/citation/,akns7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d503eda73347900176cc8ce/,5d503eda73347900176cc8ce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akns7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/akns7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/akns7

However, it is unclear if the standard model of intensification is theoretically or empirically justified. This leaves social scientists unable to make reasonable inferences about the relationship between intensification and the evolution of social complexity in past societies. To remedy this problem, I derive a novel model of intensification from human macroecology, settlement scaling theory, human behavioral ecology, cultural evolutionary theory, and niche construction theory. The standard and cultural niche construction models are formalized and their predictions are tested using a comprehensive ethnographic data set that describes food production in forty human societies ranging in complexity from foraging bands to agricultural states. Analysis of the ethnographic record suggests we reject the standard model and tentatively accept the cultural niche construction model. I attempt to demonstrate the broader utility of the cultural niche construction model as a framework that may help explain the transition from small-scale to large-scale complex societies.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-11T13:05:02.876795,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-11T13:04:35.811859,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,David S.
