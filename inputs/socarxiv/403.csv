Consequently, the issue of sustainable waste management has become an important priority for policymakers and other stakeholders of the society. Although the respective local administrations are responsible for collection and disposal of household and industrial wastes, privatization of the entire process has been heavily promoted and pursued by the federal government of the country. A significant number of waste dealers – both formal and informal – are currently involved in the field level. Through analysing the inputs acquired from semi-structured interviews with these waste dealers operating at Kuala Langat and Sepang districts in the Selangor state, this paper attempts to identify the roles they are playing in the overall waste management cycle, the challenges they are facing, and the untapped opportunities from their operations.

It was revealed that lack of skills, education, technological knowledge, and conflict among the stakeholders are the main internal constraints.

This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey that was distributed by email using the Google Doc application among the head of department of 682 departments and agencies under 24 federal ministries including the Prime Minister Department in Malaysia. Finally, based on the email responses, the final sample of the study is 109 respondents. The data were collected based on the opinion about ten factors of accountability practices in the department or agency by using seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

Further, the reliability of the data is tested by using Cronbach alpha test, and the validity of data is tested by checking the normality of data through Shapiro Wilk test and graphically. Overall, 87.3% of the respondents mentioned that overall they practice accountability in their department. However, the priority of these ten factors of accountability differs among the services schemes. The accountability in the administrative &amp; diplomatic, education, and medical &amp; health is below the overall average accountability.

The food and feeding habits including types and amount of feed and seasonal pattern of feeding were studied. 168 Aspidoparia morar were collected from the River Padma, Rajshahi, Bangladesh from May to December, 2011. The relationship between total length and alimentary canal length was tested using OLS regression. Qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of stomach and gut contents of each fish were done by percentage of occurrence and point method and fullness of stomach was measured by fullness index method. Aspidoparia morar was omnivorous due to the presence of both phytoplankton (Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae) and zooplankton (Rotifera, Crustacea) in the gut content. Based on the point method, the average percentage of phytoplankton and zooplankton was 80.71% and 19.29%, respectively. The highest average percentage of fullness was 72.62% in October whereas the lowest was 56.55% in December. The highest average percentage of emptiness recorded was 43.45% in December and the lowest was 27.38% in October. Total length was found statistically positively significant (P0.01) with the alimentary canal length.

His performance not only objects to Iranian culture industry, but also emphasizes the importance of an audience as well a proper space in furthering this act.

The expulsion of large numbers of Roma individuals, accompanied by other discriminatory practices and forms of hostility, exclusion and violence against the Roma across Europe, has brought the attention of the media and policy makers to Roma issues to a greater extent than ever before during the last decade. The range of problems still afflicting the lives of many Roma nowadays is extremely wide, well researched and profusely documented. This contribution leaves aside issues related to free movement and EU citizenship, thus moving the debate beyond the narrow framework of the ‘migrant Roma’. The contribution considers the wide range of relevant EU competences in this field, and assesses how comprehensive and appropriate the EU’s approach to Roma issues is. The analysis combines legal instruments, policy papers, and case law, draws from legal and non-legal literature, and integrates considerations of social, economic and cultural nature. In the process, this contribution considers themes that cut across several strands of the EU’s Roma policy, including fundamental rights, intercultural sensitivity, the limits of the ‘integration model’, and issues of enforcement, monitoring and funding. The logical narrative developed puts together the key jigsaw pieces that currently contribute to a EU Roma policy, and clearly identifies the limitations of the current state of affairs. Finally, this contribution interrogates the trends underlying the development of the EU Roma policy and puts forward a range of recommendations.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|ECHR|EU Law|EU policy|European Court of Human Rights|human rights|minorities|Roma|Strasbourg,2019-02-28T16:33:47.765775,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T16:32:55.219062,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/citation/,t2f7b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c77067962c82a0019ddb4ec/,5c77067962c82a0019ddb4ec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t2f7b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t2f7b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t2f7b,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-11373-5_3

We investigate whether the rise of immigration influenced the novel and salient outcome of preferences for greater law enforcement spending. We propose that these preferences are consequential for policymaking, reflect popular demand for punitive social control, and represent micro-level preferences underlying the politics of criminal justice. Motivated by literatures on criminal justice politics, minority threat, and the fear of crime, we examine whether stocks and flows of immigration influence individual-level preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data, we analyze between-country variation with multi-level models of 25 countries in 2006, and within-country variation with differences-in-differences (DD) models of 16 countries with available data in both 1996 and 2006. Both multilevel and DD models show that flows of immigration increase preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Indeed, the coefficients for immigration flows are larger than or comparable in magnitude to the coefficients for any other variable, and are robust net of homicide rates and police officers per 100,000. By contrast, the stock of immigrants is not robustly associated with preferences. The results demonstrate that rising immigration contributed to increasing public support for greater law enforcement spending.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-27T21:33:46.452115,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-27T21:33:06.712957,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",Joshua J Fink; David Brady,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/citation/,92zwa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a76hd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/relationships/node/,a76hd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c76e7de82a3950019cff719/,5c76e7de82a3950019cff719,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/92zwa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/92zwa,NA
