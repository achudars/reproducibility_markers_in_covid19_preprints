(2018) compared levels of EU knowledge among Leave and Remain voters using a 15-item EU knowledge quiz. Their quiz comprised 9 ‘ideologically neutral’ items, as well as 6 items that they deemed more ‘ideologically convenient’ for one side or the other. They found that there was no average difference between Leave and Remain voters, but that Remain voters scored slightly higher on the ‘ideologically neutral’ items (0.09sd), whereas Leave voters scored slightly higher on the ‘ideologically convenient’ items (0.12sd). They also found that those who did not vote scored lower than those who did (0.38sd). The present study attempts to replicate Carl et al.’s findings using data from the British Election Study Panel. It reports a small average advantage for Remain voters, as compared to Leave voters, of 0.05–0.09sd.

Multiple models may offer utility to understand and explain the courses of action through which state cyber missions are executed, including conduct or restraint of cyber effects operations against target systems and networks. This paper evaluates four models - surprise model, duelist model, mating- choice model, and the Black-Scholes model.

Although migration research has established the proximate relationship between armed conflict and increases in migration, much less attention has been paid to the long-term, or distal relationship. This research leverages the case of the 1992-1997 Tajikistani Civil War to examine the distal relationship between armed conflict and migration decisions nearly a decade after the war had ended. Using a series of logistic regression models and a selection-based endogeneity correction, I estimate the likelihood of migrating in 2006, given the intensity of conflict experience at the district level. I find that, controlling for individual, household, and district-level indicators, the legacy of conflict continues to influence migration – for men and for ‘stayers’ – nearly a decade after the peace accord was signed. Some evidence suggests that certain kinds of development projects can moderate this relationship. In conflict-affected countries, incorporating the legacy of conflict into empirical research can help scholars and policy-makers better understand migration in the aftermath of war.",TRUE,FALSE,civil war|development|migration|tajikistan,2019-09-15T11:40:46.531953,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-15T11:40:18.493951,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/citation/,qn5xv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7e13d37483ec001851e918/,5d7e13d37483ec001851e918,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qn5xv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qn5xv

There was an urgent need to conduct an objective analysis of political philosophies and find the factors that influence the political spectrum polarization.  For these purposes, the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was used, as it allows to introduce a fraction of objectivity due to the use of a formalized mathematical apparatus of the theory of sets.

It allows for collateral posting adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out the market price of a collateralized contract. This framework is very useful for valuing outstanding derivatives. Using a unique dataset, we find empirical evidence that credit risk alone is not overly important in determining credit-related spreads. Only accounting for both collateral arrangement and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of derivatives. We also empirically gauge the impact of collateral agreements on risk measurements.

Moore is among the most prominent normative theorists to argue that retributive justice, understood as the deserved suffering of offenders, justifies punishment. Moore claims that the principle of retributive justice is pervasively supported by our judgments of justice and sufficient to ground punishment. We offer an experimental assessment of these two claims, (1) the pervasiveness claim, according to which people are widely prone to endorse retributive judgments, and (2) the sufficiency claim, according to which no non-retributive principle is necessary for justifying punishment. We test these two claims in a survey and a related survey experiment in which we present participants (N = ~900) with the stylized description of a criminal case.

Despite this popularity it is still debated within disciplines how polarization should be conceptualized and how it should be measured. In this study I attempt to provide a systematic, interdisciplinary overview of the conceptual and measurement literature on polarization. I first describe the challenge of conceptualizing polarization, a task that requires taking decisions about how to aggregate individual positions on one or more scales. Different distributional aspects may matter and the concept’s meaning is related to the measurement level of the underlying scales. Subsequently, I review various polarization measures that have been developed during the last decades.",TRUE,FALSE,conceptualization|measurement|polarization|political polarization,2019-09-13T18:51:23.740517,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-13T18:50:55.072439,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/citation/,e5vp8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7b7939710c95001c598c03/,5d7b7939710c95001c598c03,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5vp8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e5vp8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e5vp8

Our study contributes the first population-level analysis of mental health disparities in India, where the two marginalized groups that we study constitute a population larger than that of the United States. Applying two complementary empirical strategies to data on 10,125 adults interviewed by the World Health Organisation's Survey of Global Ageing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE), we document and standardize gaps in self-reported mental health between the dominant social group (higher caste Hindus) and two marginalized social groups (Scheduled Castes and Muslims). We find that differences in socioeconomic status cannot fully explain the large disparities in mental health that we document, especially for Muslims. Our results highlight the need for research to understand the causes and consequences of mental health disparities in India, and for policies to move beyond redistribution and address discrimination against Scheduled Castes and Muslims.",TRUE,FALSE,Caste|India|Mental health|Religion|Social determinants of health|Social Inequality,2019-09-13T18:50:23.146187,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-13T18:50:06.947211,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,Aashish Gupta|Diane Coffey,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/citation/,f3zxb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7aaee59defac001716ea2a/,5d7aaee59defac001716ea2a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3zxb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f3zxb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f3zxb
