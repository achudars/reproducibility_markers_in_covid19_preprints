Based on a unique dataset of 16,624 real rides from Germany, we estimate the effects of drivers’ perceived name origins on the demand for rides. The results show sizable ethnic discrimination – a discriminatory price premium of about 32% of the average market price. Further analyses suggest that additional information about actors in this market decreases the magnitude of ethnic discrimination. Our findings broaden the perspective of ethnic discrimination by shedding light on subtle, everyday forms of discrimination in social markets; inform ongoing discussions about ways to address discrimination in an era in which markets gradually move online; and respond to increasingly recognized limitations of experimental approaches to study discrimination.",TRUE,FALSE,computational social science|discrimination|Ethnic discrimination|migration|sharing economy|social markets|statistical discrimination,2018-07-02T11:03:30.700570,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-16T10:12:12.552632,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/citation/,gefsx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xybaf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/relationships/node/,xybaf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596b3af8b83f69022a42fecd/,596b3af8b83f69022a42fecd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefsx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gefsx/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcy024,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gefsx

In this paper, we dissect this metaphor by distinguishing between different dimensions of the goodness of an explanation: non-sensitivity, cognitive salience, precision, detail, factual accuracy and degree of integration. These dimensions are partially independent and often come into conflict. Our main contribution is to go beyond simple stipulation or description by explicating why these factors are taken to be explanatory virtues in the first place. We accomplish this by using the contrastive-counterfactual approach to explanation and the view of understanding as an inferential ability. By combining these perspectives, we show how the explanatory power of an explanation in a given dimension can be assessed by showing the range of answers it provides to what-if-things-had-been-different questions and the theoretical and pragmatic importance of these questions. We also show how our account explains intuitions linking explanation to unification or to the exhibition of a mechanism.",TRUE,FALSE,explanation|explanatory depth|explanatory power|inference to the best explanation|mechanism|understanding,2018-07-02T11:03:30.648320,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-16T06:05:53.919118,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/citation/,76t9f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j78cb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/relationships/node/,j78cb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596b01946c613b022a192ab0/,596b01946c613b022a192ab0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76t9f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/76t9f/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-008-9324-z,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/76t9f

In the first place, his formulation of the dogma is ambiguous: it can be read in at least four different ways. Secondly, his arguments against the dogma are only able to refute the strongest version of it. The second part of the paper considers the idea that covering laws have a constitutive role in singular causal explanation and argues that this idea is not plausible.

I will restrict my discussion to singular causal explanation, but the basic ideas and the arguments have a broader application. They are relevant also to other kinds of explanations. In the first section I will first present the intuitive idea of contrastive questions, and then elaborate it by discussing typical criteria for the choice of a contrast. I also suggest a novel way to see the difference between scientific and everyday explanatory questions. In the second section I will discuss the major criticisms presented against contrastive theories of explanation in order to further clarify my position. I argue that all explananda can be analyzed as contrastive and that this is a fruitful approach in understanding explanatory questions. I also argue that the contrastive thesis should be understood as a claim about what an explanation can explain, not as a thesis about what the explainee has in her mind. Finally, I defend the thesis that a contrastive explanandum can be reduced to a non-contrastive explanandum against the arguments presented by Dennis Temple and John W.

In this chapter I will employ a well-known scientific research heuristic of studying how something works by focusing on circumstances in which it does not work. Rather than trying to describe what scientific understanding would ideally look like, I will try to learn something about it by looking at mundane cases where understanding is partly illusory. The main thesis of this paper will be the following: scientists are prone to the illusion of depth of understanding (IDU), and as a consequence, they sometimes overestimate the detail, coherence, and depth of their understanding. I will start my argument by presenting an analysis of the notion of understanding and its relation to a sense of understanding. In order to make plausible the claim that these are often disconnected, I will describe an interesting series of psychological experiments by Frank Keil and co-authors. These experiments suggest that ordinary people routinely overestimate the depth of their understanding. In Section 3, I will argue that we should take seriously the possibility that scientific cognition is also affected by IDU. Section 4 will spell out some possible causes of explanatory illusions in science. In the final section, I will discuss how scientific explanatory practices could be improved and how the philosophy of science might be able to contribute to this process.",TRUE,FALSE,explanation|explanatory cognition|illusion|understanding,2018-07-02T11:03:29.965302,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-16T05:13:50.882778,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/citation/,qz7sg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ywnpf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/relationships/node/,ywnpf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596af5856c613b022b192603/,596af5856c613b022b192603,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qz7sg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qz7sg

The Impact of M-PESA’s Network Power on Development as Freedom","The role of ICTs in development is contested between those who believe they will facilitate human development and those who believe they are, at most, impotent, and at worst, counterproductive. This article uses an examination of M-PESA, a large-scale mobile financial service in Kenya, to argue that the impact of ICTs on development as freedom differs with both the specific conceptualization of freedom used, and the institutional arrangement of the technology in question. The article’s novel conceptual model links the adoption of mobile money to its impact, suggesting that the dominant individualistic and instrumental approaches to ICT4D overlook the ways in which power and domination function alongside freedom when these factors are considered relationally and substantively. I demonstrate that the internal plurality of the concept of freedom leads to both new forms of empowerment, but also to limitations on choice and new forms of dominance. In closing, I suggest institutional and technological arrangements that are most likely to maximize the development potential of mobile money.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:03:29.825348,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-15T14:05:25.604303,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/citation/,5ykwm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cdkvn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/relationships/node/,cdkvn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596a20f79ad5a1022b268de7/,596a20f79ad5a1022b268de7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ykwm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ykwm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ykwm
