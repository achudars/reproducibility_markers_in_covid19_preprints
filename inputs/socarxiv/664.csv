Indeed, this is the current situation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with English encroaching into all areas of society, and especially forcefully into the education sector, where English as a medium of instruction (EMI) is on the rise. At the same time, Arabic literacy, the ability to read and write in the language, is declining among UAE youth. Using a mixed-methods design, a study was conducted to gain insights into the use of Arabic by Emirati university students. The study examines how Emirati youth use their native language (i.e., Arabic) in their daily lives, their perception of their own reading and writing skills in Arabic vis-à-vis in English language, and the extent to which they can demonstrate their literacy skills in Arabic. Clear evidence emerged showing that while Arabic as a dialect continues to be spoken and used on a daily basis, Arabic literacy is unquestionably losing ground.

Organization takes three forms: inclusion, regulation, and distinction. Overorganization is an increase in an organization’s size (overinclusion), regulatory activity (overregulation), or subculture (overdistinction). Underorganization is a contraction in size (underinclusion), regulatory activity (underregulation), or subculture (underdistinction). Numerous examples show how conflict is a direct function of the movement of organizational time.

As part of my broader doctoral research on non-government Jordanian radio today, it takes a linguistical anthropological perspective focused on the notion of indexicality: the non-referential meanings that are invoked contingently in language use, and thus articulate links to broader social and cultural ideologies, including stereotypes of identity categories such as gender and geographic origins.

I examine two case studies in which speakers problematise and reframe such stereotypes. The first involves the indexical mechanism of implicature, whereby a talk show caller mounts a challenge to dominant discourses of urban linguistic refinement through the ironic use of a ‘sanitised’ pronunciation of a local Jordanian dish (ča‘āčīl / ka‘ākīl). The second, from a programme in honour of a Jordanian pilot executed by the Islamic State (IS) in Syria, exhibits the performance of an evaluative stance towards Jordanian military activity as a form of patriotic nationalism, through the use of the [g] pronunciation of the sound /q/ (qāf) by a female broadcaster – a usage that defies gendered linguistic norms Jordanian radio, which require female speakers to use the [ʔ] (glottal stop) pronunciation instead.

While these contingent uses of implicature and stance form challenges to certain dominant discourses, they are nevertheless ambiguous in that they draw on other problematic ideologies, including localist linguistic ‘authenticity’ and patriotic Jordanian nationalism. Thus, while details of language use provide important potential for dissent, this paper also problematises this potential – asking whether (1) subversive linguistic practices always need to draw on other dominant discourses in order to be meaningful, and (2) whether such references necessarily make dissent compromised or illegitimate.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab media|Jordan|linguistic anthropology|Middle East studies|radio|resistance,2018-07-02T11:15:52.015690,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-14T05:34:46.165960,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c98|Arts and Humanities|Near Eastern Languages and Societies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/citation/,qfc7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5976e7716c613b022b38a3a8/,5976e7716c613b022b38a3a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qfc7y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qfc7y,NA

That has clearly changed. While Google Scholar shows only nine results for the phrase “sociology of quantification” through 2007, the last decade returns 448. This proliferation of scholarship on numbers goes hand in hand with a proliferation of numbers themselves. New technologies have created a “quantified self,” and the explosion of the internet has produced “big data”. As a senior sociologist recently quipped to one of us, sociology has become quantitative researchers, and qualitative researchers studying quantification. Thus the moment seems ripe for revisiting the sociology of quantification, looking at emerging themes, and seeking signs that a new subfield might be starting to consolidate.

Alas, the news is mixed. Lots of good work is being done. The intellectual space is full of ferment. Yet—and perhaps the fact that we were reviewing books by authors from at least four different disciplines should have clued us in earlier—so far, we seem to be looking at a genre, not a subfield....",TRUE,FALSE,algorithms|big data|numbers|quantification|quantified self|rankings|valuation,2018-07-02T11:15:51.943636,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-14T03:08:00.435059,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/citation/,4sgc2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z5mxh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/relationships/node/,z5mxh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e17e7db83f6902b005f002/,59e17e7db83f6902b005f002,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4sgc2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4sgc2,https://doi.org/10.1177/0094306118767649

We understand the changing themes in these ads as a specific measure of a change from what gun journalist Michael Bane calls Gun Culture 1.0, rooted in hunting and recreational target shooting, to Gun Culture 2.0, centering on personal protection through armed citizenship. Central to Gun Culture 2.0 is the legal carrying of concealed weapons, mostly handguns, in public by ordinary Americans. After briefly reviewing the history of American gun culture, we discuss our analytical approach to studying gun culture through advertising and explain the specific data and methods employed here. Our analysis of this advertising data documents the pattern of decline of Gun Culture 1.0 over the past 100 years and the ongoing rise of Gun Culture 2.0. We also identify the point at which the two centers of gravity in gun culture cross paths.",TRUE,FALSE,advertising|content analysis|culture|firearms|gun culture|guns|material culture,2018-07-02T11:15:51.899943,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-14T00:41:23.124390,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",David Yamane,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/citation/,jt8qa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/asdqt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/relationships/node/,asdqt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e15bdc9ad5a102b2879e7b/,59e15bdc9ad5a102b2879e7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt8qa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jt8qa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jt8qa,NA

As shorthand, I describe this as an evolution from Gun Culture 1.0 to Gun Culture 2.0.  In this paper, I begin by giving a brief history of the rise of Gun Culture 2.0. I then propose a cultural approach to studying gun culture, based on a working definition of culture that emphasizes the ways in which culture helps us to understand the world by defining problems and prospects and helps us to act in the world by suggesting recipes and providing tools for action in relation to those problems and prospects. Here, objects of material culture like guns and gun-related accessories play an important role. Far from being static entities, in addressing the problems associated with carrying concealed weapons in everyday life, these technologies respond to and facilitate the cultural practice of gun carrying which is central to Gun Culture 2.0.  I apply this cultural approach to studying gun culture using ethnographic observation of a Concealed Carry Expo to explore some of the many technologies that have been developed to help those who want to be armed citizens reconcile the competing demands of carrying a concealed handgun in public. These material culture technologies include guns and holsters, as well as products designed to address women’s specific carry needs.",TRUE,FALSE,concealed carry|culture|ethnography|firearms|guns|material culture,2018-07-02T11:15:51.857701,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-14T00:21:51.222650,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",David Yamane,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/citation/,dkwsy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3t4z6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/relationships/node/,3t4z6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e156dab83f6902b2063f3e/,59e156dab83f6902b2063f3e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkwsy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dkwsy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dkwsy,NA
