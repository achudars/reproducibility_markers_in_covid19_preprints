While parents generally enjoy time with children and want more “family time,” evidence also suggests that substantial, unanticipated increases in parenting time may negatively impact at least some mothers’ well-being. We investigate this possibility using surveys (N=139) and in-depth interviews (N=65) with mothers of young children in Southern Indiana conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). We find that mothers who have greatly increased the time they spend caring for their children also disproportionately report increased stress, anxiety, and frustrations with their children. Our qualitative data reveal that disruptions in childcare arrangements, particularly when coupled with intensive work pressures and/or intensive parenting norms, exacerbate the negative impact of increased parenting time on mothers’ well-being. Meanwhile, other mothers are not experiencing increased parenting time as a substantial source of stress, and some are even experiencing increased parenting time as a source of joy in otherwise difficult times.  We discuss the implications of these findings for research on parenting and its impact on women’s health and labor force participation, as well as for policies to support families during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,childcare|COVID-19|family|interviews|mental health|mixed methods|motherhood|parenthood|qualitative|stress|time use|unemployment|work-family,2020-10-04T15:28:08.703085,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-04T15:27:34.037412,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/citation/,jyvk4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7858531cfe6901d5cfb00e/,5f7858531cfe6901d5cfb00e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jyvk4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jyvk4,NA

Much research suggests that cooperation is facilitated by knowing who exactly is a cooperator and defector, and being able to respond accordingly. As such, anonymous games is thought to hinder cooperation. Here, we show that this conclusion is altered dramatically in the presence of conditional cooperation norms and heterogeneous beliefs about others' behaviours. Specifically, we show that inaccurate beliefs about other players' behaviours can in fact help foster and stabilize cooperation via social norms. To show this, we combine the population dynamics of a social community with the game theory of interactions within the community. In our model, individuals can join a community based on beliefs generated by public signals regarding the level of cooperation within, and decide to cooperate or not depending on these beliefs. These signals may overstate how much cooperation there really is. We show that even if individuals eventually learn the true level of cooperation, the initially false beliefs can trigger a dynamic that sustains high level of cooperation within the community. We also characterize how the rates of joining, leaving, and learning in the community affect the cooperation level and community size simultaneously.

For the past fifty years, however, social learning has been regarded as the fundamental driver for the emergence of tradition and culture. As a result, innovation has been relatively understudied, outside the human lineage. This has left basic questions unanswered, such as: What factors promote the creation of new ideas and practices? And what affects whether they are spread or lost? We review the existing literature, focusing on the following four levels of investigation: traits (what sorts of behaviours are easiest to invent?), individuals (what intrinsic and contextual factors make some individuals more likely to invent new things?), populations (what features of social relationships and societies promote the rise and spread of new inventions?), and ecological contexts. We aim to inspire new research agendas by summarizing what is known and highlighting theoretical and empirical gaps in our understanding of the innovative process.

Postdoctoral Experiences in the Swiss Context,"Irrespective of national and disciplinary specificities (Le Feuvre et al 2018), the conditions of entry to an academic career are generally recognized as being increasingly selective in the contemporary context. In the competition for a reduced number of stable or permanent academic positions, recently qualified PhD graduates who want to pursue an academic career face two main challenges. On the one hand, they have to accept a succession of fixed-term, often part-time and badly paid, precarious positions (generically designated as “postdocs”), that have become a prerequisite for selection to more stable and permanent positions in the global academic labour market. On the second hand, access to these positions usually requires some form of geographical – usually transnational – mobility, which removes them from their existing social networks. In this chapter, we propose to analyse the effects of the combination of precarious employment positions and geographical displacement on the gendered citizenship experiences of postdocs working in a specific academic context. On the basis of qualitative (biographical interview) and quantitative (on-line web survey) data collected in the course of the GARCIA project (www.garciaproject.eu), we will examine the citizenship challenges faced by postdocs from across the globe who are working in the Swiss academic context.",TRUE,FALSE,academic work|citizenship|gender|Higher education|postdoc,2020-10-04T15:25:20.583546,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-04T15:25:04.758344,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/citation/,6kjwa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f770576e64e7e015daa77d7/,5f770576e64e7e015daa77d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6kjwa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6kjwa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6kjwa,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-52600-9_3

This study contributes to this line of research by identifying the influence of a central characteristic of social media: message persistence. It was expected that high technical durability of political messages reduces users’ propensity to voice their opinion, moderating the silence effect. A pre-registered experiment (N = 772) revealed a small-to-medium persistence effect in three out of four topical contexts. While perceived congruence with the opinion climate was not associated with the likelihood of opinion expression, the latter could be explained by a mental cost-benefit calculus that was shaped by message persistence.

Particularly, why would some citizens ignore scientific evidence and common logic but, instead, be convinced that COVID-19 was a military experiment or spread by 5G signals? Why would they believe that Bill Gates had anything to do with it? In this contribution, we argue that populism is at the centre of these beliefs, as the complex nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it an ideal playground for populists’ opposition to scientific and political elites. We use Structural Equation Models and panel survey data (n = 823) from the Austrian Corona Panel Project to test this argument. We demonstrate a negative correlation of populist attitudes with both trust in political and scientific institutions, which, in return, negatively relate to COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. This results in an overall positive relationship of populist attitudes and conspiracy beliefs that is independent of political ideology.

We focus on field-experimental studies of hiring discrimination: studies that use fictitious applications from members of different racial and ethnic group to apply for actual jobs. There are more than 140 field experimental studies of hiring discrimination against ethno-racial minority groups in 30 countries. These studies show that racial and ethnic discrimination is a pervasive international phenomenon that has hardly declined over time, although levels vary significantly over countries. The comparative perspective from this body of research helps to move beyond micro-models of employer decision-making to better understand the roles of history, social context, institutional rules, and racist ideologies in producing discrimination. Some racial discrimination is driven by correlated conditions like religion, but the clues producing most discrimination on these bases are fundamentally racialized.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen the HE sector (including universities, publishers and funding bodies) enter a period of upheaval that risks reversing such progress. This article demonstrates how the unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the professional and personal lives of groups currently under-represented in academic STEMM is likely to widen and reproduce systemic inequalities already present within these fields. Evidence emerging from the streamlined COVID-19 related funding call indicates a backward step in gender equity when compared to most recent UKRI figures. The lack of data on other protected characteristics makes understanding and mitigating the damage a significant challenge.

As these institutions start to reopen across the UK and internationally, a number of social distance measures have been adopted in order to safely bring people into their premises and access their collections. Building on Bill Hillier’s theorical model of spatial types and spatial structures (2019), we explore the spatial-curatorial changes implicated in the re-opening of four art museums (The National Gallery, The Tate Britain and Tate Modern in London) and one American museum (The MoMA, New York). Our purpose is not to provide practical solutions, but to set the search for spatial approaches to the re-opening of museums within a theory of spatial structure in space syntax theory and inform the design future of public buildings. We present a model of a three-layered spatial system interfacing the global and local structure of these buildings. We argue that the presence of intersecting cycles of movement in spatial layouts determines their capability for adapting to the one-way routes imposed by the pandemic. The spatial organisation of the display is a second factor influencing the reopening strategies, either limiting or optimising available spatial sequences to meet curatorial criteria.",TRUE,FALSE,circulation|design|pandemic resilience,2020-10-02T07:25:20.613737,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-02T07:24:38.746999,FALSE,NA,no,The data used for this paper concern layout plans of museums that are publicly available on museum websites and maps.

We have gathered categorical data from 751 LinkedIn networks to quantitatively analyze networking tendencies and network gender compositions in the categories gender, age, sector of work, fi?eld of work, level of education and area of residence. We have also determined networking ""savviness"" as a quantitative measure of social networking for comparing groups in the categories. The observations made regarding networking behavior among female and male LinkedIn users include that women on average had more female contacts than men in all categories. Female networks working in a non-technical fi?eld were found to have the most gender equal networks of all groups with an average of 42.5% female contacts. The data show further, that men and women in STEM and the private sector were savvier networkers and that users with a PhD had fewer female contacts on average than those without a PhD. Further, Scandinavian networks had signi?cantly more female contacts in their networks than networks from other European countries and North America had.",TRUE,FALSE,gender equality|professional networking|social communication|social media|social networks,2020-10-02T07:25:46.821615,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-02T07:25:24.035747,FALSE,NA,no,Contact the authors at markus.snellman@gmail.com to request the data.,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication",Anders Lindh Olsson|Markus Snellman|Knut Deppert|Inger Lövkrona,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/citation/,fs9jy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7593e11cfe6900c2cf4f04/,5f7593e11cfe6900c2cf4f04,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fs9jy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fs9jy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fs9jy,NA
