Using administrative data on child protection, criminal justice, and social welfare interventions, I show that children are separated from their families and placed into foster care far more frequently in states with extensive and punitive criminal justice systems than in states with broad and generous welfare programs. However, large welfare bureaucracies interact with welfare program enrollment to create opportunities for the surveillance of families, suggesting that extensive and administratively complex welfare states engage in “soft” social control through the surveillance and regulation of family behavior. The article further shows that  institutionalization, a particularly restrictive form of foster care placement, is least common in states with broad and generous welfare regimes and generally more common under punitive regimes. Taken together, these findings show that policy regimes influence the interaction between families and the state through their proximate effects on family structure and well-being and through institutional effects that delimit the routines and scripts through which policymakers and street-level bureaucrats intervene to protect children.",TRUE,FALSE,Child Welfare|Criminal Justice|Political sociology|Preprint|socarxiv|Social policy|Welfare State,2018-07-02T10:45:15.822598,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-14T02:22:00.406000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/citation/,47u29,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wpvhd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/relationships/node/,wpvhd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786f749594d9001f119db33/,5786f749594d9001f119db33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/47u29/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/47u29,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122416638652

Measuring urban residents’  willingness to coexist with animals,"In the context of rapid urbanisation, geographers are calling for embracing non-humans as urban co-inhabitants, but notions of animals and plants ‘out of place’ manifest in wildlife conflicts. To find paths towards more-than-human cities, we need to better understand residents’ willingness to coexist. This study quantitatively compared residents’ preferences toward sharing their neighbourhood and perceptions of belonging across urban green space in two geographically and culturally distinct cities: Brisbane, Australia and Sapporo, Japan. Results suggest factors influencing respondents’ willingness to coexist were geographical and cultural context alongside educational attainment and age, but not sex and income. Mapping respondents’ preferences for animals in their neighbourhood revealed four categories divided by two axes – global-local and wanted-unwanted animals – arising from the way animals contested human notions of control over urban space. Most respondents chose informal green space (e.g., vacant lots, brownfields etc.) as spaces of belonging after forests and bushland. Drawing upon recent theoretical and empirical research on liminal urban spaces, I argue with Nohl (1990) that such informal green space can offer ‘provisional arrangements’, allowing for conciliatory engagements with non-humans. I thus propose informal green space as territories of encounter – a possible path towards more-than-human cities. Finally, I discuss some implications for planning and management of interspecies interactions.",TRUE,FALSE,Australia|belonging|geography|human-nonhuman relations|informal greenspace|Japan|Preprint|socarxiv|urban geography,2018-07-02T10:49:13.479413,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-14T01:10:15.976000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/citation/,hbcmz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5a7ge/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/relationships/node/,5a7ge,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786e6796c613b01fadc53e2/,5786e6796c613b01fadc53e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hbcmz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hbcmz,https://doi.org/10.11143/fennia.64182

Social networking sites have been critical for linking potential supporters and distributing information. In addition to Facebook pages on the Wall Street Occupation, more than 400 unique pages have been established in order to spread the movement across the US, including at least one page in each of the 50 states. These Facebook pages facilitate the creation of local encampments and the organization of protests and marches to oppose the existing economic and political system. '

Based on data acquired from Facebook, we find that Occupy groups have recruited over 170,000 active Facebook users and more than 1.4 million “likes” in support of Occupations. By October 22, Facebook pages related to the Wall Street Occupation had accumulated more than 390,000 “likes”, while almost twice that number, more than 770,000, have been expressed for the 324 local sites. Most new Occupation pages were started between September 23th and October 5th. On October 11th, occupy activity on Facebook peaked with 73,812 posts and comments to an occupy page in a day. By October 22nd, there had been 1,170,626 total posts or comments associated with Occupation pages. The density of Facebook activism is highest in college towns and in state capitals.

Why did student loans expand so much in the U.S. in the 1990s and 2000s? And how does organization theory suggest their expansion, and the growth of federal student aid more generally, might affect higher education as a field? In the 1960s and 70s, policy actors worked to solve what was then a central problem around student loans: banks' disinterest in lending to students. They did this so well that by 1990, a new field of financial aid policy emerged, in which all major actors had an interest in expanding loans. This, along with a favorable environment outside the field, set the stage for two decades of rapid growth. Organization theory suggests two likely consequences of this expansion of federal student loans and financial aid more generally. First, while (public) colleges have become less dependent on state governments and more dependent on tuition, the expansion of aid means colleges are simultaneously becoming more dependent on the federal government, which should make them more susceptible to federal demands for accountability. Second, the expansion of federal student aid should encourage the spread of forms and practices grounded in a logic focused on students' financial value to the organization, such as publicly traded for-profit colleges and enrollment management practices.",TRUE,FALSE,financialization|higher education|organizations|Preprint|public policy|socarxiv|student loans,2018-07-02T10:48:28.503505,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-14T00:33:44.971000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/citation/,chaq2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ssj6a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/relationships/node/,ssj6a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786ddeab83f6901e9a299ab/,5786ddeab83f6901e9a299ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/chaq2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/chaq2,NA

The theoretical framework draws on a symbolic interactionist perspective, focusing on how meaning is constructed through blogging practices, supplemented by theories of mediation and critical technology studies. The principal evidence in this study is derived from an analysis of in-depth interviews with bloggers selected to maximise their diversity based on the results of an initial survey. This is supplemented by an analysis of personal blogging’s technical contexts and of various societal influences that appear to influence blogging practices.

Bloggers were found to have limited interest in gathering information about their readers, appearing to rely instead on an assumption that readers are sympathetic. Although personal blogging practices have been framed as being a form of radically free expression, they were also shown to be subject to potential biases including social norms and the technical characteristics of blogging services. Blogs provide a persistent record of a blogger’s practice, but the bloggers in this study did not generally read their archives or expect others to do so, nor did they retrospectively edit their archives to maintain a consistent self-presentation.

The empirical results provide a basis for developing a theoretical perspective to account for blogging practices. This emphasises firstly that a blogger’s construction of the meaning of their practice can be based as much on an imagined and desired social context as it is on an informed and reflexive understanding of the communicative situation. Secondly, blogging practices include a variety of envisaged audience relationships, and some blogging practices appear to be primarily
self-directed with potential audiences playing a marginal role. Blogging’s technical characteristics and the social norms surrounding blogging practices appear to enable and reinforce this unanticipated lack of engagement with audiences. This perspective contrasts with studies of computer mediated communication that suggest bloggers would monitor their audiences and present themselves strategically to ensure interactions are successful in their terms. The study also points the way towards several avenues for further research including a more in-depth consideration of the neglected structural factors (both social and technical) which potentially influence blogging practices, and an examination of social network site use practices using a similar analytical approach.",TRUE,FALSE,audience|Blogging|computer mediated communication|Feenberg|Goffman|Preprint|socarxiv|Social Media|symbolic interaction|weblog,2018-07-02T10:51:43.080016,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-13T22:06:45.988000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/citation/,mrq9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h6zur/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/relationships/node/,h6zur,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786bb7b594d9001f119db16/,5786bb7b594d9001f119db16,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrq9v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrq9v,NA

Macroeconomists focused on labor’s share of national income, but ignored
the distribution of income between individuals. Labor economists drew on
newly avail- able survey data to explain wage disparities. By relying on
surveys, these scholars unintentionally eliminated top incomes from view:
surveys top-coded high incomes and thus were incapable of detecting the
rise of the 1%. Studies of top incomes that relied on income tax data fell
by the wayside, creating the conditions under which experts, policymakers,
and the public alike could be surprised by the rise of the 1%. This
historical study offers insights into the political power of economic
expertise by clarifying the complex linkages between observations, stylized
facts, causal theories, and policy attention.",TRUE,FALSE,socarxiv|workingpaper,2018-07-02T10:45:17.915138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-13T20:32:34.549000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/citation/,4dws8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/228dt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/relationships/node/,228dt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786a566594d9001f419daf0/,5786a566594d9001f419daf0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4dws8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4dws8,NA

Further, consumption of pornography remains a major difference in the sexual experiences of men and women. Yet research has not addressed how opposition to pornography has changed over the this period, despite shifts in the accessibility and visibility of pornography as well as new cultural and legal issues presented by the advent of Internet pornography. We examine gender differences in opposition to pornography from 1975 to 2012, measured by support for legal censorship of pornography in the General Social Survey. Results show that both men’s and women’s opposition to pornography have decreased significantly over the past 40 years, suggesting a cultural shift toward “pornographication” affecting attitudes. However, women remain more opposed to pornography than men, and men’s opposition has declined faster, so the gender gap in opposition to pornography has widened, indicating further divergence of men’s and women’s sexual
attitudes over time. This is consistent with the increasingly normative nature of pornography consumption for men, increases over time in men’s actual consumption of pornography, and its increasingly degrading depiction
of women.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:17.964036,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-13T20:03:33.153000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/citation/,4dymx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ub9su/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/relationships/node/,ub9su,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57869e96b83f6901eea2988b/,57869e96b83f6901eea2988b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4dymx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4dymx,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496515604170
