undertaken by the library anthropologist and the Usability Task Force (UTF)
for reconfiguring the library's physical and virtual spaces to meet the
educational needs and expectations of users, including students, faculty,
and community patrons. Through formal usability studies and ethnographic
research, the paper describes the process and work undertaken by the
library anthropologist and the UTF. Through surveys, focus groups
observation data were obtained about the current study and web habits of
undergraduates and faculty. This paper presents an ethnographic approach to
policy development and implementation to re-orient the physical and virtual
library environments at a large research library. Libraries and library
administrators will find value in the policies established and processes
outlined for the development of user-centered learning spaces.

How welfare conditionality undermines citizenship for vulnerable groups,"Underpinned by the assumption that unemployed persons are passive recipients of welfare, recent welfare reforms have increased benefit conditionality in the UK and introduced harsher penalties for failure to meet these conditions. Yet, conditionality may result in vulnerable groups disproportionately experiencing disentitlement from benefits, one of the rights of social citizenship, because they are, in some cases, less able to meet these conditions. Rising sanctions, then, may be the product of a disconnection between welfare conditionality and the capabilities of vulnerable claimants. To test this hypothesis, we evaluate whether sanctions are higher in areas where there are more vulnerable Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants, namely, lone parents, ethnic minorities, and those with disabilities. We find that sanction rates are higher in local authorities where more claimants are lone parents or live with a disability, and that this relationship strengthened since welfare reforms under the Conservative-led coalition.

workers. In the UK, there is considerable public interest in access to
creative jobs, and a concern that these jobs are limited to those from
privileged backgrounds. Moreover, both inequalities in cultural work and
the attitudes of cultural workers have been important areas of study for
existing research. Based on a web survey (N=2487), this
article investigates attitudes among creative workers, and finds that the
characteristics that are most consistently associated with success by
creative workers are hard work and ambition, rather than structural
factors, such privileged social origins, gender or ethnicity. Using
principal components analysis and regression, we show that there are three
main factors related to getting ahead, associated with reproduction,
meritocracy, and education, and we show that those in the most privileged
positions – broadly, the highest-paid white non-disabled men – are those
most likely to deny an account of success in the creative industries associated with cultural reproduction. We
conclude that the attitudes held by creative workers, and who holds which
attitudes, make it unlikely that access to the sector and trajectories of
individual progression within the sector will change.

Examining the gender composition of the jobs that racial minority men occupy provides critical insights into mechanisms of broader racial disparities in the labor market – in addition to stalled occupational desegregation trends between men and
women. Using nationally representative data from the three-year American Community Survey (2010–2012), we examine racial/ethnic and educational differences in which men occupy gender-typed jobs. We find that racial minority men are more likely than white men to occupy female-dominated jobs at all levels of education—except highly-educated Asian/Pacific Islander men—and that these patterns are more pronounced at lower levels of education.

Based on well over a million person-level observations, this study covers 18 OECD countries and a period from 1975 to 2005.

Work-family reconciliation policies were shown to reduce the employment gap between mothers and women without children, while policies financially supporting families with children enlarge this motherhood-employment gap. Very long periods of leave, however, negatively affect the employment of mothers. More educated mothers benefit more from reconciliation policies than the less educated.
