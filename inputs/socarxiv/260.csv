However, there has been no systematic attempt to look at it from a youth angle as their career goal. The main objective of this study was to examine the entrepreneurship development policy and institutional support dimensions towards the entrepreneurial expectations for choose entrepreneurship as their career goal referring to youth segment. For this study, 70 registered youth entrepreneurs from 10 different sectors of the VIDATHA program of Ministry of Technology and Research (MTR) during the year 2012 were identified. The primary data was collected directly from a youth through questionnaire.  Regression model was utilized for predicting the level of youth entrepreneurs’ expectation as a dependent Variable and the independent variables categorized using entrepreneurship policy criteria (policy relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability) and Institutional support criteria (entrepreneurial culture, education, business development support and access to finance). The results of the study advocated that promotion of entrepreneurial culture and business development support services were the significant contributors for the youth entrepreneurs’ expectations towards Institutional Support and the efficiency of the policy is the significant unique contributor to the prediction of youth entrepreneurs’ expectation towards entrepreneurship policy. The major challenge faced by youth entrepreneurs is to transform their enterprises into commercially viable, competitive business. Also entrepreneurship development projects have different goals and objectives, in terms of target group, political agenda and types of interventions. Further, there is no single policy model for encouragement and promotion of entrepreneurial activity among youth. Therefore, it is recommend establishing single institutional framework for promotion of entrepreneurial activity among youth and suggesting for formulating single policy model for encouragement and promotion of entrepreneurial activity among youth and key promoting agency with the combination of all sectors.",TRUE,FALSE,Career Option|Entrepreneurship Development|Entrepreneurship Policy|Institutional Support|Youth Entrepreneurship,2020-01-28T21:33:45.530231,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-28T17:40:46.836181,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,D.

This means that security is a quality of life issue as well as one of crime prevention. Here we propose that, in addition to preventing crime and being cost effective, security should preferably be ethical and unobtrusive, aesthetically neutral or pleasing, and the easy-to-use or default option. We describe security with such characteristics as ‘elegant’. We use two case studies to explore how, as many types of crime have declined in recent decades, there was an increase in elegant and a decrease in inelegant security. We suggest that the lifecycle of some security technologies sees them evolve from inelegant to elegant, that continual improvement is required to keep ahead of offender adaptations, and that inelegant security can fall into disuse even if it prevents crime.

From the publications, it is evident that advent of computers and mobile technologies or information and communication technologies (ICTs) had caused an uncleared confusion in naming and operating a CIS. Aimed at highlighting this problem and giving a recipe for a CIS to impact maximally on education, health and overall development, this work is a critical analysis of the literature. It found most CISs reported on inadequate and ineffective. While a majority of sponsors believe that CIS is solely about ICTs, a few think it is about either a library or a combination of a library and ICTs. Ten names were found for a CIS, including community information centre (CIC), telecentre, community information and communication technology centre, community library, community multimedia centre, cybercafé and information kiosk. Stock and services provided depended on the name. One thing common is the expectation that people should go for information when they need it. There is little thought about the reality that many people may not know they need information and about how to serve people who are incapacitated in other ways to go or ask for information. Thinking critically about all these alongside the goal of CIS achievable only with ICT and non-ICT resources and strategies that match every community member’s differences, preferences, deficiencies and constraints, the researcher concludes that any other name than CIC is needless.

The problem is not simply that Ethics as a domain of governance is not well understood by the technology industry, but that it is either restricted in mainstream dialogue to a discussion of risk and safety issues, or it is conflated with regulatory compliance. The terms used to for structures to manage ethics, such as ‘Ethics Boards’ and ‘Ethics Councils’ are also used interchangeably. What this paper proposes is to define Digital Ethics in terms where it becomes clear that it is necessarily a separate topic of governance to regulatory compliance and technical risk/ safety management. This paper also suggests some defining characteristics of Ethics Boards and Councils and proposes alternative models. Finally, a case is made for how the quality of ethics governance can be measured and therefore managed, in order to build comparisons between organisations in language that will be familiar to investors and consumers.

This issue is investigated quantitatively by connecting it with the way authorship on papers is distributed. I analyzed a large bibliographic dataset made available by Microsoft under the name Academic Graph  to create a histogram with the number of articles an author produces per year. The histogram has the shape of a pyramid, and different layers in it correlate with positions in the academic hierarchy. The super-prolific authors at the top of the pyramid with more than 40 publications per year are usually heads of large institutes with many subgroups and large numbers of PhD students, while the bottom of the pyramid is populated by PhD students and Postdocs with less than 5 publications per year.

Using an original dataset of about 44,000 British social scientists and bibliographic information about their published, peer-reviewed articles, I show that the introduction of standardized research evaluations disrupted local academic labor markets in British higher education, leading to patterns of interinstitutional mobility that altered the epistemic diversity of social science disciplines and the organization of their academic fields. Much like market-based interventions, research evaluations lead to a form of epistemic matching that has distinct consequences on how knowledge is generated. In particular, when evaluations affect organizational units (such as academic departments) and stress disciplinary norms, they foster forms of isomorphism that lead to reductions in a discipline’s thematic diversity and a more homogeneous structure for the field. This paper thus advances the sociology of knowledge by showing how epistemic change occurs not only through the individual realignments of quantified scholars but, as importantly, through the mediation of interinstitutional mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,computational social science|knowledge|quantification|research evaluation|science of science,2020-01-28T21:35:45.322606,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-28T17:56:16.777031,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/citation/,yzkfu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f5b29af7593003dbdc108/,5e2f5b29af7593003dbdc108,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yzkfu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yzkfu

Recently, authors claimed polygenic scores provide evidence that a significant portion of differences in cognitive performance between Black and white populations are caused by genetic differences due to natural selection, the “hereditarian hypothesis”. This study aims to show conceptual and methodological flaws of past studies supporting the hereditarian hypothesis.
Materials and Methods: Polygenic scores for educational attainment were constructed for African and European samples of the 1000 Genomes Project. Evidence for selection was evaluated using an excess variance test. Education associated variants were further evaluated for signals of selection by testing for excess genetic differentiation (Fst). Expected mean difference in IQ for populations was calculated under a neutral evolutionary scenario and contrasted to hereditarian claims.
Results: Tests for selection using polygenic scores failed to find evidence of natural selection when the less biased within-family GWAS effect sizes were used. Tests for selection using Fst values did not find evidence of natural selection. Expected mean difference in IQ was substantially smaller than postulated by hereditarians, even under unrealistic assumptions that overestimate genetic contribution.
Conclusion: Given these results, hereditarian claims are not supported in the least. Cognitive performance does not appear to have been under diversifying selection in Europeans and Africans. In the absense of diversifying selection, the best case estimate for genetic contributions to group differences in cognitive performance is substantially smaller than hereditarians claim and is consistent with genetic differences contributing little to the Black-white gap.",TRUE,FALSE,Evolutionary Biology|Genetics|Genomics|Hereditarianism|Natural Selection|Race,2020-01-27T23:10:41.382453,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-27T23:08:59.805186,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://zenodo.org/record/4284020#.YBnL__tKhuV,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/citation/,2qfkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f3e23e71ef8001f1896d6/,5e2f3e23e71ef8001f1896d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2qfkt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2qfkt

These people are often vulnerable, and their safe and early return is a key factor in preventing them from coming to serious harm. One approach to quickly find missing people is to disseminate appeals for information using social media. Yet despite the popularity of twitter-based missing person appeals, presently little is known about how to best construct these messages to ensure they are shared far and wide. This paper aims to build an evidence-base for understanding how police accounts tweet appeals for information about missing persons, and how the public engage with these tweets by sharing them. We analyse 1,008 Tweets made by Greater Manchester Police between the period of 2011 and 2018 in order to investigate what features of the tweet, the twitter account, and the missing person are associated with levels of retweeting. We find that tweets with different choice of image, wording, sentiment, and hashtags vary in how much they are retweeted. Tweets that use custody images have lower retweets than Tweets with regular photos, while tweets asking the question “have you seen...?” and asking explicitly to be retweeted have more engagement in the form of retweets.

We explore how this inattention to race and racism developed. First, we outline a history of the new economic sociology as it emerged in the 1980s and defined itself against dominant trends in economics and sociology through its emphasis on the role of meso-level social orders in shaping economic action. Second, we offer a partial explanation for how economic sociology came to ignore race, highlighting both programmatic and contextual factors. Economic sociology's intellectual agenda emphasized identifying the local social factors that made possible the seemingly rational behavior of elite economic actors. As such, economic sociologists studied primarily white men and white- dominated institutions, but, in line with understandings of race and racism at the time and in keeping with the field's emphasis on networks over category memberships, did not recognize the role of race in these settings. Economic sociologists did not study poverty or racial inequality, and so economic sociology was understood as not being about race. This strategy was capable of succeeding in an academic context where studies of race and racism centered racial attitudes, failed to theorize whiteness, and typically treated race as an individual-level variable. Third, we elaborate on two consistent foci of the subfield – ethnic enclaves and corporate interlocks. The canonical literature on ethnic enclaves conceptualized these spaces as sites for researching social capital, but not as sites for studying processes of racialization, leading this literature to largely ignore the role of racism in differences between ethnic enclaves. In contrast, the literature on interlocks ignored race and gender, despite the overwhelming dominance of white men on corporate boards.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-27T17:40:26.168239,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-27T17:40:08.940841,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/citation/,eg9f7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f07fa87a1d9024c1ce1b4/,5e2f07fa87a1d9024c1ce1b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eg9f7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eg9f7

This article is based on an empirical study of intern labour in the Cultural and Creative Industries in Ireland. The data consists of a survey of workers and interns, and interviews with interns past and present. Through approaching internships as a form of precarisation, and intern labour through the lens of ‘fictional expectations’, this article provides an analysis of intern labour as a form of regenerative precarisation through the self-reinforcing tendencies of action, subjectivity, discursive constructs and social structures. The labour market practice of interning creates discursive, normative and structural patterns of precarisation. These patterns in turn shape subjective and intersubjective expectations of work and life, impacting on the actions that individuals make and thus acting as drivers of further precarisation.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural and Creative Industries|Fictional Expectations|Individualisation of Risks|Internships|Regenerative Precarisations|subjectivity,2020-01-27T17:41:04.614845,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-27T17:40:46.716204,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/citation/,7pg3m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f05fe87a1d9024e1cd3ad/,5e2f05fe87a1d9024e1cd3ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pg3m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7pg3m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7pg3m
