Using high-quality register data on the wealth of parents during the year of partnering, we show that the correlation between partners’ levels of parental wealth is considerably lower compared to estimates from earlier research on other countries. Nonetheless, parental wealth homogamy is high at the very top of the parental wealth distribution, and individuals from wealthy families are relatively unlikely to partner with individuals from families with low wealth. Parental wealth correlations among partners are higher when looking only at parental assets rather than net wealth, implying that the former might be a better measure for studying many social stratification processes. Most specifications indicate that homogamy increased in the 2000s relative to the 1990s, but trends can vary depending on methodological choices. The increasing levels of parental wealth homogamy raise concerns that, over time, partnering behavior has become more consequential for wealth inequality between couples.",TRUE,FALSE,Assortative Mating|Cohabitation|Homogamy|Inequality|Intergenerational Processes|Marriage|Social Stratification|Wealth,2019-03-28T14:34:22.632795,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-28T14:34:13.441690,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/citation/,w4bzx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9bdd51aae20b0017b0f7b2/,5c9bdd51aae20b0017b0f7b2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w4bzx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w4bzx,NA

We investigate the extent to which immigrants and children of immigrants have contributed to the decline in adolescent heavy episodic drinking in Oslo, the capital of Norway.

Methods: We use repeated cross-sectional survey data on adolescents in grades 9-11 in Oslo (aged around 14–16, N = 54,474) from 1996 to 2018. We use data on heavy episodic drinking/intoxication in the past 12 months (dichotomized), immigrant background, sex and grade. We decompose the trend into components attributable to changes in the demographic composition of the adolescent population (by immigrant background, grade and sex), and to changes in drinking patterns within different groups. Confidence intervals (CIs) are obtained by bootstrap resampling.

Results: The proportion of adolescents with immigrant backgrounds increased from 21% to 35% over the time span. The proportion reporting having been intoxicated fell from 42% to 25%. Most of the decline stems from reduced heavy episodic drinking in the majority population, accounting for 70.8% of the reduction (95% CI: 67.5–74.2). The increased proportion of adolescents with an immigrant background accounts for 21.4% of the decline (95% CI: 19.2–23.8).

Four tests across nine cities,"Objectives: Research evidence on schools as a factor in the distribution of neighborhood violence has produced varying and at-times directly contradictory results. Drawing conclusions from existing research is also complicated by data limitations and methodological differences. The present study sought to further research in this area using a novel open-data source.

Methods: Police-recorded assault and personal robbery data from nine large US cities were used to test four hypotheses (derived from the routine activities approach) on spatio-temporal patterns of violence around schools. Multi-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo models were used to reflect the clustered structure of the data.

Results: The presence of a public secondary (middle or high) school in a census block group was associated with higher daytime assault and robbery counts on weekdays when schools were in session but not on non-school weekdays, and the effect was larger for larger schools. No such relationships were found for elementary schools. However, there were variations between cities, in that there was no effect in one city and the effect sizes in other cities varied substantially.

Conclusions: The results were consistent with the routine activites approach, suggesting a role for middle and high schools in the distribution of neighbourhood violence. The differences between cities suggest that studying multiple cities is important in the investigation of crime and place, and that open data may provide a mechanism for overcoming the data-access difficulties that have previously limited multi-city studies of spatio-temporal variations in crime.",TRUE,FALSE,crime|open data|routine activities|schools,2019-07-24T23:36:15.896251,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-26T19:44:00.112407,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/citation/,sg2qt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ah9sz/,ah9sz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9a4836f718460018b49703/,5c9a4836f718460018b49703,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sg2qt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sg2qt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sg2qt,NA

We test this argument by comparing the evolution of wages between men and women before the onset of family formation and gendered household specialization. We use a cohort study of young adults for Switzerland (TREE 2000–2014) and match the two sexes on their intellectual ability and educational attainment before they enter the labour market. We then use the ensuing survey waves to account for human capital and job characteristics as well as for values towards work and family. We replicate our analysis with a second panel study of Swiss graduate students. We find in both cohort studies an unexplained gender wage gap of between 3 to 6 percent in favour of men. This result suggests that young women earn lower wages than young men with the same productive characteristics long before they have children. Translated into annual wages, this means that young women lose out on half a monthly wage each year in comparison to young men.",TRUE,FALSE,Early career|Gender Inequality|Gender Wage Gap|Labour market|Switzerland,2019-07-24T23:36:09.022436,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-26T00:19:11.714840,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/citation/,sazxj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cnb4f/,cnb4f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c98da0c5a0cd30019f41546/,5c98da0c5a0cd30019f41546,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sazxj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sazxj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sazxj,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcz009

In order to make such a regulatory indicator, different national banks need to be  made comparable according to a common metric. Despite a substantive literature, little empirical work has been done on the social and political processes through which these indicators are made. We use Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to study how commensuration is negotiated. We find that despite a preference for commensuration, regulators allow ‘incommensurable’ categories to exist because of their unrecognised regulatory benefits.",TRUE,FALSE,Actor-Network Theory (ANT)|capture|commensuration|gaming|Regulatory indicators|transnational knowledge controversies,2019-07-24T23:36:07.922433,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-26T19:43:12.060480,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/citation/,u79pg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c98ac8674462c0018aeefd9/,5c98ac8674462c0018aeefd9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u79pg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u79pg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u79pg,https://doi.org/10.1080/19460171.2019.1594328

This project was initiated in response to concerns about the openness and trustworthiness of science and is applicable and valuable in many fields. Here, we argue that this value cannot be extended everywhere, since the epistemic content of fields, as well as their accountability infrastructures, differ. Furthermore, we argue that there are limits to replicability across all fields; but in some fields, including parts of the humanities, these limits severely undermine the value of replication to account for the value of research.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|epistemic pluralism|humanities|replicability|replication|reproducibility|reproduction,2019-07-24T23:36:16.903209,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-25T21:22:18.050010,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/citation/,nfjb6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c98943e74462c0016afb7f5/,5c98943e74462c0016afb7f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjb6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nfjb6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nfjb6,NA
