This article identifies Hollifield’s “migration state” as a useful tool for comparative analysis yet notes that in its current version the concept is limited, given its focus on economic immigration in advanced liberal democracies. We suggest a framework for extending the “migration state” concept by introducing a typology of nationalizing, developmental, and neoliberal migration management regimes.

This raises questions of how stacking persists and how opportunities arise for athletes of different races to assume different roles. Demographic data on 41,484 NCAA football players reveal differences in opportunities and playing roles for student-athletes of different races. In concert with previous racial stacking studies, white players continue to be overrepresented in central, leadership positions. Racial minorities are overrepresented in peripheral ‘skill’ positions. Stacking at each playing position is affected differently by the demographics of player high schools and college teams. Players assuming non-stereotypical roles are much more likely to come from a racially homogenous high school or college team. Even though racially homogenous schools provide stereotype-defying opportunities, they also exhibit intense racial stacking. The few white (or black) players on such teams are overwhelmingly slotted into stereotypical positions. Since stereotype-defying opportunities tend to emerge in racially homogenous schools, blacks playing typically white positions come from relatively poor schools. In contrast, whites playing typically black positions are relatively affluent, since such opportunities tend to emerge in whiter, wealthier schools. Implications for student opportunities and talent inculcation beyond the football field are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,college|football|high school|labor markets|leadership|ncaa|race|sport|stereotypes|talent,2019-09-08T17:03:01.250905,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-08T17:02:50.366165,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/citation/,zmj28,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7525d434e7c20017400ba6/,5d7525d434e7c20017400ba6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmj28/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmj28/,https://doi.org/10.1123/ssj.2017-0125,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmj28

Furthermore, I investigate how career interruptions developed after the German reunification in the old and new states and whether a convergence of re-entry behaviour can be observed. Following research questions are addressed: Which factors are more important: attitudes towards the employment of mothers, which were transferred through socialisation in childhood and adolescence, or institutional arrangements shaped by parental leave regulations? Based on data from the IAB ALWA study (‘Working and Learning in a Changing World’), the results show that even twenty years after the German reunification, significant differences between women in East and West Germany are found to exist with respect to family related employment interruptions.",TRUE,FALSE,discrete-time event history analysis|maternal employment|parental leave legislation,2019-09-06T15:29:42.761653,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-06T15:29:10.237772,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/citation/,haq3r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d723b9e01a9f9001751153c/,5d723b9e01a9f9001751153c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/haq3r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/haq3r/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/haq3r

To instrument for total emigration over several decades, we exploit severe local frost shocks that sparked an initial wave of emigration, interacted with within-country travel costs. Our estimates show that emigration substantially increased the local demand for political change, as measured by labor movement membership, strike participation, and voting. Emigration also led to de facto political change, increasing welfare expenditures as well as the likelihood of adopting more inclusive political institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,Institutions|Labor unions|Migration,2019-09-06T15:28:44.477885,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-06T15:28:22.023686,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,University of Chicago,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/citation/,y4wgm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6w5vu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/relationships/node/,6w5vu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d721d74dab10800172b7318/,5d721d74dab10800172b7318,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4wgm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4wgm/,https://doi.org/10.1086/701682,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4wgm
