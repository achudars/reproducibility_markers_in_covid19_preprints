The report's significance draws on the modern linguistic trends towards research on the structural, semantic, and functional peculiarities of compound terminological units. Moreover, it is relevant to study compound term-nouns as specific lexical content of English electrical engineering texts. The article's scientific novelty is in integrated and systematic research of compound term-nouns in electrical engineering because of semantics, stylistics, and lexicology. The study used a continuous sampling method and drew on a collection of English scientific and technical texts with 10296 pages. Compound term-nouns have been systematized according to their semantics. In electrical engineering, they consist of seven micro fields. According to the degree of abstraction, compound term-nouns have been classified into abstract and concrete. We revealed that in the texts on electrical engineering, abstract compound term-nouns dominate. Concerning the degree of stylistic features, we have arranged compound term-nouns into stylistically colored and stylistically neutral. As to usage frequency, we have researched that science textbook is the primary source of functioning compound term-nouns in electrical engineering. In respect to functional coloring, compound term-nouns have been classified into neologisms, obsolete vocabulary, archaisms, occasionalisms, and borrowings. We have found that in texts on electrical engineering borrowings, prevail.

The success of communication is always the shared responsibilities of both communicators – the sender and the recipient.  The article offers the theoretical assumptions and practical results of the research on the communicative correlation between the phenomenon of intersubjectivity, and the existence of the communication styles – assertive, aggressive, and submissive. The authors introduce a semiological approach to the paradigm of intersubjective processes, apply the conversation analysis to the material of English fictional discourse, and characterize the nonverbal profiles of the communication styles under investigation. The article aims at highlighting the specificity of intersubjectivity realization in different communicative styles according to the degree criterion and intensity features. The main findings of the research  reveal the intersubjectivity as a communicative style forming principle, which differently actualizes the concept of ''self and other'' and manages the creation of the communicative climates (supportive or unsupportive) via verbal and nonverbal behaviors of the sender and the recipient who can or cannot demonstrate their intersubjective competence.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-30T05:38:21.763796,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:37:58.323685,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/citation/,6j43n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdc779c623190125d82b8a/,5fbdc779c623190125d82b8a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j43n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6j43n/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6j43n

It is based on the lasting experience of teaching Russian and English languages and cultures to students from many European, Asian, and African countries trained as Russian and English philologists at the Kyiv National Linguistic University. Intercultural literacy is one of the conditions sine qua non for successful communications and career in the rapidly globalizing world. Intercultural awareness in the Foreign Language Classroom can be raised by incorporating literary texts written in target languages into the curriculum. In addition to being instrumental for acquiring linguistic prowess, they can also play a substantial part in fostering (inter)cultural competences in non-native speakers. The two texts by contemporary Russian and British writers (Tatiana Tolstaya’s The Slynx and Jeannette Winterson’s The Stone Gods) were selected as case studies due to their artistry in addressing familiar and relevant human concerns, while containing specific cultural codes to be deciphered and understood by the international students. It was established that the success of the teaching/learning process relies on the interactive dialogic qualities inherent in the texts under study and enabling comparative, interdisciplinary, and cross-cultural approaches to them, thus contributing to the formation of full-fledged intercultural speakers.

This paper seeks to answer the following questions: could one apply the principles of competency-based education to create an appropriate educational environment for prospective English as Second Language teachers; would it improve the way to design the programs for their professional training and advance the language teaching process in Ukrainian Universities? This article reports on an investigation associated with the implementation of a pedagogical experiment that proves the effectiveness of the specially modeled educational environment created to design the training programs for prospective English as second language teachers within competency-based education at Taras Shevchenko National University and Donbas State Pedagogical University. This paper contains the comparative analysis of two Philology Master students groups to discover whether the traditional educational environment or competency-based one produces a better educational effect on the language teaching process.

This study aims to seek out the challenges of teaching and learning Business English in Ukrainian universities. Considerable experience as Business English teachers at several Ukrainian universities and ongoing contact with colleagues in the professional community of ESP teachers, provides an opportunity to affirm that the results we found in the empirical study are typical for most Ukrainian universities. This assumption was also supported in the discussions with the ESP teachers from different regions of Ukraine during the British Council's “English for Universities” project (2015-2018). Data collection was done by conducting a questionnaire survey for the ESP practitioners that had the issues in teaching ESP course at the Faculty of Economics, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv The findings revealed the challenges that ESP practitioners face, particularly: difference in students’ language competence, course content selection, lack of motivation, in-class hours etc. and possible solutions in overcoming the constraints in teaching. The study suggests that Business English practitioners should develop and improve practical tools for evaluation and certification of results following the requirements and further improvements should be implemented in the methodology and organization of ESP teaching, the content of the course, the course design, the development of course-books and supplementary teaching materials for each specialty.",TRUE,FALSE,Business English|ESP challenges|ESP teaching and learning|the role of ESP practitioner|Ukrainian Universities,2020-12-01T06:15:40.782669,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-01T06:15:16.168771,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/citation/,4q5cw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdbeb3a72563012183297d/,5fbdbeb3a72563012183297d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4q5cw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4q5cw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4q5cw

The paper aims to prove that some metaphors imply the meaning of negation in the dialogues and monologues and to identify the common and divergent parameters of the cognitive-figurative realization of negation in English and Ukrainian. The investigation is grounded on the methods of comparative analysis, conceptual analysis, contextual analysis, and analysis of the dictionary definitions. The study of communicative-pragmatic features of the use of metaphors reveals that they perform the objecting function in the media. Still, they differ from specialized grammatical means of negation in the emotional and associative background, dependence on the context, and vast opportunities of the interpretation. The obtained results indicate that in both languages, metaphors with the implicit negation are connected to the verbalization of the same nine basic concepts: UNTRUTH, INVALIDITY, FAILURE, INEFFICACIOUSACY, RELUCTANCE, UNCERTAINTY, USELESSNESS, INACTION, ABSENCE OF PROSPECT. The study found that often such metaphors are the result of transferring close or similar domains. The authors conclude that English and Ukrainian, despite the fundamental differences in the grammatical realization of the negation, are very similar in the ways of formation the metaphors with the negative meaning. The paper gives some methodological recommendations for a more effective study of the metaphors with implicit negation in the higher educational institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,concept|idiom|implicit negation|metaphor|the English language|the Ukrainian language,2020-12-01T06:22:00.791703,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-01T06:21:46.236252,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/citation/,d4vgw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdbd8cab6518010bb0f9af/,5fbdbd8cab6518010bb0f9af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4vgw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d4vgw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d4vgw

In such a case, teaching translation is more than a challenge, primarily if students are taught the bilateral interpretation (Russian and English language combinations), and each of the mentioned above languages is a foreign one for them (our students are from China, Turkey, Japan, Algeria, Egypt, South Korea, and other countries). What are the invariant unbiased difficulties for foreigners determined by the grammatical system of the language combination? Should teachers consider phonetics and peculiar phonetic properties, or is it just enough to familiarize students with them? What are the optimal teaching methods and exercises? What is more important in translation, equivalence, or accuracy?  Are the methods of consecutive interpretation’s teaching applicable in bilateral interpretation teaching? To answer these problematic questions, we dedicated our article to the specific features of teaching international students. The study is based on our practical experience of teaching international students. We also present our most productive teaching methods, exercises, and the use of available digital technologies of the 21st century.",TRUE,FALSE,accuracy|bilateral interpretation|equivalence|exercises|grammatical system|phonetic peculiar properties|teaching methods,2020-12-01T06:22:43.469834,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-01T06:22:14.419343,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/citation/,eqcp2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdbc61a7256301128328ab/,5fbdbc61a7256301128328ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqcp2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eqcp2/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eqcp2
