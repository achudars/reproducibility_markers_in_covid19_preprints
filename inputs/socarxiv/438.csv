The point of departure of my argument is the Ili-
Wawas Integrated Project, a combined logging and agricultural project which seeks to bring economic development to the remote Pomio district of East New 
Britain Province by connecting existing logging roads to the limited national road network around the provincial capital. Developing the national road network and creating standardized or—to use James Scott’s concept—legible environments can be seen as an integral part of state-making and strengthening the role of the state. In addition to the environment, the state also needs to 
make social life legible in forms of maps, censuses and laws. As I will argue in my paper, the Ili-Wawas, and other similar projects, may indeed strengthen the role of the state not only by creating the infrastructure and legibility needed by the state, but also in unintended and accidental ways. The side effects of logging and road building include, among others, fear of crime and land disputes. It is these that create among the locals a perceived need for state institutions, which may be as significant in advancing the role of the state as is the creation of infrastructure and legibility.",TRUE,FALSE,development|land dispute|legibility|neoliberalism|Papua New Guinea|road building|state,2018-12-16T15:21:05.662148,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-16T15:20:46.048020,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/citation/,fxyh7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gmwht/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/relationships/node/,gmwht,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1654dce979520017e377cd/,5c1654dce979520017e377cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxyh7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxyh7,NA

By contributing to state formation in this way, the inhabitants of Pomio also make claims on what the state should be like. While plantations become governable and statelike spaces, they do not produce simply governable subjects, nor do they produce a uniformly governable territory but an uneven space in which some places are more governable than others.

The answer to this question may shed some light on two widely debated issues: (1) Is cultural capital essentially an instrument of exclusion adopted by economic-based classes, with the status dimension of social stratification being an epiphenomenon of class structure? (2) Is cultural participation governed by strategic status-seeking? This paper argues that possible combinations of answers to these questions suggest three different scenarios of reactions to the loosening of links between distribution of cultural and economic capital: “meltdown” (the failure of high culture to mark boundaries of an economically privileged group results in a considerable decline in cultural participation, particularly among younger individuals (DiMaggio and Mukhtar, 2004), “transfer” (status culture being taken over by the descendants of the new economically advantaged groups), and “permanence” (no significant change occurs). In this paper, we analyse a unique database which allows tracing arts participation rates by major categories of consumers in Saint Petersburg, Russia, between 1991 and 2017—the period of the emergence of capitalism, also widely regarded as the time of economic decline of the traditional Soviet intelligentsia.

As a result, a political divide opened up so that by 2010 conservatives had the lowest level of confidence in science. This analysis extends the trends through the 2018 General Social Survey (GSS). I find that political conservatives, Republicans, and Americans who attend religious services regularly, all report falling levels of confidence in the scientific community. Further, for the period 2012-2018, educational attainment, for conservatives, is not associated with increased levels of confidence in science, except at the graduate degree level (and even there confidence is lower among conservatives). In the Trump era, with an assault on facts and truth defining the president and his party, the growing political divide over confidence in science seems likely to further undermine political processes that rely on common knowledge and understanding.

Assessing two decades of German reforms,"Women-friendly policies may have perverse effects on the wages of employed women and mothers in particular. Yet few have addressed the causal impact of such policies and the mechanisms they might trigger at the individual level to produce such wage responses. We assess if and how two decades of reforms of parental leave schemes in Germany have shaped changes in the motherhood wage penalty over time. We compare two sweeps of reforms inspired by opposite principles, one allowing for longer periods out of paid work, the other prompting quicker re-entry in the labour market. We deploy panel data (G-SOEP 1985-2014) and a within-person difference-in-differences design. 
Motherhood wage penalties were found to be harsher than previously assessed in the 1990s. As parental leave reform triggered longer time spent on leave coupled with better tenure accumulation, wage losses for mothers remained stable in this first period. Conversely, we can no longer detect motherhood wage penalties for women affected by the later reform. Shorter career breaks and increased work hours may have benefited new mothers in the late 2000s, leading to a substantial improvement in their wage prospects.",TRUE,FALSE,gender inequality|Germany|labour market|motherhood wage penalty|panel data|parental leave,2018-12-14T20:18:21.713463,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-14T19:18:57.753787,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Gabriele Mari and Giorgio Cutuli,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/citation/,f2nrc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5tbzc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/relationships/node/,5tbzc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c13eaaa615b34001a0d2961/,5c13eaaa615b34001a0d2961,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f2nrc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f2nrc,NA

Since the global financial crisis, however, the European Union has become a key challenger to the OECD. This chapter explores the evolution of policy networks in and around EU tax policy. I discuss how tax networks have moved from an ‘embryonic’ expert setting to a highly heterogeneous, contested and unstable setting, with broad public and political involvement. In the context of the crisis, the salience of international tax policy has exploded, and the EU tax policy system has proved highly adaptive in adjusting to this unprecedented attention. This new EU setting has successfully produced radical policy agendas and outputs in direct competition with the OECD. The chapter examines these dynamics in the illustrative case of corporate tax transparency, a controversial and contested policy area where the EU and OECD agendas have critically diverged.",TRUE,FALSE,CBCR|EU|International taxation|OECD|Tax transparency,2018-12-14T20:15:21.220502,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-14T19:18:39.109152,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/citation/,tn329,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tdbhr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/relationships/node/,tdbhr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c13aaa9615b34001d0c1edb/,5c13aaa9615b34001d0c1edb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn329/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tn329/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tn329,NA

Despite this, and even after one century of being identified there is still no consensus on how to define, analyze or interpret these tools. In western Iberia, there is a clear lack of comprehensive studies regarding this type of artifacts at a regional scale. In this paper, we present a first techno-morphological analysis of a sample of scaled pieces from the Upper Paleolithic site of Vale Boi. Our first aim was to build upon existing analytical models in order to identify function and possible reduction strategies for these artifacts. Our second goal was to critically evaluate the role of these artifacts within western Iberia’s Upper Paleolithic. Our results showed that functional identification of scaled pieces is still not clear. By comparing our data with other author’s we found that current models could not be applied to the archaeological record, as the attribute variability is too high. Furthermore, in this region, we found that higher frequencies of bipolar technology can be found related to residential sites due to both functional and cultural patterns. While we still cannot define a specific function for these artifacts (intermediate pieces or wedges for working hard raw materials or cores for the extraction of chips and small bladelets), it is clear that they had a major role in the variability and intensification of resource exploitation during the Upper Paleolithic in western Iberia.",TRUE,FALSE,Bipolar technology|Stone tools|Upper Paleolithic|Western Europe,2018-12-14T10:46:47.909273,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-14T10:46:02.890908,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/citation/,43e2y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wpxgh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/relationships/node/,wpxgh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c12f64a2dba3b00173f0194/,5c12f64a2dba3b00173f0194,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/43e2y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/43e2y,NA

However, analysis of this kind of data is complex and not always well-understood by investigators. For example, rose diagrams are commonly used to display orientation data. While rose diagrams are a useful and intuitive way of visualizing the data, they are not on their own sufficient except in cases where preferential orientation is very evident. Class frequency, rather than the square root of class frequency, is commonly used to interpret the results. This can give a misleading impression of preferential orientation, when in fact observed patterns do not deviate significantly from random. Conversely, data may deviate significantly from random but this may not be clear from the diagram. At the same time, classic tests like the chi-square test are not appropriate for the display of circular data and alternative approaches are needed. This paper discusses the history of the use of rose diagrams to display orientation data, briefly reviews the archaeological literature in this regard, and discusses key problems and limitations. We then make some recommendations for best practice, which we demonstrate using R software for the Lower Palaeolithic “elephant butchery site” at Southfleet Road, Ebbsfleet, UK, excavated in 2004. The methods employed are clearly explained and all data are provided to ensure that the procedure is easily repeatable without specialist knowledge or programming experience.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|circular data|Ebbsfleet Elephant|Kuiper test|orientation patterns|palaeolithic|Rayleigh test|rose diagrams|R software,2018-12-14T10:40:41.259887,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-14T10:40:32.666791,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/citation/,f2vzs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wg6ns/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/relationships/node/,wg6ns,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1293bf2dba3b00193db9f3/,5c1293bf2dba3b00193db9f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2vzs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f2vzs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f2vzs,NA
