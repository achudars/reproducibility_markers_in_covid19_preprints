If party labels are a heuristic, we would expect  party-line voting to be even more dominant in lower-information elections. Yet, here I show that the prevalence of ticket splitting in state and local offices is often similar to or higher than in national offices because of larger incumbency advantages and starker candidate valence differentials. Because neither surveys nor election returns have been able to reliably measure individual vote choice in downballot races, I introduce an underused source of voter data: cast vote records. I create a database from voting machines that reveals the vote choices of 6.6 million voters for all offices on the long ballot, and I design a clustering algorithm tailored to such ballot data. In contrast to ticket splitting rates of 5 to 7 percent in US House races, about 15 to 20 percent of voters split their ticket in a modal Sheriff race. Even in a nationalized politics, a fraction of voters still cross party lines to vote for the more experienced candidate in state and local elections.",TRUE,FALSE,ballot image logs|cast vote records|elections|nationalization|State and local politics|ticket splitting,2019-05-31T01:25:01.254632,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-31T01:24:29.427002,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/citation/,bvgz3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf0719635f2580016b3c3d0/,5cf0719635f2580016b3c3d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvgz3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bvgz3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bvgz3,NA

But political ruptures carry no guarantee that democracy can overcome the accumulated inequalities of history. In South Africa, the transition to democracy shifted power from a racial minority in ways that suggested an unusually high probability of material change. This article analyzes the limits of public power after democratic transitions. Why has the post-Apartheid local state in Johannesburg been unable to achieve a spatially inclusive distribution of public goods despite a political imperative for both spatial and fiscal redistribution? I rely on interviews and archival research, conducted in Johannesburg between 2015 and 2018. Because the color line created a sharp distinction between political and economic power, traditional white elites required non-majoritarian and covert strategies that translated their structural power into effective power. The cumulative effect of these “weapons of the strong” was a form of institutional arbitrage that led the mostly black-led local state to exercise forbearance towards largely white wealthy residents’ associations and property developers.

Mathematical models of social dynamics have been increasingly recognised as a powerful research tool in achieving this goal. Here, motivated by the fact that the dynamics of the ongoing Yellow Vest Movement in France exhibit anomalously long duration (currently it is in 30th week), we explore whether this can be a result of a dynamical systems phenomenon known as long transients. To this end, we build and study a hierarchy of mathematical models describing the ""population dynamics"" of the movement, i.e. how the number of protesters changes with time. We show that in these models long transients appear via two roots: via a ghost attractor and via an interaction of the slow and fast dynamics. We demonstrate that long transients are also present in some earlier models of social protests. Interestingly, our models predict that the Yellow Vest Movement should end abruptly by, at the latest, mid-summer 2019 without any interference from the French government. More generally, we argue that long transients are a generic feature of dynamical models describing social processes in the same way as they are in models of physical, ecological, and evolutionary systems.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-30T21:56:27.307806,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-30T21:55:59.437541,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/citation/,tpyux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cef5d732a50c400167fb73d/,5cef5d732a50c400167fb73d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tpyux/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tpyux,NA

This paper analyzes the role of patron-client ties and brokerage positions in Mexican cabinet appointments over a period of sixty years (1940-2000), demonstrating that elite brokers were more likely to be included in elite coalitions.  Although network theorists have argued that brokers are most important in ""factionalized"" elites, the results show that brokers were valued elite coalition partners during the period of consolidated one-party rule, but not during the earlier, more contested period of regime formation.

Such discussion relates to a debate about the production mode 1, in which basic knowledge is produced irrespective of industry-oriented applications, and the production mode 2, in which knowledge is produced in the context of industry-oriented applications.
In the literature review, a discussion on the New Legal Landmark for ST&amp;I and the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation (NSSTI) relates these themes to the Triple Helix Approach – interaction among university, industry and government. In addition, a discussion on the typologies of academic entrepreneurship and the concept of academic hybridity was carried out, by means of the analysis of how such configurations influence how scholars view the ways of producing, diffusing and commercializing knowledge. This study consists of a qualitative research, of an exploratory character, which is oriented by phenomenology and hermeneutics, and applies the snowball sampling technique for recruiting the interviewees. The subjects of this research consisted of 15 scholars from two public universities of the state of Rio de Janeiro, who somehow perform or have tried to perform academic entrepreneurship activities and/or self-identify as entrepreneurs, according to their cognitive representations of the phenomenon. Such individuals have been named hybrid life individuals. We opted for carrying out in-depth conversational semi-structured interviews as a data collection technique. The research was guided by the following guiding question: how do the hybrid life individuals relate to the new paradigms, tendencies and regulations that promote a greater interaction among university, industry and government at the Brazilian public universities? This central question was supported by three accessory questions: a) how do the so-called hybrid life individuals perceive of and describe their experiences as academic entrepreneurs?; b) what are the barriers that impede the interaction university-industry-government from the perspective of the hybrid life individual?; c) how do the so-called hybrid life individuals view the influence of the New Legal Landmark for Science, Technology and Innovation in their activities? In the analysis and discussion of the research results, we demonstrated the path taken by the interviewees in search for answers. The most relevant conclusions of this research provide some possible clues regarding the multiple and plural ways in the process of production, diffusion and commercialization of knowledge. These clues also point that, despite the advances, there are still barriers for the interaction among university, industry and government. It was also observed that the possibilities for implementing and operationalizing the New Legal Landmark will depend on the adherence by the legal operators and academic scientists to the new regulations.",TRUE,FALSE,academic entrepreneurship|academic hybridity|entrepreneur university|Triple Helix approach,2019-05-31T09:34:51.280752,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-31T09:34:14.434569,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,No,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/citation/,g6ukw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ced79af2a50c4001980be6e/,5ced79af2a50c4001980be6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6ukw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6ukw,https://doi.org/10.22409/PPGAd.2019.m.01656969742

Existing research examines why active people “avoid” activist identities but has less to say about how active people adopt such identities as if they automatically follow participation. We draw on interviews with high school and college students from a midsize southwestern city to examine how young people make sense of what it means to be an activist, who identifies as such, and why youth are willing—or unwilling—to adopt this label. We find that respondents’ conceptualizations of “activists” are critical to (non)identification. Those who see activism as a broad category are more likely to identify, holding constant their level of activity. Those who see activism as a greedy institution, requiring significant substantive fluency, making the issue their primary focus, and willingness to sacrifice, do not, despite their level of engagement.

I argue that the political processes in Taiwan, as well as the outcomes of the local elections in 2018, reflect not the reversal of the liberal democratic ideals in the country but of the support of ‘underdogs’ and ‘黨外’, as well as the longstanding tradition of anti-establishment political affiliations among Taiwanese people. Using the 1992-2015 Taiwan Social Change Survey, I test the effects of demographic characteristics and of national identity (net of ethnic identity) on the anti-establishment political sentiments vis-à-vis the support of the mainstream political parties. I find that people with dual identity were at the core of the anti-establishment movement in the 90s and 00s. Moreover, they were more likely to be younger, well educated, and have higher earnings. The democratic process with periodic changes in power since the lift of the martial law was, therefore, driven by the electorate who used to identify themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese in the early years of the democratic rule in Taiwan.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-establishment sentiments|national identity|political affiliation|tang-wai,2019-05-28T21:23:07.407679,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-28T21:22:53.026586,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/citation/,zfeac,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ced454135f2580016b0e3f6/,5ced454135f2580016b0e3f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zfeac/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zfeac,NA

Candidate's traits can help voters select good types of politicians. However, selecting candidates with good traits can reduce accountability because the voter cannot commit to throw out politicians with good traits who produce bad outcomes. This result explains when and why voters may sometimes select candidates who they believe are less likely to be competent.",TRUE,FALSE,game theory|political economy,2019-05-28T14:20:45.354656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-28T14:20:23.068921,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,Keith Schnakenberg,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/citation/,654r9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ced3d268d6e05001a5febfa/,5ced3d268d6e05001a5febfa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/654r9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/654r9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/654r9,https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2019.6
