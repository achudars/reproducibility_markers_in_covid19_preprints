However, online social network data often lacks basic demographic information about the nodes. Researchers must rely on predicted node attributes to estimate measures of homophily, but little is known about the validity of these measures. We show that estimating homophily in a network can be viewed as a dyadic prediction problem, and that homophily estimates are unbiased when dyad-level residuals sum to zero in the network. Node-level prediction models, such as the use of names to classify ethnicity or gender, do not generally have this property and can introduce large biases into homophily estimates. Bias occurs due to error autocorrelation along dyads. Importantly, node-level classification performance is not a reliable indicator of estimation accuracy for homophily. We compare estimation strategies that make predictions at the node and dyad levels, evaluating performance in different settings. We propose a novel “ego-alter” modeling approach that outperforms standard node and dyad classification strategies. While this paper focuses on homophily, results generalize to other relational measures which aggregate predictions along the dyads in a network. We conclude with suggestions for research designs to study homophily in online networks.

This becomes especially true as activists attempt to draw connections between varied aims such as opposition to globalization and support for immigrants. During the 1999 Battle of Seattle, the movement focused on opposing neoliberalism (Graeber 2002) and advocating for alternative visions of globalization (Reitan 2012).  Some activists also noted the hypocrisy of opening borders to capital while militarizing the borders for migrants. Yet, in the end, immigrant rights movements and their central issues did not feature prominently in Seattle or later anti-globalization efforts. Simultaneously, however, most immigrant rights advocates have not prioritized opposition to the destructive power of global capitalism.  In this paper, we consider the implication of this critical omission and trace the recent history of the immigrant rights movement and its articulations with anti-capitalism.",TRUE,FALSE,Battle in Seattle|borders|capitalism|immigrant rights movement|immigrants|immigration|labor movement|neoliberalism|social movements|unions,2020-01-30T16:35:43.356088,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-30T16:35:27.888853,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/citation/,yc2ut,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3235b3f6631d004a5a3848/,5e3235b3f6631d004a5a3848,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc2ut/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yc2ut/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yc2ut,https://doi.org/10.1080/08854300.2019.1674078

Because politically charged beliefs inform those assessments, the beliefs’ truth affects the research’s accuracy. However, science’s sociopolitical uses subject politically charged beliefs to distortion. Since resultant errors assimilate into our scientific corpus and inform new hypotheses, scientists need accurate sociopolitical theories of distorting forces to identify errors. Analyzing Black-Panther opposition to violence research, we argue that since racial disparities structure our society and science has been distorted to buttress racial inequities, knowledgeable anti-racist scientists are disposed to exert a corrective force on research.

Our data cover seven generations and allows us to follow ancestors of individuals living in Sweden around the new millennium back more than 200 years, covering the mid-18th century to the 21st century. In our sample of around 75,000 traceable descendants, we analyze (a) up to 5th cousin correlations and (b) dynastic correlations over seven generations based on aggregations of ancestors’ social class/status. With both approaches, we find that past generations structure life chances many generations later, even though mobility is very high. The persistence we find using cousin and dynastic correlations is much higher compared to a simple Markov model limited to sequential parent–child transfers, but we also find that direct ancestor associations are very small. This suggests that there is a weak but constant kinship influence that attenuates slowly over generations.

The results of the study advocated that promotion of entrepreneurial culture and business development support services were the significant contributors for the youth entrepreneurs’ expectations towards Institutional Support and the efficiency of the policy is the significant unique contributor to the prediction of youth entrepreneurs’ expectation towards entrepreneurship policy. The major challenge faced by youth entrepreneurs is to transform their enterprises into commercially viable, competitive business. Also entrepreneurship development projects have different goals and objectives, in terms of target group, political agenda and types of interventions.

This means that security is a quality of life issue as well as one of crime prevention. Here we propose that, in addition to preventing crime and being cost effective, security should preferably be ethical and unobtrusive, aesthetically neutral or pleasing, and the easy-to-use or default option. We describe security with such characteristics as ‘elegant’. We use two case studies to explore how, as many types of crime have declined in recent decades, there was an increase in elegant and a decrease in inelegant security. We suggest that the lifecycle of some security technologies sees them evolve from inelegant to elegant, that continual improvement is required to keep ahead of offender adaptations, and that inelegant security can fall into disuse even if it prevents crime. It is hoped that this conceptual contribution might inform discussions about the appropriate form and role of security.",TRUE,FALSE,civil liberties|crime decline|crime drop|dapper|elegant security|security|situartional crime prevention|surveillance society,2020-01-28T21:32:24.241076,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-28T17:37:23.347530,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/citation/,tue6x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e302843e71ef8005b18c24b/,5e302843e71ef8005b18c24b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tue6x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tue6x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tue6x,NA

From the publications, it is evident that advent of computers and mobile technologies or information and communication technologies (ICTs) had caused an uncleared confusion in naming and operating a CIS. Aimed at highlighting this problem and giving a recipe for a CIS to impact maximally on education, health and overall development, this work is a critical analysis of the literature. It found most CISs reported on inadequate and ineffective. While a majority of sponsors believe that CIS is solely about ICTs, a few think it is about either a library or a combination of a library and ICTs. Ten names were found for a CIS, including community information centre (CIC), telecentre, community information and communication technology centre, community library, community multimedia centre, cybercafé and information kiosk. Stock and services provided depended on the name. One thing common is the expectation that people should go for information when they need it. There is little thought about the reality that many people may not know they need information and about how to serve people who are incapacitated in other ways to go or ask for information. Thinking critically about all these alongside the goal of CIS achievable only with ICT and non-ICT resources and strategies that match every community member’s differences, preferences, deficiencies and constraints, the researcher concludes that any other name than CIC is needless. This understanding brings about maximum impact, which can be supported with data from further researches.",TRUE,FALSE,community|computer|development|ICT|information centre|information service|mobile technologies,2020-01-28T21:33:03.747502,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-28T17:39:27.848659,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/citation/,vysgr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3015b8e71ef8005f1889c2/,5e3015b8e71ef8005f1889c2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vysgr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vysgr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vysgr,NA
