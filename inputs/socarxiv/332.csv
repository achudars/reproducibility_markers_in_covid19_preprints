The experience of olfaction is highly emotion-laden and tightly bound to memory and personal history, and Western smell vocabularies are notoriously poor: scentful experience seems poorly suited as a basis to enroll others in political projects, especially in contexts that privilege rational public debate. But smells can also spur us to immediate action. When do they prompt us to enroll others in that action, and how do we turn individual sensory experiences into convincing arguments? How does olfaction leave the realm of individual experience and generate consequential social change? This article shows how social processes of olfaction can be used to prompt social action. With an analysis of the complaints that legitimated the 2015 destruction of a shanty town in southern Sweden and a historical inquiry into the shared beliefs that allowed those complaints to make sense, I show how olfactory claims – claims based on personal experiences of smell – can leverage broadly shared norms, values, and meanings to demand social action. Despite the personal, emotional, and fleeting nature of olfactory experience (or perhaps thanks to those features, which disallow independent confirmation) it can easily be weaponized as a political tool. This article asks how individual sensory experience can have social impact, and shows how a fit between local olfactory cosmologies and the particular features of olfactory claims can allow them to be used to demand action.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-09T21:32:45.642165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T21:32:18.281821,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/citation/,9vqzp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4cd4a822a88600194f5e57/,5d4cd4a822a88600194f5e57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9vqzp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9vqzp,NA

But an emphasis on knowledge displaces the complex issues faced by those teachers who identify – or are identified by others – as subject area experts. In this paper we use ethnographic observations and interviews to understand the professional project of art teachers in the United States. This data shows how the “in-between” nature of art teaching -- the teacher not quite an artist committed to their personal craft, nor a pedagogy-centered professional with well-defined objectives -- is a product of ongoing negotiations over the meaning of their work. When seen from relational perspective, in-betweenness is a practical outcome that at one point will color any professional project. In this sense, the troubled category of the art teacher helps illuminate central concerns in any study of teaching as a profession. Rather than deliver our own assessment of professionalization in the classroom, we use our data to illuminate three practical challenges faced by the art teacher. These include the negotiation of tasks that need doing, debates over the meaning and relevance of purity to the profession, and the maintenance of roles through an emergent understanding of expertise.

I collect data on seigneurial jurisdictions for ancien-regime Spain and document a negative relationship between having been a seigneurial town in the 18th century and current economic development. To shed light on the causal effect, I focus on the distribution of lordships in the former Kingdom of Granada after its conquest by the Catholic Monarchs, which can be considered as conditionally random. The results confirm the negative effect of lordship found for the whole country: towns that shortly after the conquest were granted to nobles are relatively poorer today. In addition, I explore the mechanisms of persistence, with the results pointing to lower state capacity as a main explanatory factor. This finding is consistent with an interpretation of seigneurial jurisdictions as a privatization of the local government, which has historically hindered the application of central government policies and lowered the state’s infrastructural capacity in former manorial towns.",TRUE,FALSE,Economic development|Local political institutions|Lordships|State capacity,2019-08-09T21:35:43.413377,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T21:35:31.466481,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Daniel Oto-Peralías,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/citation/,k8mzr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gu79q/,gu79q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4c51d6272b140016eb97b7/,5d4c51d6272b140016eb97b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k8mzr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k8mzr,NA

It presents a general analysis of the shortcomings of national legislation that limits the constitutional provisions for citizens of Ukraine to obtain the appropriate level of social protection. The article shows the problems of the status of internally
displaced persons (IDPs), which should provide for them additional guarantees from the state, including social ones. However, the carried out research shows that this status often becomes a discriminatory factor that imposes disproportionate restrictions on individuals. The current legal regulation of social payments for internally displaced persons contains a number of rigid and rather complicated administrative procedures that significantly restrict, and in some cases even generally make it impossible to obtain social protection. The only effective remedy for the protection of an infringed right for pensions or other social benefits for internally displaced persons is an appeal to a court. The courts do not always carry out effective and prompt protection of the violated law. Despite positive examples of judicial practice, it can not always provide an adequate and well-timed level of social protection, which causes the need for the improvement of national legislation.

Although recently the relations started to improve, the main international agreement between Belarus and the EU is still the one concluded by the Soviet Union. Even though there are plans on changing the situation and concluding a new international framework agreement with the EU, it is clear that Eurasian integration is of primary importance for Belarus. This article focuses on analyzing the legal basis of the EU-Belarus relations, effect that international contractual obligations have in the domestic legal order, and the way membership to the Eurasian Economic Union influences that. It is argued that new contractual legal framework between Belarus and the EU is imaginable, although it would be limited, among others, due to transfer of certain exclusive competences to the supranational level of the Eurasian Economic Union.

A current consequence for Greece.,"People expect the state to create jobs and provide them with a social security net. Whatever its defects, whatever the virtues of the private sector, no structure other than the state can today provide citizens with the basic public goods. Under the present right-wing government of Nea Dimokratia in Greece, which is not particularly at odds with neoliberalism, a very active role of the state is not expected. Also is nor expected the introduction of a serious program of public investment and demand-boosting to stimulate the national economy and enter into a virtuous circle of recovery.

Representative surveys consistently find dramatically decreasing levels of sexual prejudice among all groups, among men and young men in particular. Qualitative scholarship, however, continues to find that enactments of homophobia remain integral components of contemporary masculine identities. In this article, we make sense of this shift and apparent methodological inconsistency. We do not question which measure is best. Instead, we argue for a need to understand the ways that gendered sexual prejudice transforms in ways that allow the relationship between masculinity and homophobia to endure—sometimes even when it appears to be in decline.",TRUE,FALSE,hegemonic masculinity|homophobia|masculinities|masculinity|sexual prejudice,2019-08-09T21:42:31.087393,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T21:42:07.299994,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Sage Publications,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/citation/,4vd8f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4b202d0f488d00188f528c/,5d4b202d0f488d00188f528c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4vd8f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4vd8f,NA

Library of Porto, held on the 24th November 1945, sets the motto for the construction of
a historically and sociologically based analysis of the modes of usage of public and semi-
public space – namely libraries – used by women and their meanings in those days.
Within the framework of a qualitative approach, sources such as literature, photography
and personal interviews are added to documentary data from institutional archives. A
fictional narrative, built from historical data, is inserted to sustain our analysis, where
Adozinda is the character embodying a woman reader who crosses the city to visit the
recently inaugurated Feminine Reading Room. Two female figures punctuate this narrative,
Virgínia de Castro e Almeida, the person after whom this room was named, and Tília Dulce
Machado Martins, the main legator of the collection it holds. Using this fictional narrative,
we aimed at reconstructing a holistic context for the facts as they might have happened
through a pleasurable reading of a plausible text. These women’s diverse histories are
also inserted in that context.
Fiction is a resource used to inscribe data on the social, economic, and political situation
in the city and in the country at that time, with an emphasis on women and their uses of
public space.
As to the theoretical framing of public and semi-public use of the space, the theory of
gendered spaces, as opposed to separate spheres, is evoked and confirmed to account
for the presence of women in public space, according to gender and social class roles, a
presence which is however socially invisibilised.
We conclude that the Room’s space, initially segregated for moral reasons, was later
transformed through an appropriation which went from separatism to integration, as a
response to ethical claims gaining ground in society. This separatism was, therefore, an
intermediate step towards a more equalitarian use of space.",TRUE,FALSE,gendered space|Portugal|public libraries|public space|the New State regime|women,2019-08-09T22:04:26.797393,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T22:03:54.893764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/citation/,ybnvh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4b12900f488d00168eba09/,5d4b12900f488d00168eba09,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ybnvh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ybnvh,NA
