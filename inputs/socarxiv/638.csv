One of the challenges researchers face in this area, however, is balancing the trade-offs between different modes of network measurement and study design.  At one end of the spectrum, entirely ego-centered network designs facilitate access to a large, generalizable sample of the population but often lack details on the underlying network structure that embed each respondent.  At the other end, whole-network designs offer fine details about the network structure but are costly and suffer from generalizability limitations.  In this paper, we employ an ego-centered network sampling design that strikes a balance between these two cases by leveraging how individuals perceive their social worlds vis-a-vis respondent reports of their alter-alter ties.  We describe a large sample of close personal networks where respondents informed on their perceptions of the ties between their alters on multiple types of relations.  Specifically, we characterize the distribution of network statistics (size, density, and multiplexity) for over a thousand individual ego-centered cognitive networks drawn from a representative sample of the U.S. population.  To our knowledge this is the first study to characterize the distribution of mental maps vis-a-vis perceived alter-alter relationships in this large of a sample of respondents involved in close personal networks.  In doing so, we more clearly shed light on how Americans perceive the structure of their social worlds and provide an empirical case study in what we characterize as ego-centered cognitive social structures.",TRUE,FALSE,networks|personal networks|socarxiv|social networks,2018-07-02T10:56:49.980339,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-08T20:07:48.053083,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/citation/,pg3yx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4ugk6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/relationships/node/,4ugk6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5910cd926c613b024e488951/,5910cd926c613b024e488951,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pg3yx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pg3yx

Consequently, to identify as “neither religious nor spiritual” runs the risk of being stigmatized as superficial, untrustworthy, and immoral. Conflicts and confusions encountered in the process of negotiating a nonreligious/nonspiritual identity, caused by the ambiguous nature of religious language, were explored through qualitative interviews with 14 ex-ministers and 1 atheist minister—individuals for whom supernaturalist religion had formed the central core of identity, but who have deconverted and no longer hold supernatural beliefs. The cognitive linguistics approach of Frame Semantics was applied to the process of “oppositional identity work” to examine why certain identity labels are avoided or embraced due to considerations of the cognitive frames evoked by those labels.

Through the constant comparative method of grounded theory, a host of useful theoretical concepts emerged from the data. Several impediments to the construction of a “secular but not superficial” identity were identified, and a framework of new theoretical concepts developed to make sense of them: sense disparity, frame disparity, identity misfire, foiled identity, sense conflation, and conflated frames. Several consequences arising from these impediments were explored: (1) consequences of sense conflation and conflated frames for the study of religion; (2) consequences of conflated frames for religious terminology; and (3) consequences of the negation of conflated frames for those who identify as not religious, not spiritual, or not Christian. Additionally, four types of oppositional identity work were identified and analyzed: (1) avoidance identity work, (2) dissonant identity work, (3) adaptive identity work, and (4) alternative identity work. Finally, the concept of conflated frames was applied to suggest a new interpretation of the classic Weberian disenchantment narrative.",TRUE,FALSE,Atheism|Ex-Clergy|Humanism|Nonreligion|Secularism|Sociology of Religion|Spirituality,2018-07-02T10:56:48.994262,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-05T22:41:01.607832,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/citation/,bxszm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vxwrf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/relationships/node/,vxwrf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/590cfde36c613b024e47cbbc/,590cfde36c613b024e47cbbc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bxszm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bxszm

I expand this view by showing that one linguistic feature of “Pittsburghese” is used to create stances that are enregistered along with the characterological figures in this vernacular variety of English. Falling question intonation (FQI) is a common feature of the White Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania variety. I analyze its use in a series of videos posted on YouTube® entitled Greg and Donny. The series depicts conversations among the two eponymous characters and their friends in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

We developed a novel method to assess long term retention as a measure of true learning in tests that do not involve any cramming and found to our dismay that it falls progressively more towards recent years. Our initial work on poverty showed that consumption on commodities is hyperbolic (as in catalysis) and hierarchic and, that the total income is not fractionally distributed among the commodities, as economists assume;  the leftover (residual) income after the more essential items is spent on the commodities of lesser preference. Education is also a naturally ordered commodity and parental income quantitatively determined school dropouts/attendance obeying the same hyperbolic relationship, as we could show. We could thereby affirm the first-ever mechanism for Engels’ three curves of consumption, based on the time constants associated with the corresponding hyperbolic functions.  The disturbing observation was that long term retention as a true measure of learning decreases rapidly with years and seems to be independent of socioeconomic circumstances and gender but depends on subjects. The test also revealed that those who are not good at cramming could exhibit good retention, though the conventional tests fail to identify them. Causes of the progressive loss of retention for the recent years, either as limits to learning or as limitations in imparting learning, need to be assessed by further studies.

Specifically, they look at three shifts that have transformed most of the software industry: software is now delivered as services, software and hardware have moved into the cloud and software’s development is ever more agile. These shifts have altered the conditions for privacy governance, and rendered the typical mental models underlying regulatory frameworks for information systems out-of-date. After 'the agile turn', modularity in production processes creates new challenges for allocating regulatory responsibility. Privacy implications of software are harder to address due to the dynamic nature of services and feature development, which undercuts extant privacy regulation that assumes a clear beginning and end of production processes. And the data-driven nature of services, beyond the prospect of monetization, has become part of software development itself. With their focus on production, the authors manage to place known challenges to privacy in a new light and create new avenues for privacy research and practice.",TRUE,FALSE,agile methods|cloud services|political economy|privacy|Software as a Service|software engineering|surveillance,2018-07-02T10:56:45.265557,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-02T12:34:14.127440,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Seda Gürses| Joris Van Hoboken,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/citation/,9gy73,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/27x3q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/relationships/node/,27x3q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57aa2315b83f6901f3539ae8/,57aa2315b83f6901f3539ae8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9gy73/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9gy73/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9gy73

Other studies suggest gender egalitarianism increases sexual intimacy by enhancing communication in couples. We tested these competing hypotheses by examining the underlying processes that link gender attitudes to sexual activity. We also examined the association between gender egalitarian attitudes and women’s and men’s sexual self-efficacy and examined how sexual self-efficacy in turn shapes gendered patterns of sexual initiation and sexual frequency. An actor-partner interdependence model based on data from the National Couples Survey provided support for both perspectives. Women’s gender egalitarian attitudes decreased couples’ sexual frequency by negatively affecting men’s sexual control, but gender egalitarian attitudes surrounding the scripting of sexual activity among women were positively associated with sexual frequency. Moreover, egalitarian attitudes about domestic roles were positively associated with partner communication which in turn enhanced partners’ sexual self-efficacy and sexual frequency. Yet, while sexual self-efficacy was positively associated with sexual frequency for men it was negatively associated for women. The findings show that whereas gender conventional attitudes increase sex through male empowerment and female disenfranchisement, egalitarian beliefs lead to greater sexual intimacy – not only more sex, but also mutual partner decision-making.",TRUE,FALSE,egalitarianism|Gender|Gender Conventions|gender ideology|Sex|Sexual Frequency|Sexual Self-efficacy,2018-07-02T10:56:44.949862,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-01T17:20:22.034101,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/citation/,ud65x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d6gpm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/relationships/node/,d6gpm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59076d836c613b024d88b6c7/,59076d836c613b024d88b6c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ud65x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ud65x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ud65x

There are 91,180 cells in the state with at least some structural value. Total and residential structural values total \$942 Billion and \$619 Billion, respectively. Over the period 1950 through 2015 there were 3,233 individual tornado reports in the state with a peak frequency during July. Property value exposed to tornadoes is estimated using a geometric model for the path. Annual statewide total and residential structural property exposure to tornadoes is estimated at \$171 Million and \$103 Million, respectively. Property exposure to tornadoes peaks in February although the number of tornadoes peaks in September. A regression model quantifies the relationship between actual losses since 2007 and exposures. A doubling of the residential exposure increases actual recorded losses by 26\% since 2007 and a doubling of non-residential exposure increases losses by 21\% controlling for changes over time. Randomization of the historical tornado paths provides alternative exposure scenarios that are used to determine the probability of extreme loss years. Results from the Monte Carlo algorithm indicate a 1\% chance that the annual loss will exceed \$430 Million and a .1\% chance that it will exceed \$1 Billion. These findings, and the procedure to obtain them, should help property insurance and reinsurance companies gauge their risk of losses and prioritize their management actions.",TRUE,FALSE,Florida|property loss|tornado,2018-07-02T10:56:44.924493,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-01T15:02:06.211851,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/citation/,3yvxm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xu3fw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/relationships/node/,xu3fw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59074c85594d900255532d76/,59074c85594d900255532d76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yvxm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3yvxm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3yvxm
