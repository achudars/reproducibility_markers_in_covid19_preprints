We call the measure Isolation and anticipate it will be useful as an alternative to commonly used rural classification schemes (e.g., the Census Bureau's measure). Following the best known standards for measuring rurality, it captures the trade-off between access to resource-rich, high-population-density areas and the cost of travel to those areas; thus even intrinsically low-resource areas may have high access to nearby resources. Validity was tested with proxies such as nighttime outdoor lights, distance to hospitals, physician availability, and access to high quality food. The Isolation scale demonstrated good construct validity (i.e., both convergent and criterion validity). Fit statistics indicated that, compared to other commonly-used urban/rural definitions, the Isolation scale was the best overall measure when predicting several proxies for rurality, even when categorized. We also show that the measure does a substantially better job at explaining national health outcome data at the state level. This new continuous Isolation scale shows considerable promise for improving our conceptualization, theorization, and measurement of the features of rurality that are pertinent to rural health disparities research, and can also be useful to policy makers who may find value in using isolation thresholds that are most relevant to their policy planning needs.",TRUE,FALSE,geography|health|measurement|rural,2018-07-02T11:31:02.475973,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-21T14:20:53.726710,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/citation/,4928e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dxn9m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/relationships/node/,dxn9m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3bbbc4f22f400010bea95d/,5a3bbbc4f22f400010bea95d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4928e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4928e,NA

However, researchers are often interested in combinations of relational and categorical nodal attributes. In this case, it is desirable to account for the label, or color, of the nodes in the triad census. In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm for constructing the colored triad census, based, in part, on existing methods for the classic triad census. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using empirical and simulated data for both undirected and directed graphs. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational time by approximately many-fold over the naive approach. We also apply the colored triad census to the Zachary karate club network dataset. We simultaneously show the efficiency of the algorithm, and a way to conduct a statistical test on the census by forming a null distribution from 1,000 realizations of a mixing-matrix conditioned graph and comparing the observed colored triad counts to the expected. From this, we demonstrate the method's utility in our discussion of results about homophily, heterophily, and bridging, simultaneously gained via the colored triad census.

As qualitative researchers are faced with new expectations to share their data, data repositories and academic libraries are working to address the specific challenges of qualitative research data. This paper describes how data repositories and academic libraries can partner with researchers to support three challenges associated with qualitative data sharing: (1) obtaining informed consent from participants for data sharing and scholarly reuse; (2) ensuring that qualitative data are legally and ethically shared; and (3) sharing data that cannot be deidentified. This paper also describes three continuing challenges of qualitative data sharing that data repositories and academic libraries cannot specifically address—research using qualitative big data, copyright concerns, and risk of decontextualization. While data repositories and academic libraries can’t provide easy solutions to these three continuing challenges, they can partner with researchers and connect them with other relevant specialists to examine these challenges. Ultimately, this paper suggests that data repositories and academic libraries can help researchers address some of the challenges associated with ethical and lawful qualitative data sharing.",TRUE,FALSE,data repositories|data sharing|libraries|qualitative data,2018-07-02T11:29:55.873395,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-21T02:06:14.616596,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/citation/,7z2bt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yvhjd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/relationships/node/,yvhjd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3ae7605a9350000fa55417/,5a3ae7605a9350000fa55417,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7z2bt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7z2bt,NA

Exposure to heterosexual practices and to cultural messages depicting women as physically weak and sexually vulnerable, and transwomen’s embodiment of hetero-femininity play a central role in increasing their fears.

While relationships provide women with greater sexual satisfaction, some women prefer hookups because inequalities still exist within relationships. The following review examines the effects of college hookup culture on female subjectivity and suggests that gender inequalities reposition women into a state of gender liminality. This liminal space is a middle ground between the stereotypical statuses of passive “feminine-object” and agentive “masculine-subject” that prompts women to negotiate how they perform femininity without losing agency.",TRUE,FALSE,college hookup culture|gender|orgasm gap|sexual double standard|sexuality,2018-07-02T11:29:52.365212,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-18T22:37:40.184223,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Jules Ostro,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/citation/,bxn8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mfqyt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/relationships/node/,mfqyt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a38082abd78290010684758/,5a38082abd78290010684758,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxn8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bxn8t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bxn8t,NA

In these efforts, the bulk of research has ignored genetic inheritance. We use structural equations models and data on 4590 twin pairs and their parents to distinguish the roles of genetic and environmental influences on educational  attainment in Norway, a country with high affordability and easy access to education  at all levels. Our quantitative genetic models confirm the status quo; not of sociology, but of behavior genetics. Heritable factors play an important role in the  transmission process, and the postulated direct effects of parents own educational attainments are negligible. The family environment does matter, but only those features that are shared between the twins themselves and not those that involve their parents. These results represent a challenge to conventional sociological theory on intergenerational transmission processes and the role of education in social stratification.",TRUE,FALSE,educational attainment|Norway|parents' education|register data|twins,2018-07-02T11:29:52.091415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-18T14:50:23.751700,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/citation/,fby2t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4wuvk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/relationships/node/,4wuvk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a37cecebd7829000f68777f/,5a37cecebd7829000f68777f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fby2t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fby2t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fby2t,NA

Nature-based recreation provides substantial benefits for human wellbeing, including improving physical and mental health, but can also have severe ecological impacts. The recreational value of landscapes and natural areas is often used to generate support for public spending in conservation. However, we still don’t know whether nature-based recreationists place greater recreational value on natural areas that have high conservation value compared to other green spaces.
2.	Here, we determine which attributes of nature-based tourism destinations provide recreational services. We used pictures of wildlife posted on Flickr to quantify wildlife-watching activities in Scotland. We then determined the environmental variables key to attracting wildlife watchers to a destination, such as protected areas (PAs), the perceived naturalness, and the presence of different types of infrastructure.
3.	Infrastructure is the best predictor of intensity of wildlife watching activities in Scotland, while areas of high natural value are rarely used. PAs act as a weak attractor of wildlife watchers, with PAs designated to protect threatened habitats or species having low recreational value. In accessible and highly visited areas, higher biodiversity increases the intensity of wildlife watching activities.
4.	Synthesis and applications. Areas of high natural and conservation value and areas of high recreational value do not tend to overlap. Recreational ecosystem services are mainly provided by the wider countryside and highly transformed landscapes as opposed to wild ecosystems and PAs designated to protect environmental features of high conservation value. These results question the synergy between the goals of recreation and those of conservation and the use of recreation as a justification for economic investment in conservation. During wildlife watching activities most people experience an urbanised, highly transformed nature; it will be important to determine how this human-dominated nature can influence support for conservation of wild and remote areas.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:29:52.004315,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-18T14:47:35.763787,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/citation/,vze7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8tbrz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/relationships/node/,8tbrz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3791bc1e3f47000e883462/,5a3791bc1e3f47000e883462,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vze7y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vze7y,NA

A transcendental phenomenological research design was used to provide a thick description of the essence of the Saudi female experience in this learning environment. The participants included four Saudi female students currently attending ESL courses in Melbourne, Australia. Two phases—descriptive and interpretive—were employed in the data analysis to accurately capture the nature of the experience.  This study revealed that, while all the participants held a positive attitude towards their experience, language proficiency level and marital status played crucial roles in their adaptation. Participants with high language skills reported smoother adaptation than students with low language skills. The married students tended to be more inhibited than single students by the attendance of male especially Saudi male. Working solely with males or participating in physical activities with males had the greatest impact on levels of engagement in classroom activities. These findings were broadly in line with the sparse literature available on this phenomenon.
