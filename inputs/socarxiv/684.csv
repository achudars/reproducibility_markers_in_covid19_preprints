There are many transformations available, and popular is ‘dummy coding’ in which the estimates represent deviations from a prese- lected ‘reference category’. A way to avoid choosing a reference category is effect coding, where the resulting estimates are deviations from a grand (unweighted) mean. An alternative for effect coding was given by Sweeney and Ulveling in 1972, which provides estimates representing deviations from the sample mean and is especially useful when the data are unbalanced (i.e., categories holding different numbers of observation). Despite its elegancy, this weighted effect coding has been cited only 35 times in the past 40 years, according to Google Scholar citations (more recent references include Hirschberg and Lye 2001 and Gober and Freeman 2005). Furthermore, it did not become a standard option in statistical packages such as SPSS and R. The aim of this paper is to revive weighted effect coding illustrated by recent research on the body mass index (BMI) and to provide easy-to-use syntax for SPSS, R, and Stata on http://www.ru.nl/sociology/mt/wec/ downloads.

This somewhat neglected parameterization is preferred over the well-known effect coding (ANOVA) if the data are unbalanced (i.e., when categories hold different numbers of observations) and was recently revived in this journal (te Grotenhuis et al. 2016). In this paper, we show that weighted effect coding can also be applied to regression models with interaction effects. The weighted effect coded interactions represent the additional effects over and above the main effects obtained from the model without these interactions. This is a useful alternative to effect coding when the data are unbalanced as in most observational data. In this contribution, we describe this novel parameterization and provide syntax, data, and examples in SPSS, R, and Stata on http://www.ru. nl/sociology/mt/wec/downloads.

Most recent empirical analyses of this phenomenon have focused on changes in risk attitudes, and in risk and return expectations but, so far, inconclusive evidence has been provided that changes in those psychological variables play a causal role in the actual decision making at work. Furthermore, the duration of the phenomenon, which is very short, is often not considered and it is thus unclear why the situation recovers so quickly after crises. Relying on experimental data and on a simple agent-based model, we propose an alternative explanation of this phenomenon based on the interaction of the two most important phases that individuals undertake in decision making, namely (1) searching information about possible options and (2) selecting the preferred one. Our main result is that the observed reallocation of portfolios in times of crisis is not the result of a portfolio reassessment driven by the crisis but it is instead explained by changes in search behavior for information on specific market conditions.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-Based Model|Behavioral Finance|Economic Experiment|Financial Crisis|Investment Decision|Non-compensatory Heuristic|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:06.920563,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-01T20:18:58.028000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/citation/,zt3wf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vbcjf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/relationships/node/,vbcjf,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5818f8b39ad5a1004e469397/,5818f8b39ad5a1004e469397,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zt3wf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zt3wf

Critical heterosexuality studies demonstrates the role of the traditional, white wedding in the reproduction of heteronormativity and gender and contribute to a social order that privileges white, middle-class, heterosexual married couples over other relationships. On the other hand, social science research points to the ways that same-sex weddings offer a site of resistance to heteronormativity and traditional gender roles. We analyze in-depth interviews with women in straight and same-sex marriages. We find that women in straight marriages are more likely to embrace the traditional, white wedding than those in same-sex marriages. Women planning same-sex weddings think deeply about their wedding ceremonies as they relate to heteronormativity. Some participants reject traditional weddings as excessively costly and wasteful. We argue that, while weddings are often sites for the celebration of consumerism, traditional gender and heterosexuality, they can also be sites of resistance that challenge these same social norms.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:34.570632,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-01T18:39:05.395000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/citation/,e4yst,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/my59r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/relationships/node/,my59r,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5818e14bb83f690044ebeb0f/,5818e14bb83f690044ebeb0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4yst/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4yst

Romania in the context of poor waste management infrastructure in the last
decade (2003-2012). Biowaste is the main fraction of municipal waste, thus
a proper management is a key challenge in order to sustain a bioeconomy in
the near future. The amount of biowaste generated and uncollected by waste
operators is generally uncontrolled disposed if not recovered through home
composting. The paper points out the role of home composting in diverting
the biowaste from wild dumps and landfills for the regions covered or not
by waste collection services. Home composting and the biowaste losses are
further assessed based on several scenarios (worse-case, pessimistic,
realistic, optimistic) where the net loads of greenhouse gasses (GHG) are
calculated at national and regional levels. The transition of home
composting techniques, from open piles to plastic bins with respect to
standard guidelines will improve the home composting performance in terms
of compost quality and net GHG’s savings, supporting a bio-based economy
which will lead towards a sustainable rural development. Regional
disparities are revealed across Romanian counties and the paper opens new

It proposes the conjecture that perceived discrimination tends to increase with parental education, particularly among those children of immigrants who have attained only mediocre levels of education themselves. I discuss that this conjecture may be developed as an argument that comes in two versions: a narrow version about explicit downward (intergenerational) mobility and a wide version about unfulfilled mobility aspirations more generally. Analyses based on the six-country comparative EURISLAM survey sup-port the argument: parental education positively predicts perceived discrimination in general, but among the less educated this relation is most pronounced whereas it is absent among those with tertiary education. A replication and falsification test based on the German IAB-SOEP Migration Sample reconfirms the main finding and provides further original pieces of evidence.

The systems analytic group, which used cost-benefit analysis to improve government decision-making, had considerable success in the 1960s and helped create offices of economists throughout the executive branch, but was losing momentum by 1970. The I/O group was, by the mid-1970s, working from the White House to reduce economic regulation—eliminating price and entry controls across a range of industries—but its ability to act was limited. After 1975, the I/O group increasingly focused on social regulation—rules meant to improve health, environmental, or safety conditions—and pushed for cost-benefit/cost-effectiveness analysis of such regulations. In the process, its efforts became linked with the legacy of systems analysis, leading to legal requirements for cost-benefit analysis of regulation and the expansion of executive-branch offices oriented toward economics—changes which opened doors to the future exchange of ideas between academia and the policy domain.",TRUE,FALSE,1970s|deregulation|economics|history|policy|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:08.384245,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-10-31T17:46:20.925000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/citation/,sjb2a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7rztm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/relationships/node/,7rztm,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58178037594d9001ee357d08/,58178037594d9001ee357d08,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjb2a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjb2a/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sjb2a

problems for small-area mortality estimation. Many existing approaches 
to fitting local mortality schedules, including those most often used in 
Brazil, estimate rates by making rigid mathematical assumptions about 
local age patterns. Such methods assume that all areas within a larger 
area (for example, microregions within a mesoregion) have 
identically-shaped log mortality schedules by age. We propose a more 
flexible statistical estimation method that combines Poisson regression 
with the TOPALS relational model (DE BEER, 2012). We use the new method 
to estimate age-specific mortality rates in Brazilian small areas 
(states, mesoregions, microregions, and municípios) in 2010. Results for 
Minas Gerais show notable differences in the age patterns of mortality 
between adjacent small areas, demonstrating the advantages of using a 
flexible functional form in regression models.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:07.164031,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-10-27T15:25:45.603000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/citation/,zuk87,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nrqw4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/relationships/node/,nrqw4,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58121c7db83f6901e242c241/,58121c7db83f6901e242c241,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuk87/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zuk87/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zuk87
