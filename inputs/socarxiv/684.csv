There has been much interest in how intellectual property law, policy, and practice will adapt to the emergence of 3D printing and the maker movement. Intellectual property lawyers will have to grapple with the impact of additive manufacturing upon a variety of forms of intellectual property – including copyright law, trade mark law, designs law, patent law, and trade secrets. The disruptive technology of 3D printing will both pose opportunities and challenges for legal practitioners and policy-makers.

Rather than try to survey this expanding field, this article considers a number of early conflicts and skirmishes in respect of copyright law and 3D printing. There has been significant interest in the impact of 3D printing on copyright law and the creative industries. There have been classic issues raised about copyright subsistence, and the overlap between copyright law and designs. There has also been a moral panic about 3D printing facilitating copyright infringement – like peer to peer networks such as Napster in the past. There has been a use of open licensing models such as Creative Commons licensing to facilitate the sharing of 3D printing files. Such battles highlight a conflict between the open culture of the Maker Movement, and the closed culture of copyright industries. In many ways, such conflicts touch upon classic issues involved in ‘information environmentalism’. Part II looks at the controversy over Left Shark. In particular, it examines the copyright claims of Katy Perry in respect of the Left Shark figure. Part III considers questions about scanning. Augustana College tried to assert copyright against a maker, Jerry Fisher, who was scanning statues of Michelangelo (although copyright had long since expired in such work). Part IV focuses upon copyright law, 3D printing and readymades. The Estate of Marcel Duchamp lodged a copyright protest over a 3D printed set of chess, based on the work of Marcel Duchamp. Part V examines the intervention of a number of 3D printing companies in a Supreme Court of the United States dispute in Star Athletic v. Varsity Brands. Part VI considers copyright law and intermediary liability.

3D printing is a field of technology, which enabled the manufacturing of physical objects from three-dimensional digital models.

The discipline of copyright law has been challenged and disrupted by the emergence of 3D printing and additive manufacturing. 3D Printing poses questions about the subject matter protected under copyright law. Copyright law provides for exclusive economic and moral rights in respect of cultural works – such as literary works, artistic works, musical works, dramatic works, as well as other subject matter like radio and television broadcasts, sound recordings, and published editions. Copyright law demands a threshold requirement of originality. There have been sometimes issues about the interaction between copyright law and designs law in respect of works of artistic craftsmanship. In addition, 3D printing has raised larger questions about copyright infringement. There has been significant debate over the scope of copyright exceptions – such as the defence of fair dealing, and exceptions for cultural institutions. Moreover, there has been debate over the operation of digital copyright measures in respect of 3D printing. The takedown and notice system has affected services and sites, which enable the sharing of 3D printing designs. Technological protection measures – digital locks – have also raised challenges for 3D printing. The long duration of copyright protection in Australia and the United States has also raised issues in respect of 3D printing.

There has been great public policy interest into how copyright law will address and accommodate the disruptive technologies of 3D Printing. As a public policy expert at Public Knowledge, and as a lawyer working for Shapeways, Michael Weinberg has written a number of public policy papers on intellectual property and 3D Printing. Associate Professor Dinusha Mendis and her colleagues have undertaken legal and empirical research on intellectual property and 3D printing. In 2015, Professor Mark Lemley from Stanford Law School wrote about intellectual property and 3D printing in the context of work on the economics of abundance. As a practising lawyer, John Hornick has examined the topic of intellectual property and 3D printing. Comparative legal scholar Dr Angela Daly has written on the socio-legal aspects of 3D printing in 2016. The World Intellectual Property Organization in 2015 highlighted 3D printing.

3D printing has provided new opportunities for cultural institutions to redefine their activities and purposes, and engage with a variety of new constituencies. 3D printing has also highlighted deficiencies in copyright law in respect of cultural institutions. Culturally and technologically specific exceptions for libraries, archives, and cultural institutions have proven to be ill-adapted for an age of 3D printing and makerspaces. The Australian Law Reform Commission has highlighted the need to modernise Australia’s copyright laws for the digital age. Likewise, the Productivity Commission has considered the question of copyright exceptions in its study of intellectual property arrangements in 2016. The Turnbull Government has contemplated somewhat more modest copyright reforms, with the draft legislation in the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Bill 2016 (Cth). Libraries, galleries, museums, and archives would all benefit from flexible copyright exceptions for cultural institutions to take full advantage of the possibilities of digitisation and 3D printing.",TRUE,FALSE,3d printing|archives|copyright law|cultural heritage|cultural institutions|fabspaces|galleries|libraries|makerspaces|museums,2018-07-02T11:05:27.652109,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-05T11:55:23.412540,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/citation/,e54vn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zph3b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/relationships/node/,zph3b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5985b17db83f690229bedcad/,5985b17db83f690229bedcad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e54vn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e54vn,NA

However, the presence of a strong social safety net in these countries has not solved the problem of socioeconomic exclusion, manifesting in such outcomes as chronic unemployment and welfare dependency. In an effort to understand this phenomenon, the current study builds on the assumption that psychological risk factors emerge as important determinants of socioeconomic disadvantage in an environment where ascribed characteristics have less impact on educational and occupational attainment. Using data from Finland, this research examined a life course model linking childhood differences in cognitive skills and antisocial propensity to midlife socioeconomic exclusion. The Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development (n = 369) follows individuals from age 8 (b. 1959) through age 50. Evidence from a structural equation model found support for key theoretical predictions: (1) human capital and antisocial pathways contributed independently to socioeconomic exclusion; (2) the effect of childhood psychological factors on midlife socioeconomic exclusion was mediated by adolescent and adult life course outcomes; and (3) the human capital and antisocial domains intersected such that antisocial children struggled in school as adolescents, which contributed to their persistence in crime and deviance in adulthood – a behavioral pattern that directly increased the risk of socioeconomic exclusion in midlife. In short, the findings suggest that early emerging differences in cognitive ability and antisociality set in motion a process of negative life outcomes with enduring consequences for socioeconomic well-being. The results are discussed from the perspective of socio-historical context and public policy.",TRUE,FALSE,antisocial behavior|Finland|human capital|individual differences|life course|midlife|noncognitive skills|Poverty|social exclusion|socioeconomic disadvantage|welfare state,2018-07-02T11:05:26.488502,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-03T14:43:55.308080,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",© 2016 American Psychological Association.,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/citation/,35w4n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jdx6b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/relationships/node/,jdx6b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598334da594d9002409f9fa2/,598334da594d9002409f9fa2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/35w4n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/35w4n,https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000344

Shrinking cities could utilize vacant land to provide more green space, but declining tax revenues preclude new park development – a situation pronounced in Japan, where some cities are projected to shrink by over ten percent, but lack green space. Could informal urban green spaces (IGS; vacant lots, street verges, brownfields etc.) supplement parks in shrinking cities? This study analyzes residents’ perception, use, and management preferences (management goals, approaches to participatory management, willingness to participate) for IGS using a large, representative online survey (n=1,000) across four major shrinking Japanese cities: Sapporo, Nagano, Kyoto and Kitakyushu. Results show that residents saw IGS as a common element of the urban landscape and their daily lives, but their evaluation was mixed. Recreation and urban agriculture were preferred to redevelopment and non-management. For participative management, residents saw a need for the city administration to mediate usage and liability, and expected an improved appearance, but emphasized the need for financial and non-financial support. A small but significant minority (~10%) were willing to participate in management activities.

While the requirement for Open Data in government funded research can provide an excellent basis for future research, not all Open Data is created equal. Releasing the methods of analysis alongside a dataset of high quality will also allow for lower technical difficulties when reusing or remixing the data.

Circuity results from a circulation network’s configuration, planning, and underlying terrain. In turn, it impacts how humans use urban space for settlement and travel. Although past research has examined overall street network circuity, researchers have not studied the relative circuity of walkable versus drivable circulation networks. To address this gap, this study uses OpenStreetMap data to explore relative network circuity. We download walkable and drivable networks for 40 US cities using the OSMnx software, which we then use to simulate two million routes and analyze circuity to characterize network structure. We find that walking networks tend to allow for more direct trips than driving networks do in most cities: average driving circuity exceeds average walking circuity in all but four of the cities that exhibit statistically significant differences between network types. We discuss various reasons for this phenomenon, illustrated with case studies. Network circuity also varies substantially between different types of places. These findings underscore the value of using network-based distances rather than straight-line distances when studying urban travel and access. They also suggest the importance of differentiating between walkable and drivable circulation networks when modeling and characterizing urban street networks: although different modes’ networks overlap in any given city, their relative structure and performance vary in most cities.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|big data|circuity|cities|civil engineering|driving|geospatial|GIS|land use|modeling|network analysis|networks|open data|OpenStreetMap|pedestrian|public data|python|simulation|spatial analysis|street network|transportation|urban design|urban form|urban morphology|urban planning|urban studies|walkability,2018-07-02T11:05:25.355213,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-02T17:10:54.420796,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/citation/,4rzqa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7fr5m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/relationships/node/,7fr5m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598206fc6c613b022b7e2ce0/,598206fc6c613b022b7e2ce0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4rzqa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4rzqa,NA

Scholars of cities and urban planning have incorporated complexity theories from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. From a structural standpoint, the urban form may be characterized by the morphological complexity of its circulation networks – particularly their density, resilience, centrality, and connectedness. This dissertation unpacks theories of nonlinearity and complex systems, then develops a framework for assessing the complexity of urban form and street networks. It introduces a new tool, OSMnx, to collect street network and other urban form data for anywhere in the world, then analyze and visualize them. Finally, it presents a large empirical study of 27,000 street networks, examining their metric and topological complexity relevant to urban design, transportation research, and the human experience of the built environment.",TRUE,FALSE,built environment|centrality|chaos|cities|complexity|complex systems|connectivity|network analysis|networks|nonlinearity|python|resilience|social physics|street networks|sustainability|topology|transportation|urban design|urban form|urban morphology|urban planning,2018-07-02T11:05:25.294993,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-02T17:06:33.668994,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/citation/,93h82,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/esvdx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/relationships/node/,esvdx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59820574b83f69022a07fe1f/,59820574b83f69022a07fe1f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93h82/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93h82/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93h82,NA

This is evidenced in the field of data analytics, which is interdisciplinary in nature and severely lacking in professional talent.  This paper explores the T-shaped skills desired by businesses seeking graduates with an analytics degree and the challenges Universities face when developing interdisciplinary programs. We apply business process modeling in a University setting by mapping out the current processes involved with starting and sustaining a new graduate degree program.  Through this approach, a roadmap is developed as a tool for University domain experts, which highlights areas of inefficiency that can be further streamlined to allow improved flexibility and evaluation of all graduate programs.",TRUE,FALSE,analytics|curriculum design|data science|graduate programs|interdisciplinary graduate program|professional masters,2018-07-02T11:05:24.789306,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-31T19:25:40.363424,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d71|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/citation/,3bgu7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3jnbu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/relationships/node/,3jnbu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597f80ba9ad5a1022ae56a2c/,597f80ba9ad5a1022ae56a2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bgu7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3bgu7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3bgu7,NA

We begin by reviewing the basics of relational event modeling, with an emphasis on models with piecewise constant hazards. We then discuss estimation for dyadic and more general relational event models using the relevent package, with an emphasis on hands-on applications of the methods and interpretation of results.

Exploring the Role of Intrauterine Environment in Moderating Genetic Influences on Body Weight,"By incorporating molecular genetic variants and the fetal origins of obesity hypothesis into a gene-environment interaction framework, this study investigates the potential interactive effects of variation in the obesity-associated gene (FTO) and intrauterine environment on body mass index (BMI) in adulthood. This study draws on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, and uses sibling comparisons that allow for quasi-experimental variations in both genetic and environmental factors. Findings demonstrated that even after controlling for unobserved family background, the FTO variants and birth weight are generally associated with adult BMI. Moreover, this study found that the effects of having a risk allele of the FTO gene are largely concentrated on those who were heavier at birth, providing evidence for a gene-environment interaction on BMI and the development of obesity. Results of this study suggest that genes are not destiny and environmental factors may offset the effects of obesity-promoting genes. In particular, efforts to counteract genetic effects on obesity may begin as early as in utero. Interventions to prevent higher birth weight may help reduce the risk of obesity later in life, by directly addressing the programming effects of the in utero environment and also indirectly moderating the obesity-promoting genetic effects.",TRUE,FALSE,Birth Weight|BMI|FTO|Gene-Environment Interaction|Obesity|WLS,2018-07-02T11:05:24.598426,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-30T20:32:46.349250,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/citation/,jngrx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c347j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/relationships/node/,c347j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597e41f06c613b023a8d26b3/,597e41f06c613b023a8d26b3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jngrx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jngrx,NA
