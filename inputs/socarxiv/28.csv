The current study explores the knowledge and beliefs of Saudi students of English as a foreign language (EFL) about English reading comprehension strategies. It also intends to determine if there is a significant correlation between the students’ foundational knowledge of English reading comprehension strategies and their beliefs about reading comprehension strategies. The study employed a quantitative method. The data were collected using a forty-item survey questionnaire. The respondents were 203 Saudi EFL students enrolled in Preparatory Year Program at Northern Border University in Saudi Arabia. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and a test of non-parametric correlation (Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient) was run to determine the relationship between the variables. The overall findings of the study revealed that the students have a good foundational knowledge of pre-reading, while-reading, and post-reading reading strategies. The correlational analysis showed a medium correlation between students’ foundational knowledge of reading strategies and their beliefs about reading strategies.

Determiner spreading is the syntactic representation and phonological realization of multiple determiners within the same determiner phrase. As a cross-linguistic phenomenon, determiner spreading has been investigated in other languages (e.g., Scandinavian and Greek); different accounts have been proposed. For Scandinavian languages, determiner spreading has been analyzed as a representation of different semantic interpretations. As far as Greek is concerned, some analyses have been proposed; however, two prominent ones have received considerable attention in the literature: (i) a residue of a reduced relative clause and (ii) an instantiation of close appositions. Contrary to those analyses, this paper claims that none of the two analyses is suitable for Arabic; thus, a language-specific analysis is required. To analyze determiner spreading in Arabic, the current paper posits the following research question: What is the linguistic purpose of the multiple determiners found in Arabic determiner phrases? Answering the research question, the paper claims that, in addition to its indispensable role in establishing agreement between nouns and adjectives within the Arabic determiner phrase, determiner spreading demarcates syntactic and semantic phrase boundaries. The paper takes Minimalist Program and Distributed Morphology as a theoretical framework to argue that attributive adjectives are projection of an agreement phrase headed by the definite article ʔal or by the indefinite phonological marker `nunation: -n’. This proposal requires no syntactic movements in the syntax proper. The ultimate linear order is achieved in the phonological components.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic|close apposition|demarcation|determiner phrases|determiner spreading|semantics|syntax,2021-04-20T10:30:06.029143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:33:09.229784,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/citation/,j3k4a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e5a060c818202e651371f/,607e5a060c818202e651371f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3k4a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j3k4a/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j3k4a

The overarching aim of this study is to examine the impact of English-medium instruction (EMI) on Omani engineering students’ academic performance and their studies in an English-medium engineering programme in Oman. This paper reports on findings from a larger project that was intended to investigate Omani engineering students’ experience of learning through the medium of English in one of the Colleges of Technology in Oman. The study adopted a qualitative interpretative approach with a case study strategy and a purposive sampling technique to look into the impact of EMI on Omani engineering students’ academic performance and their studies. The sample included 12 Omani engineering and 8 engineering instructors who were interviewed along with five classroom observations. The data were collected and generated through semi-structured interviews and classroom observations. They were analysed manually, inductively and thematically using Braun and Clarke’s model (2006).

Structured Input vs. Structured Output Task’s Effects on the Acquisition of the English Causative Forms: Discourse-Level.,"This research paper presents a quasi-experimental empirical study investigating the effects of structured input and structured output tasks on the acquisition of English causative forms. This research is framed on VanPatten’s (1996) input processing theory. The grammatical form chosen for this investigation is affected by a processing strategy called the First Noun Principle. There are three variables included that make this study significant.  These variables are having participants that are young learners who speak Arabic as an L1 and using discourse-level instrumentation. These variables make this study significant because the studies that investigated the effectiveness of structured input practice with these variables are in the minority. The study’s main questions are: (i) What are the short-term effects of structured input and structured output on the acquisition of English causative forms as measured with discourse-level interpretation tasks? (ii) What are the short-term effects of structured input and structured output on the learners’ ability to acquire the English causative forms as measured with discourse-level production tasks?  Participants were school-age learners (aged 12-13) from an Arabic background with Arabic as an L1 who studied English as a second language in Kuwait. A pre and post-test procedure was adopted in this study. Two instructional groups were created, which are: (i) structured input; (ii) structured output. Discourse-level tasks were used in the study to assess the effectiveness of the two instructional treatments. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ANOVA. The main findings support the view that discourse-level structured input tasks are a useful pedagogical intervention in helping young L2 learners from an Arabic background with Arabic as an L1 to process, interpret and produce accurate English causative forms.

I use data from a lab-in-the-field experiment conducted in Mali, a West African country with an active  conflict managed by troops from France and the United Nations (UN), to show that  UN peacekeepers increase the willingness of individuals to cooperate relative to control and French enforcers. Moreover, I find that  UN peacekeepers are especially effective among those participants who hold other groups and institutions in low esteem as well as those who have more frequent contact with peacekeepers.

Thirty-eight Thai EFL undergraduate students majoring in English at a university located in Thailand participated in the study. To determine the students’ vocabulary knowledge before and after the instruction, the vocabulary pretest and posttest were employed. A perception questionnaire and a semi-structured interview were conducted at the end of VSS instruction to elicit the students’ perceptions towards VSS instruction. The paired samples t-test analysis indicates that the students improved short-term vocabulary retention, and they could retain vocabulary learned after VSS instruction. The results from the questionnaire and the semi-structured interview showed that they mostly agreed that VSS instruction assisted them in learning new words, memorizing word meaning, having a chance to choose their own words to learn, sharing words to classmates, working in a group, and realizing the importance of learning new words.

It is a poem published in 1910. It presents the embedded ideologies and shows how the poet used the available linguistic resources to achieve his goal. The models of analysis adopted are Critical Stylistics as proposed by Lesley Jeffries (2010) and  Stylistic Analysis as submitted by McIntyre (2010).  The paper aims at identifying the poet’s beliefs to show that success is the outcome of self-control and a real sense of the values of things. It is a try to discover how the poet used various linguistic choices to build a message telling us how to deal with life confidently and identify a line of ideological positioning through Critical Stylistic strategies. The paper presents a theoretical background of the term stylistics and critical stylistics, explaining the adopted models; Analyzing the poem stylistically with a focus on critical stylistic regarding two tools: Representing and Negating for their dominant use in the poem and their effectiveness in interpreting the hidden ideologies. Stylistic devices are used because they steer the text to enable the writer to reach the intended goal. In conclusion, the paper displays that the poet uses the stylistic tools in a brilliant way that leads All, not only his son, to follow and consider it a moral lesson of life.",TRUE,FALSE,critical stylistic analysis|material actions|mental processes|Rudyard Kipling poem If|stylistics|verbalization,2021-04-20T10:12:27.353519,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:27:56.338129,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/citation/,7fmx4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e5517eb9cc9030714d37c/,607e5517eb9cc9030714d37c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmx4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7fmx4/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7fmx4

The current study used a mixed method to answer the question of the study which is: What is the perception of EFL learners and teachers toward the use of online videos in EFL classes? It includes both quantitative and qualitative techniques, namely a questionnaire and an interview. To get the required data and to answer the question of the study, the researcher collected information by distributing a relevant questionnaire among 120 EFL Saudi female students who are studying English in their preparatory year “Unified Scientific Track” at Taibah University. Their ages range between 18 to 21 years old. The questionnaire of the study consists of 10 items. For the first nine items, Likert Scale is used to let the respondents range the statements on a five- point scale. The tenth item asks the respondents to rate the usefulness of the online video regarding language skills and other aspects. The researcher also conducted an interview with six EFL teachers who teach English language skills in the English Language Centre (ELC) at Taibah University. The responses of the participants showed that the use of online videos is an effective technique and has a positive influence in EFL classes.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL learners|language skills|online video|perception|technology,2021-04-20T10:00:02.632076,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:26:26.932104,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/citation/,5t2xs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e524aeb9cc9030714c254/,607e524aeb9cc9030714c254,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t2xs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5t2xs/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5t2xs

An effective EFL writing instruction, therefore, plays a significant role in helping EFL students deal with writing problems efficiently and approach writing tasks effectively. Based on this premise, the present study aims at investigating the effect of two alternative writing approaches, process and product, on Moroccan EFL students’ writing performance to find out which of these approaches is more effective. It explores process writing instruction based on Hayes’ (2012) recent model that responded to both critiques of the 1980-s original model of Flower and Hayes and to new ideas, which adds more layers to EFL writing research and instruction.  To this end, the participants were divided into two groups, A and B, and they all took a writing pre-test before the treatment. For three months (two hours per week),  group A students received academic argumentative writing instruction that was product-oriented, while group B students were taught academic argumentative writing based on Hayes’ (2012) process writing model. After the treatment, all participants took a writing post-test. The analysis of the collected data revealed that group B participants showed a significant improvement in their compositions compared to their group A counterparts, which provides evidence that the process-oriented approach is more effective in enhancing EFL writing than the product-oriented approach. In the light of these findings, some pedagogical recommendations were suggested.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-20T09:59:04.059150,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:26:09.153881,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/citation/,4aebr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e5193c29ca802ffeb256c/,607e5193c29ca802ffeb256c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4aebr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4aebr/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4aebr
