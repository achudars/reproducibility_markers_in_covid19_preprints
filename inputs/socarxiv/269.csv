Yet, conventional methods for analyzing causal mechanisms are difficult to use when the causal effect of interest involves multiple mediators that are potentially causally dependent—a common scenario in political science applications. This article introduces a general framework for tracing causal paths with multiple mediators. In this framework, the total effect of a treatment on an outcome is decomposed into a set of path-specific effects (PSEs). We propose an imputation approach for estimating these PSEs from experimental and observational data, along with a set of bias formulas for conducting sensitivity analysis. We illustrate this approach using an experimental study on issue framing effects and an observational study on the legacy of political violence.

While teaching helps them to grow academically, learning and scholarship are essential for personal development. In a participatory, progressive and tolerant society, the role of a teacher is to help children in becoming positively ‘participating citizens’. In Pakistan, there is a huge emphasis on exam-oriented quantitative teaching practices within government schools; however, the learning and scholarship aspect seems to have been largely left neglected. Currently, the only opportunity for a child to have a mentor-oriented learning experience within the school is through subject classes. Unfortunately, these classes do provide subject-specific guidance but does address after the overall development needs of a child, in particular: personal development, their trajectory in achieving their full potential, hitting learning objectives through the schooling experience and in developing ways of self-reflection. 
The purpose of the draft is to propose a system of Personal Tutorage to be introduced at the government schools in Pakistan. For the benefit of the political and bureaucratic audience, the authors have intentionally kept the discussion closely relevant to the very structure of the proposed system and have avoided unnecessary jargon, as well as a detailed literature review. The draft is by no means suggested as a final proposal and has substantial room for updates and structural improvements.

Part of this decline may be due to the rapid growth of free digital goods.  Statistical agencies have no reliable way to measure the benefits of the introduction of free goods. This is true even when the provision of the goods is paid for via advertising. Yet these free goods are enormously popular and surely create substantial utility for households. In this paper, we suggest a methodology which will allow statistical agencies to form rough approximations to the benefits that flow to households from new free goods. The present paper draws heavily on the contributions of Brynjolfsson, Collis, Diewert, Eggers and Fox (2019) (subsequent references will be to BCDEF) and Diewert, Fox and Schreyer (2019).  In section I, we outline how the reservation price methodology introduced by Hicks (1940; 114) can be used to measure the consumption benefits to households of new products that are provided at zero cost or costs that are close to zero. This Hicksian approach relies on normal index number theory but requires the estimation of reservation prices. In section II, we show how choice experiments about compensation for product withdrawals can be used to estimate these reservation prices.

These components are indispensable for the teaching-learning processes. It is observed that engineering faculty members do not require any ‘teacher-training’ to join the engineering institutions across the globe. Hence, they may not have adequate experience in assessing students’ performances and providing feedback to students. Only a few research studies have been carried out on assessment and feedback from the engineering education context. Therefore, this paper attempts to critically analyse the literature pertaining to learning through different types and methods of assessment practices in the engineering education settings. Further, it examines the significance of qualitative feedback in assessment and the principles of good feedback practice. It highlights the implications of assessing student performance and providing feedback from the engineering education perspective.

The emergence of a neo-institutionalist sociology of journalism and the application of Bourdieu’s field theory to this subject provide sociologists of science with new tools to make sense of journalists’ work in controversies. This paper draws on this literature to shed light the media coverage of the controversy over the safety of the 2009 pandemic flu vaccine. Using semi-structured interviews with journalists who covered this issue for the French agenda-setting news-media and content analysis of the coverage proposed by a sample of these media, it analyses the diversity in the media coverage of this issue. I show that journalists presented a variety of conceptions of their role during this crisis. This was reflected in significant variations in how the issue was covered in the French news media. These variations are linked to journalists’ professional trajectories, their media’s position in the market and the overall evolution of the field of health journalism. These results contrast with the traditional account of why vaccine criticism emerges in the news that presents journalists on the whole as being favourable towards the “antivaccine movement” and as interested in fostering controversies on vaccination.",TRUE,FALSE,controversies|journalists|media|science|sociology|STS|vaccines,2020-01-10T07:06:01.976092,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-10T07:05:43.491000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/citation/,75tnh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1752a75734190336804803/,5e1752a75734190336804803,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75tnh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75tnh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75tnh,NA

Denial-of-Service Attacks After Sanction Events,"Conventional wisdom expects to see a rise of cyber activities around aggressive foreign policy events. In this article, I test this claim by investigating whether sanctions lead to an increase in DoS attacks using new data on Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks measured from Internet traffic. Exploring the development of DoS attacks around sanctions imposed against Russia in 2014 indeed shows an increase of DoS attacks against several sanction sender states. Extending this case study to a systematic analysis including all sanction threats and impositions made by the United States and the European Union from 2008 until 2016 shows no apparent patterns. However, when I exclusively consider sanctions against technologically advanced countries, the frequency of attacks rises systematically against the United States. Overall, it appears that countries do not always have to expect a digital retaliation after aggressive foreign policies. Nevertheless, this article finds evidence for an increase of DoS attacks against states when they impose sanctions against technologically advanced countries.",TRUE,FALSE,cyberattacks|cyberspace|digital politics|international conflict|sanctions,2020-01-10T06:59:24.240839,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-10T06:59:11.374785,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/citation/,veyfd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e17415a7545840300f99b8b/,5e17415a7545840300f99b8b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/veyfd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/veyfd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/veyfd,NA
