Despite their numbers and the economic hardships they face, disability is often excluded from general sociological studies of stratification and inequality. To address some of these omissions, this paper focuses on employment and earnings inequality by disability status in the United States since the enactment of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a policy that affects many Americans. After using Current Population Survey data from 1988-2014 to describe these continuing disparities, we review research that incorporates multiple theories to explain continuing gaps in employment and earnings by disability status. In addition to theories pointing to the so-called failures of the ADA, explanations also include general criticisms of the capitalist system and economic downturns, dependence on social welfare and disability benefits, the nature of work, and employer attitudes. We conclude with a call for additional research on disability and discrimination that helps to better situate disability within the American stratification system.",TRUE,FALSE,Disability|Discrimination|Employment|Stratification,2020-12-30T22:03:40.922036,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-30T22:03:18.512889,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/citation/,3v76h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5feb7210e3acd102bc4a7893/,5feb7210e3acd102bc4a7893,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v76h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3v76h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3v76h,https://doi.org/10.18061/dsq.v35i3.4927

This study explores an under-researched dimension of this phenomenon, investigating the relationship between feminist identification and sexual behavior. In heterosexual encounters, do feminist men report having sex more recently than those who do not call themselves feminists? During sexual encounters, do feminist men behave differently than non-feminists? In particular, do feminist men organize their sexual behavior in a way that prioritizes their partners’ sexual pleasure to a greater extent than non-feminists? Using representative survey data of Canadian adults, we examine the self-reported sexual behavior of heterosexual Canadian men. We find that self-identifying feminist men report having sex more recently and are more likely to report engaging in breast stimulation and performing oral sex on their partners than non-feminists.

This thesis has been done with a phenomenological epistemology and a holistic idea of man. Following the framework of childhood sociology I understand children as active agents. Within this framework, I want to bring out the voices of children behind the statistics about child poverty. Plenty of research has been done on child poverty, but the children’s own experiences are seldom listened to. This is especially true for children in developing countries, who at the same time appear in countless pictures provided by international charities. This creates an illusion of poor children being far away, and nowhere near us. However, as research on childhood poverty experiences has revealed, Northern European children have diverse experiences of poverty as well. To lessen the comparison and simplification, I have found it important to listen to children themselves and to reflect Tanzanian and Northern European children’s experiences. I carried out my ethnographic field work in the beginning of 2018 while I did a three-month social work apprenticeship in a small and local NGO working with families in the Tanzanian city of Mwanza. As a part of my weekly work in the organization, I organized group sessions for two groups of children aged 8–16, who were living in small mountain villages. It was in these groups that I gathered most of my research material, through group discussions, writing tasks, and drawings. In addition, I also wrote notes in my daily life. As an ethnographer, I reflected everything I saw to the context of Finland and to the literature review I had previously made about Northern European children’s experiences of poverty. Hence, I have had a reflective approach to my work all the way. I approached my material by qualitative content analysis, and soon recognized that it contains some of the categories found in Northern European research on children’s experiences of poverty.

A central finding of this study is that Tanzanian children’s experiences of poverty are indeed quite similar to those of Northern European children. Both have experiences of poverty related to deprivation of basic needs, and the effect this deprivation causes on friendships is also pointed out. In addition, poverty causes tension in families, which stems from the contradiction between scarce resources and the demands of the environment. This tension requires children to use various coping strategies in order to balance between the family conditions, their own needs and the expectations of friends. The experienced deprivation of basic needs is described as deficiencies in food, school materials, clothes, home environment, and health. These deficiencies are in turn described as leading to experiences of alienation, otherness, bullying, and to the need of children to regulate the amount of money spent together with friends. However, the Tanzanian children also have experiences that cannot be found in Northern European studies. In the category of food deficiencies, these include the lack of food in schools, the obligation to participate in buying food for the household, and the shame that is put on buying unnecessary snacks. Additionally, some possibilities that are self-evident for all Northern European children raise doubt in Tanzanian children. These include possibilities to attend school, to get health care and to live at home instead of in the street. From the viewpoint of friendships, it is common for Tanzanian children to spend time in free play, whereas Northern European children often see paid hobbies as a must in order to participate fully. Further, the Tanzanian children are strong moral agents in teaching their friends in how to use money properly. Having respect for elders and a willingness to help parents is especially important to Tanzanian children. The strong authority of Tanzanian parents is seen in my material as a low level of communication between parents and children, for example in parents not sharing shame or economic trouble with their children.

The children I have encountered present multiple explanations to poverty, and also share varied ways of helping poor people. The children see everyone’s role important in preventing poverty, and they hope for this work to be done together from the individual level all the way to the cultural level. In my work I have moved between different levels, considering individual situations and reflecting them culturally. The aim of this thesis is to bring new perspective on poverty as a phenomenon experienced by children.",TRUE,FALSE,Africa|Basic Needs|Childhood Poverty|Childhood Sociology|Child Perspective|Child Poverty|Children's Friendships|Children's Status|Content Analysis|Coping Strategies|Cross-Cultural Research|Developing Countries|Empowering Children|Ethnography|Experiences of Poverty|Family Relationships|Hierarchy of Needs|Northern Europe|Phenomenology|Social Exclusion|Subjective Poverty|Tanzania,2020-12-30T22:07:21.950099,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-30T22:04:33.317773,FALSE,NA,no,I collected the data independently for this thesis and the data (my research material) has not been published anywhere.,,no,"This is a translation of my Finnish Master's thesis, and the prior steps have hence not been published.

Using contract-level information on public spending from Colombia’s e-procurement platform, and a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that municipalities classified by a machine learning algorithm as more prone to corruption react to the spending surge by using a larger proportion of discretionary non-competitive contracts and increasing their average value, especially to procure crisis-related items.

After anti-corruption audits, municipalities experience an increase in the number of firms concentrated in sectors most dependent on government relationships.

Politically connected firms suffer after the audits.

We evaluate the short- and medium-term impacts of lockdown policies on civic attitudes relevant for the health of democracy. Using survey data collected daily between March and May 2020 in the United States and four European countries from 27,317 respondents and a difference-in-differences design, we document that lockdown policies give rise to authoritarian values and, to a lesser degree, support for autocracy. We find little evidence that lockdown policies affect satisfaction with democracy and the government, out-group hostility, and generalized trust. Additional analyses reveal that the effects on authoritarianism and support for autocracy persist for at least seven weeks, that the lifting of lockdown policies does not have a countervailing effect away from authoritarianism and support for autocracy, and that economic support packages have limited ability to alleviate the negative consequences of lockdowns on civic attitudes. Together, these findings confirm the existence of lockdowns' political repercussions, but show the need for a nuanced assessment of their scope. We discuss the implications of our findings for how governments might need to accompany lockdowns with measures that strengthen civic culture.",TRUE,FALSE,civic attitudes|covid19|democracy|lockdown,2020-12-30T22:10:22.019669,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-30T22:08:18.733001,FALSE,NA,no,Will be made available soon.,,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Marbach|Ward|Hangartner,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/citation/,5nsgc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe9dcf6e9ccb90234aee91f/,5fe9dcf6e9ccb90234aee91f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nsgc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5nsgc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5nsgc,NA

In this article, we provide an assessment of vital statistics in Kerala, India. Kerala is home to more than 33 million people and a comparatively low-mortality context. We use individual-level vital-registration data on more than 2.8 million deaths between 2006 and 2017 from the Kerala MARANAM (Mortality and Registration Assessment and Monitoring) Study. Comparing age-specific mortality rates from the CRS to those from the Sample Registration System (SRS), we do not find evidence that the CRS under-estimates mortality. Instead, CRS rates are smoother across ages and less variable across periods. In particular, the CRS records higher death rates than the SRS for ages where mortality is low, and for women. Using these data we provide the first set of annual sex-specific life-tables for any state in India. We find that life expectancy at birth was 77.9 years for women in 2017, and 71.4 years for men. Although Kerala is unique in many ways, our findings strengthen the case for more careful attention to mortality records within LMICs, and for their better dissemination by government agencies.",TRUE,FALSE,civil registration|health surveillance|India|Kerala|mortality|vital statistics,2020-12-30T21:59:21.180763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-30T21:58:57.672133,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",Aashish Gupta|Sneha Mani,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/citation/,jachq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe9cb341e6d97022a2fa095/,5fe9cb341e6d97022a2fa095,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jachq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jachq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jachq,NA
