The processes of within- and between- group cooperation and competition have shaped human history over the last several millennia. To deepen our understanding of the underlying social dynamics, we model a society subdivided into groups with constant sizes and dynamically changing powers. Both individuals within groups and groups themselves participate in collective actions. The groups are also engaged in political contests over power which determines how resources are distributed. Using analytical approximations and agent-based simulations, we show that the model exhibits rich behavior characterized by multiple stable equilibria and, under some conditions, non-equilibrium dynamics. The strength of democratic institutions plays a key role: increasing it promotes cooperation, reduces variation in power, and mitigates inequality among groups. We show that increasing potential benefits of between-group cooperation promotes it only in societies with strong democratic institutions. We show that small groups are successful in competition if the jointly-produced goods are rivalrous and the potential benefit of cooperation is small. Otherwise large groups dominate. Overall our model contributes towards a better understanding of the causes of variation between societies in terms of the economic and political inequality within them.",TRUE,FALSE,collective action problem|contest for power|cooperation|group-size paradox|modelling,2021-02-08T02:06:21.380605,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-08T02:06:04.828765,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/citation/,24svr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60204bfc4497cf00e49c6799/,60204bfc4497cf00e49c6799,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/24svr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/24svr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/24svr,NA

In response to this, the Spanish government enacted a strict lockdown in late March, that was gradually eased until June. We explored differentials in mobility by area-level deprivation in the functional area of Madrid, before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We used cell phone-derived mobility indicators (% of the population leaving their area) from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), and a composite measure of deprivation from the Spanish Society of Epidemiology (SEE). We computed changes in mobility with respect to pre-pandemic levels, and explored spatial patterns and associations with deprivation. We found that levels of mobility before COVID-19 were slightly higher in areas with lower deprivation. The economic hibernation period resulted in very strong declines in mobility, most acutely in low deprivation areas. These differences weakened during the re-opening, and levels of mobility were similar by deprivation once the lockdown was lifted. Given the existence of important socioeconomic differentials in COVID-19 exposure, it is key to ensure that these interventions do not widen existing social inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,commuting|coronavirus|COVID-19|inequalities|mobility|quarantine,2021-02-08T02:03:22.888086,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-08T02:03:14.188391,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/citation/,apz4e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60203140339cb600e7cf2985/,60203140339cb600e7cf2985,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/apz4e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/apz4e,NA

To date, the literature has treated this theory as a model that merely explains employer behavior. This article contends that the idea of statistical discrimination, rather than simply providing an explanation, can lead people to view social stereotyping as useful and acceptable and thus help rationalize and justify discriminatory decisions. A preregistered survey experiment with more than 2,000 participants who had managerial experience shows that exposure to statistical discrimination theory strengthened people’s belief in the accuracy of stereotypes, their acceptance of stereotyping, and the extent to which they engaged in gender discrimination in a hiring simulation. Reading a critical commentary on the theory mitigated these effects.

With either repeated cross-sectional data or conventional panel data, raw change cannot be decomposed into over-time differences that are attributable to the effects of common experiences of alternative birth cohorts, features of the periods under observation, and the cumulation of lifecourse aging.  This article proposes a rolling panel model for cohort, period, and aging effects, suggested by and tuned to the treble panel data collected for the General Social Survey (GSS) from 2006 through 2014.  While the model does not offer a general solution for the identification of the classical age-period-cohort (APC) accounting model, it yields warranted interpretations under plausible assumptions that are reasonable for many outcomes of interest.  In particular, if aging effects can be assumed to be invariant over the course of an observation interval, and if separate panel samples of the full age distribution overlap within the same observation interval, then period and aging effects can be parameterized and interpreted separately, adjusted for cohort differences that pulse through the same observation interval.  The estimated cohort effects during the observation interval are then interpretable as effects during the observation interval of entangled period and cumulated aging differences from before the observation interval.",TRUE,FALSE,Cohort analysis|General Social Survey|Panel data,2021-02-05T15:10:42.222031,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-05T14:51:47.643053,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/citation/,m582q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jzkxm/,jzkxm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/601d529f7ad0a800bbd95b36/,601d529f7ad0a800bbd95b36,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m582q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m582q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m582q,NA

Cities around the world responded by instituting a variety of policies and programs meant to address this shift, such as carving out roadway space for non-car uses, putting pedestrian walk signals on recall, reducing speed limits, and subsidizing bike share schemes. The extraordinarily rapid pace and global scale of these responses—and the public’s reactions to them—suggest that the transport planning, policy, and engineering professions may be at an inflection point with respect to equitable accommodation of non-car transport modes. In this paper we describe an effort to support potential shifts in practice by documenting and cataloging over a thousand COVID-19-related mobility responses into a publicly available database. We provide detailed guidance on using the database, along with preliminary summaries of key variables in the database. We also put forth a research agenda intended to build understanding about the processes that led to these actions, their implications for future efforts to design and implement pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and ways in which the transport professions might evolve in response to lessons learned during and after the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,bicycling|COVID-19|infrastructure|practice change|transport planning|walking,2021-02-05T14:41:24.619512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-05T09:44:32.356181,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://pedbikeinfo.org/shiftingstreets,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Tabitha S.
