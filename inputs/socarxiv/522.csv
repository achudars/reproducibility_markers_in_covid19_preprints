However, a deeper understanding of the relationship between MS characteristics and a firm’s financial performance is needed. This study proposes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of MS characteristics (i.e., key words and readability) for Latin-American firms and their relationship to financial performance. MS content is evaluated using content analysis software, and the relationship between MS readability and financial performance is examined using regression analysis. The results of the content analysis suggest differences among industries and an international trend toward isomorphism regarding key terms. The results of the quantitative analysis revealed a positive relationship between MS readability and return on assets and return on equity.

Taking advantage of rich Danish population data, we apply log‐linear models that include four ways of measuring educational homogamy patterns: (a) by returns to education, (b) by macro‐education (five aggregated levels), (c) by field of study (16 categories), and (d) by a disaggregated micro‐educational classification, combining levels and fields of study (54 groups). Our results show declines in educational homogamy from 1984 to 2013, but the odds ratios of being educationally homogamous at the university college and university levels remain of substantial magnitude, by both the macro‐ and micro‐educational measures. The micro‐educational classification outperforms all other measures in explaining the associations in the homogamy tables.

They claim that since these countries already have so much in common and because they are already bound together by a dense web of security commitments, it is viable to create a globe-spanning zone of free movement of goods, services, and labour. Some argue that these initial steps should be followed by deeper integration, even the creation of a transcontinental (con)federal polity. In this paper we analyse CANZUK as an attempt to develop a fruitful post-Brexit imaginary and as a case of contemporary transnational elite advocacy. We show that the argumentative moves, institutional prescriptions, and rhetorical strategies, of CANZUK advocacy echo those of late Victorian and Edwardian imperial enthusiasts to a remarkable degree.

Archaeologists across South America have pointed to patterns of regional abandonment during the Middle Holocene (8200 to 4200 cal BP) as evidence of sensitivity to shifts in hydroclimate over this period. We develop a unified approach to investigate demography and climate in South America and aim to clarify the extent to which evidence of local anthropic responses can be generalised to large-scale trends. We achieve this by integrating archaeological radiocarbon data and palaeoclimatic time series to show that population decline occurred coeval with the transition to the initial mid-Holocene across South America. Through the analysis of radiocarbon dates with Monte Carlo methods, we find multiple, sustained phases of downturn associated to periods of high climatic variability. A likely driver of the duration and severity of demographic turnover is the frequency of exceptional climatic events, rather than the absolute magnitude of change. Unpredictable levels of tropical precipitation had sustained negative impacts on pre-Columbian populations lasting until at least 6000 cal BP, after which recovery is evident. Our results support the inference that a demographic regime shift in the second half of the Middle Holocene were coeval with cultural practices surrounding Neotropical plant management and early cultivation, possibly acting as buffers when the wild resource base was in flux.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Climate change|Demography|Domestication|Holocene|Palaeoecology|Radiocarbon|Simulation|South America,2018-11-09T15:16:21.602744,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-09T15:15:32.321350,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/citation/,7zw6x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v2c93/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/relationships/node/,v2c93,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be56e589738410018225f82/,5be56e589738410018225f82,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7zw6x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7zw6x,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-43086-w

This paper begins with a broader question and adopts a more grounded strategy, asking: what are some elements of an informal commodity market in a developing country, such as a goat market, that can be identified in an ethnographic approach? Based on 18 months of field observations, the paper narrates the presence or absence of formal documentation and informal rules across three categories (price, care, and transportation) at its case study site of the goat market in Bolgatanga, Ghana. It finds that there is an almost complete lack of standard documentation seen in the everyday life of developed countries. It also notes the relatively stable, yet informal, practices with respect to bargaining and exchange and organized transportation to a point of sale. These social and cultural practices are likely important to any planned adjustment or intervention to ensure food security or simply improved market operation.",TRUE,FALSE,Ghana|goats|informal|markets,2018-11-09T15:28:05.382043,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-09T15:24:55.357368,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|Food Security|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/citation/,xr78w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ms5zw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/relationships/node/,ms5zw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be46d27973841001a20b461/,5be46d27973841001a20b461,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xr78w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xr78w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xr78w,NA

Since WWI, plastic has been used as a material for packaging. However, there is a growing awareness that plastic packaging pollutes environment, kills wildlife, and even poisons human health. As new eco-consciousness trends lean in with plastic concerns, there are increasing efforts to find ecological alternatives to plastic takeaway food packaging. In this thesis, I will examine takeaway food packaging, explain problems and responses to plastic, explore consumer behavior regarding packaging, showcase up-and-coming eco-packaging, and test my own alternative takeaway food packaging. My goal is to provide an insightful discovery into the current state of packaging design and provide examples to provoke or pivot the consumer conversation towards creative solutions for a more sustainable and healthy future for takeaway food consumers and the planet.",TRUE,FALSE,consumer behavior|design|ecological|food packaging|life cycle|packaging|plastic|social impact|takeaway,2018-11-09T15:29:05.320378,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-09T15:25:44.614990,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/citation/,d4r8v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9h4z5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/relationships/node/,9h4z5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be45c369738410019209cfb/,5be45c369738410019209cfb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4r8v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d4r8v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d4r8v,NA
