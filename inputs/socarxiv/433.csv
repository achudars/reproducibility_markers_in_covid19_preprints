This interaction and communication may appear in different language styles. This is much more influenced by a situation or place where communication takes place. In class, for example, the language utilized by lecturers in the class room is different from others. This research aims at exploring lecturers’ language style and its implication to student’s psychological condition in Indonesia. The main question in this research is what kind of language style used by the lecturer in the learning process? does the using of lecturers’ language style influence students’ psychological condition? What are the factors that affect the presence of lecturers’ language style? This research used the grounded theory method by Keraf language style theory (2006), perlocutionary act theory of Austin (1962), and Leech’s politeness theory (1983). This research was conducted at Institut Agama Islam Negeri Kendari, Indonesia. Observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation were used as data collection. The results indicated that (1) there were two kinds of lecturers’ language styles which are always delivered to students, namely language style based on sentence structures and language  style based on  directness and indirectness of  meaning (2)  the using of that language style has  a great influence  on students’ psychological  condition. There are three psychological conditions of the students, they are motivation, self-efficacy, and interpersonal relation.

The purpose of the article is to give a comparative analysis of teaching general English and English for special purposes, to present arguments with respect to approaches designed to organize and ensure the high efficiency of mastering English for special purposes. The study focuses on comparative methods of studying different training programs in order to set out the results of a success study of different students groups. The authors substantiated the necessity of using the basic methodology of teaching a foreign language for special purposes with a higher efficiency of the personality-oriented approach as a basis for teaching ESP. The results of the research proved that the development of the program depends on the analysis of the needs of the learning group and the actual situations of using the language for special purposes. For teaching the EGP course, students have a common standard goal of learning English, which does not always correspond to the language needs of the students. The line of demarcation between the courses of EGP and ESP has become very important, but requires the further discussion.

This empirical survey identifies Saudi English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ beliefs through Beliefs About Language Learning Inventory (BALLI) developed by Horwitz’s (1987). The Arabic version of the questionnaire has been administered and 118 Saudi EFL learners from a Saudi university returned the questionnaire. The research questions set for this survey include what beliefs Saudi EFL learners have towards the difficulty of foreign language learning, foreign language aptitude, the nature of language learning, learning and communication strategies and motivation and expectations for English language learning. The results reveal that the participants bear high English language learning aptitude and believe that it is easier to learn it in childhood. No strong relationship in learning subjects like science and math and English language was reported. The participants also believe that for quick and successful language learning, it is imperative to practice the target language extensively.

It is also the first step toward a cross-linguistic theory of comparative error gravity based on the functional equivalence approach to translation. It finds that teachers tend to perceive grammatical errors as graver than mechanical or lexical errors, with most differences in perception appearing to stem from cultural background. Among students, there is very little consensus, in line with previous studies.

The researcher adopts the view of social learning, particularly in reaching better understandings of the learners’ experiences in learning English. As there exists a tendency to gauge learners’ success in English based on examinations, this study asserts that language learning involves more than a cognitive process, thus values the social aspects of experiential English learning. The focus lies on investigating the perceptions of these high achieving English language learners of their success in learning English as well as the influences contributing to it. Two methods are used to collect data: focus groups and interviews. The findings indicate the participants’ perceptions of their own success in learning English in three main aspects:  English language ability, examination performance and skills in teaching others. In particular, the ability to speak English fluently and correctly appears to be of utmost importance for a successful English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learner. It is also found that most learners identify their own performance in class, the teacher, including teacher rapport, and school culture as contributing to their English learning achievement. In focusing on the learners’ perceptions and their actual experiences, insights into how the learners actually undergo the learning opportunities provided by the education system can be obtained.

Among the difficulties to incorporate IC into FLT can be due to the fact that teachers may not have sufficient knowledge on the concept. To test this hypothesis, we attempt to answer the following question: how do Algerian English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers perceive the concepts of culture and IC as well as the objectives of the intercultural approach (ICA) in English language teaching (ELT) contexts? The present study proceeds to analyze teachers’ knowledge, perceptions and understanding of the concepts of culture, IC and the ICA and seeks to identify any potential deficiencies that may hinder effective IC teaching. The main aim of the study is then to help teacher trainers establish training programs that address more efficiently targeted teachers’ needs with regard to IC teaching. This paper will hopefully assist in improving the implementation of IC into FLT classrooms. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with eight teachers and then analyzed thematically. The findings revealed that many EFL teachers displayed a lack of theoretical understanding concerning the ICA and its objectives, which may well impact negatively on their IC teaching practices.

This study proposes that there is a negative treatment of athletes by other students in the classroom. It also reveals that athletes have lower GPAs than non-athletes. Using a data set collected at Skidmore College in 2006, these questions are analyzed. This study investigates the degree to which athletes perform compared to non-athletes and their treatment by other students. The sample had 361 valid respondents of whom 50 percent were athletes, and 66 percent of the sample were women. The results demonstrate that athletes, on the whole, have lower GPAs than non-athletes. It also shows that women have higher GPAs than men, which was expected. Based on the findings at Skidmore College in 2006, students did not feel that they were treated poorly by other students just because they were athletes. The data confirms the first hypothesis which stated that on average athletes will have lower GPAs than non-athletes. However, the second hypothesis that athletes were more likely to agree that athletes are treated more poorly than non-athletes was not supported by the data.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-01T22:35:01.200394,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-01T22:34:38.259056,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/citation/,u9axy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2be460a7c0a7001a3d794b/,5c2be460a7c0a7001a3d794b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9axy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9axy/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u9axy

Its aim is to analyze how the materials that signs are made of reflect recurrent practices of identity formation and numerous socio-cultural norms in the Jordanian tourism context. The signs were first coded according to language, and then categorized within the framework of material practices enacted by sign designers. The results show that signs written on stone and metal surfaces often displaying English in uppercase letters and replicating governmental practices convey a sense of quality, continuity and permanence within economic and tourism-centered ideologies and polices; the visibility of English painted on wooden board signs is evidence of the creativity further manifested in block capitals to denote a sense of freshness and newness; signs printed and hand-written on paper often appearing in uppercase letters manifest the dynamic nature of the LL, ensuring the flow of special offers and even linguistic and non-linguistic changes; most remarkably, monolingual English signs painted inside sand bottles symbolize important environmental, historical, and cultural information on the ancient city of Petra, which contributes significantly to the popularity of Petra as a worldwide tourist destination among members of the tourist population, particularly the international visitors.",TRUE,FALSE,English|linguistic and paralinguistic practices|linguistic landscape|materiality|Petra,2019-01-04T18:00:27.124462,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T18:00:13.135137,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/citation/,zt8xg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2be35f0e8efd0017d08dd6/,5c2be35f0e8efd0017d08dd6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zt8xg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zt8xg
