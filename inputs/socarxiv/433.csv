Depending on the goals and the resources of the institution, these revisions can focus only on an analysis of retention-graduation rates of different entry cohorts over the years, or survey results measuring students level of satisfaction in their programs. They can also be more comprehensive requiring an analysis of the content, scope, and alignment of a program’s curricula, for improving academic excellence. The revisions require the academic units to collaborate with university’s data experts, commonly the Institutional Research Office, to gather the needed information. The information for departments’ faculty and decision makers should be presentable in a highly-informative yet easily-interpretable manner, so that the review committee can quickly notice areas of improvement and take actions afterwards. In this study, we discuss the development and practical use of a visual that was developed with these key points in mind. The visuals, referred by us as “Students’ Progress Visuals”, are based on the Sankey diagram and provide information on students’ progress and mobility patterns in an academic unit over time in an easily understandable format. They were developed using open source software, and recently began to be used by several departments of our research intensive higher-ed institution for academic units’ review processes, which includes members of the campus community and external area experts. Our discussion includes questions these visuals can address in Higher-Ed, other relevant studies, the data requirements for their development, comparisons with other reporting methods, and how they were used in actual practice with actual case studies.",TRUE,FALSE,Data Visualization|EDM|Educational Data Mining|Higher Education|LA|Learning Analytics|Open-Source,2019-06-07T21:34:32.469629,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-07T21:34:04.103635,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/citation/,a758v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cfad39c46ad4d0017d40c01/,5cfad39c46ad4d0017d40c01,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a758v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a758v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a758v,NA

Innovative teams face the paradox of relying on experience to generate novelty.  We argue that forbidden triads, as conjunctures of dyadic experience, are the locations where successful novel combinations can be recognized and realized.  Prior scholarship has sidelined such network structural diversity with strong ties, and assumed that strong ties are mostly closed, and weak ties connect to diverse structural locations.  We use data on all recording sessions of more than a century of jazz to show that forbidden triad is the only consistent predictor of six measures of success that span the dualities of insiders and outsiders, and voice and trace. This network structure is also the only predictor of deep success: coinciding success in all four quadrants. Furthermore, forbidden triads that require effort beyond easy structural availability contribute in addition to voice measures of success.

While sanctions represent but the final disciplinary measure, university teachers’ pre-empting such academic misconduct before the final year project remains a necessity. This paper proposes a reconsideration of the teacher’s routine evaluation methods to promote good study skills, and thus high quality teaching and learning. Drawing on a personal teaching experience (in the department of English of Saida University), the paper suggests simple methods through which students routinely practise sound referencing. Preliminary observational data that triggered the topic of the present paper consist of samples of students’ internet-based assignments and project papers with missing references. Additional notes generated from classroom discussions with post-graduate Master students about (un)intentional plagiarism represent the insider student perspective of its causes. Initial findings reveal that student-submitted non-referenced work was not only due to poor time management, paraphrasing, or note taking skills but also to modelling poor citation habits (illustrated in the academic genres they were exposed to in their formal learning environment, such as PowerPoint presentations, class notes, hand-outs, and so on). The paper concludes with the necessity to raise teachers’ awareness to the importance of providing a good model of well-referenced teaching materials and learning supports as the initial step. Other practical methods consist of constantly checking students’ work for missing references, asking them to resubmit their work with requisite paraphrasing, as well as giving scores for correct referencing.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic plagiarism|digital/cyber-plagiarism|referencing|teacher assessment|techniques,2019-07-21T21:14:28.102149,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:14:18.484322,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/citation/,6p92b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9e45f8c451d0016ea7d2b/,5cf9e45f8c451d0016ea7d2b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6p92b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6p92b,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.10

Conscious of this fact, Algeria has incorporated English for Legal Purposes teaching into tertiary studies. In Algeria, Law students receive ELP course aimed to help them in their studies and future careers. However, at the end of their learning process these students still find linguistic and communication difficulties in situations where English is needed as the course received is no more than teaching specific words and phrases and translating some texts following the traditional Grammar Translation Method. Accordingly, this paper aims to presents the current ELP course situation and to measure students’ and teachers’ attitudes towards the use of Blended ELP course based on Content Language Integrated Learning model. The course has twofold: to provide students with international legal knowledge and to compare them to the Algerian one, and to expose learners to intensive reading activities and overcome lack of teaching time activities. In this quantitative study, seven teachers were interviewed and fifty seven masters’ students were questioned. The results revealed that the students have comprehension difficulties because the time load for reading activities is not sufficient. Concerning informants readiness to use Blended approach, the teachers present negatively the usefulness of such an approach for their students; on the contrary, students show a positive attitude to have additional English reading comprehension activities online, and they demonstrate a high interest to the proposal to support their English course with extra home tasks.",TRUE,FALSE,Blended Learning|CLIL|ELP|Online Based Education,2019-07-19T19:20:01.997774,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:19:35.034437,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/citation/,nf45b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9e39e3cd70c0017ff2c58/,5cf9e39e3cd70c0017ff2c58,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf45b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nf45b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nf45b,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.9

The research has involved individual in-depth semi-structured interviews with six English Foreign Language (EFL) teachers and six students to further explore key issues from their viewpoints. The main findings have unveiled that both teachers and students recognise the motivating potential of all the examined scales. Many similarities and some dissimilarities related to specific motivational themes have emerged. In terms of dissimilarity, students accorded importance to group work scale, however teachers minimised its role by justifying that it needed certain conditions. Another area of mismatch can be noticed in the way students and teachers regarded tasks in motivating students. Teachers stressed on providing clear instruction and explanation while students pointed to the content of tasks. Furthermore, another instance of difference in participants’ views towards the same scale in terms of the motivational strategies to be used was in teacher behaviour scale.

Observing the very limited rate of use of English in the Algerian community, English as Foreign Language (EFL) students, actually, need to progress in the mastery of that language by reading and/or listening to texts or messages intensively. To achieve this goal, subsequent procedures should take place by giving the foreign language a rather more appreciable position in the community such as the one held by a second language. To be down-to-earth, a brief survey on the linguistic situation in Algeria is exposed where neat clarification of second-foreign language status in the community is laid out to show that the more a (foreign) language is explicitly exposed in its manifold forms, the more are learners, in that community, likely to acquire it as a second language. However, the assumption of presenting the receptive skills (reading and listening) as the most appropriate means for the growth of foreign language vocabulary is supported by Krashen’s input theory where any input to be understood, should come at EFL learners’ capacity to read/listen and decode easily the meaning. In due course, First year EFL students have been subject to a language proficiency test-‘a pre-test then a post-test’. This typical experimental design is an intervention study which contains two groups: ‘the treatment or experimental’ group which receives the treatment, or which is exposed to some special conditions of intensifying vocabulary learning through a varied, comprehensible input; and a second group of EFL learners- the control group- whose role is to provide a baseline. The findings showed better scores among the experimental group compared to the other group.

These theoretical foundations enable the instructor to appropriately implement the outlined approach along its salient features to achieve the desired outcomes. Despite this tight rapport, teachers of English at the University of Mostaganem tend to rely on their common-sense teaching practices that are mainly informed by their experience of teaching EFL. The gap between the two extremes theory and practice, the premise of this paper, may be widened as teachers do not develop accurate and scientific understandings of certain pedagogical concepts, in this case, learner-centeredness as agreed on by professional academics, let alone to apply it along its proper standards. The pedagogical sequel of such misunderstanding mainly relate to random references to both teacher and learner-centered approaches in classroom teaching practices. The study via a detailed teachers’ questionnaire revealed that teachers of English, in addition to the cursory understandings they develop in relation to the very meaning of a learner-centered approach, tend to eschew developing learners’ metacognitive skills in their teaching practices. Most importantly, they are likely to rely on traditional ways of assessment instead of authentic frameworks, a cardinal feature within the current paradigm.",TRUE,FALSE,Authentic assessment|constructivism|learner-centered approach|metacognition|teacher-centered approach,2019-07-21T21:12:47.764254,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:12:17.169900,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/citation/,pefw4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9e14e89c983001abcc445/,5cf9e14e89c983001abcc445,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pefw4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pefw4,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.6

Accordingly, teachers need to look out for additional training opportunities. One of these opportunities is found in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Nevertheless, research on applying MOOCs for continuous professional development (CPD) with regard to Algeria is overlooked. Hence, this study aims at filling in this gap by exploring Algerian university teachers’ familiarity, disposition, and experiences of using MOOCs for CPD. To reach this end, an online questionnaire is administered and a semi-structured interview is conducted with university teachers. The results of the study evinced that: 1) Teachers have low familiarity and weak interaction with MOOCs in general and, 2) teachers acknowledge the importance of CPD and are aware that the initial training and the teaching experience are not sufficient to maintain career advancement. Yet, 3) they do not have the disposition to engage in a CPD, 4) teachers consider this study as an eye opener on MOOCs and show a positive attitude for leveraging MOOCs for their CPD in the future. In the light of these findings, urgent plans to implement and value the culture of informal CPD are recommended, in addition to creating centres at the level of the universities devoted exclusively to CPD and related research. Most importantly, MOOCs that address the Algerian teachers’ CPD needs should be developed.",TRUE,FALSE,Andragogy|constructivism|life-long learning|Massive Open Online Courses|teacher continuous professional development,2019-07-19T19:27:02.664797,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:26:40.651026,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/citation/,4nxtw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9e0778c451d0017ea5839/,5cf9e0778c451d0017ea5839,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nxtw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4nxtw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4nxtw,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.5

In the aftermaths of ‘the bloody decade’, Algeria lost the pillars of its tertiary education. To compensate, the government relied on mass access to universities which has in its turn resulted in low quality. This work seeks to check the usability of the human capital approach in solving the quality problem in Algerian universities. Because education could offer both monetary and non-monetary profits, it is considered lucrative to invest in developing human skills and competences which constitute the capital that guarantees earning a living. This research, thus, proposes ‘academic advising’ as a first step on the short term. The current paper presents a descriptive analysis of 50 questionnaires answered by middle and high school teachers and headmasters, university students and professors and guidance counselors. The results of this qualitative study show how ‘academic advising’ when extended up to the university level can harness the learner’s capital.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic advising|Algerian higher education|quality|the human capital approach,2019-07-19T19:24:07.431762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:23:31.630446,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/citation/,ycrbf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9dfc389c9830018bcd6a0/,5cf9dfc389c9830018bcd6a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ycrbf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ycrbf,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.4
