In 2015, voters in Seattle approved the creation of the Democracy Voucher program with the intent of broadening representation in the campaign finance system and expanding participation from marginalized communities. Every registered voter in Seattle was provided with four, twenty-five-dollar vouchers that they could, in turn, assign to the local candidate(s) of their choice.  Through an analysis of the inaugural implementation of the program in 2017, we investigate whether this innovative public financing system increased participation, broadened involvement from underrepresented groups and led to a donor pool that was more representative of the electorate. Compared to cash donors in the municipal election, we report that voucher users are less likely to be high-income and more likely to come from poor neighborhoods.  While older residents are over-represented among voucher users, there is little difference in the racial composition of cash donors and voucher users.  Our analysis confirms that the Democracy Voucher program successfully moved the donor pool in a more egalitarian direction, although it remains demographically unrepresentative of the electorate.  The lessons from Seattle’s inaugural implementation offer key insights for other municipalities considering public financing policies, and these lessons have the potential to reshape the national policy debate about the influence of political money.",TRUE,FALSE,Campaign Donors|Campaign Finance|Democracy Vouchers|Money in Politics|Political Participation|Seattle,2018-07-02T11:53:07.786850,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-16T23:53:53.122830,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs",Brian J.

Limitations of behaviorally informed policy under social interaction","Nudge and boost are two competing approaches to applying the psychology of reasoning and decision making to improve policy. Whereas nudges rely on manipulation of choice architecture to steer people towards better choices, the objective of boosts is to develop good decision-making competences. Proponents of both approaches claim capacity to enhance social welfare through better individual decisions. We suggest that such efforts should involve a more careful analysis of how individual and social welfare are related in the policy context. First, individual rationality is not always sufficient or necessary for improving collective outcomes. Second, collective outcomes of complex social interactions among individuals are largely ignored by the focus of both nudge and boost on individual decisions. We suggest that the design of mechanisms and social norms can sometimes lead to better collective outcomes than nudge and boost, and present conditions under which the three approaches (nudge, boost, and design) can be expected to enhance social welfare.",TRUE,FALSE,boost|mechanism design|nudge|social norm|social welfare,2018-07-02T11:53:07.750843,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-16T23:53:00.117322,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/citation/,zh3qw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vjz2g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/relationships/node/,vjz2g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afc9ab85ccb5b000fbb5b8b/,5afc9ab85ccb5b000fbb5b8b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zh3qw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zh3qw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zh3qw,NA

Prior work has shown that between 1990 and 2000, the religiously unafﬁliated population also became more religious in belief and practices, both in absolute terms and relative to the afﬁliated population. This curious empirical ﬁnding is believed to be driven by a dilution effect in which moderate believers disafﬁliated from organized religion without giving up religious beliefs and practices. In the current article, I use data from the General Social Survey to show that this convergence of beliefs and practices of the religiously afﬁliated and unafﬁliated ended around 2000. Since 2000, the religiously unafﬁliated have decreased their belief in god and the afterlife, and have not increased their prayer frequency. The trends for the afﬁliated have been either increasing or unchanging and thus the religious practices and beliefs of the religiously afﬁliated and unafﬁliated have diverged since 2000. The change in trend for the religiously unafﬁliated after 2000 cannot fully be explained generational succession or the growing percentage of Americans raised without religion. Although the unafﬁliated remain very heterogeneous in their beliefs and practices, these results point to a growing religious polarization in the United States.",TRUE,FALSE,nones|polarization|religious change,2018-07-02T11:53:04.635753,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-15T21:09:46.997527,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/citation/,ae97g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/94kv6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/relationships/node/,94kv6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afb3d9713c138000e048f28/,5afb3d9713c138000e048f28,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ae97g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ae97g,https://doi.org/10.15195/v5.a16

His work, published in several scientific journals indexed in international databases, addresses issues related to promoting natural capital, the right of future generations to a healthy environment, eco-investments, green tourism, green energy, environmental audit, economy and public health financing and then, because ""People are at the forefront of sustainable development”, issues related to the human factor.",TRUE,FALSE,budgetary resources|control / audit of public funds|financing biodiversity|health and well-being|human capital|natural capital|sustainable development,2018-07-02T11:53:03.462310,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-15T16:00:29.104383,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,Copyright Holders,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/citation/,jc6f5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hjqke/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/relationships/node/,hjqke,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afad0e513c1380010036555/,5afad0e513c1380010036555,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc6f5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jc6f5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jc6f5,NA

Although scholars have suggested a number of potential correlates of mass killings, it remains unclear whether the estimates are robust to different model specifications, or which variables accurately predict the onset of large-scale violence. We employ extreme bounds analysis and distributed random forests to test the sensitivity of 40 variables on a sample of 177 countries from 1945 to 2013. The results help clear the brush around mass killings, as few variables in this literature are robust determinants of atrocity. However, support for an opportunity logic persists as greater constraints on a government limit its ability to employ barbarous tactics. It appears that the Conflict Trap applies to government atrocity. Atrocity breeds atrocity, while wealthy stable democracies tend to avoid episodes of mass killing.",TRUE,FALSE,extreme bounds analysis|genocide|mass killings|random forests|state-sponsored violence,2018-07-02T11:53:02.228910,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-15T15:58:03.208090,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Defense and Security Studies",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/citation/,pzx3q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9rzgt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/relationships/node/,9rzgt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afa7762dbf98d000cfd289d/,5afa7762dbf98d000cfd289d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzx3q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pzx3q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pzx3q,NA

Despite the constant references to meritocracy in inequality and stratification research, there are still few conceptual and empirical attempts to understand to what extent individuals perceive and prefer meritocracy, as well as their consequences. The present research proposes a conceptual and empirical framework for  studying meritocratic perceptions and preferences, which is then related with economic inequality variables. Using data from the Chilean survey “Social justice and citizenship participation”, the analyses suggest that meritocratic perceptions and preferences are different constructs and that those perceiving an adequate functioning of meritocracy also perceive less economic inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,Chile|desigualdad económica|distributive justice|economic inequality|inequality perception|meritocracia|meritocracy|social status,2018-07-02T11:51:32.529517,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-15T15:58:56.463630,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/citation/,qkpu4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tfpsm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/relationships/node/,tfpsm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af98bb9da163200111fcb03/,5af98bb9da163200111fcb03,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qkpu4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qkpu4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qkpu4,NA
