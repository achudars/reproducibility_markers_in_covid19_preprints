of the public sphere, such as news waves, polarization, or communication cascades. I
also discuss to what extent public spheres have grown more complex in the course of digitalization,
and how this affects the dynamics of public communication processes. My focus is to
further develop existing system theoretical approaches of the public sphere towards a theory
of complex, adaptive systems that can be connected to other models of public spheres; notably
network and public arenas models, as well as to interdisciplinary complexity research. I
introduce the fundamental characteristics of complex systems; i.e. interconnectedness, selforganization,
emergence, nonlinearity and heterogeneity, showing how they apply to the system
of the public sphere in its contemporary digitized context. I then point out the methodological
consequences of this perspective, and conclude by commenting on its integrative potential
for theory development in public sphere research.",TRUE,FALSE,Complexity|Public Sphere|Social Media|Systems Theory,2018-07-02T11:51:32.495422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-15T15:56:56.679373,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/citation/,fapmr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gs7n5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/relationships/node/,gs7n5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af98f617bf0b90011e5d5bc/,5af98f617bf0b90011e5d5bc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fapmr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fapmr/,https://doi.org/10.5771/1615-634X-2017-3-534,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fapmr

Drawing on an analysis of newspaper articles about the Oosterweelconnection in Antwerp (Belgium), it concludes that framing through imaginative appeals and framing through evidence mutually reinforce each other in a spiralling pattern. When evidence backs up appeals to the imagination, such as when facts back up metaphors, these appeals are endowed with authority and hence legitimacy. While this strengthens appeals that have been ”proven” to be true, it also makes actors backing these appeals increasingly frustrated with other parties that still refuse to accept them. Because of their frustration, the former are spurred to launch new imaginative appeals conveying their anger and to seek new evidence to substantiate these new appeals. Over time, as parties in a conflict grapple with evidence and imagination, their tolerance for ambiguity decreases and the debate polarizes.",TRUE,FALSE,Belgium|Conflict|Evidence based policy making|Frame analysis|Frame analysis Conflict Planning Evidence-based policy-making Spatial policy Belgium|Planning|Spatial policy,2018-07-02T11:51:32.007036,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-15T15:55:46.783785,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/citation/,8grp4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af94c687bf0b90010e6af9d/,5af94c687bf0b90010e6af9d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8grp4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8grp4/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11077-017-9275-3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8grp4

The students' errors were classified into 15 different categories and analyzed using the Error Analysis Matrix. The findings show that most secondary students who were learning EFL made errors in syntax. Also, the study reveals that the students face complexity with different grammatical errors in terms of using punctuation, using articles, spelling, verbs, conjunctions, capitalization, fragments, lexicon, subject omission, pronouns, prepositions, using adjectives, and using nouns; that may hinder understanding the written text.

In the context of the US South, this paper examines the legacy of cotton on economic development focusing on a novel channel of structural change. Exploiting variation in cotton production along with agro-climatic conditions, I show that the legacy of cotton has impeded local economic development exclusively as of the mid-twentieth century. The structural break is found to be a consequence of cotton mechanization. Evidence from exogenous variation in the boll weevil infestation shows that cotton farming was strongly dependent on tenant farmers with little human capital. Following cotton mechanization, cotton tenants were largely displaced and absorbed by the manufacturing sector. I then find that the inflow of cotton tenants has reduced labor productivity in the manufacturing sector. Beyond the composition effect, the negative impact on manufacturing productivity has persisted in the long-run through demand-side. Employing an index of state-level policy environment, I exploit within-state variation to show that the legacy of cotton has induced unskill-biased technical change in manufacturing.",TRUE,FALSE,Cotton|Human Capital|Labor Push|Mechanization|Productivity|Structural Change,2018-07-02T11:51:28.090120,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-11T20:23:34.851977,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/citation/,trjfz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af5f50a7bf0b90011e3e0e5/,5af5f50a7bf0b90011e3e0e5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/trjfz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/trjfz

Exploring the Impact of Poverty Reduction Strategies on Poverty Rates among the Canadian Provinces,"Poverty reduction strategies (PRS) have become a popular instrument for addressing poverty globally. In Canada, all ten provinces have committed to adopting PRS. The province’s commonalities and differences provide an ideal testing ground for studying their effects. Do PRS actually reduce poverty? According to their detractors, governments use PRS as ‘window dressing’ to gloss over unsuccessful poverty reduction efforts. In this study, I identify the timing of the introduction of PRS action plans and explore whether they have coincided with changes in provincial poverty rates. I find that more often than not rates have dropped before rather than after the introduction of PRS. This suggests that governments have indeed used PRS as window dressing, but to showcase and claim credit for poverty reduction successes.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|credit claiming|government|poverty reduction strategy|provinces|social policy,2018-07-02T11:51:26.386091,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-11T09:33:20.850130,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",Charles Plante,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/citation/,xtnfg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4dg6v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/relationships/node/,4dg6v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af4e8cca5bbbc0012c60213/,5af4e8cca5bbbc0012c60213,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtnfg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xtnfg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xtnfg

In: The Scandinavian Invasion: The Nordic Noir Phenomenon and Beyond. eds. Richard McCulloch; William Proctor. Peter Lang, (forthcoming).  -------------------------------------------------------  
Nordic Noir has, since the early-2000s, evolved into a globally-popular genre that now easily transcends media-specific boundaries. Television has always been at the forefront of that development: Scandinavian TV productions either turned literary successes such as the Henning Mankell novel universe of Wallander into distinct and easily-recognizable television scripts, or developed independent shows such as Forbrydelsen (DR, 2007-12), which, with foreign adaptations such as The Killing (US) (AMC/Netflix, 2011-14) – themselves grew into international format successes. 
The most recent wave of Nordic Noirs – including blockbuster shows like Bron/Broen [The Bridge] (DK/SWE, 2011-), Dicte (DK, 2012-), Blå ögon [Blue Eyes] (SWE, 2014), Arvingerne [The Legacy] (DK, 2014-), Frikjent [Acquitted] (NOR, 2015-), Herrens veje [Rides upon the Storm] (DK, in development) or Kongen af Danmark [The King] (DK, in development, 2017-) – continues to employ a particular Nordic Noir template. But while doing so, many of these shows also simultaneously transform Nordic Noir through processes of remaking and adaptation that become evident in examples such as Gomorrah (ITA, 2014-) and Les Témoins [Witnesses] (FR, 2015-), within correspondingly-changing generic, narrative, and locational contexts such as ‘Italian’ or ‘French Noir’. This most recent wave thus both affirms and dissolves the specificity of Nordic Noir as a genre.
This chapter is particularly interested in the status that Nordic Noir as a genre has as a source for formatting within television, and the specific (re)negotiations that take place when Nordic Noir is transferred to different cultural settings. Following a brief introductory framing of Nordic Noir and its role in larger processes of the global format trade, I will use the analytic perspective of Performance Studies which, as I argue, allows for a more nuanced view on the workings behind the circulation of Nordic Noir formats in the global television business. In particular, I will employ Navarro’s understanding of format adaptation as processual ‘space between cultures’ (2012), and try to identify the onsets of this liminal space in the specific setting of the pilot. It is exactly here, I argue, where adaptation processes first become visible – processes that take a known template and rework it via narrative modulation into transcultural TV remakes.
Subsequently, I will illustrate this perspective via the example of Bron/Broen, one of the recent Nordic Noir television series that has itself become a format – travelling on a global scale and thus renegotiating the meaning of Nordic Noir in a variety of cultural settings. This will be done via a comparative analysis of Bron/Broen’s pilot and two of its international iterations – The Bridge (US), and The Tunnel (FR/UK).",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|Bron/Broen|genre|glocalisation|nordic noir|scandinavian television|space between cultures|television|television format|The Bridge|The Tunnel|transcultural remake|transformation,2018-07-02T11:51:25.928900,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-11T00:08:06.954471,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c90|Arts and Humanities|Television|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d24|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Visual Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d26|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Other Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/citation/,9dbw2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ug9x7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/relationships/node/,ug9x7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af47f5cd6e6eb0010231085/,5af47f5cd6e6eb0010231085,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9dbw2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9dbw2

The present article is a critical reanalysis of the models offered by Mutz, using the data files released along with her article. Contrary to her conclusions, this article demonstrates that (1) the relative importance of economic interests and status threat cannot be estimated effectively with her cross-sectional data, and (2) her panel data are consistent with the claim that economic interests are at least as important as status threat.
