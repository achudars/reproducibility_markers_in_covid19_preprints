We examined 6.5 million tweets posted during the days leading up to and the month following President Donald Trump’s June 1, 2017 announcement of the United States’ withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Of a 10% sample of users, we used the machine learning algorithm “Botometer” to identify likely mechanized “bots.” Botometer identified 17,509 suspected bot accounts, representing about 9% of users and 17% of all tweets. Query limits on Botometer and the capacity of STM modeling reduced our final sample size to 167,259 tweets. We then used the ‘stm’ package in the R statistical programming language to implement structural topic models to cluster tweet content into topics. We identified 34 topics. Topics broadly fell into categories related to news of the withdrawal and the responses from various media and government personnel, posts about climate change research, discussions of the denial of climate change, and finally activist topics with campaign goals. Within these topics, bots were often common, representing as much as 38% of tweets. Additionally, among the most common 15 topics, we found evidence that after adjusting for topic size, timing of tweets, and whether a user was suspended, tweets produced by bots were more likely relative to non-bot users to fall into four topics. These topics included tweets sharing news links on the announcement, links related to climate research, links sharing denialist research, and links about White House aids and their views of fossil fuels. These findings suggest a substantial impact of mechanized bots in amplifying denialist messages about climate change, including support for Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-02-26T17:35:22.971548,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-26T17:35:08.999699,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/citation/,h6ktm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5458118d876501d481296d/,5e5458118d876501d481296d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6ktm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h6ktm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h6ktm,NA

However, very few of these studies have empirically tested whether their results are due to monopsonistic characteristics in the labor markets. In this paper, I estimate the effects of the minimum wage for the U.S. under concentrated labor markets and low-mobility jobs (two variables that measure monopsony), identify heterogeneous effects among different scenarios derived from the monopsony model, and provide a plausible explanation of the mixed results about the minimum wage effects in the literature. My main findings indicate that minimum wages have an elasticity to teenage employment of -0.418 under perfect competition, which is, as expected, much higher than the usual results in the literature. If the monopsony variable is one standard deviation higher than the baseline, it implies a positive change in elasticity between of 0.05. The minimum wage has a positive insignificant effect between 0.04 and 0.29 under full monopsonistic labor markets. The results are consistent among different specifications and controlling for possible external shocks to the monopsony and omitted variables.",TRUE,FALSE,Labor Economics|Labor Markets|Labor Policy|Minimum Wage|Monopsonistic|Monopsony,2020-02-24T19:43:41.347516,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-24T19:43:26.382467,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/citation/,abpj9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e54252f35d22d01ba5f4919/,5e54252f35d22d01ba5f4919,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abpj9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/abpj9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/abpj9,NA

How democracy works depends to a large degree on what democracy is framed as meaning, both in terms of the specific institutional arrangements that texts authorize and the disputed frames that are in play. The changing terrain of movements today may have less to do with the scale or locus of material power than with unresolved issues of democracy raised by movements of the past.  Although “democracy” is defined as the power of people, the question still arises, “which people”? The institutionalization of procedural democracy often went hand-in-hand with the exclusion of certain kinds of issues and constituents from institutional access to politics in specific ways in different countries.  Movements and parties are not just related to each other; both are sited in a broader field of political discourse. Feminist movements and bringing gender into evaluation of the democracy of democratic institutions illustrate this general claim, as the representation of both the people and the issues once defined as private have been transformed into legitimate matters of public political struggle.",TRUE,FALSE,democracy|discourse|gender politics|social inclusion|social movements,2020-02-26T04:30:59.628946,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-26T04:30:15.224485,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/citation/,fj35s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e53fd3e35d22d01ad5f30ab/,5e53fd3e35d22d01ad5f30ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fj35s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fj35s,NA

Liberal democracies, once revolutionarily new political formations, rested on an equally revolutionary understanding of male domination based not on descent but economic arrangements (the new “breadwinner” role) and political institutions (the “brotherhood” national state).  Over time, social movements have diminished liberal democracy’s original exclusions of women and nonwhite men so that many citizens’ daily lives now contradict this once hegemonic normative order. The U.S. party binary pushes contemporary movements for transforming or restoring this understanding of democracy under the political umbrellas of the competing Democratic and Republican parties.

This paper argues instead for an understanding of liberal democracy itself as gendered, being the collective masculinity of brotherhoods representing rivalrous nations. The first great transition from patriarchies and monarchies to brotherhoods and democracies is not being unmade now but facing a second transition to a different understanding of gender and power. This normative rise of a partnership model in families and politics is incomplete and highly contested everywhere. In the U.S., it has become a partisan conflict expressed in gender terms. The Republican defense of the brotherhood state and its exclusive version of national good is countered by a newer but increasingly institutionalized vision of democracies as representing women and men equally.

The SDG4 is even more important for developing nations as receiving proper education or vocational training, especially in science and technology, means a foundational step in improving other aspects of their citizens’ lives. However, the extant scientific literature about STEM education still lacks focus on developing countries, even more so in the rural area. Using a dataset of 4967 observations of junior high school students from a rural area in a transition economy, the article employs the Bayesian approach to identify the interaction between gender, socioeconomic status, and students’ STEM academic achievements. The results report gender has little association with STEM academic achievements; however, female students (αa_Sex[2] = 2.83) appear to have achieved better results than their male counterparts (αa_Sex[1] = 2.68). Families with better economic status, parents with a high level of education (βb(EduMot) = 0.07), or non-manual jobs (αa_SexPJ[4] = 3.25) are found to be correlated with better study results. On the contrary, students with zero (βb(OnlyChi) = -0.14) or more than two siblings (βb(NumberofChi) = -0.01) are correlated with lower study results compared to those with only one sibling.

A freeform computer aided design (CAD) model was generated based upon the topology of the three-dimensional (3-D) mesh in Geomagic Design X with a desired maximum deviation of 0.1 mm between the model and the mesh. Deviations were calculated in Geomagic Control X using the surface model as the reference data, and the mesh as the measured data. A custom patch network was subsequently designed using a series of iterative revisions until the whole of the surface model met with the specified tolerance.

In addition, a new way of calculating the rigor of this type of projects is presented using the “3D rigor method”, based on obtaining the rigor measures of the product, process and reputation of the project researchers. Thanks to this new method, it is possible to know the rigor of an R&amp;I project at any time during its development, which enables its monitoring and management to adapt it to the interests and needs of each situation. On the one hand, this method is presented as a tool of great utility for new researchers, since it will allow them to guide the development of their R&amp;I project in an agile way, adjusted to the speed of the current times, while maintaining minimum levels of rigor and scientific quality. On the other hand, the method is highly recommended for all those organizations that promote and support the development of new R&amp;I projects, enabling them to mentor and guide the projects towards the achievement of specific objectives and viable projects.",TRUE,FALSE,3D Rigor Method|Innovation|Open Innovation|Project Management|R&amp;I|Reputation|Research|Scientific Rigor|TRL|TRL Canvas,2020-02-22T10:18:48.179885,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-22T10:18:25.384977,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/citation/,q6nvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4fba3835d22d00575f2568/,5e4fba3835d22d00575f2568,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6nvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q6nvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q6nvx,NA
