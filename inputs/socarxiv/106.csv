It sought to answer how engaging EFL student teachers in writing a teaching philosophy and peer observation affect their understanding of and appreciation for reflective practice and its influence on developing their reflection level and teaching performance. A mixed-methods study design was implemented where both quantitative and qualitative data were collected within this study. Eight female Saudi student teachers enrolled in a teacher education program at a public university in Saudi Arabia participated in this study while completing an 11-week teaching practicum course at a public secondary school in Riyadh. Each participant was tasked with completing a teaching philosophy and six peer observations with other participants within the study. Each task was analyzed for its reflection level based on a rubric developed by El- Okda (2009). Data were also collected through a semi-structured interview with each of the participants. This study demonstrated that while the participants struggled throughout the practicum to develop a cogent teaching philosophy, their level of reflection for the peer observation tasks improved throughout the teaching practice. Their enthusiasm for these tasks and the process of reflection itself was very positive. The results of this study will help teacher educators to create an informative account of reflection in teaching practice programs in ways that encourage reflective practice among student teachers. Future research could continue to explore more reflective tasks that encourage reflection among student teachers.",TRUE,FALSE,peer observations|reflection|reflection-enhancing tasks|reflective teaching|teaching philosophy,2021-01-14T04:34:05.580550,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:32:07.389432,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/citation/,vx94j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffc336ba010904fb8970ab/,5fffc336ba010904fb8970ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vx94j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vx94j/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.35,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vx94j

Thus, devising appropriate and effective exam questions may be a problematic issue for tests designers. Under the requirements of the current Algerian English curriculum, the exam questions must cover the lower and higher-order thinking skills of Bloom’s taxonomy. On this basis, this research paper seeks to investigate the effectiveness of the EFL baccalaureate exam papers, and aims to answer the research question: ‘To what extent does the Algerian EFL Baccalaureate exam paper cover the lower and higher-order thinking skills of Bloom’s taxonomy?’ This research is a descriptive content analysis; the researcher analyzed the exam questions of the Algerian EFL Baccalaureate under the cognitive domains of Bloom’s taxonomy. This study is significant as it helps tests’ designers to design practical EFL exams that develop students’ thinking skills and language competencies.

This study is important since jigsaw task could help learners to become autonomous learners as well as to promote cooperation between learners. The study sample consisted of 40 (two classes) female students studying the course of curriculum reading in English in the Master’s Program of curriculum and instructions at Umm Al-Qura University. The classes were allocated to the experimental group (n=21 students), which was taught using self-regulated jigsaw task, and the control group (n=19 students), which was taught using traditional tasks. Pre-and post-tests have been conducted to find out the statistical differences. Further, an open-ended questionnaire was given to the participants in the experimental group (n=21 students) to find out more about their perception of using the jigsaw technique in the learning process. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used as a statistical procedure to analyze the participants’ scores on the post-test, and the Greenhouse-Geisser test was applied to investigate the differences between groups. The results of the study showed that the difference in performance between students taught using self-regulated jigsaw task and those taught using traditional tasks was statistically significant. Further, the participants in the experimental group perceived that using the jigsaw task had a positive effect on the learning process, enhanced their relations with other learners, and increased their motivation in learning.

However, it is not an exclusive online environment because the teacher and the students have to be present in a traditional face-to-face classroom. It is widely believed that adopting a blended learning approach will enable learners to have quality educational opportunities and improve their performance. The incentive for conducting the research is to evaluate the effect of the blended learning approach on high school students’ English proficiency. Specifically, the study aimed at answering the question: is there a significant difference in the Twelfth-Grade students’ English language proficiency as measured by IELTS due to the model of delivery (Blended learning model and the traditional delivery model)? To achieve the study’s goal, the researcher applied the experimental method and used IELTS to measure language proficiency.  The study sample selected purposively consisted of 63 male twelfth-grade students in one of the private schools in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study sample was assigned to two groups: the experimental group taught using blended learning consisted of 31 students, and the control group led by the traditional method consisted of 32 students. The results showed statistically significant differences at the level of (a&lt;0.01) between the means of the results of the two groups on the post achievement test in favor of the experimental group.

Nevertheless, it is still challenging to identify the real authors of social media’s offensive and inappropriate content. These contents are usually very short; therefore, it is challenging for stylometric authorship systems to assign controversial texts to their real authors based on the salient and distinctive linguistic features and patterns within these contents. This research introduces a new stylometric authorship system that considers both the shortness of data and the peculiar linguistic properties of Arabic. A corpus of 20, 357 tweets from 134 Twitter users. A document clustering based on Document Index Graph (DIG) model was used to classify input patterns in the tweets that shared common linguistic features. A comparative analysis using Vector Space Clustering (VSC) model based on the Bag of Words (BOW) model, conventionally used in authorship recognition applications, was used. Results indicate that the proposed system is more accurate than other standard authorship systems mainly based on vector space clustering methods.

Meanwhile, several studies report that English as a Foreign Language teachers in many parts of the world is in shortage of skills required for Computer Assisted Language Learning integration in their classes and teaching methods. In view of the variances in different parts of the world as to the status of Computer Assisted Language Learning integration, the current study aims at exploring challenges that English as a Foreign Language teachers, at the University of Tabuk, Saudi Arabia, are assumed to confront in employing Computer Assisted Language Learning as an integral constituent in their classroom teaching methodology. With this end, the study is carried out in light of the question ‘Are the EFL teachers able to integrate CALL applications effectively in their classroom teaching methodology?’ The study employs a mixed-methods research design in which quantitative and qualitative approaches are used in both data collection and analysis. The required data for analysis was collected by using a questionnaire of Likert items that were distributed to a convenient random sample of EFL teachers working at the English language Institute (ELI) at the University of Tabuk. Quantitative data were analyzed statistically with the support of excel and SPSS whereas qualitative data were analyzed in light of invitational theory proposed by Purkey and Novak (1992).

Ultimately, in a language class, learners may confront difficulty in understanding a literary text which can derive from the limited language proficiency, and presiding over lack of linguistic, cultural, and academic competence. In order to affirm this hypothesis and answer the question of the extent to which can self-directed learning be achieved and improved through metacognitive competence in performing a task in literature, this study aims at highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating certain innovative teaching activities and management practices, notably self-cognition and self-reflection on pursuing learners’ metacognition in understanding a literary text. By adopting a quasi-experimental methodological design, this study uses a participant observation with twenty- six subjects at Higher College of Teachers of Laghouat, they are assigned into two groups to measure their level of meta-cognitive competence and self-regulation, and prove their impact on achieving independent learning in studying a literary text. Results assured learners’ enthusiasm, high competence, and positive responses upon compiling metacognition and self-reflection which are not only learning strategies, but also learning paradigms for increasing learners’ self-directed learning and performance in class. Further studies may include engaging in improving independent learning and self-regulation of post-graduated learners through compensation and memory-related strategies.",TRUE,FALSE,Algerian EFL context|cognitive monitoring|educational psychology|literacy teaching|self-regulation,2021-01-14T04:39:23.033498,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:34:52.104249,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/citation/,rynmk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffbe99ba010904fa893e69/,5fffbe99ba010904fa893e69,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rynmk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rynmk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.28,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rynmk

This study is concerned with manipulation in two political speeches; one in English delivered by the American President Donald J. Trump, while the other in Arabic delivered by the Iraqi President Barham Salih to be the study's data. Each one of these two speeches is divided into serial-numbered extracts( henceforth Ext.). The study aims at investigating the semantic and rhetorical devices utilized as manipulation strategies in these speeches. To this end, the qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis will be followed in this study.  The significance of the study stems from how the ideological dimension based on bettering off the speaker's image and derogating others' image plays a vital role in the political speeches. This study draws on Van Dijk's ideological approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) of political discourse, and accordingly, it is adopted as a model. Results revealed that both speakers use lexicalization, a list of three, repetition, and citing as effective techniques in their two speeches to affect their recipients' minds. The study concluded that the ideological framework of ""positive self-presentation"" and ""negative other-presentation"" is the central umbrella under which manipulation can exist and work freely. The findings might help linguists and political analysts to understand how politicians use the linguistic features in their discourse to affect the audience's thoughts and behaviors manipulatively.",TRUE,FALSE,ideological dimension|manipulation|political speeches|rhetorical devices|semantic devices,2021-01-14T04:40:42.917783,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:35:13.304666,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/citation/,d35rn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffbddce80d370517a59994/,5fffbddce80d370517a59994,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d35rn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d35rn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.27,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d35rn

It creates sense of respect inside learners and makes them on the right direction. This research attempted to identify the impact of motivation on listening skills of students enrolled in English Language Course at British Education and Training System (BETS) Lahore, Pakistan during January to February, 2020. The learners for this class look forward to hone their speaking skills by listening as much as they can. The results show that there is a positive correlation between listening strategy instruction and motivation. Listening motivation was recorded utilizing the English Listening Comprehension Motivation Scale (ELCMS) and strategy use was tracked with the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire (MALQ). Pre- and post-test scores of 36 participants (control group, n=20; experiment group, n=16) were analyzed using a mixed-effects regression and paired t-test to determine differences after a four-week treatment period. The results revealed that the participants’ motivation level in both groups decreased over the treatment period, with the experiment group seeing a smaller decrease than the control group.",TRUE,FALSE,English|language|listening|metacognition|motivation|strategies,2021-01-14T04:41:43.716287,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:35:35.447084,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/citation/,38sjk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffbd1dba010904ff896a3a/,5fffbd1dba010904ff896a3a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38sjk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/38sjk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.26,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/38sjk
