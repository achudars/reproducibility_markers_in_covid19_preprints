The current patent duration is arbitrary, the result of entrenched historical accident. Allowing upward variance from the 20-year term in discrete categories of invention offers the prospect of boosting innovation in impoverished technological sectors. Allowing downward variance in other categories would benefit overall social welfare by removing needless technological monopolization and associated deadweight loss.

Current economic models and available economic data do not allow for the academic calculation of optimal patent lifetimes in the real world. This paper proposes practical procedural mechanisms to gather and synthesize information about innovation incentives and returns, and to make use of that information in decision-making paradigms that would vary patent terms to make the patent system more economically beneficial than it currently is. An appendix to this paper uses theoretical evolutionary biology to criticize economic theorists who have suggested that very long or even infinite durations for patents may be optimal.",TRUE,FALSE,duration|economics|innovation|intellectual property|invention|macroeconomics|patent|patents|terms,2018-07-02T10:45:18.670599,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-07T23:53:17.001000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4f|Law|Law and Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,Eric E Johnson,2006,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/citation/,4kvbs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xkt2q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/relationships/node/,xkt2q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58bf4595b83f6901f027212e/,58bf4595b83f6901f027212e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kvbs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4kvbs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4kvbs,NA

We first explore the different narrative perspectives on the Balkan wars from the beginning to the end of twentieth century. Their subsequent problematization is aimed at challenging the way how they have constructed commonplace and time-worn representations, which international society shares with different consequences in international affairs. This is a limited conception since international representations as a socio-anthropological concept are always socially, culturally and politically constructed, contested and negotiated. They do not neutrally refer to a reality in the world; they create a reality of their own. Moreover, this limited conception ignores the fact that how, by whom and in whose interest international representations are constructed is itself a form of power in international relations. Therefore, the way international representations are constructed can be problematized as an example of political and ideological projects that operate in the West as well as in the Southeast European countries that are the object of Western foreign policy.",TRUE,FALSE,Balkanism|Balkan wars 1912-1913|collective representations|essentialism|international politics|pacifism|power relations|securitism|sensationalism|Southeast Europe|Yugoslav conflicts 1990s,2018-07-02T10:49:13.312060,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-07T21:18:13.790000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d91|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Eastern European Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/citation/,h7xya,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ktehp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/relationships/node/,ktehp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58bf20739ad5a101fd00f295/,58bf20739ad5a101fd00f295,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7xya/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h7xya/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h7xya,https://doi.org/10.1080/09557571.2015.1118998

This attribution decision influences one’s opinion of the object (I like him). Misattribution occurs when the internal experience is triggered by one object (a prime), but attributed to another (a target). The present research used the Affect Misattribution Procedure to examine the influence of conceptual overlap between the prime and the target on misattribution of valenced internal experiences. For instance, would people misattribute the pleasure activated by a flower prime to a target flower more than to a person? We argue that the valence of the internal experience does not enter the attribution process alone, but is rather accompanied by semantic properties related to the object that generated the experience. Consequently, misattribution occurs more when prime and target are conceptually similar. Four experiments (Total N = 3,183) supported that prediction, using diverse primes and targets.

Yet, knowledge regarding the implementation of maternity provisions is essential, as such policies could significantly improve women and children’s well-‐being. We add to this literature by using fixed effects panel regression from 1999 through 2012 across 121 developing countries to explore whether different types of maternity leave policies affect infant/child mortality rates, fertility, and women’s labor force participation, and whether those effects are shaped by disparities in GDP per Capita and Secondary School Enrollment. Our findings demonstrate: 1) both infant and child mortality rates are expected to decline in countries that institute any leave policy, policies that last 12 weeks or longer, and policies that increase in duration and payment as a percentage of total annual salary, 2) fertility is expected to decline in countries that have higher weekly paid compensation, 3) maternity leave provisions decrease fertility and infant/child mortality rates most in countries with lower GDP per capita and countries with middle range secondary enrollment rates, and 4) labor force participation does not increase. Our results suggest that policy makers must consider the duration, compensation, and goals (addressing fertility versus mortality rates) of a policy alongside a country’s economic development and secondary school enrollment when determining which maternity leave provisions to apply within developing-‐country contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Child Health|Economic Development|Fertility|Infant Mortality Rate|Maternity Leave,2018-07-02T10:49:05.570011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-07T09:02:17.549000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/citation/,f2qk5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sa4aj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/relationships/node/,sa4aj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58be75799ad5a101fa00ecab/,58be75799ad5a101fa00ecab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2qk5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f2qk5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f2qk5,NA

The present moment is therefore privileged: it is the last moment of time. Craig Bourne (2002) and David Braddon-Mitchell (2004) have argued that this position is unmotivated, since the privilege of presentness comes apart from the indexicality of ‘this moment’. I respond that no-futurists should treat ‘x is real-as-of y’ as a nonsymmetric relation. Then different moments are real-as-of different times. This reunites privilege with indexicality, but entails that no-futurists must believe in ineliminably tensed facts.

Ladyman (2005) responds by allowing our identity criterion to include ‘irreflexive two-place relations’. I note that this does not solve the problem for structures with indistinguishable positions, i.e. positions that have all the same properties as each other and exactly the same relations to all objects (including themselves). I conclude that realistic structuralists must compromise and treat some structures eliminativistically.
