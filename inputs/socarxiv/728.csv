We argue against the necessity of both these explanations, instead suggeting that the apparent Weisburd paradox is an artifact of systematic overestimation inherent in post-hoc power calculations, a bias that is large with small n.

Based on qualitative interviews, conducted in eastern and western Germany, with young adults (28-30 years old) and their parents, we hypothesize, that the bigger supply of intergenerational support of grandparents for their children and grandchildren and an alleged dependence on these transfers is especially responsible for impeding the modernization of traditional role models assigning women to the role as a mother and housewife.

As a global network based upon the ""end to end"" principle of interoperability, the Internet mediates between different, otherwise incompatible computing platforms. But to the extent that law and technological ""code"" may act as substitutes in shaping human behavior, the Internet similarly mediates between different, otherwise incompatible legal platforms. Much of the legal and social controversy surrounding the Internet stems from the interconnection of such incompatible legal systems. As with technical systems, problems of incompatibility may be addressed by the adoption of uniform legal standards. This, however, raises legal standard-setting problems similar to those seen in technical standard-setting, where the standard may be ""tipped"" in favor of dominant producers.

But e-science network development is already encountering difficulty over the intellectual property rights associated with data and networked collaborative activity. Intellectual property regimes are often problematic in the practice of science, as scientific research typically assumes practices of openness that may be hampered or obstructed by intellectual property rights. A considerable literature has developed documenting and analyzing the impact of patents on research in the biomedical area, and the history of recent major scientific initiatives, such as the Human Genome Project, have been punctuated by clashes over the propriety and provision of patent rights in the accumulated data.

These difficulties are likely to be exacerbated in the context of e-science collaboration, where the development and use of intellectual resources will likely be distributed among many researchers in a variety of physical locations, often spanning national boundaries. The institutions that sponsor e-science collaborators may have differing intellectual property policies. Additionally, intellectual property is largely territorial, and the rights conferred under patent or copyright laws are relegated to a single nation.

Much recent scholarship and considerable governmental attention has been focused on adapting and expanding copyright to encompass digital works of authorship.

However, these rationales ignore the literature regarding the efficiency of unclear or ""muddy"" property entitlements. Where transaction costs of private bargaining are high, ""muddy"" rules will tend to force parties into informal bargaining transactions. Transaction costs on the Internet may tend to be high because of the number of parties involved, the difficulty of locating the parties, increased opportunity for strategic behavior, and the transborder nature of the medium. Thus, informal transactions or ""self-help"" may be the most efficient means for provision of digital works.

These prohibitions are entirely separate from the exclusive rights under copyright, causing some commentators to dub the anti-circumvention right as ""paracopyright."" Such ""paracopyright"" effectively grants copyright holders sweeping new ability to impose terms of access on content users: consumers who access content without accepting the content owner's terms would violate the owner's ""paracopyright"" even if the material accessed is not itself copyrighted or copyrightable.


At some point, such leveraging of access control seems certain to overstep the bounds militated by sound policy or intended by Congress. In the past, abuse of intellectual property rights has been curtailed under the doctrine of misuse. Misuse claims first arose in the patent context, where the patent might be leveraged into licensing terms that exceeded the proper scope of the patent grant. More recently, overreaching in copyright licensing has been recognized to constitute a form of misuse.  This paper argues that because DMCA ""paracopyright"" is ripe for abuse, limits on overreaching may be imposed by applying the misuse doctrine in this new area. Just as improper leveraging of patent and copyright may be curtailed by application of the misuse doctrine, so improper leveraging of paracopyright should be curtailed by application of misuse. This new application of misuse doctrine may be guided by the standards established in previous applications to patent and copyright law, and may serve a similar function in regulating the excesses invited by the anticircumvention right.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,copyright|digital rights management|DMCA|DRM|paracopyright|Preprint|socarxiv|technical protection measures|TPM,2018-07-02T10:47:34.245545,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T19:02:34.087000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/citation/,9w6rz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/etde3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/relationships/node/,etde3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578a84cc594d9001f5859eed/,578a84cc594d9001f5859eed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9w6rz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9w6rz

Drawing on theories of intersectionality, we contribute to the cultural and empirical analysis of gender gaps in religiosity by documenting an interactive effect between gender, education, and political views for predicting religious nonaffiliation and infrequent attendance at religious services among Americans. For highly educated political liberals, gender gaps effectively disappear, such that men and women are almost equally likely to be secular (or religious).
