Our main questions concern the BRICs’ willingness to accept AEoI, and their agreement to the Western-dominated OECD as its institutional forum. First, we examine the domestic drivers for BRICs’ participation, as their statist model of capitalism reveals strong disincentives to join this regime and the fact that the budgetary consequences of the global financial crisis were less severe than in Western states. We argue that their agreement on AEoI results more from their persistent balance-of-payments vulnerability to illicit capital than from fiscal weakness, while also discussing the possibilities for mock compliance. Second, we review the role of the non-reciprocal US foreign account tax compliance act (FATCA) in shaping the BRICs’ preference for a multilateral AEoI-regime centred around the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Last, we show that the BRICs’ acceptance of the OECD resulted from pragmatic interests and receiving ownership over the process, together with the absence of coercive mechanisms within the CRS-regime that could fundamentally undermine their sovereignty in this domain.",TRUE,FALSE,Automatic exchange of information|BRICS|Fatca|International tax governance|OECD|TAX,2019-10-09T14:35:03.389430,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:34:39.227573,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/citation/,9nmke,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c9c84fcf91f001119d642/,5d9c9c84fcf91f001119d642,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9nmke/,https://doi.org/10.1080/13563467.2019.1584168,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9nmke

While the former signifies an essential step forward in reducing tax evasion, the BEPS outcomes were criticized for merely patching up flawed taxation principles based on the arms’-length standard. The emergence of global automatic exchange of information is often ascribed to the US who unilaterally enforced its own FATCA automatic information-exchange standard, while no comparable action happened during BEPS. This article investigates the US position on the BEPS outcomes and if a similar unilateral action would have led to more far-reaching cooperation concerning BEPS. By examining the distributional consequences of cooperation in both processes, we conclude that US power in tax governance in both issues is more limited than generally assumed and insufficient to explain global cooperation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-09T14:34:45.998527,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:34:16.844025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/citation/,ewd3j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c9b73fcf91f00121a3068/,5d9c9b73fcf91f00121a3068,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewd3j/,https://doi.org/10.1080/14747731.2018.1496558,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewd3j

While the DST will fall short in the EU Council due to unanimity requirements, I argue that the Commission actually achieved its pre-prescribed goals.

Comparing Frame Occurrence in Online and Traditional News Media Reporting on Europe’s  “Migration Crisis”,"News media have transformed over the last decades, with rising online news suppliers and an increase in online news consumption. We examine how reporting on immigration differs between popular German online and print media over three crucial years of the so-called immigration crisis, from 2015 to 2017. This study extends knowledge on framing of the crisis by examining a period covering start, peak, and the time after the intake of refugees. Moreover, we establish whether online and print reporting differs in terms of both frame occurrence and variability. The period of the crisis provided an ideal test to see whether the focus of media reporting differed between online and print sources. Employing a most similar cases design based on (autonomous) online and print versions of three major German news outlets, we extract the dominant frames in almost 18,500 articles using algorithm-based topic modelling. While results indicate that many frames are more visible in either online or print media, these differences often do not follow theoretical expectations. Furthermore, online media are dominated more by particular frames and, hence, show less diversity than print media.

Seven (7) participants were gathered as co-researchers and were selected thoroughly based on the following criteria: 1) They are Filipino who had stroke at the age of 15-35 and 2) They are able and willing to articulate, participate, and share their life experiences. 
	Further, the experiences of the participants were gathered and enhanced through the following methods: 1) Interview, and 2) Storytelling. Subsequently, three levels of analysis were done ensuing the process developed by Martinez (2013), grounded on interpretative phenomenology. Through the process of reflective analysis, three themes have emerged and are as follows: 
(a) “Sometimes, what is forbidden is pleasurable”: Dilemma of Needs and Wants
(b) “I accepted it... my family is still accepting it”: Centrality and Ambiguity of the Family
(c) “I become feeble but stronger”: Resilience in Vulnerability

	The themes represent a recurring pattern among the lives of the co-researchers from having the desire to change their old ways and habits but acting otherwise. Further, these patterns are reflected in the positionality of their family as both a burden that reminds them that they have a disease yet serves as the main reason they continue to fight. This also mirrors how they view stroke as something that defeated them but in the process taught them resilience in life. The insight of a “life in paradox”, then serves as the central essence of the study.

Given this context, it is interesting to note that few research have been done on the experiences of these individuals who provide care to their dying relatives.
     This research aims to understand the lives of these informal carers as they provide care to their dying relatives. After securing clearance from an IRB, seven (5) informants, deemed as coresearchers, were recruited and agreed to participate in this study. The co-researchers where selected based on a pre-set criteria and the number were reached based on theoretical saturation. Multiple individual in-depth face-to-face interviews were done to create the individual narratives which was later reflectively analysed. Interpretive phenomenology as espoused by van Manen served as the philosophical underpinning of the study. Consequently, the proposed analytic technique of van Manen was utilized as the process of reflective analysis.
     After the process of reflective analysis, three (3) themes were gathered, namely: Ambivalence in anticipation, Courage in uncertainty, Meaning in suffering. These themes represent for the co-researchers their lives as they care for their dying relatives. Further, these themes reflects for the co-researchers a phenomenon of living moment-to-moment, unsure of what tomorrow will bring, patiently waiting for their relative to cross over. For them, there seems to be a constant struggle of finding a reason for being and a sense of what has happened, what is happening and what could happen to their dying relative and their family after their death. This essence can be symbolically represented by a swinging pendulum, constantly in motion trying to situate ambivalence in their anticipation, looking for courage amidst uncertainty and finding for
meaning in their experience of suffering.
     The insights suggest that there is a need for constant dialogue among family members and health care providers as they assumed the role of primary caregivers. Further continued emotional, moral and spiritual support is implied during this transition as well as follow-ups when the families are at the home setting.",TRUE,FALSE,caregiver|caring|death|dying|family member|phenomenology,2019-10-08T16:44:21.613921,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-08T16:44:07.809907,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/citation/,tqzp6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c3af4a7bc73000be6b545/,5d9c3af4a7bc73000be6b545,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqzp6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqzp6

Grounded on focused ethnography, seven (7) informants from two stroke unit from two selected hospitals within Metro Manila were chosen to be informants in this study. Participants were selected based on the criteria that (1) They are currently working as nurses in the stroke unit with at least five years of exposure in the said area and (2) they are fluent in English and Tagalog and are willing to participate in this study. Interviews and story-telling sessions were done to gather the necessary narratives which was then analyzed via the process of thematization. 
After the process of analysis, three themes were identified and are as follows: (1) Technical proficiency as a sign of competence; (2) Perceived autonomy as a mark of dignity; (3) Relational expertise as a manifestation of seniority. The themes show in general how technical competence, perceived autonomy and relational expertise were seen by the informants as distinctive marks of their professional identity as nurses working in a stroke units.  
Insights from this study reveal the unique appreciation of nurses working in stroke unit of their concept of competence, autonomy and expertise. The said concepts are deeply ingrained in their everyday lives that it has become part of their disciplinary hallmarks. 
Since  the ultimate aim of focused ethnography is not to produce a universal truth that can be applied to all context and setting but rather provide insights on specific context sensitive phenomena that will serve as a springboard for the improvement of the context where the insights were gleaned upon from, the following implications were proposed: Professional updates, trainings and preceptorship program that focus on technical competencies, communication skills, and conflict management techniques are suggested. Further, empowerment and inter professional bonding activities, such as open forums might also be beneficial in the context of collegiality and collaborative practice.",TRUE,FALSE,competence|focused ethnography|nursing|professional identity|stroke,2019-10-08T16:47:43.805781,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-08T16:47:15.869211,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/citation/,dh65f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9bfc65fcf91f000f192f1b/,5d9bfc65fcf91f000f192f1b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh65f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dh65f/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dh65f

Economic and technological advances have led to a more interconnected global community, further increasing the need for considerations of human mobility. While data on human mobility are better recorded in many developed countries, availability of such data remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, particularly at the fine temporal and spatial scales required by many applications. In this study, we used 5-year census-based internal migration microdata for 32 departments in Colombia (i.e., Admin-1 level) to develop a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for estimating migration, at a finer spatial scale, among the 1,122 municipalities in the country (i.e., Admin-2 level). Our modeling approach bridges a significant gap in the availability of migration data at administrative unit levels finer than those at which migration data are typically recorded. Due to the widespread availability of census-based migration microdata at the Admin-1 level, our modeling approach opens up for the possibilities of modeling migration patterns at Admin-2 and Admin-3 levels across many other countries where such data are currently lacking.",TRUE,FALSE,Colombia|disease transmission|human mobility|migration|spatial scales,2019-10-08T01:36:42.748868,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-08T01:31:55.482221,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/citation/,avw7z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/74mg8/,74mg8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9bc3ebfcf91f0010191377/,5d9bc3ebfcf91f0010191377,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/avw7z/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/avw7z
