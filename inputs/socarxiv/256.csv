A Study of 25 Years of Publication Outputs,"Given their constitutionally guaranteed academic freedom, German academics are not forced by law to metrify their research outputs, but they do still practice metrification – one could say on autopilot. The metrification autopilot mode captures the voluntary commitment of a substantial part of the German academic profession to socio-calculative valuation, evaluation and valorization practices in the governance and control of higher education institutions (HEI), of disciplines and at the individual level. The effects of the metrification autopilot, in terms of auto-metrification in individual academics’ publication behavior, are studied empirically using three surveys (1992, 2007 and 2018). On the individual level, the metrification autopilot is observed as a trend among all full professors. Among non-full professors, the most metrified publication outputs are produced by academics who have been in their positions for more than 13 years. Accordingly, socialization into metrified status/reputation-seeking and status/reputation-keeping academic culture seems to take about 12 years. On the organizational level, we observe the metrification autopilot trend on the basis of the correlation between journal articles and HEIs’ policy of strong metrified performance recognition. On the discipline level, the metrification autopilot trend is observable in the way that humanities and social sciences scholars adapt to the peer-reviewed journal publication paradigm of the natural sciences, which is a key driver for transforming science and HEIs into a “socio-calculative environment” (Vormbusch 2012) of valuation, evaluation and valorization.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic profession; Germany; Higher education and science policy; Metrification; Publication outputs; Reputation,2020-06-05T10:35:22.330970,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-05T10:35:12.978634,FALSE,NA,no,Part of the data will be available after mid-2021 (embargo to enable a PhD thesis),,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/citation/,mcs3g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed941a6fabc45008f638a77/,5ed941a6fabc45008f638a77,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcs3g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mcs3g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mcs3g,NA

Wildlife trade has become central to discourse on COVID-19, zoonotic pandemics, and related policy responses, which must focus on “saving lives, protecting livelihoods, and safeguarding nature”. Proposed policy responses have included extreme measures such as banning all use and trade of wildlife, or blanket measures for entire Classes. However, different trades pose varying degrees of risk for zoonotic pandemics, while some trades also play critical roles in delivering other aspects of sustainable development, particularly related to poverty, hunger, decent work, responsible consumption and production, and life on land and below water. Here we describe how wildlife trade contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in diverse ways, with synergies and trade-offs within and between the SDGs. In doing so, we show that prohibitions could result in severe trade-offs against some SDGs, with limited benefits for public health via pandemic prevention. This complexity necessitates context-specific policies, with multi-sector decision-making that goes beyond simple top-down solutions. We encourage decision-makers to adopt a risk-based approach to wildlife trade policy post-COVID-19, with policies formulate via participatory, evidence-based approaches, which explicitly acknowledge uncertainty, complexity and conflicting values across different components of the SDGs. This could help to ensure that future use and trade of wildlife is safe, environmentally-sustainable and socially-just.",TRUE,FALSE,conservation|COVID19|ecosystems|environmental policy|human well-being|livelihoods|multi-sector|pandemics|public health|SDGs|sustainable development goals|trade-offs|zoonotic diseases,2020-06-04T17:18:01.564958,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-04T17:17:11.768715,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/citation/,2p3xt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/58ms9/,58ms9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed8f580fabc45004f639790/,5ed8f580fabc45004f639790,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2p3xt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2p3xt,NA

Black activists in the US have long protested racially disparate policing and the repression of Black political action. These actions have meshed with efforts by other reform movements. This chapter reviews Black and non-Black movements addressing racial disparities or biases in US criminal justice with an emphasis on the movements between the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and the emergence of the Black Lives mobilization in 2014. The author's experiences in a local movement around racial disparities in criminal justice are shown to be consistent with what happened elsewhere. Prior to 2012, both radicals and moderates engaged in similar tactics of writing reports and seeking to influence criminal justice policy and there were periodic eruptions of protest about police violence or discrimination. Protests built upon longstanding organizations and networks and received external support as they grew.

As the Covid-19 pandemic has grown internationally, there has been an increased need for volunteers. This study aimed to identify the predictors of volunteering including demographic backgrounds, socio-economic characteristics, personality and psychosocial factors.
Methods. Data were analysed from 31,890 adults in the UK COVID-19 Social Study run by University College London; a longitudinal study focusing on the psychological and social experiences of adults living in the UK during the Covid-19 pandemic. Tetrachoric factor analysis was applied to identify latent categories of voluntary work. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identity predictors for volunteering and change in volunteering behaviours since before lockdown.
Results. Three types of volunteering during the pandemic were identified: formal volunteering, social action volunteering, and neighbourhood volunteering. Regression analysis showed that the pattern of voluntary work was structured by demographic backgrounds, socio-economic factors, personality and psychological factors.

Social science, liberal arts, history, and philosophy are meant first of all. That kind of theory is presupposed to be a consistent text, which can be exhaustedly represented by a certain mathematical structure constructively. In thus used, the term “theory” includes all hypotheses as yet unconfirmed as already rejected. The investigation of the sketch of a possible proof of the principle demonstrates that it should be accepted rather a metamathematical axiom about the relation of mathematics and reality.
The main statement is formulated as follows: Any scientific theory admits isomorphism to some mathematical structure in a way constructive (that is not as a proof of “pure existence” in a mathematical sense).
Its investigation needs philosophical means. Husserl’s phenomenology is what is used, and then the conception of “bracketing reality” is modelled to generalize Peano arithmetic in its relation to set theory in the foundation of mathematics. The obtained model is equivalent to the generalization of Peano arithmetic by means of replacing the axiom of induction with that of transfinite induction.
The sketch of the proof is organized in five steps: (1) a generalization of epoché; (2) involving transfinite induction in the transition between Peano arithmetic and set theory; (3) discussing the finiteness of Peano arithmetic; (4) applying transfinite induction to Peano arithmetic; (5) discussing an arithmetical model of reality.
Accepting or rejecting the principle, two kinds of mathematics appear differing from each other by its relation to reality. Accepting the principle, mathematics has to include reality within itself in a kind of Pythagoreanism. These two kinds are called in paper correspondingly Hilbert mathematics and Gödel mathematics. The sketch of the proof of the principle demonstrates that the generalization of Peano arithmetic as above can be interpreted as a model of Hilbert mathematics into Gödel mathematics therefore showing that the former is not less consistent than the latter, and the principle is an independent axiom.
The present paper follows a pathway grounded on Husserl’s phenomenology and “bracketing reality” to achieve the generalized arithmetic necessary for the principle to be founded in alternative ontology, in which there is no reality external to mathematics: reality is included within mathematics. That latter mathematics is able to self-found itself and can be called Hilbert mathematics in honour of Hilbert’s program for self-founding mathematics on the base of arithmetic.
The principle of universal mathematizability is consistent to Hilbert mathematics, but not to Gödel mathematics. Consequently, its validity or rejection would resolve the problem which mathematics refers to our being; and vice versa: the choice between them for different reasons would confirm or refuse the principle as to the being.
An information interpretation of Hilbert mathematics is involved. It is a kind of ontology of information. The Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics is involved to illustrate that ontology. Thus the problem which of the two mathematics is more relevant to our being (rather than reality for reality is external only to Gödel mathematics) is discussed again in a new way
A few directions for future work can be: a rigorous formal proof of the principle as an independent axiom; the further development of information ontology consistent to both kinds of mathematics, but much more natural for Hilbert mathematics; the development of the information interpretation of quantum mechanics as a mathematical one for information ontology and thus Hilbert mathematics; the description of consciousness in terms of information ontology.",TRUE,FALSE,axiom of choice;|axiom of induction|axiom of transfinite induction|eidetic|epoché|Gödel mathematics|Hilbert mathematics;|phenomenological and transcendental reduction;|principle of universal mathematizability,2020-06-04T17:15:42.833637,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-04T17:15:11.875084,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfa|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Logic and Foundations of Mathematics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cff|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Continental Philosophy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/citation/,er9dt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed8b4eda8777300386c68c9/,5ed8b4eda8777300386c68c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/er9dt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/er9dt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/er9dt,NA

Drawing on a conceptual innovation by political scientist Jennifer Chudy, we explore the utility of transferring into criminology her construct of racial sympathy—or Whites’ concern about Blacks’ suffering.  First, across three data sets, we replicate Chudy’s finding that racial sympathy and resentment are empirically distinct constructs.  Second, based on a national-level 2019 YouGov survey (n = 760 White respondents) and consistent with Chudy’s thesis, racial sympathy is then shown to be significantly related to the race-specific view that capital punishment is discriminatory but not support for the death penalty or harsher courts.  Racial sympathy also is positively associated with advocacy of rehabilitation as the main goal of prison.  Notably, in all models, racial resentment has robust effects, increasing punitive sentiments.  Taken together, the results suggest that racial sympathy is a concept that can enrich criminologists’ study of how race shapes crime policy preferences in the United States and beyond.",TRUE,FALSE,Capital punishment|public policy|Racial resentment|Racial sympathy,2020-06-18T01:46:25.746329,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:46:05.078766,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/citation/,xybj9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed81437a87773000c6c8224/,5ed81437a87773000c6c8224,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xybj9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xybj9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xybj9,NA

However, even when the benefit of the behavior change is supported by solid science, actually changing behavior is difficult. Doing so effectively requires an appreciation for how people learn behaviors, and translate information into action. Insights from the evolutionary human sciences can improve the behavioral change toolkit for researchers and policy makers. Specifically, effective  behavior change policy should be based on an understanding of humans as a cultural and cooperative species. Socially transmitted information and culturally-informed motivations shape behavior change. The structure of social networks and how group identities map onto those networks in turn influence transmission dynamics. Information can spread from person to person, similar to the way diseases spread. Just as with disease, the epidemiology of information is subject to structural and behavioral influences on transmissibility. We show why and how 1) the pandemic poses several adaptive challenges with important tradeoffs, 2) people use social information to learn how to deal with these, and 3) people adopt social norms in a group-based context.",TRUE,FALSE,behavior|coronavirus|COVID-19|evolution|identity|social learning|uncertainty,2020-06-03T18:01:31.501943,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-03T18:00:57.046505,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/citation/,kxajh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed7e417237cd3009c54b8be/,5ed7e417237cd3009c54b8be,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxajh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kxajh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kxajh,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23485

Evidence from U.S. High School Students,"The under-representation of women in American politics can likely be explained, at least in part, by women’s comparatively lower levels of political ambition. We analyze a co-ed, religious program for high school students in which participants lobby their Members of Congress and receive political skills training. By leveraging longitudinal survey data about the participants and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program successfully increased the political ambition of its female participants. To the best of our knowledge, we offer the first quasi-experimental evidence demonstrating a possible means of increasing the political ambition of high school-aged American women.
