This search engine, unlike traditional databases, automatically indexes information from the academic web. Its ease of use, together with its wide coverage and fast indexing speed, have made it the first tool most scientists currently turn to when they need to carry out a literature search. Additionally, the fact that its search results were accompanied from the beginning by citation counts, as well as the later development of secondary products which leverage this citation data (such as Google Scholar Metrics and Google Scholar Citations), made many scientists wonder about its potential as a source of data for bibliometric analyses. The goal of this chapter is to lay the foundations for the use of GS as a supplementary source (and in some disciplines, arguably the best alternative) for scientific evaluation. First, we present a general overview of how GS works. Second, we present empirical evidences about its main characteristics (size, coverage, and growth rate). Third, we carry out a systematic analysis of the main limitations this search engine presents as a tool for the evaluation of scientific performance. Lastly, we discuss the main differences between GS and other more traditional bibliographic databases in light of the correlations found between their citation data.

Here, we analyze greater than 24,000 MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) transcriptions of Western classical music from 197 composers spanning from the 15th to 20th centuries. The unique file format of MIDI files (notes of discrete frequencies turning “on” and “off” at specific times) allows us to statistically quantify note usage with respect to pitch class and intervals. We first perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on pitch class and show that the data creates a ring. Songs strongly associated with a particular key fall on the ring, whereas highly chromatic and atonal works fall in the center, revealing that the evolution of Western music is constrained by the circle of fifths. We then examine interval usage. Discriminant analysis on composer identity reveals that a major source of evolutionary change is incremental and linear. Interval usage predicts individual composer identity at levels above chance. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) reveals four major groups of composers with similar tonal styles. These groups are loosely based on traditional musical eras, but reveal unexpected continuity between co-existing schools of composers.",TRUE,FALSE,corpus analysis|history|music|tonality,2018-07-02T11:28:49.760277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-11T19:26:50.242434,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d47|Arts and Humanities|Music|Other Music,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/citation/,btshk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rkptu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/relationships/node/,rkptu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a2ec6553e0297000d8232d0/,5a2ec6553e0297000d8232d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/btshk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/btshk,NA

In this article, we argue that practice theory has great potential for illuminating this question. Drawing on Vincent Pouliot's empirical analysis of NATO-Russia relations after the end of the Cold War, we elaborate how change happens in and through practice. We show that post-Cold War security practices are inherently unstable, because there is a fundamental uncertainty about whether the Cold War is really over or whether the Cold War logic of bipolar confrontation still applies. Uncertainty about the meaning of the past destabilizes present practices and thus makes sudden and drastic change possible. To date, many contributions to the literature on international practices have, however, failed to grasp the inherent instability of practice. We argue that this failure is due to a particular conception of change that can be found in the works of Pierre Bourdieu. Through a close reading of Pouliot's Bourdieusian analysis of post-Cold War politics, we demonstrate the limitations of such a perspective, notably that it is unable to grasp how change originates in practice.",TRUE,FALSE,Cold War|international practices|NATO-Russia diplomacy|Pierre Bourdieu|practice theory|social change,2018-07-02T11:28:48.842450,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-11T14:57:17.517467,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d93|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Sebastian Schindler; Tobias Wille,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/citation/,7bgmn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/krs5j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/relationships/node/,krs5j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a2e69065a8b4c0010508f76/,5a2e69065a8b4c0010508f76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7bgmn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7bgmn,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1752971915000068

We focus on how the effects of parental divorce on children’s education differ across families with varying likelihoods of disruption. Using U.S. panel data, with careful attention to the assumptions and methods needed to estimate total and mediating causal effects, we find a significant effect of parental divorce on educational attainment among children whose parents were unlikely to divorce, for whom divorce was thus a relative shock. We find no effect among children whose parents were likely to divorce and for whom divorce was one of many disadvantages, and thus less economically and socially disruptive. We also find that the observed effect of divorce on children’s education is strongly mediated by post-divorce family income. Children’s psychosocial skills also explain a portion of the effect among children with a low propensity for parental divorce, while cognitive skills play no role in explaining the negative association between divorce and children’s education.

This paper visits the argument for using simulation as a means of addressing the gap that exists between archaeological interpretations of past behaviours and their physical residues. It is argued that simulation is used for much the same reason that archaeologists use ethnographic or experimental studies, and that computational models can help to address some of the practical limitations of these approaches to record formation. A case study from arid Australia, examining the effects of episodic surface erosion on the visibility of the record, shows how simple, generative simulations, grounded in formational logic, can be used to compare different explanatory mechanisms and suggest tests of the archaeological record itself.",TRUE,FALSE,Australia|digital archaeology|Formation|simulation,2018-07-02T11:28:43.431910,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-07T22:13:39.622946,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/citation/,tyjc9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b2fum/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/relationships/node/,b2fum,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a29ae7bd7a04c000e8c5e3c/,5a29ae7bd7a04c000e8c5e3c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyjc9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tyjc9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tyjc9,NA
