Philosophy has puzzled over it, physics queried its nature, and popular culture entertained us with its peculiarities. As a construct, time is multifaceted. While we experience time, we are subject to it. We also harness time, and apply it as an instrument and a lens. However, time also represents a means to enrich knowledge of urban health. To achieve this aim will involve accounting for time as well as thinking in time.
Thinking in time within urban health draws attention to the evolution of urban contexts, such as neighbourhoods, the life-courses of these settings and, the dynamics between the life-course of people and their health in place, with the life-course of place. Thinking in time also entails attending to the nature of time itself, and the manner by which re-imagining time may transform how urban health is queried.
Cross-disciplinary in nature, and trans-disciplinary in its intent, this conceptual review reflects on observational research to consider what has been discovered about neighbourhood effects, and how time features in this information.

However, the actual trend in the 21st century has been the opposite. Knowledge spillovers have fuelled urbanisation and pulled job-seekers into large cities, increasing the gap to deprived rural areas. We argue that new assemblages of technologies and social practices, so-called ’online labour platforms’, have recently started to counter this trend. By providing effective formal and informal mechanisms of enforcing cooperation, these platforms for project-based remote knowledge work enable users to hire and find work across distance. In analysing data from a leading online labour platform in more than 3,000 urban and rural counties in the United States, we find that rural workers made disproportionate use of the online labour market. Rural counties also supplied, on average, higher skilled online work than urban areas did. However, many of the most deprived regions of the country did not participate in the online labour market at all.

Executive Report.,"In an era of mass migration, social scientists, populist parties and social movements raise concerns over the future of immigration-destination societies. What impacts does this have on policy and social solidarity? Comparative cross-national research, relying mostly on secondary data, has findings in different directions. There is a threat of selective model reporting and lack of replicability. The heterogeneity of countries obscures attempts to clearly define data-generating models. P-hacking and HARKing lurk among standard research practices in this area.
This project employs crowdsourcing to address these issues. It draws on replication, deliberation, meta-analysis and harnessing the power of many minds at once. The Crowdsourced Replication Initiative carries two main goals, (a) to better investigate the linkage between immigration and social policy preferences across countries, and (b) to develop crowdsourcing as a social science method. The Executive Report provides short reviews of the area of social policy preferences and immigration, and the methods and impetus behind crowdsourcing plus a description of the entire project.

Inspired by this computational movement, this study uses Bayesian networks analysis, combining both the frequentist and the Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, to investigate the highly representative elements in the cultural evolution of a Vietnamese city’s architecture in the early 20th century. With a focus on the façade design of 68 old houses in Hanoi’s Old Quarter (based on 78 data lines extracted from 248 photos), the study argues that it is plausible to look at the aesthetics, architecture, and designs of the house façade to find traces of cultural evolution in Vietnam, which went through more than six decades of French colonization and centuries of sociocultural influence from China. The in-depth technical analysis, though refuting the presumed model on the probabilistic dependency among the variables, yields several results, the most notable of which is the strong influence of Buddhism over the decorations of the house façade. Particularly, in the top 5 networks with the best Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) scores and p&lt;0.05, the variable for decorations (DC) always has a direct probabilistic dependency on the variable B for Buddhism. The paper then checks the robustness of these models using Hamiltonian MCMC method and find the posterior distributions of the models’ coefficients all satisfy the technical requirement. Finally, this study suggests integrating Bayesian statistics in the social sciences in general and for the study of cultural evolution and architectural transformation in particular.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian network|Buddhism|cultural evolution|Franco-Chinese style|French colonialism|Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo|Hanoi architecture|house façade|Old Quarter,2019-01-26T15:43:02.447918,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-26T15:42:34.662985,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c80|Arts and Humanities|Other Languages, Societies, and Cultures|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cab|Arts and Humanities|Fine Arts|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf0|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Asian Art and Architecture|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/citation/,7p9zf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4c4e1dbf723100187952f3/,5c4c4e1dbf723100187952f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7p9zf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7p9zf,NA

However, game-theoretic and institutional models suggest that cooperatives may be inherently fragile due to the individual costs of cooperation. Because of this it is widely believed that organizations which rely less on cooperation may be more stable, while organizations that require cooperation may be at higher risk of folding. Therefore, if cooperatively owned or managed businesses do in fact require higher levels of prosocial and cooperative behavior than hierarchically managed firms, they must attract and maintain cooperation among participants in order to function. We hypothesized that successful consumer food cooperatives will exhibit greater generalized cooperation than conventional grocery stores. We employed an experimental dictator game to measure altruistic cooperation among consumers at a food cooperative and a comparable conventional grocery. Cooperative customers exhibit a higher base rate of cooperation than similar conventional food shoppers, and this relationship holds even when taking demographic factors such as income, education, and age into account. We conclude that, when successful, consumer food cooperatives exhibit greater levels of cooperation than comparable traditional businesses.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperation|dictator game|experimental economics|food cooperatives|prosociality,2019-01-25T21:45:08.711511,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-25T21:44:51.386017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,Ethan Tremblay|Afton Hupper|Timothy Waring,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/citation/,6x9p3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4b6f27bf723100167a1013/,5c4b6f27bf723100167a1013,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6x9p3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6x9p3,NA

It started in 2011, partially due to the ripple effect caused by Arab Spring in the nations along the West Asian and North African (WANA) regions, and also due to the resentment of the population to the Syrian regime led by Bashar Al Assad. What began as peaceful protests in March 2011 erupted into violent, brutal attacks, all culminating into the bloodiest conflict in the 21st century, which saw intervention by many State and non-State actors like Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra Front and the like. The involvement of foreign powers led by the US and its allies in Europe and West Asia exacerbated the situation, when they started arming, funding and training rebels and/or terrorist groups. The other prominent actors like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia supported the rebels and/or terrorist groups, while the Syrian forces were supported by Iran, Iraq and Lebanon-based militia group, Hezbollah, and lately by the Kurdish groups. In 2015, Russia too intervened in Syria to back the government forces. In April 2017, the US administration carried out its first direct military action against the Syrian government, launching cruise missiles at a Syrian air force base.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-25T18:40:47.379369,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-25T18:40:26.331243,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Military and Veterans Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Peace and Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dee|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Emergency and Disaster Management|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76def|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Other Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Defense and Security Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/citation/,wu42a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4b2fe2568329001b7e885b/,5c4b2fe2568329001b7e885b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wu42a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wu42a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wu42a,NA
