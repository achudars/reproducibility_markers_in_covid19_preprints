Comparing Theories of the Reverse Income-Obesity Gradient in the U.S. and South Korea,"In high-income countries, poverty is often associated with higher average body mass index (BMI). To account for this reverse gradient, deprivation theories posit that declining economic resources make it more difficult to maintain a healthy weight. By contrast, discrimination theories argue that anti-fat discrimination in hiring and marriage sorts heavier individuals into lower-income households. We assess competing predictions of these theories by examining how household income in representative samples from South Korea (2007–2014, N=20,823) and the U.S. (1999–2014, N=6,395) is related to BMI in two key contrasting groups: (1) currently married and (2) never married individuals. Naïve analyses that aggregate these two groups reveal the well-established reverse gradient. Stratified analyses, on the other hand, reveal that the gradient only appears among currently married women, but not never-married women or men. Further analyses indicated that these differences in the gradient by marital status cannot be accounted for a number of alternative hypothesis based on differential employment or motivation to lose weight. Though consistent with predictions of anti-fat discrimination in marriage, these findings raise important challenges to deprivation theories of the reverse gradient.",TRUE,FALSE,body mass index|income|KNHANES|NHANES|obesity|reverse gradient,2018-07-27T11:09:01.223561,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-27T11:08:48.380785,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",SeungYong Han|Daniel J.

A Cautionary Tale,"In studies of educational achievement, students' self-reported number of books in the family home is a frequently used proxy for social, cultural, and economic background. Absent hard evidence about what this variable captures or how well, its use has been motivated by strong associations with student outcomes. I show that these associations rest on two types of endogeneity: low achievers accrue fewer books, and are also prone to underestimate their number. The conclusion is substantiated both by comparing reports by students and their parents, and by the fact that girls report on average higher numbers despite being similar to boys on other measures of social background. The endogenous bias is large enough to overturn classical attenuation bias; it distorts cross-country patterns and invalidates many common study designs. These findings serve as a caution against overreliance on standard regression assumptions and contribute to ongoing debates about the empirical robustness of social science.",TRUE,FALSE,differential measurement error|education|endogeneity|equality of opportunity|home literacy environment|socioeconomic status|standardized assessments,2018-07-27T11:07:20.853669,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-27T11:07:01.922700,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/citation/,a6jny,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gh9kp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/relationships/node/,gh9kp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b59e29fee43a5000f6eda1d/,5b59e29fee43a5000f6eda1d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6jny/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6jny/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a6jny,NA

Using Beijing and Shanghai as case studies, this paper draws on 32 in-depth semi-structured interviews with municipal government officials, academics, and transportation professionals to explore the city-level transportation policymaking process in China. Across the two cities, we identify three common contributors – policy learning, data informatization, and public opinion – and four obstacles – public complaint, unilateral decisionmaking, inadequate coordination among relevant departments, and lack of adaptiveness in policy implementation practice – to adopting timely and appropriate transportation policies. We then introduce a processual model that connects the contributors and obstacles identified within the flow of transportation policy among key actors in city-level government. This process shows how transportation policymaking in Chinese megacities is often reactive to public outcry over a transportation problem. This problem is investigated by a technical government research center that reports to the municipal transport committee. This committee then assesses public opinion and submits a policy recommendation to city government leadership, who make the final policy decision. Based on both case studies, we discuss potential recommendations for how to better enable transportation policymaking at the city level in China through more formalized processes of policy experimentation and public participation.

In response to this limitation, here a method to estimate socioeconomic and demographic variables in a consistent manner at the tornado level for historical events is implemented and assessed. The daysmetric method uses data from the 1990 and 2000 Census, as well as the 2010 American Community Survey together with tornado reports over the period 1995--2016. Results show that a typical casualty-producing tornado affects 34 people with an interquartile range between 4 and 198 people. Results also show that the 2 July 1997 Detroit, Michigan tornado with its 90 known injuries likely affected over 101,752 people. Comparisons between estimates using the actual path and a simplified modeled path show strong correspondence (percent errors averaging less than 10%) and estimates compare favorably (correlations exceeding .90) with known demographic numbers from a sample of tornadoes indicating the procedure provides useful information for statistical studies of tornado vulnerability.

The data comes from a 10-indicator scale from the national representative survey “Social Justice and Citizenship Participation”, applied in Chile in 2013 (N=1.245). Based in previous exploratory and confirmatory studies, a factorial confirmatory model for internal and external attributions of both poverty an wealth was estimated (four factors), based on which a second order two-factor confirmatory model was estimated, one for internal and one for external attributions, for both poverty and wealth.

Yet “open” research instruments have understudied socioeconomic, organizational, and political dynamics, describing distinctive modes of participation in scientific knowledge infrastructures. In this paper, I describe the CERN “Open Hardware” initiative with a focus on the exchange practices and technologies of participation that were mobilized to assemble a critical infrastructure with distributed teams at research centers, companies, and Internet-based projects. Drawing from ethnographic and archival research of collaborative and competitive dynamics around “Open Hardware” at CERN, I examine how “open” scientific tools and infrastructures are designed, disputed, and implemented following Free and Open Source development models. In questioning “openness” both at the level of technical objects and their technical collectives, I examine the usage of Open Hardware for validating and assessing research results as well as rendering scientific projects more permeable to new modes of participation in the making of the“technoscience by other means.” --- Paper submitted for the ""Colloque annuel de l’IFRIS 2018,"" Université Paris VI, France.",TRUE,FALSE,anthropology of science|CERN|free software|open hardware|open science|open source|open source hardware,2018-07-25T13:47:02.163988,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-25T13:46:38.025724,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/citation/,tqwef,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2t4cq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/relationships/node/,2t4cq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b576633da105100109a83c5/,5b576633da105100109a83c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqwef/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqwef,NA

Comparative studies thus often serve as political devices. Owing to the development of the Internet and translation technology, large-scale, cross-national surveys have become a low-cost means to manipulate public opinion.
    In this paper, I introduce the case of the political use of the International Fertility Decision-Making Study (IFDMS) in Japan. IFDMS was conducted in 2009-2010 by researchers from Cardiff University and Merck Serono, a global pharmaceutical company. IFDMS prepared a questionnaire in 13 languages for 18 countries, targeted at both men and women who were trying to conceive. It featured questions regarding medical knowledge about pregnancy. According to the published results, the respondents who lived in Japan exhibited a lower level of knowledge about conception than those in other countries. Based on this result, medical authorities in Japan insisted that, because of the lack of knowledge, the Japanese people had thoughtlessly postponed childbirth, resulting in fertility decline. The government accordingly created a new outline of population policy in 2015, in which it referred the results from IFDMS to advocate sex education for youth in order to encourage early marriage.
    However, IFDMS is unreliable. It has many defects including mistranslations in the questionnaire. Nevertheless, results from IFDMS were accepted as reliable scientific findings in conferences and journals in the field of natural sciences in Europe, bypassing scrutiny by social science researchers in the targeted countries. Language differences also prevented the accurate understanding of the research results. The case of the political effect of IFDMS thus teaches us that social impacts of comparative studies may be deceptive and nullify social scientific efforts to accurately perceive the society in which we live.

The key point of pollution is massive disposable plastics and people should say no to them sooner or later. Then there are 4 alternative policies for solving the problem. All of them are evaluated, analyzed as well as some possible trade-offs. The current best choice is to increase landfill density while producing CH4 from landfill suit as a sustainable trade-off, and develop microorganisms of degrading plastics. But developing proper replacements through biotechnology and chemistry technologies will be the ultimate solution.",TRUE,FALSE,biotechnology|chemistry|disposable|energy|plastic|pollution|polymer|recycle.,2018-07-24T17:49:01.324944,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-24T13:16:40.296639,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/citation/,45bq8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6d2pn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/relationships/node/,6d2pn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b567c7f69e43a000fd658b0/,5b567c7f69e43a000fd658b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45bq8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/45bq8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/45bq8,NA

This has been made possible because of the large amount of online digital data and has spawned many new techniques specifically aimed at analysing very large datasets, often termed Big Data. The quantity of data resulting from digital communication is enormous, and therefore a tempting source of raw material. However, there is also a long tradition of non-digital communication, letter-writing, which shares many of the formal characteristics of digital formats and also constitutes a huge body of data.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-24T17:36:01.403829,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-24T13:15:17.194967,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/citation/,89xbp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bs793/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/relationships/node/,bs793,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b5660d269e43a0010d4dee0/,5b5660d269e43a0010d4dee0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89xbp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/89xbp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/89xbp,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.013
