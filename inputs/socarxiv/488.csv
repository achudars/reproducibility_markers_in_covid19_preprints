In Indonesia, it is seen on the Act of the Minister of Education and Culture No. 109 Year 2013. This issue came from the problems on the availability, accessibility, quality, equality, and guarantee. Further, an effort conducted by the Ministry of Education is developing e-Learning platform at universities. As one of the universities who supports the government policy, the English Department of Universitas Lambung Mangkurat applies for this e-Learning program through the http://elearning.ulm.ac.id. As a result, there is a need to unravel students’ perceptions in the implementation of this policy as one of the ways to see the successful standard and to explore students’ views. Employing qualitative method, this study uncovered the foci of English Department students’ view of the independent assessment, learning outcome, and evaluation of learning English online. Using a validated questionnaire and an interview, the results showed that e-Learning program supports students in learning English. It is seen from their perceptions of the independent assessment that the students gave a good response. On the learning outcome, the students responses were in the category of fair. Meanwhile, on the e-Learning evaluation, the students’ responses were in the fair category. The availability, accessibility, quality, equality, and guarantee problems can be lessened through e-Learning.

This research also tried to verify whether teaching aids activate teaching and learning processes and more specifically if  they make students interactive and effective participants. Moreover, it encourage teachers to update their methods of teaching. A questionnaire is used as an instrument to collect the necessary data. The questionnaire content was  based on items to maximize the benefits of various teaching aids use in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom settings. Twenty teachers and fifty students took part in the questionnaire survey. Findings from the teachers' and students' questionnaires demonstrated that teaching aids help teachers and students activate their teaching and learning processes. Moreover, they help in classroom setting and management. Teachers' attitudes as well as their perception toward using teaching aids to motivate students are positive since they all find the necessity of using them to improve students' English performance. As a result, teachers should be aware that disregarding of teaching aids use impedes learners' motivation.

Although technology nowadays is more and more user friendly and may need no specific training on how to use it, teachers need to possess the knowledge that underpins the idea of using it for teaching and learning process. Teachers need to have solid pedagogical knowledge on how to use the technology to deliver contents to their students. Therefore, a technology-training course for teachers is always necessary. This paper presents the partial results of a design based study/research (DBR) on the development of online technology training for teachers with focus on CALL in Indonesia. Questions regarding factors affecting online CALL course and ways to improve the course in terms of training materials, activities, as well as the administration of the training are addressed in the study. Based on the study, some considerations on how to design such technology-training course are proposed. The considerations are ranging from aspects associated with technology competence for teacher standards, constructivism in online learning, adult learning theory, online instructional models, the technology, pedagogy and content knowledge (TPACK) framework and open educational resources (OER). Information regarding those aspects will be useful to assist other CALL teacher training course developers later to inform their decision in the development of the course which is based on a good theoretical understanding as well as highly practical in learning activities",TRUE,FALSE,OER|online CALL course development|online teacher-training|TPACK,2018-08-04T01:32:01.332325,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:31:34.762468,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/citation/,gs9xk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y2zke/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/relationships/node/,y2zke,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64f99d2ce076001c2d72c6/,5b64f99d2ce076001c2d72c6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gs9xk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gs9xk

With both positive and negative feedback being reported about these systems, it is imperative to further explore users’ attitudes to CAT tools. Given the scarcity of research conducted in this field on the English-Arabic language pair, the present study attempts to examine users’ attitudes to CAT tools among 114 translation students and professional translators in Egypt. The main purpose of the research is to examine user attitudes towards these tools with specific reference to their perceived benefits, ease of use and compatibility. The survey instrument was adapted from Moore and Benbasat with some modifications. Drawing upon Dillon and Fraser’s premises, the research investigates the relationship between user attitudes to CAT tools and various factors, including years of experience, computer skills and type of texts translated. Semi-structured interviews were also used to achieve a mixed-method. The study points to an overall favorable attitude among participants towards using CAT tools, despite some mixed and contradicting opinions on some aspects.

This critical appraisal, which provides the context for the paper, assesses how successfully technology has been viewed in relation to language teaching and learning and how it has developed up to the present day. The focus then moves to social media apps and mobile technology as a contemporary form of CALL.

First year students with a pre-intermediate level of English language proficiency, who were enrolled in the General English Language course, were assigned to work on a SPV project that required them to make a short video related to content learnt in class. There were four main objectives of the SPV project which were: (1) to provide an environment that allows students to grasp a deeper understanding of the topic learnt in class; (2) to enhance English language proficiency as well as creativity and problem-solving skills; (3) to promote the use of Information and communication technology (ICT) in language teaching and learning and (4) to provide a collaborative working environment among students. There were 450 students who participated in this project. A questionnaire on the perceptions of the SPV project was administered to 107 students. It covered three aspects (1) the improvement of students’ English language proficiency and life skills, (2) the use of technological tools and (3) collaboration among peers. Questionnaires results were statistically analyzed and reported in descriptive statistics. Findings indicated that students had positive perceptions toward the SPV projects in all three aspects.

It contributes to the understanding of online learner as an agent in highly heterogeneous language learning contexts and the link between online learning and learner autonomy. The mixed-method design is employed to present data from a Learner Autonomy Questionnaire by Joshi (2011) conducted with 57 participants from three English MOOLCs with a variety of focus as well as a content analysis method was used on the interaction data in the form of open discussion forum posts, which were added by the participants, to create a frame of autonomous learning activities in these MOOLCs and learners’ attitudes towards them. The findings show that the English MOOLC participants are highly autonomous and willing to be more responsible for their own learning. Similarly, the learners’ perception of their own roles indicates a positive inclination towards autonomy. Furthermore, the participants favor the MOOLCs that encourage learner-centered and autonomous language learning practices. Due to the interactive, communicative, and collaborative nature of MOOLCs, learners are advised to develop globalized autonomous skills to participate effectively in such multicultural learning platforms because learner autonomy goes beyond traditional classrooms.",TRUE,FALSE,Connectivist theory|English as a foreign language|language MOOCs|learner autonomy|massive open online language courses,2018-08-04T01:33:40.917116,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:33:16.640862,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/citation/,wv8ay,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8f974/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/relationships/node/,8f974,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64f60e2ce07600192d83cb/,5b64f60e2ce07600192d83cb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wv8ay/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wv8ay/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wv8ay

In some language classes, this is done in the literature component of the curriculum.  However, in many circumstances teachers are not trained on how to integrate critical thinking skills in literature integrated language learning classes. Training teachers nationwide can be costly to a country if the traditional way of in-service training is adopted.  One of the ways to address this problem is by providing online training programmes. A viable alternative platform for online engagement is the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) which has the potential to reach the mass. A training module would have to take into consideration the fact that different schools could be using different literary texts.  Hence, the training module for teachers would need to focus on activities or pedagogical approaches rather than the text itself.  This paper will focus on the aspects to consider when developing a MOOC for this purpose.  This study will focus on Malaysian teachers who are expected to integrate HOTS into their literature lessons. When developing the materials, two important aspects that need to be considered are the components of HOTS and also the approaches that can be adopted.  This paper discusses the approaches that can be applied to develop a specific aspect of HOTS.  It focuses on the Malaysian teachers who are expected to integrate HOTS into their literature lessons.",TRUE,FALSE,fiction|higher order thinking skills|HOTS|literature|MOOC|pedagogy,2018-08-04T05:01:44.599661,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:33:26.855097,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/citation/,xp2f3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pn9rs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/relationships/node/,pn9rs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64f46b7e433e001603a2c4/,5b64f46b7e433e001603a2c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp2f3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xp2f3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xp2f3

It is an explicatory study based on the main findings of researchers in the field and the practical involvement and observation of the researcher as an ESL/EFL teacher in writing classrooms. The scientific literature on the subject as well as the analytical work done on it have been critically examined for efficacy and proof. The study also investigates the usefulness of the various CALL-based materials and tools employed in the teaching process, and it examines how far they can help students in their classroom practices. The major outcomes of the study demonstrated that most teachers and students have found that CALL has helped them in a positive way, has motivated them to learn ESL/EFL writing, and has improved their knowledge and capability in writing English effortlessly. It has also been discovered that this method of teaching writing enriches their information and plays an important role in developing their academic skills. The current study, therefore, recommends that students should use computers in learning English writing, in particular, in order to increase the level of learning.",TRUE,FALSE,CALL|computer assisted language learning|English language teachers/learners|ESL/EFL English writing|technology integration,2018-08-04T01:29:04.965122,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:28:38.665919,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/citation/,z35t8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qa23n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/relationships/node/,qa23n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64f36e2ce076001a2d7190/,5b64f36e2ce076001a2d7190,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z35t8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z35t8/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z35t8
