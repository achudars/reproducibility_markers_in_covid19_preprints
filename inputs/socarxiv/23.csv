In the last years, researchers have started to apply PSI on videogame streaming environments, where the audience can interact with the observed media persona and get immediate feedback on their messages and requests. In a 3×2 online experiment (N = 251), we manipulated how a streamer addressed participants (individual vs. collective vs. no addressing) and whether he paid attention to and answered messages in the chat (attention vs. no attention to the chat). Findings show that the more individually participants were addressed and whether the streamer reacted to messages in the chat affected experiences of PSI. Further, alongside their overall enjoyment, PSI predicted viewers’ commitment to social norms. We discuss these findings regarding their implications for the conceptualization of PSI in light of interactive novel technologies.",TRUE,FALSE,"commitment to social norms|enjoyment|opencomm|parasocial interaction|Twitch|videogame streaming,",2021-01-31T01:01:07.811422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-31T01:00:51.142577,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/jwxdz/,available,NA,https://aspredicted.org/pt8kj.pdf,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/citation/,cfds9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jwxdz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/relationships/node/,jwxdz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60144637dd2225033958962c/,60144637dd2225033958962c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfds9/,https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0546,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfds9

Comparing samples across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the population’s activities, locations and social interactions, which may be interpreted as direct responses to changes in regulations. One of our main motivations was to compare risk-related behavior across the first and second lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence that the second lockdown (recorded late November 2020) was less strictly adhered to than the first (recorded May-June 2020).  Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown.

Theoretical studies and economic experiments predict that without enforcement mechanisms, cooperation in public goods games should collapse. But human societies have repeatedly resolved collective action dilemmas through social norms and institutions. Humans condition their social behavior on the moral reputations of other individuals, and the reputations themselves reflect their past behavior. Here I show how Indirect Reciprocity mechanisms based on group reputations and group-level norms can evolve to promote collective action in public goods games. Individual reputations reflect moral judgments of social behavior within groups, according to the prevailing social norm. Only three norms previously studied as part of Indirect Reciprocity in pairwise games can sustain public goods investments, and their performance depends on how tolerant individuals are to occasional antisocial behavior within groups. When members of the society have predominantly tolerant moral views towards groups, only the norm that abstains from judgment in morally ambiguous interactions (known as Staying) can sustain collective action.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-31T00:56:44.196621,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-31T00:56:31.626468,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/citation/,k2wgj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m9t5p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/relationships/node/,m9t5p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60142c9075226b051551647e/,60142c9075226b051551647e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2wgj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k2wgj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k2wgj

Common examples are described among ants, bees, and other insects. The US defenses against SARS-CoV-2 were weakened by malformations in the information ecosystem that disrupted the dissemination of information while spreading misinformation and disinformation. Distortions arising from political corruption, and magnified by social media platforms, were especially consequential.

By scrutinizing the spatial demarcation between the “upper” and “lower” parts of the Syntagma Square occupation, one can think more carefully about the conditions of possibility for the emergence of the radical imagination.",TRUE,FALSE,Athens|austerity|crisis|neoliberalism|Occupy|radical imagination|social movements|space,2021-01-28T22:50:43.860788,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-28T22:50:20.077788,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,Dimitris Soudias,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/citation/,bpg9j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60132028c5784b02f2d0d34c/,60132028c5784b02f2d0d34c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpg9j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bpg9j/,https://doi.org/10.3167/cont.2020.080103,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bpg9j

Such approaches to policy analysis have been caught up in the same crisis as the social sciences have in general: an overarching failure to create a predictive science of society or to consistently provide solutions to social problems. This has led some policy researchers to align with the interpretivist turn, which has had its own drawbacks. In this review I summarize the historical development and main tenets of both approaches, examining their advantages and disadvantages. I then review an alternative epistemological approach to social science, critical realism, which combines an ontological realism with an epistemological relativism, a focus on elucidating causal mechanisms in the social-ecological systems studied, an approach that may be particularly suited for analyzing the complex social-ecological systems studied in environmental policy analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,critical realism|environmental policy|epistemology|policy theory,2021-01-28T20:04:03.320294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-28T20:03:42.353227,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/citation/,u8hgk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6013160a75226b04af51b266/,6013160a75226b04af51b266,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8hgk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u8hgk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u8hgk

Institutionalized Public Preferences and Pandemic Policy Feedback in 32 Countries,"The Novel Coronavirus Pandemic provides a unique opportunity to test theories of policy feedback in times of national emergency. An important question in this field is whether the discrepancy between public attitudes and emergency rules makes ordinary citizens less likely to comply, which in turn can undermine the goals of that national emergency policies such as the recent lockdown. In this study, we first compare 2016 institutionalized non-Covid related public preferences for government intervention to government actions taken at the outbreak of this pandemic in early March 2020 across 32 middle to high income countries, using aggregated data from the International Social Survey Program and country-level Blavatnik Coronavirus Government Response Tracker data. Then, we use the relative discrepancy between them to predict public behaviors shortly after the initial outbreak in late-March into early April using the Measuring Worldwide COVID-19 Attitudes and Beliefs survey. We find no association between public preferences and government response at the outbreak; however, we find some tentative evidence that the discrepancy between them shows a relationship with public behaviors in the subsequent stage, after adjusting for the local severity of the outbreak and the current level of government intervention. Where the government took much stronger interventions in the outbreak stage relative to public preferences for non-Covid government interventions, the public were more likely to engage in risky social behaviors, such as going out when asked not to, attending social gatherings, or not keeping a safe distance from others. In contrast, where the government took weaker measures, the public were instead more likely to avoid risky social behaviors. Although we cannot conclude whether this means that the enforced measures were more or less effective, our results may suggest that governments took stronger measures in countries where they expected more risky behaviors and that there may be a tradeoff between institutionalized public preferences and the ability to curtail social behaviours.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|government intervention|policy feedback|public behaviors|public opinion.|public policy|public preferences,2021-01-28T17:26:43.331034,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-28T15:34:40.315739,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/hungnguyen167/SPR33-COVID,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/citation/,7swqe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6012d6a0dd2225029958d442/,6012d6a0dd2225029958d442,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7swqe/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7swqe
