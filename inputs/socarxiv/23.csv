Much prior research has pointed to widening education differences in a wide array of family patterns, but none has examined trends in the number of years women spend as mothers of young children. We use retrospective fertility data from the 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation to show how changes in women’s completed fertility and birth spacing produce trends in years women spend as mothers of children under age six from 1967 to 2017. Despite remarkably parallel declines in completed fertility, growing educational differences in birth spacing produced educational divergence in years spent as mothers of young children. Particularly striking is the finding that increases in birth spacing reversed declines in years spent as mothers for women with less than a high school degree such that they spent more years with young children in the 2010s than in the late 1960s. The increasing prevalence of multiple partner fertility explains some but not all of these trends.",TRUE,FALSE,Birth Spacing|Family Structure|Fertility|Motherhood|Multiple Partner Fertility,2021-04-27T08:00:04.080799,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-27T07:57:42.808916,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/data/datasets.2014.html,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/citation/,eztn7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7tzyw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/relationships/node/,7tzyw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6086f49f7166fa0128e91d5e/,6086f49f7166fa0128e91d5e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eztn7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eztn7/,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48519-1_10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eztn7

However, beyond specific policies, there is limited empirical investigation into the consequences of the changing political context on population health in the United States. We examine a salient political factor—the party of the president and governor—as a determinant of infant health between 1971 and 2018 using a battery of fixed-effects models. We focus on infant health because it has far-reaching implications for future population health and inequality. Our analysis yields three findings: (1) Democratic presidents have a beneficial effect on infant health outcomes, with stronger effects for Black infants compared to White infants. (2) The president’s party effect materializes after two years of a Democratic transition and remains elevated until the end of the party’s tenure in office. (3) Specific measurable social policies appear to play a minor role in explaining the beneficial effect of Democratic administrations. Our findings suggest the party in power is an important determinant of infant health, particularly among vulnerable populations, and they invite a deeper examination of mechanisms.",TRUE,FALSE,infant health|political party|president|racial disparities|social determinants of health,2021-04-27T07:58:22.438424,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-27T07:57:02.514248,FALSE,NA,no,Restricted access data are used.

Italy was one of the countries most affected by both the pandemic and the related infodemic. The success of anti-COVID-19 strategies and future public health policies in Italy cannot prescind from containment of fake news and divulgation of correct information.
Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on conspiracy attitudes and risk perception of Italian web users.
Methods: Google Trends was used to monitor users' web interest in specific topics, such as conspiracy hypotheses, vaccine side effects, and pollution/climate change. The keywords adopted to represent these topics were mined from Bufale.net – an Italian website specialized in detecting online hoaxes – and Google Trends suggestions (i.e., related topics and related queries). Relative search volumes of the timelapse 2016-2020 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020-2021 (post-COVID-19) were compared through percentage difference (∆_%) and Welch’s t-test (t). When data series were not stationary, other ad-hoc criteria were used. The trend slopes were assessed through Sen's Slope (SS). The significance thresholds have been indicatively set at P=.05 and t=1.9.
Results: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically enforced Italian netizens' conspiracy attitudes (Δ_%∈[60,288],t∈[6,12]). The regional web interest towards conspiracy-related queries has increased and become more homogeneous compared to the pre-COVID-19 period ((RSV) ̅=80±2.8,t_min=1.8,Δ_(min%)=+12.4,min ∆_(SD%)=-25.8). Besides, a growing trend in web interest in the infodemic YouTube channel ""ByoBlu"" has been highlighted. The web interest in fake news has increased more than that in anti-hoax services (t_1=11.3  vs  t_2=4.5,Δ_1=+157.6  vs  Δ_2=+84.7). Equivalently, the web interest in vaccine side effects exceeded that in pollution/climate change (SS_vac=0.22,P&lt;.001  vs  SS_pol=0.05,P&lt;.001,∆_%=+296.4).
Conclusions: COVID-19 has given a significant boost to online conspiracy attitudes in Italy. In particular, the average web interest in conspiracy hypotheses has increased and become more uniform across regions. The pandemic accelerated an already growing trend in users' interest towards some fake news sources, including the 500,000 subscribers YouTube channel ""ByoBlu"" (canceled for disinformation in March 2021). The risk perception related to COVID-19 vaccines has been so distorted that vaccine side effects-related queries outweighed those relating to pollution and climate change, which are much more urgent issues. Based on these findings, it is necessary that the Italian authorities implement more effective infoveillance systems and communication by the mass media is less sensationalistic and more consistent with the available scientific evidence. In this context, Google Trends can be used to monitor the users' response to specific infodemiological countermeasures. Further research is needed to understand the psychological mechanisms that regulate risk perception

In Turkey, educational inspection is carried out by the Educational Inspectors of the Ministry of National Education. On the other hand, educational inspection in the UK is carried out by Ofsted education inspectors. In both countries, it is compulsory to prepare an inspection report at the conclusion of an inspection, which sheds light on and evaluates the activities carried out at the school. The inspection reports are the subject of this study in terms of both form and content. The qualitative research method was used in the study and a document analysis was carried out. In this context, 10 inspection reports from both Turkey and the United Kingdom each were subjected to the inspection report review. A code was assigned to each inspection report.

In 1999, the Ministry of Education reformed and decentralized the Thai educational system with the National Education Act B.E. 2542 (A.D. 1999). In 2001, the Ministry of Education issued an English Program Policy allowing qualified schools to teach certain subjects under the Basic Education Curriculum in English as an alternative mode of instruction. This mixed method research investigated the implementation of the English Program Policy of three Secondary Schools under the Secondary Educational Service Area Office 7. Instruments used was opinionnaire surveys adopted from the Office of Basic Education Council (OBEC) English Program Educational Standard Educational Institution Self-Assessment Questionnaire and the English Program/ Mini English Program Implementation Student Questionnaire and selected validated questions from studies by Chantarasiri, and Senachit. Respondents were administrators from the Secondary Educational Service Area 7 Office and from the three selected schools with English Program, and teachers and students from the mentioned schools. The data analysis from this study showed that the level of implementation of the English Policy among administrator was Very High, while the level of implementation among students was High. There was no significant difference in the level of implementation among administrators and teachers, and the study found no significant difference in the level of implementation among teachers when compared by the number of years in the position.",TRUE,FALSE,English Program|Public Policy Implementation,2021-04-25T23:59:07.208258,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-25T23:58:42.467183,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/citation/,9uvpf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60851dab7166fa0083e92de8/,60851dab7166fa0083e92de8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uvpf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9uvpf/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.02.209,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9uvpf

While most of these have focused on provision of tangible and intangible resources, the understanding about processes and routines that transform these resources into capabilities, which ultimately translate into successful start-up emergence has been lacking. Based on the resource-based view and the dynamic capabilities approach and using the cases of two academic incubators in India (Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and National Chemical Laboratory, Pune), this paper analyses the pre-incubation level processes that have resulted in their enhanced opportunity recognition potential. This study adds to the literature in the area of dynamic capabilities in the context of academic incubation.  The study has important implications for both incubation setups as well as policy makers.",TRUE,FALSE,entrepreneurial ecosystem|incubation|india|startup emergence,2021-04-28T10:49:43.342769,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T10:44:26.190597,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Kshitija Joshi|Krishna Satyanarayana|Muralidharan Loganathan,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/citation/,uevnj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/swmp5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/relationships/node/,swmp5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60843512a9746600572f5f3f/,60843512a9746600572f5f3f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uevnj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uevnj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uevnj

The study focuses on the acceptability, affordability, accessibility and awareness of Menstrual Cups amongst Indian women in the menstruating age. An assessment of the Knowledge, Aptitude, Practice and Behaviour (KAPB) of Menstrual Cups was done. The sampled data received from various parts of the country, after exclusions, included 397 responses. The average age of the respondents was 24 years where most of them were students and were from urban dwelling. From the results, it was inferred that menstrual cups users were in favour with their experiences with 79% reporting menstrual cups to be comfortable and 82% of the users found menstrual cups to be cheaper compared to other menstrual products, 61% of the users reported menstrual cups to be easy to adapt. For monthly expenditure of sanitary products, menstrual cups were more cost efficient as users spent an average of Rs 0-100 in comparison to other Sanitary Products where users spent an average of Rs 100-300. Disposable Sanitary pads was the most used sanitary product by non-menstrual cup users. 29.6% of the respondents are willing to switch to menstrual cups and 45.4% of the respondents are not sure if they want to switch to menstrual cups. The reasons for non-usage of menstrual cups was mostly comfort (32%), limited knowledge (25%) and accessibility (15%). Homemakers scored high on Practice and Behaviour questions while Business women scored high on Knowledge and Aptitude questions. Both users and non-users recommended conducting awareness drives in the form of seminars focusing on clarifying myths and taboos related to menstrual cups.
