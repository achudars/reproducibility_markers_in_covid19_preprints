It contrasts critical psychology with mainstream psychology in general terms, before introducing a critical psychological perspective on climate change. Central to this perspective is a critique of the framing of individual behaviour change as the problem and solution to climate change in mainstream psychology, and a related emphasis on identifying ‘barriers’ to pro-environmental behaviour. This framework is argued to be reductive, obscuring or downplaying the influence of a range of factors in shaping predominant responses to climate change to date, including social context, discourse, power and affect. Currently, critical psychologies set out to study the relative contribution of these factors to (in)action on climate change. A related concern is how the psychological and emotional impacts of climate change impact unevenly on communities and individuals, depending on place-based, economic, geographic and cultural differences, and giving rises to experiences of injustice, inequality and disempowerment. Critical psychology does not assume these to be overriding or inevitable psychological and social responses, however. Critical psychologies also undertake research and inform interventions that highlight the role of collective understanding, activism, empowerment and resistance as the necessary foundations of a genuine shift towards sustainable societies.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|climate crisis|community psychology|critical psychology|eco-anxiety|emotion|environmental justice|liberation psychology|psychology|resistance,2021-02-10T18:24:23.298069,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:23:45.658510,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,Elsevier,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/citation/,sbvpd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6023e87f73c9fe00f9076a36/,6023e87f73c9fe00f9076a36,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sbvpd/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2021.01.007,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sbvpd

There is a widely held view that governmental bureaucracy with its laws, regulations, institutions, and `red tape' is unable to keep up with a rapidly changing and digitizing society. It is now often claimed that the solution is for governments to become agile. Along these lines, the resulting discourse on `agile government' posits that government is not agile now, but it could be, and if it were agile then government would be more e?ective, adaptive, and, thus, normatively better.

At the same time, the reduction in travel activity led to an immediate and unprecedented reduction of global carbon emissions. Many academics argue that the tourism industry should be rebuilt in a more sustainable way post-COVID-19. Based on the sociological theory on response to disruption, the present study provides initial empirical evidence that long-lasting environmental benefits are unlikely to result from the pandemic. Recovery guidelines issued by the UNWTO and six member-based industry associations from different geographical locations and representing different types of tourism businesses form the basis of the empirical analysis. Member-based industry associations represent key information brokers during the pandemic; they convey information and advice to their member businesses. The result of the content analysis indicates the dominant impact of normative expectations, which exclusively focus on re-establishing the pre-COVID-19 status. While there is little indication that cognitive expectations – which view the pandemic as an opportunity to transform business operations to be more environmentally sustainable – will be leveraged.

While declines in affordability from 1990-2016 were universal between rural and urban counties, population growth is associated with decreases in affordability in rural counties but increased affordability in large metros counties due to estimated decreases in housing costs. Population aging is estimated to improve affordability in large and small metro counties, despite the associated decrease in income and housing costs across all county types.

The baseline scenario formalizes the current Italian tariff scheme, while the intervention scenario includes users' response to a gainsharing policy.

We focus on the allocation aspect of this choice in an iterated game played on bipartite networks of agents and common-pool resources (CPRs) that degrade linearly in quality as extraction increases. When CPR users attempt to reallocate their extraction efforts among resources to maximize
their own payoffs in the very next round (that is, myopically), collective wealth is increased. Using a heterogeneous mean-field approach, we estimate how these reallocations affect the payoffs of CPR users of different degrees within networks having different levels of degree heterogeneity. Focusing specifically on Nash equilibrium initial conditions, which represent the patterns of over-exploitation that result from rational extraction, we find that networks with greater heterogeneity among CPR
degrees show greater improvements over equilibrium due to reallocation. When the marginal utility of extraction diminishes, these reallocations also reduce wealth inequality. These findings emphasize that CPR users’ adaptive reallocations of effort—a behavior that previously-studied network evolutionary game models typically disallow by construction—can serve to direct individuals’ self interest toward the collective good.",TRUE,FALSE,common-pool resources|evolutionary games|networks|resource allocation,2021-02-10T18:33:21.975008,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:32:20.413354,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,Andrew Schauf and Poong Oh,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/citation/,w2cxp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2sbz8/,2sbz8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6022b3f4232383007b9d7503/,6022b3f4232383007b9d7503,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w2cxp/,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79514-5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w2cxp

U.S. households and trace the importance of household wealth in helping families experiencing these events avoid entering a spell of material hardship. Using longitudinal data from two panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we draw on direct measures of material hardship, disruptive events, and household assets. Regression and decomposition analyses reveal that the relationship between disruptive events and the likelihood of experiencing a new spell of material hardship strongly varies across the wealth distribution, suggesting that high household wealth provides an effective private safety net. By distinguishing different types of disruptive events, we also demonstrate that divorce, disability, and income instability entail the risk of falling into material hardship but also that this risk is effectively buffered by substantial wealth. Different types of hardship – namely, financial, food, and medical hardship – respond in similar ways.
Like public insurance schemes, wealth insurance helps buffer the effects of disruptive events on material hardship, but unlike public insurance schemes, reliance on private wealth further stratifies the economic well-being of households. Policy options for addressing this highly stratified private insurance scheme includes disposing of the need for it by funding a more robust public insurance, for instance through wealth taxation.",TRUE,FALSE,hardship|inequality|wealth,2021-02-10T18:19:03.765871,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:18:39.080201,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp.html,no,"Please direct correspondence to Richard Rodems, University of Michigan, 426 Thompson Street, Institute for Social Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104, rodems@umich.edu.

Building on research on political trust as related to regime legitimacy and on the evaluative nature of political trust, we formulate hypotheses about the effect of political trust on democracy and of democracy on political trust, both with regard to overall levels of trust in societies, as well as trust by education and age groups. We test these hypotheses with cross-lagged models applied to country time series of political trust from 26 European countries between 1991 and 2019, and with two democracy indicators, from the Varieties of Democracy and the Democracy Barometer projects. We find evidence of effects of democracy on trust and vice versa, as well as of differences in the effects of democracy on political trust among different education and age groups. The results are sensitive to the choice of the democracy indicator as well as the lag length, which points to the need of examining different reasonable combinations of indicators and nags in this kind of analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,brms|democracy|Democracy Barometer|political trust|Varieties of Democracy,2021-02-09T15:51:04.769690,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-09T15:45:09.583458,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/chx6a/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/citation/,79dth,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/chx6a/,chx6a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602285c6d6a4320054f1516a/,602285c6d6a4320054f1516a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79dth/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/79dth/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/79dth
