	Beliefs that sport participation inherently leads to personal development and social capital benefits have been termed the Great Sport Myth (Coakley, 2015). The purpose of this study was to examine the extent that U.S. adults embrace the Great Sport Myth and the potential influence that their primary groups, social stratification indicators, and sport experiences have had on their beliefs in the personal development and social capital benefits of sport. Data was collected through a large national U.S. survey, the National Sports and Society Survey, and analyzed with multiple regression analyses. Findings suggest that most Americans endorse the Great Sport Myth. Furthermore, primary groups, stratification indicators, and positive sport experiences appear to consistently shape beliefs in the Great Sport Myth.",TRUE,FALSE,development through sport|sport involvement|sports values,2020-10-24T15:53:02.497512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-24T15:52:47.039393,FALSE,NA,no,"Codebook/data not prepped for public release, yet.

capitalism systems and their levels of income and
compositional inequality (how the composition of
income between capital and labor varies along income
distribution). Capitalism may be seen to range between
Classical Capitalism, where the rich have only capital
income, and the rest have only labor income, and
Liberal Capitalism, where many people receive both
capital and labor incomes. Using a new methodology
and data from 47 countries over the past 25 years, we
show that higher compositional inequality is associated
with higher inter-personal inequality. Nordic countries
are exceptional because they combine high
compositional inequality with low inter-personal
inequality. We speculate on the emergence of
homoploutic societies where income composition may
be the same for all, but Gini inequality nonetheless
high, and introduce a new taxonomy of capitalist
societies.

However, little research has been conducted on how schools and different factors in the school context shape gender differences in adolescents’ LS and how this varies across countries. I investigate this question by conducting a series of statistical analyses using PISA 2015 data on 15-year-old students in 33 countries. Results indicate that girls report lower LS than boys on average in all the countries studied. Moreover, although school is a life domain where experiences which relate to LS tend to be more negative among boys than among girls (mainly via bullying and relationships with teachers), the opposite is observed for a few school-related factors (notably school anxiety). Furthermore, in some countries, the gender gap in LS varies across schools, which suggests that schools may play an important role in influencing students’ LS in different ways for girls and boys.

We find that EU-member populations support the EU- values strongly and increasingly over time, especially in individual freedoms and gender equality. Regarding support for these values, EU-member populations are notably distinct from non-EU populations. Simultaneously, however, EU-member populations are internalizing the EU-values at different speeds—alongside traditional cultural fault lines that continue to differentiate Europe—in the following order from fastest to slowest internalization: (1) Protestant, (2) Catholic, (3) Ex-communist and lastly (4) Orthodox countries.

Results indicate that generalised reductions in total fertility rate were slowed down for municipalities traditionally affected by conflict as a result of the permanent ceasefire declared by the FARC insurgency. Total fertility rate observed a relative increase of 2.6% in the formerly conflict-affected areas, in all age groups. However, no impact was found for demand of health care services, neonatal and infant mortality rates, or birth outcomes such as the incidence of low weight at birth or the percentage of preterm births. Our evidence shows that municipalities with mines victims and expelled population by forced displacement before the ceasefire have significantly higher total fertility rate in the four years following the ceasefire.

Third, building upon this background, we outline the main elements of our proposed model, with special attention to elaborating the value of its key conceptual innovation, the “formeme.” Last, we conclude with a discussion of what types of research commitments the overall approach does or does not imply, and point toward the more formal elaboration of the model that we undertake in “Towards a Model of Urban Evolution II” and “Towards a Model of Urban Evo-lution III.”",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-22T01:18:40.765217,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-22T01:18:30.632985,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/citation/,yubkr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f90845629d10e0018a038f5/,5f90845629d10e0018a038f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yubkr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yubkr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yubkr

Does envy of the rich (the desire to ""chop the top""), matter to these evaluations, even above and beyond other well-known influences? We explore this issue by extending a standard model of social-structural and political influences on inequality aversion/ desire to reduce income inequality to include  self-reported income envy (and including perceived self-interest as a control variable).  Key findings: (1) Envy of the rich has a moderately strong relationship with seeing the current income distribution as too unequal: The total effect of envy on inequality aversion is positive and moderately strong.  (2) This effect persists unchanged after taking family political and stratification background, demographics, and current social class/stratification position into account. (3) It persists when we also control perceived economic self-interest in inequality reduction. (4) Part of the effect is indirect through political party preference, but the direct effect of envy remains moderately important even when party is taken into account (5) The effect is strong among Republicans, but absent among Democrats. Data and methods: Data are from the International Social Science Survey  Round 20, USA 2016-2017, a representative US national sample (N=1,778 in the main wave and 2496 in two developmental waves). Methods include descriptive statistics; CFA for scale construction; OLS and multilevel regression analysis; and SEM to check causal issues. Theoretical implications: Attitude towards income inequality, also called inequality aversion or norm on income inequality, is the offspring of many parents; envy is one of the generative influences, in addition to structural and political roots of public opinion and policy-relevant attitudes. Support for redistribution, therefore, encompasses not only a desire for social cohesion through mechanical solidarity based on equality of condition, not only a self-interested desire to reap some of the redistributed riches, not only a fixed political commitment to this goal, but also an envy component, specifically among people on the right of politics.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes towards redistribution|envy|equality|equity|income inequality norms|inequality attitudes|inequality aversion|partisanship|political party affiliation|poor|rich|social structure,2020-10-22T01:19:46.045637,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-22T01:19:14.247044,FALSE,NA,no,The data are survey data described in the paper.

Review of previous studies reveals that measures of effectiveness and techniques for evaluation vary widely, and often provide cursory reporting of the immediate outputs of involvement efforts, rather than system outcomes related to public participation. Interviews and government documents from three detailed cases in the United States transportation planning suggest that complexity, perceived subjectivity and an extended period of project development creates challenges for performance measurement of public participation. To demonstrate use of the logic model approach for evaluation of public participation, the research team performed three case studies that separate broad phases of projects into context, implementation, and results. This phased approach supports the identification of performance measures that may address immediate outputs of a public participation processes, in addition to intermediate and later outcomes related to public participation. Results from the multiple case studies suggest that performance measures are more likely to be sustained and impactful when devised for simplicity, supported by an agency champion, and resources are in place for institutionalization of the process as part of agency operations. The logic model approach clarifies that performance targets should be tailored by an organization to address a particular phase of the project development process.",TRUE,FALSE,logic modeling|multiple case study|performance measurement|public participation,2020-10-22T01:20:17.694250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-22T01:19:52.799387,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.tn.gov/tdot/long-range-planning-home/25-year-transportation-policy-plan.html|https://www.planbayarea.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Evaluation_Report_PBA_Outreach.pdf,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/citation/,gjr9h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f905ae7b11ee900e45a817c/,5f905ae7b11ee900e45a817c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gjr9h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gjr9h
