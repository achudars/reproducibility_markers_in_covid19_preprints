Recent research suggests there may be a motivational component to these behaviors. The present study examines whether time-related academic behavior is stable across time and context, and the degree to which change is predicted by contextual and motivational factors. The sample was comprised of 453 undergraduate college students at a large public university in the Midwestern U.S. We found that time-related academic behaviors were not stable, and changes in those behaviors were most closely linked to changes in self-efficacy, self-regulation, and mastery-approach achievement goals.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.724237,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:51:46.174201,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Educational Psychology,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/citation/,qnj5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5ywtv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/relationships/node/,5ywtv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d22db42121000c1633d8/,5a26d22db42121000c1633d8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnj5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qnj5x/,https://doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2017.1384535,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qnj5x

Guided by an open-systems perspective and functional (Ballantine &amp; Roberts, 2007) and expectancy-value (Eccles, 2005; Eccles, 2007) theories, we focused on school related socialization processes and the role of parents and teachers in shaping children’s abilities and skills. Participants included 153 children from 23 rural, Oklahoma schools and provided matched sets of parent, teacher, and child surveys. Weisgram and Bigler’s (2006) science self-efficacy subscale organized survey items where wording changes allowed parallel parent and teacher versions of the scale. Achievement was determined by test scores on the state-administered Oklahoma Core Curriculum Tests (OCCT). Results showed teachers’ expectancy for children’s success in science did not significantly predict students’ fifth grade science achievement. However, regression analyses showed parents’ expectancy did predict students’ fifth grade science achievement. The relationship was statistically significant and explained about 19% of the variance in fifth grade science achievement test scores (R2 = .19). We further determined that children’s science self-efficacy significantly influenced science achievement scores (β = .20) (however this was a far weaker influence than the direct effect of parents’ expectancy (β = .38) of children’s success in science). The novel finding is that parents have an influence on children’s achievement over and above children’s own self-efficacy beliefs about science. Clearly, parents matter when it comes to science achievement. Though it seems parents are more influential than teachers when it comes to children’s own expectations and achievement success in elementary science, we encourage further consideration of parent expectancy as it relates to child ability and achievement, modified classroom strategies, and home-school relations to better align teachers’ positive influence on children’s expectancy for success.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.685583,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:52:26.142454,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Journal of Research on Science Teaching,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/citation/,p6na5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8gu4b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/relationships/node/,8gu4b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d171b42121000c163319/,5a26d171b42121000c163319,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p6na5/,https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21382,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p6na5

In the present study, a multi-staged experiment was undertaken to expand the work in implicit racial
bias by using a similar research design focused on sexual orientation. We attempted to elicit sexual orientation identification one-word changes (wife, partner, or husband to refer to significant other) in graduate school admission essays and investigated differences in
participants’ ratings of those essays on a number of relevant dimensions. Results indicate that essays referring to a partner or husband were perceived as more feminine/less masculine and more gay/less straight versus those referring to a wife. We also found that the essays mentioning the partner or husband were rated as being a poorer “fit” to the university versus those referring
to a wife.

Ross, Canada, and Rausch (2002) in predicting self-handicapping from conscientiousness and
neuroticism, and 2) extend on those findings by cross-validating the prediction equation in a

psychological and academic impacts on students. However, the traditional view of
procrastination as a unidimensional construct is insufficient in two regards. First, the construct
needs to be viewed more broadly as time-related academic behavior, encompassing both
procrastination and timely engagement. Secondly, the underlying motivation of these behaviors
needs to be considered. Therefore, we developed and validated a 2×2 model of time-related
academic behavior. The results of a confirmatory factor analysis supported a four-factor
structure, and correlation with a unidimensional measure of procrastination also supported this
model. Furthermore, the 2×2 model demonstrated significantly better fit to the data than
potentially competing models. Structural equation modeling with achievement goals revealed
that the 2×2 model unveiled relationships previously obscured in the traditional model, including
that procrastination appeared to be used as a performance-enhancing strategy, while timely
engagement was used to enhance mastery. The theoretical and practical implications of these
new relationships are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.461721,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:56:18.192042,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Learning and Individual Differences,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/citation/,6yrdx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3fnqe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/relationships/node/,3fnqe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26ce0d86b219000f8ae967/,5a26ce0d86b219000f8ae967,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6yrdx/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2013.02.007,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6yrdx

The emergent viewpoints seem to suggest that a more nuanced understanding of learning occurs within-person.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.425469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:55:47.386768,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Academic Exchange Quarterly,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/citation/,u48hm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dx6jb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/relationships/node/,dx6jb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26cdb1b42121000c162f45/,5a26cdb1b42121000c162f45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u48hm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u48hm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u48hm
