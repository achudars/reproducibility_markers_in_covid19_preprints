attention on two doctrines that provide immunity from antitrust liability
for certain anticompetitive activity: the state action doctrine and the
petitioning immunity doctrine (sometimes known as the Noerr-Pennington
doctrine, after the two cases that established it). These doctrines have
been the subject of seven Supreme Court decisions in as many years. In
spite of (or perhaps because of) the Court’s numerous recent decisions,
there remains a great deal of confusion about the source and the scope of
these doctrines. This Article attempts to clarify both doctrines.

The Supreme Court and a number of commentators contend that the antitrust
immunity doctrines are the product of statutory interpretation of the
antitrust laws themselves. The Court contends that petitioning and state
action are “essentially dissimilar” to the types of business activity the
antitrust laws were designed to regulate. This Article disagrees. Both
petitioning and state action present precisely the sorts of problems with
which the antitrust laws are concerned — exploitation of consumers through
the charging of supracompetitive prices.

To determine the source of antitrust immunity, the Court must look beyond
the antitrust laws to the constitutional principles that are implicated by
the doctrines. For the state action doctrine, the constitutional principle
at stake is largely one of federalism, and the more general democratic
principles embodied in the Court’s non-delegation jurisprudence. For the
petitioning immunity doctrine, the First Amendment protection of speech and
petitioning provides the relevant principles. After examining the source of
the antitrust immunity doctrines, this Article considers the appropriate
scope of those doctrines in light of the constitutional principles at issue.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:33.042559,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-02T23:01:23.752000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/citation/,9fc3a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9u63f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/relationships/node/,9u63f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57ca04c76c613b01eb24a903/,57ca04c76c613b01eb24a903,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9fc3a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9fc3a

computer software has shifted from copyright to patent. We argue that one
unanticipated effect of this trend may be to encourage software reuse.
Traditionally, computer programmers have reinvented software components,
coding programs from scratch each time a new one is desired rather than
buying and reusing existing components. This process is inefficient, and is
in stark contrast to the normal practice in other engineering disciplines.
We argue that copyright law encourages reinvention and discourages the
development of a market for tradeable software components because it allows
competitors to appropriate the value of a new software invention without
payment to the original developer of that invention, but forbids
competitors from copying the computer code implementing that invention. The
result is that competitors take inventions from others, but write their own
code to implement those inventions. By contrast, patent law gives strong
protection to inventions, forcing competitors to license the patent in
order to make any product incorporating the idea. It is reasonable to
expect that one effect of increasing reliance on patent law will be an
increase in licenses of both the patented idea and the implementing code.
This licensing should in turn pave the way for the trading and reuse of
software components.

The patent misuse doctrine is an equitable remedy analogous to the “unclean
hands” doctrine in tort law. It bars infringement suits by patentees who
have “misused” their patent grant, either by using the patent to violate
the antitrust laws or by extending their patent monopoly in some other way.
The author first describes the nature and scope of antitrust protection in
the patent area, and contrasts the antitrust laws with the patent misuse
doctrine. Next, the author argues that the patent misuse doctrine is
irrational from an economic standpoint for three reasons: the level of
sanction is unrelated to the injury caused; the sanction duplicates
antitrust remedies, leading to excessive recoveries; and the sanction is
awarded as a windfall to the patent infringer even if that party was not
injured by the misuse. These effects combine to make the patent misuse
doctrine indefensible from the standpoint either of proportionality or of
deterrence. Finally, the author reviews recent legislative efforts to
reform the patent misuse doctrine and argues that they are misguided
because they fail to deal with the fundamental problems described herein.
The author concludes that the patent misuse doctrine ought to be abolished,
and that the antitrust laws can serve the same purposes that the patent
misuse doctrine was designed to serve.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:11.427494,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-02T20:38:43.053000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/citation/,tyf6h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fxss8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/relationships/node/,fxss8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c9e3576c613b01eaedbadb/,57c9e3576c613b01eaedbadb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tyf6h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tyf6h

courts, particularly in the Ninth Circuit, have also turned eBay from a set
of guidelines for case-by-case analysis of the equities of an injunction
into a hard-and-fast set of requirements for injunctive relief.

eBay should apply to trademark cases. But it must be applied with
sensitivity to the very different contexts of patent and trademark. Doing
so will make it more likely that trademark owners will obtain injunctions

moral valences of contemporary, automated, finance. In this paper, I study
spoofing as an opportunity to understand markets and their relations of
exchange. In particular, by extending Weberian metaphors of markets as
moral and organizational communities, I examine how the courts and market
participants distinguish the ‘false’ transactions of spoofing from the
‘real’ exchanges of 'normal' market behavior. Combining Marilyn Strathern’s
theoretical discussion of the anthropological relation with recent
literatures on infrastructures and markets, I argue that the perceived
reality of transactions is a product of how novel forms of economic
knowledge are able to make sense of ‘taken for granted’ behavioral patterns
within digital platforms of market action. The intent that constitutes
‘real’ trades is therefore a product of how market participants, economic
experts and the courts interpret the operational underbelly of markets and
the relations that they produce.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:18.978030,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-02T15:23:13.790000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/citation/,4s8z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2w5k5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/relationships/node/,2w5k5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c99963b83f6901dd777430/,57c99963b83f6901dd777430,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s8z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4s8z7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4s8z7

public interest in testing the validity of patents, weeding out patents
that should not have been issued. But there is one important group of
people the law systematically prevents from challenging bad patents.
Curiously, it is the very group patent law is supposed to support:
inventors themselves. The century-old doctrine of assignor estoppel
precludes inventors who file patent applications from later challenging the
validity or enforceability of the patents they receive. The stated
rationale for assignor estoppel is that it would be unfair to allow the
inventor to benefit from obtaining a patent and later change her tune and
attack the patent when it benefits her to do so. The Supreme Court has
traditionally disfavored the doctrine, reading it narrowly. But the Federal
Circuit has expanded the doctrine in a variety of dimensions, and applied
it even when the benefit to the inventor is illusory. Further, the doctrine
misunderstands the role of inventor-employees in the modern world.

More important, the expansive modern form of assignor estoppel interferes
substantially with employee mobility. Inventors as a class are put under
burdens that we apply to no other employee. If they start a company, or
even go to work for an existing company in the same field, they will not be
able to defend a patent suit from their old employer. The result is a sort
of partial noncompete clause, one imposed without even the fiction of
agreement and one that binds anyone the inventor comes in contact with
after leaving the job. Abundant evidence suggests that noncompetes in
general retard innovation and economic growth, and several states prohibit
them outright, while all others limit them. But assignor estoppel is a
federal law doctrine that overrides those state choices.

It is time to rethink the doctrine of assignor estoppel. I describe the
doctrine, its rationale, and how it has expanded dramatically in the past
25 years. I argue that the doctrine is out of touch with the realities of
both modern inventing and modern patent law, and that it interferes with
