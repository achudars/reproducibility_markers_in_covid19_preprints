We find that epidemic exposure in an individual's impressionable years (ages 18 to 25) has a persistent negative effect on confidence in political institutions and leaders. We find similar negative effects on confidence in public health systems, suggesting that the loss of confidence in political leadership and institutions is associated with healthcare related policies at the time of the epidemic. In line with this argument, our results are mostly driven by individuals who experienced epidemics under weak governments with less capacity to act against the epidemic, disappointing their citizens. We provide evidence of this mechanism by showing that weak governments took longer to introduce policy interventions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos.

Vulnerability indices are rarely validated with disaster outcome data at broad spatial scales, making it difficult to develop effective national scale strategies to mitigate loss for vulnerable populations. This paper validates social vulnerability indicators using two flood outcomes: death and damage. Regression models identify sociodemographic factors explaining variation in outcomes from 11,629 non-coastal flood events in the USA (2008-2012), controlling for flood intensity using stream gauge data. We compare models with i) socioeconomic variables, ii) the composite social vulnerability index (SoVI), and iii) flood intensity variables only. The SoVI explains more variance in death (AIC = 2829) and damage (R2=0.125) than flood intensity alone (death-AIC = 2894 ;damage-R2=0.089), and models with individual sociodemographic factors perform best (death-AIC = 2696; damage- R2=0.229). Socioeconomic variables correlated with death (rural counties with a high proportion of elderly and young) differ from those related to property damage (rural counties with high percentage of both Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations in poverty).

Educational provision changed during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK (20th March to 31st May 2020) with schooling moving online. The Prime Minister announced a timetable for partial reopening of school on 10th May. With the return to partial schooling imminent, the views of year 10 and year 12 students were surveyed.
Design 
Cross-sectional web-based survey disseminated via closed social media fora.
Setting 
A structured questionnaire hosted on Google Forms™ and disseminated via two Facebook™ fora in the week prior to the original stated date of return to partial schooling for year 10 and year 12 students (20th  to 27th May 2020).
Participants 
United Kingdom school students in year 10 (age 14 to 15 years old) and year 12 (age 16 to 17 years old).
Main outcome measures 
Views of year 10 and year 12 students on returning to schools with a focus on their opinions on government guidance, impact on their future, and how remote learning has impacted on their education.
Results 	
1534 students (yr10 n= 1007 66%, yr12 n=527 34%) completed the questionnaire.
Students were equally divided in opinion with 781 (51%) preferring to return to partial schooling with limited educational contact and 753 (49%) preferring to remain isolated at home with remote schooling, when an unsure option was removed.
A majority (73%, n=1111) of students feel unsafe or unsure that Government guidelines will be enough to protect them from COVID-19 in a school environment. 79% (n=1205) of students felt that COVID-19 has impacted on their future. 15% (n=231) of students said they have had no additional support or guidance from their school during remote learning.
Conclusions
Year 10 and 12 school students were divided equally in their preferences about returning to partial school. Exploration of their uncertainty by thematic analysis revealed the source to be anxieties around safety. Students feel they are being put at risk and because guidelines will be impossible to enforce in a school environment. Some students recognised a need to return to education despite this perceived risk. An inequity in the standard of education was identified with 15% (n=231) of students reporting that they did not receive any support during the 87 days of lock down.  School students expressed desire that their concerns be heard by the Government. Better consideration needs to be taken of the concerns of these year groups in the future.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|education|impact of COVID-19 on future|lockdown|lockdown impact on education|online learning|partial schooling|preferences to returning to school after pandemic|remote schooling|return to school|school|student attitude towards returning to school|student perception on government guidelines|student voice|year 10|year 12,2020-06-12T11:39:03.843915,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-12T11:24:51.657821,FALSE,NA,no,Data available subject to a data sharing agreement,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/citation/,mdjsn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee2995ea777b70018ab5c8d/,5ee2995ea777b70018ab5c8d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mdjsn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mdjsn,NA

Building on the insight that group cognition is not static but is instead dynamically and interactively produced, we develop a novel conceptualization of group cognitive diversity—discursive diversity, or the degree to which the semantic meanings expressed by group members diverge from one another at a given point in time. We propose that the relationship between this time-varying measure of group cognition and team performance varies as a function of task type: discursive diversity enhances performance when groups are engaged in ideational tasks but impedes performance when they perform coordination tasks. Using the tools of computational linguistics to derive a measure of discursive diversity, and drawing on a novel longitudinal data set of intragroup electronic communications, group members’ demographic traits, and performance outcomes for 117 remote software development teams on an online platform (Gigster), we find support for our theory. These results suggest that the performance tradeoff of group cognitive diversity is not inescapable: Groups can circumvent it by modulating discursive diversity to match their task requirements.",TRUE,FALSE,cognition|diversity|groups and teams|interaction|natural language processing,2020-06-12T11:38:41.234070,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-12T11:24:19.385153,FALSE,NA,no,Data were obtained under an NDA and cannot be shared publicly.,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/citation/,8pjga,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee290d236a16d0019e9296e/,5ee290d236a16d0019e9296e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pjga/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8pjga/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8pjga,NA

In addition, self-reported and actual behaviour may not match in empirical settings. To better explore the relation among these variables and the political stance of participants, we ran an online experiment with 805 US residents. Four key variables – environmental concern, self -reported environmental behaviour, observed environmental behaviour (in the form of carbon compensation), and political attitudes – were measured and their interactions in promoting pro-environment behaviour were analysed. We found that self-reported measures hardly held any correlation with real behaviour and that political attitudes mainly predicted self-reported measures, not real environmental behaviour.",TRUE,FALSE,attitude-behaviour gap|carbon compensation|environmental behaviour|experiment,2020-06-11T16:44:11.995924,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-11T16:43:38.624556,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/citation/,rqd4s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee230e59e163700d68fa0ac/,5ee230e59e163700d68fa0ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqd4s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rqd4s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rqd4s,NA
