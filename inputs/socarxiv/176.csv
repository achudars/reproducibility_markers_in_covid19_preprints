Despite expectations that alliances should lead to decreased military spending, the empirical record offers mixed findings. We argue that not all alliances are reliable, thus only allies that receive signals of reassurance will rely on allies and subsequently reduce their military spending. Compared to states that do not receive additional signals, these reassured allies will have greater confidence that an ally will come to their aid. As a result, third party aggressors are deterred and the demand for military spending will decrease. We test this argument with an analysis of U.S. signals of support, alliance commitments, and military spending. We find that alliances without additional signals of support have a negligible effect on military spending. Yet, we observe that signals of support are negatively associated with military spending among U.S. allies. Additional tests indicate that strong U.S. signals, coupled with alliance commitments, are also associated with lower military spending in the rivals of U.S. allies. Our results potentially help explain the mixed evidence in the arms-versus-allies and burden-sharing literatures and further demonstrate that signals play an important role in the practice of international relations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-06T10:00:00.914910,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-06T09:59:30.426656,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/citation/,acrpb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7c02851f65a50040ed5df5/,5f7c02851f65a50040ed5df5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acrpb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/acrpb,NA

The increased legal powers, often a result of groundbreaking agreements or settlements with Indigenous peoples, may improve environmental protection and river management, but they can also challenge the legitimacy of laws and regulations that protect the rivers. In this paper, we compare the new legal rights with two long-standing uses of legal personality in river management, to explore the effects of legal personality in terms of environmental resource management.

Although the legal, political, historical and cultural context for recognition is different in each country, an analysis of the cases presents some interesting conceptual correlations, which help us to understand this emerging (and sometimes controversial) transnational idea that a river can be a person. In both cases recognising that the river is a person is an attempt to accommodate diverse legal and cultural interests in the river, in order to establish a new collaborative relationship between the state and river communities. Whether either model results in improved river outcomes, or increased indigenous or community jurisdiction to govern, turns not on the fiction that the river is a person but on the surrounding institutional framework, which has been carefully designed to engender enforceability. Thus, we argue, traditional dichotomies that draw lines between human-centred and earth-centred laws, or nature as the object versus the subject of property or rights fail to capture what legal personality entails.

Yet, there is relatively a scant interest in how the NPM approach has influenced the ways of institutionalizing the third mission of universities and its consequences. This paper tries to fill this gap with a case study of LINC (Leaders in INdustry-university Cooperation), which is one of the main South Korean university funding programs dedicated to the third mission. This paper examines the evaluation system of LINC and its multi-level operation that constitutes the Korean version of the entrepreneurial university. As a result, this study finds that the evaluation system of LINC has been steering university toward an “industry serving agency,” with persistent approaches of formalization and incentivization.

However, debates about environmental law regularly overlook the details within national legislation that define which specific acts are illegal, where laws apply, and how they are sanctioned. Based on a review of nearly 200 wildlife laws in 8 countries, we developed a taxonomy that describes all types of wildlife offences in those countries. The 511 offences are organized into a hierarchical taxonomy that scholars and practitioners can use to help conduct legal analyses globally, providing more nuance and facilitating like-for-like comparisons of laws across countries. This is significant amidst competing calls to strengthen, deregulate and reform wildlife legislation, particularly in response to fears over zoonotic threats and large-scale biodiversity loss. The taxonomy can be used to analyse legal reforms (e.g., new laws, deregulation, closing loopholes, harmonising legislation), or to establish international standards. For example, we apply the taxonomy to compare how 8 countries sanction the offence of “hunting a protected species”, to explore different scales and approaches to imposing fines and imprisonment. The taxonomy also illustrates how future legal taxonomies can be developed in the environment sector.",TRUE,FALSE,biodiversity|comparative law|conservation|crime|enforcement|environmental law|governance|green criminology|illegal wildlife trade,2020-10-04T15:33:26.131403,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-04T15:33:00.708576,TRUE,"Maria Pascual and James Wingard are owners of Legal Atlas, a legal comparative analysis platform that is referenced in the article.",no,Please contact Authors or review https://www.legal-atlas.com/,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law,Jacob Phelps|Maria Pascual|James Wingard,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/citation/,ze25n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b53z4/,b53z4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f78f49f39d7e301f1eb4d08/,5f78f49f39d7e301f1eb4d08,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze25n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ze25n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ze25n,NA

This interdisciplinary study examined the complexities of family homelessness in Fort Worth, Texas. A literature review outlined pathways into family homelessness, shared experiences, and common intervention strategies. An original qualitative study followed, employing a phenomenological approach to interview families in a local rapid-rehousing program. Open-ended question allowed free description of personal realities. Audio-recorded responses were analyzed for relevant themes, commonalities, and variations. Findings suggested that Fort Worth families’ pathways into homelessness are consistent with “life shock theory,” whereby those already financially-strained suddenly experience compounding stresses, leading to homelessness. The study found local and national experiences to be similar; however, it was limited by a convenience sample exclusively comprised of women nearing a housing goal, potentially coloring their outlooks. Finally, the study raised the question whether rapidly-rehoused Fort Worth families are well-positioned for stability. The similarity of participants’ concerns pre- and post-homelessness suggested that some families may transition to a status still “at risk,” rather than “stably-housed.” Considered in the context of previous research, findings supported further interdisciplinary inquiry into how longer-term, post-housing support might promote housing stability.",TRUE,FALSE,2Gen|ACEs and Homelessness|Adverse Childhood Experiences|children and homelessness|family homelessness|homelessness|homelessness in Fort Worth|homelessness in Texas|interdisciplinarity|Intergenerational transfer of Poverty|life shock theory|Poverty|rapid rehousing|women and homelessness,2020-10-04T15:29:24.108531,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-04T15:29:02.623083,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/citation/,ya7m6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f78a367e64e7e01dbaae802/,5f78a367e64e7e01dbaae802,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7m6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ya7m6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ya7m6,NA
