Realistically, however, concern revolves not around redundancy of labour, but the polarising effect automation exerts on jobs. This polarisation stems from the claim that automation 'hollows out' mid-skill jobs, thereby increasing demand for high- and low- skill jobs. Job polarisation widens wage disparity, lowers the aggregate skill level of labour and exacerbates existing social inequalities. Proponents of laissez-faire automation argue that while automation may exert adverse effects on labour in the short run, it is bound to realise higher net benefits and employment in the long run. Such an understanding which is based on the Schumpterian notion of creative destruction is predicated on the fact that firms would adopt only such technology which bring about substantial strides in productivity. However, world over and in India firms have been merely substituting labour with capital, without any greater efficiency gains. This trend is only set to worsen with the ongoing health crisis due to varied reasons. In such a situation, it becomes imperative to design novel methods of social security.",TRUE,FALSE,automation|indian labour market|jobless recovery|job polarisation|labour|social security|technological unemployment,2020-08-11T07:07:08.132188,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T07:06:50.349616,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76def|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Other Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/citation/,h9gaw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2e42a8479288006b85f192/,5f2e42a8479288006b85f192,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h9gaw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h9gaw,NA

Here, we report the findings of an experimental transmission study designed to compare the simultaneous effects of a high- or low-prestige model with the presence of content containing social, survival, emotional, moral, rational, or counterintuitive information. Results from multimodel inference reveal that prestige is a significant factor in determining salience and recall, but that several content biases, specifically social, survival, negative emotional, and biological counterintuitive information, are significantly more influential. Further, we find evidence that prestige serves as a conditional learning strategy when no content cues are available.

While modelling behaviour by forward-looking rational agents can provide some insight into the time paths of pandemics, the non-stationary nature of Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models of viral spread makes characterisation of resulting equilibria difficult. Here I posit a shortcut that can be deployed to allow for a tractable equilibrium model of pandemics with intuitive comparative statics and also a clear prediction that effective reproduction numbers (that is, R) will tend towards 1 in equilibrium.

First, using ordinary least squares (OLS ) estimation, this article examines the cognitive assessment scores of children of immigrants in the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS 70) and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS ). It then exploits the richer data of the MCS to construct multilevel models for children of immigrants in this more recent cohort. In the BCS 70, children of immigrants show significant gaps at ages 5 and 10 in both reading and maths scores. Even when controls are included in the OLS model for the BCS 70, children of Caribbean immigrants are expected to perform worse in both assessments. In the raw MCS data, on the other hand, nearly no gap remains in age‐11 and ‐14 assessments. Although Bangladeshi children of immigrants in the MCS have negative coefficients in the OLS analysis, in the final multilevel model for the MCS , all children of immigrants follow positive trajectories wherein no group attains distinguishably lower scores than their peers in later assessments, and Indian children of immigrants even outperform their peers in the MCS model's predictions.",TRUE,FALSE,Britain|children of immigrants|cognitive development|education|ethnicity|immigration|United Kingdom,2020-08-06T15:12:44.979050,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-06T15:12:09.527028,FALSE,NA,no,Data from the 1970 British Cohort Study and Millennium Cohort Study are available at https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/citation/,wrp2g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2c1936b084f60314c98e42/,5f2c1936b084f60314c98e42,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrp2g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wrp2g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wrp2g,https://doi.org/10.1002/berj.3476

Specifically, the analysis focuses on studies that use primary data as the basis of their insights. A small number of key issues explains most desk-rejections, including: the use of weak empirical measures and research designs which do not lead to valid conclusions; text-duplication; ignoring key changes to the external environment, such as COVID-19; and a lack of (clearly articulated) contribution to knowledge.",TRUE,FALSE,Annals of Tourism Research|primary data|publishing|rejection|tourism research,2020-08-11T14:46:12.536257,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T14:42:37.721857,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/citation/,wx64j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8fg7u/,8fg7u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2b8e9cb084f602dbca213e/,5f2b8e9cb084f602dbca213e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx64j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wx64j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wx64j,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2020.102981

Metropolitan counties compensated for state inaction in initial U.S. response to COVID-19 pandemic,"Societal responses to crises require coordination at multiple levels of organization. Exploring early efforts to contain COVID-19 in the U.S., we argue that local governments can act to ensure systemic resilience and recovery when higher-level governments fail to do so. Event history analyses show that large, more urban areas experience COVID-19 more intensely due to high population density and denser socioeconomic networks. But metropolitan counties were also among the first to adopt shelter-in-place orders. Analyzing the statistical predictors of when counties moved before their states, we find that the hierarchy of counties by size and economic integration matters for the timing of orders, where both factors predict earlier shelter-in-place orders. In line with sociological theories of urban governance, we also find evidence of an important governance dimension to the timing of orders. Liberal counties in conservative states were more than twice as likely to adopt a policy and implement one earlier in the pandemic, suggesting that tensions about how to resolve collective governance problems are important in the socio-temporal dynamic of responses to COVID-19. We explain this behavior as a substitution effect in which more urban local governments, driven by risk and necessity, step up into the action vacuum left by higher levels of government and become national policy leaders and innovators.",TRUE,FALSE,Cities|Compensation|Counties|COVID-19|Diffusion|Government response|Local government|Public policy|States|Urban governance|Urban science|USA,2020-08-06T13:32:20.635894,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-06T13:22:44.448170,FALSE,NA,available,"Data will be made publicly available after peer-review, contact authors.",https://github.com/mansueto-institute/plosone_covid_counties,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/citation/,b5hj3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2af7cfb084f602bec9c4f2/,5f2af7cfb084f602bec9c4f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b5hj3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b5hj3,NA
