Generalizing from experiments con- ducted during this period of persistent crisis may be challenging due to changes in how participants respond to treatments or the composition of online samples. We investigate the generalizability of COVID-era survey experiments with 33 replications of 12 pre-pandemic designs, fielded across 13 quota samples of Americans between March and July of 2020. We find strong evidence that pre-pandemic experiments replicate in terms of sign and significance, but at somewhat reduced magnitudes. Indirect evidence suggests an increased share of inattentive subjects on online platforms during this period, which may have contributed to smaller estimated treatment effects.

However, the inadequacies associated with extant financing streams are in sharp relief since they do not address damages and losses associated with the climate crisis. The current global configuration aimed at generating from “billions to trillions” of development finance are awfully mute on historical responsibility for the uneven and extreme consequences facing climate-impacted communities in the Global South. This paper interrogates the role of the SDGs, in particular SDG17, in both adducing financialisation as an evolutionary process, further extracting profit from racialized communities, and a source of instability in the global economy. It points to the manner in which the “trillions” deemed necessary are ostensibly mobilized in pursuit of financial returns to be made from climate disaster that generate further debt, dispossesses populations in the global south, and thereby  ushering in a new era of “bond-age” and coloniality. Current development financing arrangements under the SDGs would increase the cost burdens and compromise the Global South’s capacities to democractically manage and meet their developmental needs due to accumulating losses and damage from major extreme climate-induced events. Loss and damage compensation for marginalised developing countries at the forefront of the climate crisis must therefore come from another source: climate reparations. Climate reparations offer an appropriate encompassing philosophical and policy apparatus for first understanding the magnitude of climate breakdown, and second for mounting a response to ongoing environmental harm in vulnerable countries that is centred on climate justice.",TRUE,FALSE,climate crisis|climate debt|climate loss and damage|colonialities|development finance|financialization|reparations|SDGs|Sustainable Development Goals,2020-11-28T18:57:01.981934,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-28T18:56:34.833545,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,Keston K.

This short paper provides a theoretical foundation based upon current literature to propose an alternative framework from which to conduct the analysis of the data collected by AlShebli et al. (2020).

We believe that AlShebli et al’s (2020) results corroborate, at unique scale, the well-documented gender citation bias. We find that the interpretation of the data, that junior academic careers (both men and women) see greater career benefits when being mentored by senior men, is lacking theoretical foundation and not cognisant of the accepted knowledge on this topic.

We present survey experimental evidence on two substantial effects of the pandemic. First, the unprecedented economic downturn significantly depressed Trump's popular support across all partisan groups, and especially among middle-low and low-income respondents. Second, the poor public health record of the Trump administration reduced its electoral prospects in 25 percentage points among citizens aged between 55 and 70 years old. By contrast, populist attitudes proved to have a negligible effect on the outcome. We conclude that the 2020 election was a normal contest compatible with theories of economic voting and political competence.

This homogeneity can be a result of humans’ tendency to process information in biased, confirmatory ways – a characteristic which is also ascribed to populist citizens and those who hold conspiratorial beliefs. It is hypothesized that populist views and conspiratorial beliefs are associated to higher exposure to like-minded information within Facebook and that conspiratorial beliefs fuel this association.

Investigating Cryopreservation Practices in Contemporary Societies,"Cryopreservation practices are an essential dimension of contemporary life sciences. They make possible the freezing and storage of cells, tissues and other organic materials at very low temperatures and the subsequent thawing of these at a future date without apparent loss of vitality. The article presents some initial ideas and central theses of a research project recently funded by the European Research Council (ERC). The CRYOSOCIETIES project is based on the thesis that in contemporary societies, cryopreservation practices bring into existence a new form of life: “suspended life”. “Suspended life” enables vital processes to be kept in a liminal state in which biological substances are neither fully alive nor dead. CRYOSOCIETIES examines the creation of “suspended life” through three ethnographic studies that investigate various sites of cryopreservation. The first deals with cord blood banking with the promise to store vitality and ensure health; the second addresses oocyte freezing to extend fertility and rearrange reproductive futures, while the third case study focusses on the emergence of “frozen zoos”, that is to say cryobanks which seek to preserve organic material of endangered or extinct animal species.

We test this using London Fire Brigade data (2012-2020) in Waltham Forest, where from 2015 low traffic neighbourhoods have been implemented.  We find no evidence that response times were affected inside low traffic neighbourhoods, and some evidence that they improved on boundary roads.  However, while the proportion of delays was unchanged, the reasons given for delays initially showed some shift from ‘no specific delay cause identified’ to ‘traffic calming measures’. Our findings indicate that low traffic neighbourhoods do not adversely affect emergency response times, although while LTNs are novel this perception may exist among some crews.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-26T01:36:00.886465,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-26T01:35:44.703379,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-incident-records|https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-mobilisation-records,no,N/A,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/citation/,jathq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pw2hr/,pw2hr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbe9ce1ab65180185b0ef5e/,5fbe9ce1ab65180185b0ef5e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jathq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jathq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jathq,NA

 We theorize that social conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to increase the importance of families for health and widen existing inequalities. We suggest three primary tenets important for understanding families and health during COVID-19. First, risks of specific COVID-19 outcomes and other health problems are unevenly distributed across families. Second, how families impact health during the COVID-19 pandemic is conditional on public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events. Third, many health inequalities driven by racism, sexism, classism, and other oppressive societal force are amplified during COVID-19, but the extent to which this is occurring is shaped by families and by the public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events that also impact families and health. As health disparities continue to emerge from this pandemic, we call on researchers and policy-makers to pay attention to the multiple ways that families matter.",TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|families|health|health disparities|health inequalities|pandemic|public policy,2020-11-26T01:34:41.363236,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-26T01:34:30.119498,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/citation/,kjb2f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbe8c93c623190185d80f40/,5fbe8c93c623190185d80f40,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjb2f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kjb2f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kjb2f,NA
