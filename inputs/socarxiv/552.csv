Using the framework of sexual racism, in this essay, I contend that people do find pleasure in race and to propose a colorblind alternative to sexual racism is inappropriate. I consider the kink of race play as a site where it is clear pleasure exists for some. To delineate ethical and unethical pleasures of race, and the possibility for a non-colorblind approach, I look at experiences of racial beauty experienced by people of color themselves.

Social Computing, Digital Humanities and Cultural Analytics","I developed the concept of cultural analytics in 2005 to refer to ""the analysis of massive cultural datasets and flows using computational and visualization techniques."" In 2007 we established a research lab (Software Studies Initiative, softwarestudies.com) to start working on practical projects. The following are the examples of theoretical and practical questions that are driving our research:

What does it mean to represent ""culture"" by ""data""? What are the unique possibilities offered by computational analysis of large cultural data in contrast to qualitative methods used in humanities and social science? How can we use quantitative techniques to study the key cultural form of our era — interactive media? How can we combine computational analysis and visualization of large cultural data with qualitative methods, including ""close reading""? (In other words, how does one combine analysis of larger patterns with the analysis of individual artifacts and their details?)  How can computational analysis do justice to variability and diversity of cultural artifacts and processes, rather than focusing on the ""typical"" and ""most popular""?

Eight years later, the work of our lab has become only a tiny portion of a very large body of research. Thousands of researchers have already published tens of thousands of papers analyzing patterns in massive cultural datasets. First, there are data describing the activity on the most popular social networks (Flickr, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, etc.), user-created content shared on these networks (tweets, images, video, etc.), and also users' interactions with this content (likes, favorites, reports, comments). Second, researchers have also started to analyze particular professional cultural areas and historical periods, such as website design, fashion photography, twentieth-century popular music, nineteenth-century literature, etc. This work is carried out in two newly developed fields — social computing and digital humanities.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-23T20:56:01.205595,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-23T20:55:39.065387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/citation/,b2y79,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/94wqp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/relationships/node/,94wqp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7de5698c6d9f001bae1638/,5b7de5698c6d9f001bae1638,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b2y79/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b2y79,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.004

We argue that performance indicators should be used for learning and innovation rather than for indicator-based accountability. Accountability can only enhance innovation when it allows for staff and stakeholders to critically think about the results. They have to engage in a performance dialogue on the meaning of indicators that also accounts for complexity. Indicator-based accountability, however, typically does not allow for such thinking. In our view, reforming accountability therefore implies that results- based accountability needs to be saved from its indicators.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|innovation|learning|performance indicators,2018-08-23T21:04:42.936173,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-23T21:04:20.355256,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/citation/,z4vk2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7d26af99a6cb001c4bc9d4/,5b7d26af99a6cb001c4bc9d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z4vk2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z4vk2,NA

The current study takes this research in a different direction by examining (1) whether pornography use may be associated with entrance into marriage during early adulthood and (2) whether this association is moderated by both gender and religion, two key factors strongly related to both pornography use and earlier marriage. Longitudinal data were taken from waves 1, 3, and 4 of the National Study of Youth and Religion, a nationally-representative panel study of Americans from their teenage years into early adulthood (N = 1,691). It was theorized that frequent pornography use at earlier survey waves may foster more sexually progressive attitudes that may lead to devaluing marriage as an institution, and, for religious men in particular, may disincentivize marriage as a “socially legitimate” means of sexual fulfillment. Findings affirmed that, compared to more moderate levels of pornography use, higher levels of pornography use in emerging adulthood were associated with a lower likelihood of marriage by the final survey wave for men, but not women. This association was not moderated by religiosity for either gender. Moreover, among men, higher frequency pornography viewers were not significantly different from non-viewers in their likelihood of marriage entry.

Yet critical debate related to the use of ‘everyday’ stop and search powers by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has, despite the hyper-accountable policing system of Northern Ireland, been marked by its absence. This paper presents the first ever analysis of PSNI’s use of PACE-type powers - currently used at a higher rate and with poorer outcomes compared to the rest of the U.K. While it can only be considered as an elusive power, about which detailed research evidence is markedly lacking, stop and search in Northern Ireland seems to serve as a classificatory tool for PSNI to control mainly young, socio-economically marginal male populations. The paper provides new theoretical insight into stop and search as a simultaneous overt and covert practice, and speaks to wider issues of mundane police power – and practice – within highly contested and politically fractured contexts.

The Virú state developed around 200 BC and is the earliest known state on the north coast of Peru. The settlement patterns and settlement hierarchies of the Virú Period (ca. 200 BC – 600 AD) are compared with those of the earlier Puerto Morin Period (ca. 400 – 200 BC) to investigate processes of territorial expansion. Two independent polities and several outlying communities occupied the valley during the Puerto Morin Period whereas settlement during the Virú Period was extensive, populations surged, and large swaths of the valley were settled for the first time. Evidence is presented to show that the Virú state incorporated the earlier Puerto Morin polities and that a three-tiered settlement hierarchy existed at this time. Drawing from cross-cultural evidence and recent studies on Virú expansionary dynamics, I propose a hypothesis that the Virú state expanded rapidly throughout the valley early in its developmental history and pursued a policy of territorial consolidation later in its history.

I also address criticisms regarding issues of musical agency, meaning, and reductionism, and highlight potential applications including music copyright, education, and sustainability. While cultural evolution will never explain all aspects of music in culture, it offers a useful theoretical framework for understanding diversity and change in the world’s music.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-21T13:22:01.781782,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:21:48.829220,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d46|Arts and Humanities|Music|Ethnomusicology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/citation/,uf5z3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hcepf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/relationships/node/,hcepf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b6f302da7bb001b70914e/,5b7b6f302da7bb001b70914e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf5z3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uf5z3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uf5z3,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-019-0221-1

Research in communicative approach to language has shown that competence in oral and written language grows as the learners actively use the language in and out of the classroom. The aim of this paper is to engage learners in activities that demand their autonomous participation and develop linguistic competence and learner autonomy. The vital question every teacher has to ponder upon is “Can we expect what was taught in the previous class is retained in the next class?” The present study focuses on how films can aid in enhancing ELT in the GFP in Oman. The research data collected will be empirical and qualitative in nature. GFP students will be the main subjects of this research. The research will be carried out on different levels and groups in the GFP. The activities based on films expose the learners to authentic language input, help them learn how language operates and challenge them to use the language independently. The rich visual imagery, the action and motions of the films deliver the learners with multi-sensory involvement (Arcario, 1993). Infusing technology into Education serves a variety of purposes in language teaching. The observation of cultural aspects such as traditions helps to understand the function of the language. By this pragmatic approach an innovative teacher can aid students’ critical thinking skills as well as their linguistic competence. Hence it is suggested that a judicious selection of digital materials along with several learner-friendly tasks can be incorporated in syllabus of ELT.",TRUE,FALSE,ELT|films|GFP|learner autonomy|linguistic competence,2018-08-21T13:22:20.879110,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:22:09.848414,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/citation/,bevug,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/esytv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/relationships/node/,esytv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b6250d4676c0018abf0e3/,5b7b6250d4676c0018abf0e3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bevug/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bevug/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bevug,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC1.11

Hence, the paper aims to demonstrate how literary texts can be employed in the English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom to facilitate reading, language acquisition, and related critical skills, particularly at the pre-intermediate stage and above. Text selections from popular novels were analysed using Johns and Davies’ (1983) Text as Vehicle of Information (TAVI), and Text as Linguistic Object (TALO), as well as Clandfield’s (2005) Text as Springboard for Production (TASP) as a framework to design language learning/use activities. Source texts were selected from Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day, Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, and Martel’s Life of Pi in view of these novels’ current salience in the literary world to address key research questions: 1) What reading skills and sub-skills can the literary texts help develop among ESL/EFL students? 2) What aspects of grammar and vocabulary can be exploited in the texts? 3) How can the texts be used as reflections of social reality to generate discussion of critical issues among students? The fact that these novels have been produced as films, which the learners could also watch in whole or part, is expected to stimulate further critical appreciation. The paper concludes that the value of such informed use of any literary text is that it exploits the literature-language nexus to provide the synergy needed for student learning in the ESL/EFL classroom and beyond.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-21T13:24:21.271772,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:24:03.845011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/citation/,hq528,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j8ynd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/relationships/node/,j8ynd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b602bd4676c0017abcfff/,5b7b602bd4676c0017abcfff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hq528/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hq528,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC1.9
