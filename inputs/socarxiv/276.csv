A critical review of existing literature unfolds ‘Strategic CSR’ as   a   sustainable   and pragmatic paradigm as it delivers competitive advantage for a firm. Further, stakeholder engagement and market orientation  were identified as the dominant linking themes whereas the latter is also identified as a core construct of Strategic CSR. Market orientation is an antecedent while competitive advantage delivered by   strategic CSR can be measured through customer loyalty ,stakeholder commitment and reputation.

Quantum mechanics involves infinity by Hilbert space, but it is finitist as any experimental science. The absence of hidden variables in it interpretable as its completeness should resurrect Hilbert’s finitism at the cost of relevant modification of the latter already hinted by intuitionism and Gentzen’s approaches for completeness. This paper investigates both conditions and philosophical background necessary for that modification. The main conclusion is that the concept of infinity as underlying contemporary mathematics cannot be reduced to a single Peano arithmetic, but to at least two ones independent of each other. Intuitionism, quantum mechanics, and Gentzen’s approaches to completeness an even Hilbert’s finitism can be unified from that viewpoint.

Although parents’ reports of time with children are taken as standard and reliable, assessing different family actors’ perspectives on time together may challenge this notion. Using the American Time Use Survey (2003-2018), we provide a unique window into parent-adolescent time, via a novel examination of precise questions about co-presence and emotions during daily activities. Comparing parents’ and teenagers’ reports of the amount and emotional valence of time spent together, we reveal considerable perceptual gaps – reflecting “ambiguous” rather than “objective” togetherness. Mothers report 24 hours per week of co-presence (“in the room with”) compared to adolescents’ 15 hours – a gap greater than an entire school day; father-teenager discrepancies are comparable. Discrepancies vary by parents’ employment status, with larger discrepancies between stay-at-home parent and adolescent reports. Though the perceptual gap is sizeable, the emotional one is not: both generations experience reported time together as more meaningful, happier and less stressful than time apart, partly due to the nature of activities and presence of other people. Employed parents and the more educated receive more of a well-being boost from adolescent co-presence compared to their counterparts. Ultimately, generational position and social statuses shape perceptions of co-presence, in the form of “creating” versus “negating” classifications of togetherness.",TRUE,FALSE,Parent-adolescent relations|Parenting|Subjective well-being|Time use,2020-05-09T20:17:31.702012,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-09T20:16:57.908583,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/citation/,4vp57,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6vcew/,6vcew,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb5ce359ddd28010a08ed5e/,5eb5ce359ddd28010a08ed5e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vp57/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4vp57/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4vp57,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12764

Public policies and parents’ work-family preferences in Germany,"This study uses Sen’s (1985) “capabilities framework” to examine how public policies affect parents’ preferences for a more egalitarian division of paid and unpaid work. Based on the assumption that individuals develop their preferences within a specific policy context, we examine how changes in three policies affect mothers’ and fathers’ work-family preferences, namely, the availability of high-quality, affordable childcare, the right to return to a full-time job after working part-time, and an extension of “partner months” in parental leave schemes. Analyzing a unique probability sample of parents with young children in Germany, we find that, on average, fathers would want to work slightly fewer hours if they had the right to return to a full-time position after working part-time, and mothers would want to work slightly more hours if childcare opportunities were improved. Our analyses, however, also show that full-time working parents have preferences for shorter hours and that non-employed parents would prefer longer hours independent of the policy setting. Last but not least, we find that increasing the number of partner months in the parental leave scheme considerably increases fathers’ preferences for longer and mothers’ preferences for shorter periods of parental leave.

Racial Vision and Scientific Selves in German Portrait Photographic Practice,"Default ways of reading others come with a host of problems, often caused by a lack of adequate tools for obtaining analytical and interpretive access to the phenomenon of interest; in the case of Nazis, this has led to a flattening of National Socialist racial thinking into a blunt racial essentialism that, as Ann Stoler put it, ignores nuance and conflicts in historical debates about race that are then juxtaposed to later, presumably more sophisticated, racial epistemologies (Stoler 2016). Horror at historical atrocities has led to a glossing over of significant variation in scientific and cultural practices that are consequential for our understanding of dictatorships and authoritarian regimes substantively, and for our ability as cultural and comparative historical sociologists to make claims about the past, methodologically and causally.

What Is It Like to Be a Nazi employs Nagel’s paper as metaphorical point of departure to study not consciousness, but to more attentively interrogate the scientific practices of those whose ways of thinking and existing in the world seem so alien to us, as well as the practices of contemporary social science purporting to understanding National Socialist science. My contribution to this project consists in homing in on one historical form of racial knowledge production and visualization, that of portrait photographic practice. By choosing portrait photographers, the larger category of “Nazi” is narrowed down to a professional group who generated visual propaganda for the National Socialist regime and sustained the dictatorship by way of artistic production.

How did National Socialist photographers generate “race” in images? Through an analysis of photographic instruction manuals, reflections of the image makers on their craft and the photographs themselves, I theorize three processes by which National Socialist-period photographers created race in images: contemplation, freezing, and sculpting. Photography, far from being a transcriptional art, brimmed with agency and was in constant disagreement about the nature of perception, and the best way of capturing phenomena occurring in the world through novel technologies. While local circumstances of photographic production under National Socialist rule at first glance appear excessively specific and perhaps exceptional, they raise more universal questions about perception, vision and interpretation that remain at issue today (Browne 2010; Morning 2011; Morning 2014; Nelson 2008).",TRUE,FALSE,history of science|national socialism|photography|propaganda|scientific selves|STS,2020-05-09T20:09:09.265804,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-09T20:08:50.809503,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/citation/,rau4n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb58546a2199501175d20c3/,5eb58546a2199501175d20c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rau4n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rau4n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rau4n,NA

Though democratic governments may intend to meet their international obligations, and though democratic institutions provide greater political constraints to encourage compliance, investment agreements may conflict with the goal of maintaining domestic public support. Specifically, we argue that credible elections create strong incentives for governments to side with domestic voters over foreign business interests, and to pass legislation that violates investment agreements. We use a data set of BIT violation complaints that better captures potential indirect expropriation to confirm prior findings that show a difference in violations by regime type. Since policies are not passed immediately and companies do not file arbitration complaints instantly when a potential violation occurs, democratic governments are only more likely to be sued as their time in office increases. The results suggest that the ability of voters to sanction leaders is an important mechanism that incentivizes governments to pass legislation that potentially violates investment treaties through indirect expropriation.",TRUE,FALSE,electoral accountability|indirect expropriation|investment treaties|political economy,2020-05-09T19:59:20.607266,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-09T19:59:04.291126,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/citation/,b7xp2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb574cb9ddd2800ef08edba/,5eb574cb9ddd2800ef08edba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b7xp2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b7xp2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b7xp2,NA

Not since the Spanish Flu in 1918 has the world experienced such a widespread pandemic and this has motivated many countries across globe to take unprecedented actions in an effort to curb the spread and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Among these government and regulatory interventions includes stringent domestic and international travel restrictions as well as a raft of stay-at-home and social distancing regulations. The scale of these containment measures has left criminologists wondering what impact this will have on crime in both the short- and long-term. In this study, we examine officially recorded property crime rates for March, 2020, as reported for the state of Queensland, Australia. We use ARIMA modeling techniques to compute six-month-ahead forecasts of property damage, shop theft, other theft, burglary, fraud, and motor vehicle theft rates and then compare these forecasts (and their 95% confidence intervals) with the observed data for March 2020. We conclude that the observed rates of reported property offending across Queensland were significantly lower than expected for shop theft, other theft and credit-card fraud but statistically unchanged for property damage, burglary, and motor-vehicle theft.",TRUE,FALSE,arima|covid-19|forecast|property crime,2020-05-09T20:00:21.944057,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-09T19:59:57.876187,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Jason Payne and Anthony Morgan,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/citation/,de9nc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb5546ba2199501035da41a/,5eb5546ba2199501035da41a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/de9nc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/de9nc,NA

For every scientific development and policy implementation which comprehensively connects this pandemic, the event is not very sound about the extensive socio-economic impact ushered with this disaster. In this paper, using a combined qualitative-quantitative approach, Q method, we have tried to assess the peoples’ discernment from different perspectives. This work was done through questionnaire survey method, during the national level lockdown 1.0 in India. We have differentiated the perception of youth respondents into 7 factors taking 6 dimensions on Covid-19 pandemic (viz. science, society, environment, economy, politics and religion). This work yielded a firsthand ground level insight on the comprehensive but diverse responses from the youths and their opinion for Covid-19 pandemic in India. We are hopeful that this work might open new avenues to understand the people-Covid-19 connection, both for future research and policy implementation.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|India|pandemic|Principal Component Analysis|Q methodology,2020-05-08T11:49:00.686957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-08T11:48:48.235671,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/citation/,4qhgd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb544b9a2199501035d8115/,5eb544b9a2199501035d8115,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qhgd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4qhgd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4qhgd,NA
