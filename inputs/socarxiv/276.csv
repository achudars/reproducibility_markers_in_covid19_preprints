[working paper],"This paper underlines the importance of space for the transition towards the circular economy (CE). Policy-makers and industry give most attention to closing material flows, largely ignoring the important spatial implications. The CE requires (re)producing and consuming as locally as possible to avoid problem displacement. This clashes with the general urban land use policy to externalize (re)manufacturing activities. This paper proposes a methodology that combines territorial and network perspectives to understand this conflict.

His ideas about Islam from within the Muslim circle attempt to transform and renew concepts of the God-creation relationship. Important, yet not unique, this book offers ideas similarly expressed by intellectuals like Amina Wadud, Farid Esack, Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, Fazlur Rahman, and Muhammad Arkoun. Religion remains meaningful only when it manages to keep up with the social transformations affecting its members. Religion essentially needs to be constantly rethought, just as Khorchide attempts to achieve with this book. His thoughts are not without ambiguities and can certainly be challenged on several levels. But in the end, this is what the author calls for with his support for spiritual freedom and independent reasoning. This work makes an intriguing read for all who are interested in alternative streams of Islamic theology, specifically those trends emerging in the European university landscapes. There exists no justification for denouncing and rejecting these drafts as 'only products of the West'. Most Muslim reform scholars originate or have lived a considerable time in Muslim societies.

Initially the focus of this centred on the proliferation of online groups and websites promoting and distributing discriminatory content. Since the introduction of more interactive tools and platforms in the mid-2000s that enabled new and faster ways of disseminating content in a relatively anonymous fashion, concerns about online hate speech becoming a pervasive behavior have increased.

Current research and analysis acknowledge the complex nature of online hate, the mediating role of technology and the influence of other contextual factors (e.g. social or political events). However, despite the growing attention on the topic, New Zealand-based research looking at personal experiences and/or exposure to online hate is surprisingly absent. This study seeks to address this gap. It builds on existing international research on young people’s experiences to explore those of the adult New Zealand population based on a nationally representative sample. The research instrument used for this study was an online survey. The survey was administered by Colmar Brunton in June 2018.

A Comparison of White and Asian Americans’ Perception of Their Social Rank,"Asians are often viewed as the “model minority” group for assumptions about their high income and education level. Does this necessarily translate to higher self-esteem, social desirability, and self-perceived social rank for Asians? Building upon literature examining confidence, beauty, masculinity and the “model minority” stereotype, I use the General Social Survey (2016—2018) to study the relationships between attractiveness and perceived social rank for 124 Asian Americans and 3,038 White Americans. The attractiveness data was collected by the GSS rating respondents on their physical attractiveness. Social rank helps examine a general sense of perceived ranking in society that may not be explicitly expressed by socio-economic class. I propose that a high attractiveness rating positively affects the level of self-perceived ranking for Whites but not for Asians. I also control for sex, age, family income and education. The results of the regression support my hypothesis showing a statistically significant relationship between attractiveness and social rank for the White sample but not the Asian sample. However, the strongest predictor of self-perceived social rank was the level of family income. Therefore, the more money someone makes, the higher they self-reported their social rank for both Asians and Whites. Due to the limited sample size of Asians, further research including a larger group of Asian participants should be conducted to study the relationship between attractiveness and social rank.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian American|Race|Social Rank,2019-12-20T14:49:03.794488,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-20T14:48:48.173141,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/citation/,6ajb5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfc09780236b8000c75b70d/,5dfc09780236b8000c75b70d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ajb5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ajb5

Past research shows benefits from spending time in green spaces, including improved well-being, as well as better mental and physical health (van den Berg et al. 2010; Atuoye et al. 2019; Bingley 2013). However, these studies focus on spending time in parks, gardens, or other natural environments and build their cases around the advantageous effects resulting from actual time spent in such places (Fan, Das, and Chen 2011; Litt et al. 2015; van den Berg et al. 2010). This study focuses instead on whether exposure to, regardless of time spent in green spaces, has similar effects. Using attention restoration theory and the theory of therapeutic landscapes, I hypothesize that the more one agrees that they have access to or views of natural environments, the fewer days of poor mental health they will have. This study uses data from the 2018 General Social Survey, with a restricted sample of only those who are employed or temporarily not working (N = 649). After controlling for race, family income, full-time employment status, size of place, and dwelling type, results show no significant relationship between access to or views of natural environments and days of poor mental health. However, multivariate results show that controlling for all other factors, white individuals had more days of poor mental health, and those who work full-time, live in single-family detached homes, or have higher family incomes had fewer days of poor mental health. While the results do not support the proposed hypotheses, the bivariate correlations begin to indicate which populations have access to green spaces, as well as which may be more likely to experience poor mental health based on demographic characteristics.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-20T14:54:02.331238,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-20T14:53:53.182772,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/citation/,mpejg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfc049a0236b8000c75af89/,5dfc049a0236b8000c75af89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mpejg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mpejg

It starts by asking: how do market prices work? Beyond mainstream economics, I find two distinct answers for this question: either prices are outcomes, coordinated by social structures through pricing scripts, or prices are performative-epistemological forces of marketization. Reviewing these two approaches to prices, I suggest they differ in their definitions of market knowledge, pricing, and price. I then examine these definitions by applying them to empirical examples of pricing in practice, drawn from ethnographic fieldwork in the Swedish meat industry. The conclusion presents a unified theory of market prices as a ‘structural episteme’: prices work recursively as instances of taken-for-granted knowledge about market-relevant social structures. Pricing, then, is the scripted marketization process in which this knowledge is performed through monetary quantification, thereby (re)producing said structures.",TRUE,FALSE,knowledge|markets|performativity|pricing|structure,2019-12-20T14:51:03.822326,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-20T14:50:36.855426,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/citation/,qp5yr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfbd740fad251000a6a76b0/,5dfbd740fad251000a6a76b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qp5yr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qp5yr

Launched in 2000 by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the GGP is a longitudinal comparative survey of 18-79 year olds in 20 countries in Europe and beyond, run by a consortium of research institutions. It is based on a relatively decentralized management model and relies on considerable post-hoc harmonization of data. The international “core” questionnaire is either adapted to the different national contexts or partly incorporated into existing surveys. Using data from the surveys administration, we examine the quality of compliance and standardization in the GGP and whether this affects data usage. Firstly, we analyze the extent to which instruments from the core questionnaire were fielded within each of the countries in the GGP. The results show that on average across countries, 66% of instruments in the core questionnaire were captured but this varies widely from 23% to 84%. Secondly, we take administrative data from the GGP website to capture the number of times each country dataset is downloaded, and we study whether those countries with greater compliance are more likely to be used in scientific analysis. We supplement this with the number of times a country dataset is used in peer reviewed comparative publications and cited in scientific articles. The paper concludes with some reflections on the analysis of compliance and usage in assessing the interest of comparative projects.",TRUE,FALSE,Comparability|Cross-national Research|Survey Research,2019-12-20T14:51:22.895713,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-20T14:51:01.765682,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/citation/,8c24f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfbd61f0236b8000a7411c9/,5dfbd61f0236b8000a7411c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c24f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8c24f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8c24f
