In view of this, a time series approach is considered to examine the empirical evidence of Fisher’s effect in the country. By applying OLS and Unit Root test, the estimated value is used to determine the casual relationship between interest rates and inflation for the monthly sample period of August 1996 to December 2003. The empirical results suggest that there does not exist any co-movement of inflation with interest rates and the relationship between the variables is also not significant for Bangladesh. Further, the trends advocate that the inflation premium, equal to expected inflation that investors add to real-risk free rate of return, is ineffective in the country.",TRUE,FALSE,Bangladesh|Inflation|Interest rate,2019-02-20T14:34:42.446196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T14:31:34.179820,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/citation/,udpwj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d45t8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/relationships/node/,d45t8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d12068d5d98001c2f9e4e/,5c6d12068d5d98001c2f9e4e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udpwj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/udpwj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udpwj,NA

And if markets are inefficient, investors can use available information ignored by the market to earn abnormally high returns on their investments. In this context this paper tries to find evidence supporting the reality of weak-form efficiency of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) by examining the issues of market risk-return relationship and market depth or liquidity for DSE. The study uses a data set of daily market index and returns for the period of 1994 to 2005 and weekly market capital turnover in proportion of total market capital for the period of 1994 to 2005. The paper also looks about the market risk (systemic risk) and return where it is found that market rate of return of DSE is very low or sometimes negative. Eventually Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which envisages the relationship between risk and the expected rate of return on a risky security, is found unrelated in DSE market. As proper risk-return relationships of the market is seems to be deficient in DSE and the market is not liquid, interest of the available investors are bring into being very insignificant.

Some contend that increasing aridity exacerbated conflict, while others have found that increasing temperature ramped up conflict. Here, we report a study in which we sought to resolve this disagreement. We collated annually-resolved conflict and climate data, and then created a Bayesian time-series model for analysing count-based prehistoric and historic data. We carried out three analyses, one covering more or less the whole of the Classic Period (292-900 CE), one focused on the Early Classic (292-600 CE), and one that concentrated on the Late Classic (600-900 CE). Our analyses indicated that climate change likely did impact Classic Maya conflict levels, but our results differed from those of previous studies in two important ways. First, we found that the impact of climate change is only evident during the Late Classic. Second, we found that while increasing summer temperature exacerbated conflict, increasing aridity suppressed it. Thus, our study offers a new, more complex perspective on Classic Maya climate-conflict dynamics. It also has implications for our understanding of other aspects of Classic Maya history and for the debate about the likely impact of the current bout of climate change on conflict levels.",TRUE,FALSE,aridity|Bayesian time-series analysis|Classic Maya|Climate Change|conflict|human-environment interaction|temperature,2019-02-20T13:20:27.975648,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T13:04:35.760749,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,William Christopher Carleton|Dave Campbell|Mark Collard,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/citation/,ntv8y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3zq9j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/relationships/node/,3zq9j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6c68628d5d98001a3039f5/,5c6c68628d5d98001a3039f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ntv8y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ntv8y,NA

In this study, we analyze data from a survey experiment designed to assess public opinion about a range of workplace diversity policies. We examine how support for these policies among employed respondents varies by race, gender, and by the targeted population (i.e. whether the policies aim to improve the workplace representation of women or racial minorities). Using OLS regression models to analyze a diverse sample of employed persons participating in the survey, we find that women, blacks, and Latina/os are more supportive of diversity policies than men and whites, and a substantial portion of these gender/race differences can be explained by group-differences in the belief that discrimination causes inequality. In addition, we find that respondents report lower levels of support for workplace policies when these policies are framed as a mechanism to increase diversity than when they are framed as being needed to address discrimination or if no justification is given for the policy. Our findings highlight the role of inequality beliefs in shaping worker support for diversity policies, suggesting directions for  future research on how such beliefs are developed.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|inequality|public opinoin|race|Workplace diversity policies,2019-02-20T13:24:07.555977,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T13:07:39.861513,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",William Scarborough,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/citation/,yfznx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4cus3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/relationships/node/,4cus3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6c469f62c82a0017d63685/,5c6c469f62c82a0017d63685,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yfznx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yfznx,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2019.01.002

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992 (UNFCCC) established a foundation for the development, application and diffusion of low-carbon technologies. Against this background, it is useful to analyse how the Paris Agreement 2015 deals with the subject of intellectual property, technology transfer, and climate change. While there was discussion of a number of options for intellectual property and climate change, the final Paris Agreement 2015 contains no text on intellectual property. There is text, though, on technology transfer. The Paris Agreement 2015 relies upon technology networks and alliances in order to promote the diffusion and dissemination of green technologies. In order to achieve technology transfer, there has been an effort to rely on a number of formal technology networks, alliances, and public–private partnerships—including the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN); the World Intellectual Property Organization’s WIPO GREEN; Mission Innovation; the Breakthrough Energy Coalition; and the International Solar Alliance. There have been grand hopes and ambitions in respect of these collaborative and co-operative ventures. However, there have also been significant challenges in terms of funding, support, and operation. In a case of innovation policy pluralism, there also seems to be a significant level of overlap and duplication between the diverse international initiatives. There have been concerns about whether such technology networks are effective, efficient, adaptable, and accountable. There is a need to better align intellectual property, innovation policy, and technology transfer in order to achieve access to clean energy and climate justice under the framework of the Paris Agreement 2015. At a conceptual level, philosophical discussions about climate justice should be grounded in pragmatic considerations about intellectual property and technology transfer. An intellectual property mechanism is necessary to provide for research, development, and deployment of clean technologies. There is a need to ensure that the technology mechanism of the Paris Agreement 2015 can enable the research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies at a scale to address the global challenges of climate change.",TRUE,FALSE,climate finance|climate justice|climate law|innovation law|innovation policy|Intellectual Property|SOCARXIV,2019-02-19T11:54:08.338783,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-19T11:53:24.508303,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c29|Law|International Trade Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/citation/,fxhvm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6b71078d5d98001b2e6865/,5c6b71078d5d98001b2e6865,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxhvm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxhvm,https://doi.org/10.3390/laws8010007

We analyze a game-theoretic model that shows how the threat of corruption affects the incentives of non-corrupt politicians to enlist the help of lobbyists to make more informed decisions. Politicians face a dilemma because voters cannot always tell whether a politician allows access to lobbyists in order to solicit corruption or to seek information. Thus, a non-corrupt politician may deny access to lobbyists to signal that she is non-corrupt even though doing so impedes her ability to make good policy. This signaling may decrease the welfare of the voters depending on the value of the lost policy information relative to the value of screening out corrupt politicians.",TRUE,FALSE,Campaigns|Lobbying|Signaling,2019-02-19T11:54:07.175294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-19T11:53:43.737097,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,Keith E.
