In conjunction to the waves of technology and the era of globalization, there is also a demand for excellent communication skills among today’s younger generations especially university students. University students are expected to be well equipped with proficient English language and outstanding communication skills which is what they are currently lacking at. Therefore, a specific Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) for English for Communication is designed and developed to provide learners with the ladder towards good communication skills. This study is a design and develop research of study which consists of twenty-two undergraduate students in a public university and the whole duration of this study is fourteen weeks altogether. The particular well developed MOOCs then later implemented to the learners and learners evaluation on the course are taken into consideration. This study intended to accommodate students with Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and to investigate the learners’ perceptions on the use of MOOCs in helping them to develop good communication skills. This study also evaluated the developed MOOCs’ usability and the students’ interaction level during learning along with the impacts of particular developed MOOCs towards their development of communication skills.

This study emphasizes the inclusive character of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). After careful assessment of the multiple relationships within UTAUT, a modified version of the theory was hypothesized then researched for the impact it has on the English as Foreign Language (EFL) context in Morocco. The technology acceptance model in this paper emphasized four directions connecting performance expectancy, effort expectancy, teacher feedback and compatibility to behavioral intention, also referred to as the determinants of behavioral intention to use MALL.  For the purpose of this study, a technology enhanced environment was created. A total number of 156 EFL common core students were brought to interact on a WhatsApp-based platform by means of text-messaging. The WhatsApp treatment was optimized to synchronize with the institutionalized character of the teaching of English in Moroccan public schools. The questionnaire method was used for data collection. The data were screened for missingness, normality and outliers. Then, multiple reliability and validity tests were performed to substantiate the legitimacy of the dataset. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used in the assessment of the measurement model and the structural model. The outputs of structural modelling corroborated the hypothesized directions connecting teacher feedback and compatibility to behavioral intention to use MALL while there was lack of support for the relationships linking performance expectancy and effort expectancy to behavioral intention to use MALL.",TRUE,FALSE,educational technology|English as a foreign language|mobile language learning|Morocco|technology acceptance,2019-08-04T20:58:01.640243,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:57:42.751696,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/citation/,mru9e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4730bc90489f001949b2c0/,5d4730bc90489f001949b2c0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mru9e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mru9e/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mru9e

It is cutting across various population boundaries and has almost assumed an endemic proportion. Its consequential impact on the standard language has acquired greater importance. This paper aims to determine the perceptions and attitudes of English Second Language (ESL) learners at Aligarh Muslim University towards the consequences of texting on Standard English. The data were collected through a five-point scale questionnaire from ninety students who were enrolled at Aligarh Muslim University during the academic year 2010-2011. The respondents completed a 16-item questionnaire. The students from which the data were collected were grouped according to their levels. The results indicate the negative impact of this new usage of the language in breaking the rules of English language and influencing their literacy.

Variety of measures were employed to gain as comprehensive an insight as warranted given the study limitations of a small sample, brief study period and relatively unsophisticated but freely available AI chatbot. The measures ranged from surveys of anxiety, attitudes toward daily chatbot usage, oral interviews and IELTS testing of English speaking ability. The results were cautiously encouraging: nearly universal endorsement of AI as a non-threatening interlocutor positively impacting subjects’ confidence and to the extent limited by time constraint, enhancing individual components of the IELTS paradigm. Moreover, significant linear relationship between individual anxiety survey items and overall IELTS scores at baseline was observed, lending a measure of validity to the construct developed for the occasion.

This paper evaluates the efficacy of CALL in improving students’ writing skills and provides innovative techniques and robust strategies for long-lasting learning. The research seeks to fill in the knowledge gap regarding prospects of using CALL in the Kingdom with these main research questions; 1) how is the technology presently used for teaching the writing skills?; 2) what is the true impact of using CALL on students’ writing skills?; 3) which area of the language (organization, structure, content, grammar) sees the most improvements by CALL to make them better writers? A quantitative research design was used for this study. The sample was sixty female students of a Saudi University divided equally into control and experimental groups. The elicited data analysis indicates that the performance scores of two groups differ significantly when taught through CALL. The research contends that using CALL can enhance students’ writing skills over a short period of time when compared to the traditional ways of improving the writing skills.

It is challenging to apply collaborative learning methods because students tend to engage passively with traditional methods of lectures. Several studies have suggested that digital interactive technologies such as Zuvio Interactive Response System (IRS) have been applied to increase learning motivation. However, related studies on using IRS in English a foreign language (EFL) classrooms are limited in Taiwan, especially from learners' perspectives. The aim of this study was to integrate an interactive response system into an English grammar course and to explore whether the assistance of this digital tool could promote students' learning motivation and whether it could facilitate a student learning environment. Based on the research background and rationale, the following research questions were investigated: (1) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward their learning attitudes? (2) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward learning contents? (3) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward classroom interaction? An experimental design was employed. This research was conducted in this one-semester project to uncover 49 EFL learners’ views of IRS in a grammar class. Zuvio IRS and the British Council Grammar Snacks videos were utilized in this experimental instruction.

However elected officials are most often lawyers which rely on experts in the field, or even lobbyists to inform their decision making.  A list of the educational background of the United States Congress was created and the changes from the 2018 election highlighted.  An analysis of the congressional record was also done showing a recent decline in selected scientific terms.

Because questions are asked in an indirect way, it is used to inquire about illegal activities or behaviours people might not want to openly admit to. The method provides an estimate of how many people within a population are performing the behaviour in question. Although using UCT will not uncover why people are performing a given behaviour, its analysis can produce results to indicate which characteristics (e.g. location, gender, age, income) of the population surveyed are more likely to affect whether a person is engaging in the behaviour.
