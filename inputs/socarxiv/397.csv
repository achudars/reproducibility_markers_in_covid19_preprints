Although most people agree that computational reproducibility is important, it is still difficult to achieve in practice. In this paper, we describe our approach to enabling computational reproducibility for the 12 papers in this special issue of Socius about the Fragile Families Challenge. Our approach draws on two tools commonly used by professional software engineers but not widely used by academic researchers: software containers (e.g., Docker) and cloud computing (e.g., Amazon Web Services). These tools enabled us to standardize the computing environment around each submission, which will ease computational reproducibility both today and in the future.

We find that Latin American elites prefer international organizations to formulate climate policies, support imposing increasing fines on violators, and favor renewing agreements every five years.

We find that villages where property rights were granted to the cultivators have more skewed sex-ratios, lower female literacy, and lower female labor force participation rate than villages where property rights were granted to the landlord.

I sketch applicable models that may involve trust as an important feature of many sharing economy interactions but also highlight other strategic considerations that superficially look similar to trust problems but may be understood more fruitfully by alternative models.  More specifically, I discuss various types of two-person dilemmas such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Trust Game, but also N-person dilemmas, including common pool problems, exchange systems, and club goods. Solutions to the cooperation problems implied by these dilemmas are also discussed.

We leverage the data infrastructure shared by the main edX instance and one regional Open edX provider, Edraak in Jordan, to compare the experience of learners from Arab countries on both platforms. Comparing learners from Arab countries on edX to those on Edraak, the Edraak population has a more even gender balance, more learners with lower education levels, greater participation from more developing countries, higher levels of persistence and completion, and a larger total population of learners. This ""apples to apples"" comparison of MOOC learners is facilitated by an approach to multiplatform MOOC analytics, which employs parallel research processes to create joint aggregate datasets without sharing identifiable data across institutions.

The current study evaluates three competing theories of opposition to democracy – developmentalist, culturalist, and elitist – using a series of multi-level regression models that combine individual- and country-level variables. Results of our statistical analyses suggest that: 1) country-level indicators of social, political, and economic development are not consistently related to individual support for democracy; 2) macro-cultural factors have mixed effects on individual support for democracy; and 3) individual income and education have strong effects on individual support for democracy, but this relationship is mediated by country-level economic development.

But, what happens when privileged families’ interests conflict with schools’ stated goals? Focusing on the case of homework, and drawing insights from organizational theory, cultural capital theory, and research on parent involvement in schools, I examine how schools’ dependence on higher-SES White families influences their enforcement of rules. Using a longitudinal, ethnographic study of one socioeconomically diverse public elementary school, I find that teachers wanted to enforce homework rules, but they worried doing so would lead to conflict with the higher-SES White “helicopter” parents, on whom they relied most for support. Thus, teachers selectively enforced rules, using evidence of “helicopter” parenting to determine which students “deserved” leeway and lenience. Those decisions, in turn, contributed to inequalities in teachers’ punishment and evaluation of students. Broadly, these findings suggest privilege-dependence leads schools to appease privileged families, even when those actions contradict the school’s stated goals. These findings also challenge standard policy assumptions about parent involvement and homework, and they suggest policies aimed at reducing the power of privilege are necessary for lessening inequalities in school.",TRUE,FALSE,children|education|ethnography|family|homework|inequality|interviews|organizations|parental involvement|parenthood|qualitative|rules|schools|teachers,2019-03-15T00:44:41.741227,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:44:22.633061,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/citation/,vk8bt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c89673e1d73810017c64512/,5c89673e1d73810017c64512,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vk8bt/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vk8bt

Low-income racial minority students may have additional personal and academic issues associated with demonstrating grit and overcoming barriers to entry (i.e. institutional racism) over the course of their lives. When the campus environment is not socially or culturally supportive of racial minority and first-generation college students, there is an added risk of mental health deterioration stemming from isolation for these students. The struggle to persist in college, and do so alone, can lead many to experience symptoms of impending “burnout,” or disengagement from academic settings. Drawing from a sample of interviews with low-income racial minority strivers—students who were once highly engaged—this paper offers insight into both causes and solutions for college burnout. Findings suggest that it is important to understand how experiences of isolation manifest to better support minority student populations and foster their academic reengagement to achieve at high levels. This paper outlines recommendations for improving the college experiences of racial minority and first-generation students, including examples of resources and recommendations to improve the higher education landscape towards more inclusivity and equity.",TRUE,FALSE,Agency|Burnout|College Persistence|Cultural Competency|Equity|Grit|Higher Education|Mental Health,2019-03-15T00:43:27.170438,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:42:52.481917,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,Anindya Kundu,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/citation/,5pyhq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c893e8766b44d001c75f714/,5c893e8766b44d001c75f714,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pyhq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5pyhq/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11256-019-00501-w,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5pyhq

We re-examine this issue by taking a more nuanced look at the inquiry scale in PISA 2015. Previous studies using PISA and other ILSA assume that scales measuring inquiry-based instruction are invariant across regions/countries. This study tests whether measurement invariance could indeed be established, and if not, what regional patterns of instructional practice exist. This study also examines whether the association between inquiry and learning outcomes depend upon the provision of teacher guidance. Participants were 151,721 students from 5,089 schools from 10 highest and 10 lowest science performers in PISA 2015. Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses found that measurement invariance cannot be established, suggesting substantial regional variation in the pattern of inquiry-based instruction. Exploratory factor analyses confirm that at the measurement level, inquiry takes different forms in each region. However, at the conceptual level many regions exhibit a pattern which contrasted between “Guided inquiry” and “Independent inquiry”. Results of structural equation modelling show that inquiry is positively associated with outcomes when it incorporates teacher guidance, and negatively when it doesn’t. This pattern of association is remarkably consistent across the 20 regions examined. These findings are in line with current theories regarding the importance of scaffolding in learning from inquiry. This study suggests that it would be misguided to use PISA findings to support arguments to scale back inquiry and other constructivist approaches to teaching science.",TRUE,FALSE,epistemic belief|inquiry-based instruction|intrinsic motivation|large-scale assessment of learning|measurement invariance|science achievement|scientific literacy,2019-03-15T00:41:27.940578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:40:44.113983,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/citation/,aqsbj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c89225b245c0a001ad392d1/,5c89225b245c0a001ad392d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqsbj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aqsbj/,https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2020.1716093,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aqsbj

Its first vehicle, the Model T, introduced the concept of mass production and automobile affordability to the masses.  Today, the market is full of domestic and foreign competitors, yet, Ford has struggled to remain competitive, even though it promotes itself as America’s best-selling brand. Its stock was recently downgraded, and recently, it announced its intentions to only sell sports utility vehicles, trucks, Mustangs and Focus, in other words, it will stop selling most of its passenger cars. Conversely, Toyota continues to lead the market in passenger car sales, while newcomer Tesla struggles to deliver on its backlog of 500,000 electric vehicle orders. 
Ford has strong brand equity, has automated production facilities and a large franchised dealer network across the globe. Yet, it is rapidly losing passenger car market share, its profits are eroding, and its new vision is confusing. Furthermore, the company is facing a significant threat from well capitalized new competitors entering from the tech industry. 
The company, on the other hand, has enjoyed significant success in mainland China, where the demand for American automobiles continuous to be strong. Yet, the company needs to assume a cost leadership position and attempt to use this strategy to increase market share. 
The contention in this paper is that an adequate approach for the company appears to be a combination of market penetration in the domestic front, market expansion in Asia and other parts of the globe, and a product development approach that ushers cost reductions.",TRUE,FALSE,Auto Industry|Ford|PESTEL|Strategy|VRIO,2019-03-15T00:38:49.685450,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:38:30.716032,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/citation/,q3m7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c891f741d73810018c10469/,5c891f741d73810018c10469,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3m7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q3m7g/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q3m7g
