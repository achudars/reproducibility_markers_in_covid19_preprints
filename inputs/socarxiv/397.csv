Multiple lines of evidence suggest that there was indeed an influx of people from regions north of the Black Sea or further east in the fourth century CE, but there is no indication of a large-scale migration from central Asia. It is possible that the climatic downturn and increased aridity in the 430s to 450s disrupted both the economic organisation of the incomers and that of the local Romanised population, requiring both to adopt new subsistence strategies.

A question of great theoretical and practical importance is how successful social institutions get established and spread across groups and societies. Here, using institutionalized punishment in small-scale societies as an example, we contrast two prominent mechanisms - selective imitation and self-interested design - with respect to their ability to converge to cooperative social institutions. While selective imitation has received a great deal of attention in studies of social and cultural evolution, the theoretical toolbox for studying self-interested design is limited. Recently Perry et al. (2018) expanded this toolbox by introducing a novel approach, which they called foresight, generalizing standard myopic best response for the case of individuals with a bounded ability to anticipate actions of their group-mates and care about future payoffs. Here we apply this approach to two general types of collective action – “us vs. nature” and “us vs. them” games. Our results show that foresight increases leaders’ willingness to punish free-riders. This, in turn, leads to increased production and the emergence of an effective institution for collective action. We also observed that largely similar outcomes can be achieved by selective imitation, as argued earlier. Foresight and selective imitation can interact synergistically leading to a faster convergence to an equilibrium. Our approach is applicable to many other types of social

From 1995 to 2015, greenhouse gas emissions from just material production increased by 120%, with 11 billion tons of CO2-equivalent emitted in 2015. As a proportion of global emissions, material production rose from 15 to 23%. China accounted for 75% of the growth. In terms of the first use of materials, two-fifths of the carbon footprint of materials is attributed to construction, and two-fifths to the manufacturing of machinery, vehicles and other durable products.

The conjoint examines the impact of inclusiveness, popular control, considered judgement, transparency, efficiency, and transferability on citizens’ evaluations of participatory processes. Furthermore, it is examined whether the evaluations differ by policy issue and process preference of the respondents.

Despite its critical importance, it curiously remains poorly understood in a number of dimensions. In order to address this, we have analysed peer review to assess where the major gaps in our theoretical and empirical understanding of it lie. We identify core themes including editorial responsibility, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, the function and quality of peer review, and the social and epistemic implications of peer review. The high-priority gaps are focused around increased accountability and justification in decision making processes for editors, and developing a deeper, empirical understanding of the social impact of peer review. Addressing this at the bare minimum will require the design of a consensus for a minimal set of standards for what constitutes peer review, and the development of a shared data infrastructure to support this. Such a field requires sustained funding and commitment from publishers and research funders, who both have a commitment to uphold the integrity of the published scholarly record. We use this to present a guide for the future of peer review, and the development of a new research discipline based on the study of peer review.",TRUE,FALSE,open science|peer review|scholarly communication|scholarly publishing,2019-08-30T10:45:44.356374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-30T10:45:27.438555,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/citation/,jq623,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s9623/,s9623,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6780d372151000199bf26b/,5d6780d372151000199bf26b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq623/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jq623/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jq623,NA

Past research offers three explanations of this phenomenon: 1. the economic explanation maintaining that parents contribute in order to supplement lagging public investments in education; 2. the opportunity hoarding explanation arguing parents contribute to secure educational advantages for their children; and 3. the civic engagement and social capital explanation that sees parent fundraising as an element of parents’ democratic participation in schools. This article considers the efficacy of these explanations in the case of parent fundraising in a Manhattan elementary school I call PSX. Applied to data collected through ethnographic research among PSX parents, the existing explanations provide an incomplete understanding of parent fundraising because they focus on the intentions and motivations of parents. A normative-institutional perspective provides additional explanatory leverage. Educational policy and normative expectations link parental fundraising and school quality. The money supplied by parents is an easy-to-read measure of a good school, and, by association, good parents. Parents give and give more because that is what they are asked to do.",TRUE,FALSE,Education|Gifted and Talented|Institutional Ethnography|New York CIty|Opportunity Hoarding|Parental Involvement|Parent Fundraising|Parent Organizations,2019-08-28T20:55:46.657011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-28T20:55:25.047350,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/citation/,u5ew7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d66e1c672151000179a793f/,5d66e1c672151000179a793f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ew7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u5ew7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u5ew7,NA
