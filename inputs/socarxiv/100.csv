The rise of the US$20 billion emotion AI industry will transform the future workplace. Yet, besides no international consensus on the principles or standards for such technologies, there is a lack of cross-cultural research on future job seekers’ attitude toward such use of AI technologies. This study collects a cross-sectional dataset of 1,015 survey responses of international students from 48 countries and 8 regions worldwide. A majority of the respondents (52%) are concerned about being managed by AI. Following the hypothetico-deductivist philosophy of science, we use the MCMC Hamiltonian approach and conduct a detailed comparison of 10 Bayesian network models with the PSIS-LOO method. We consistently find having a higher income, being male, majoring in business, and/or self-rated familiarity with AI correlate with a more positive view of emotional AI in the workplace. There is also a stark cross-cultural and cross-regional difference. Our analysis shows people from economically less developed regions (Africa, Oceania, Central Asia) tend to exhibit less concern for AI managers. And for East Asian countries, 64% of the Japanese, 56% of the South Korean, and 42% of the Chinese professed the trusting attitude. In contrast, an overwhelming majority of 75% of the European and Northern American possesses the worrying/neutral attitude toward being managed by AI. Regarding religion, Muslim students correlate with the most concern toward emotional AI in the workplace (β_Islam_Attitude’s mean =-0.16, sd =0.10; β_Buddhism_Attitude’s mean =-0.05, sd =0.07; β_Christian_Attitude ‘s mean = -0.10, sd= 0.09). When religiosity is higher, the correlation becomes stronger for Muslim and Buddhist students.

Therefore, religious heterogamy and its negative effects on religious socialization have been associated with the generational decline of religion in Western societies. How about China, where religion has been resurging in the last few decades? Existing studies suggest two opposing possibilities: the restrictive national context may diminish parental impact on religious socialization, or the family influence withstands contextual pressures. Using the 2007 Spiritual Life Survey of Chinese Residents and logistic regression models, we examine patterns of association between having one or two religious parents during childhood and current religious affiliation, beliefs, behavior, and salience of respondents in China. Analyses reveal that despite China’s atheist education system and strict religion policies, having at least one religiously affiliated parent is associated with increased religiosity compared to having two nonreligious parents. As the number of interreligious marriages rises in Chinese society, religious heterogamy contributes to the growth of religion among younger generations. Whereas religious heterogamy in the West has a secularizing effect on the next generation and contributes to religion’s decline, religious heterogamy in secular nations such as China has a religionizing effect and contributes to religion’s rise.",TRUE,FALSE,China|heterogamy|religious socialization|secularization,2021-01-23T17:03:22.079335,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-23T17:02:49.115442,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/SPRTCHNA.asp,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/citation/,4ukcq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600b78fa75226b00e5518b01/,600b78fa75226b00e5518b01,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ukcq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ukcq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4ukcq,https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12667

Racism and its diverse historical manifestations should in theory be key areas of study for historical sociology: the displacement of populations, the dispossession of lands, genocide, slavery, the coercive exploitation of workers of color, and the creation of a way of seeing people through race. Yet, historical sociological scholarship has to date failed to address how racism and colonialism have structured the modern world. This, we argue, is the result of two problems: First, historical sociology’s ontology and vision of modernity does not see colonialism as central to and constituting the modern world. Second, historical sociology’s Weberian roots produced a methodological approach that detaches theoretical categories from specific historical contexts in the pursuit of generalization. This approach cannot capture the historicity of theory and thus address the subfield’s racial structures of knowledge. As an alternative, we propose that previously silenced anticolonial sociologists provide a different model for historical sociology, one that emphasizes the centrality of colonialism and empire in the constitution of modernity and locates theoretical categories in this historical context. We argue that to overcome the racial underpinning of its knowledge structures, historical sociology has to rebuild itself in this anticolonial mode.",TRUE,FALSE,anticolonial|colonialism|empire|historical sociology|postcolonial|race|racism|theory,2021-01-23T17:02:41.852533,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-23T17:02:16.218980,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,Ricarda Hammer|Jose Itzigsohn,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/citation/,pgce4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600b70fd327cbe00fc7b9155/,600b70fd327cbe00fc7b9155,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgce4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pgce4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pgce4,NA

While it is commonly assumed that environmental conditions partially explain variation in visitation to coastal recreation areas across space and time, scarce and inconsistent visitation observations challenge our ability to reveal these variations. With the ubiquity of mobile phone usage, novel sources of digitally derived data are increasingly available at a massive scale. Applications of mobile phone locational data have been effective in research on urban-centric human mobility and transportation, but little work has been conducted on understanding behavioral patterns surrounding dynamic natural resources. We present an application of cell-phone locational data to estimate the effects of beach closures on visitation to coastal access points. Our results indicate that beach closures on Cape Cod, MA, USA have a significant negative correlation to visitation at those beaches with closures, while closures at a sample of coastal access points elsewhere in New England have no detected impact on visitation. Our findings represent geographic mobility patterns for over 7 million unique coastal visits and suggest that closures resulted in approximately 1,800 (0.026%) displaced visits for Cape Cod during the summer season of 2017. We demonstrate the potential for human-mobility data derived from mobile phones to reveal the scale of use and behavior in response to changes in dynamic natural resources.

However, to date there has been no targeted exploration of how COVID-19 may have influenced youth offending, which may be more heavily impacted by the changes heralded by COVID-19 containment measures. This study examines changes in youth offending in an Australia jurisdiction, Queensland, following the implementation of COVID-19 containment measures from the period April to June, 2020. Additionally, differences in impacts across community types were explored. Findings from panel regression indicated significant declines in youth property offending, offences against the person and public order offences in this period, but no significant changes in illicit drug offences. There were also significant differences across communities according to socio-economic status, per cent Indigenous population, and the extent of commercial or industrial land use. Findings are explored with reference to environmental crime theories and the potential impacts of social, economic and policing changes that occurred in this period.",TRUE,FALSE,community characteristics|COVID-19|pandemic|property offending|routine activities theory|social distancing|youth offending,2021-01-22T06:23:01.983416,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-22T06:22:28.982148,FALSE,NA,no,Data is available from the Griffith University Social Analytics Laboratory.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Molly McCarthy|Jacqueline Homel|James Ogilvie|&amp; Troy Allard,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/citation/,59bzv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600a2f2b75226b0039514c89/,600a2f2b75226b0039514c89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/59bzv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/59bzv,NA

To understand the nature and magnitude of school closures across states, we collected detailed primary data—the Elementary School Operating Status database (ESOS)—to measure the percentage of school districts offering in-person, remote, and hybrid instruction models for elementary schools by state in September 2020. We link these data to the Current Population Survey to evaluate the association between school reopening and parents’ labor force participation rates, comparing 2020 labor force participation rates to those observed pre-pandemic in 2019.  We find that, across states, the maternal labor force participation rate fell to a greater extent than that of fathers. In 2019, mothers’ rate of labor force participation was about 18 percentage points lower than fathers’. By 2020, this gap grew by five percentage points in states where schools offered primarily remote instruction. We show that schools are a vital source of care for young children, and that without in-person instruction, mothers have been sidelined from the labor force. The longer these conditions remain in place, the more difficult it may be for mothers to fully recover from prolonged spells of non-employment, resulting in reduced occupational opportunities and lifetime earnings.",TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|employment|gender|inequality|mothers|public schools,2021-01-21T20:08:02.409080,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-21T20:07:42.219598,FALSE,NA,available,Uses data fro m Current Population Survey (available through IPUMS) and ESOS (Elemetnary School Operating Status) database which is not yet publicly available but will soon be in 2021.,https://osf.io/zeqrj/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/citation/,qgtue,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zeqrj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/relationships/node/,zeqrj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6009d8d6e80d370a4da56fd1/,6009d8d6e80d370a4da56fd1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qgtue/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qgtue,NA
