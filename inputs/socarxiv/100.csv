Learners perform various translation tasks drawing on different features of GTA. However, what specific features they draw on when using Google Translate, and how the app influences their English learning process is unknown. This study aims to answer the following research question: what are the affordances of GTA as perceived by second language learners in Saudi Arabia? The research participants were twelve second language learners at a university in Saudi Arabia. Focus group interviews and individual interviews were conducted to gather the data over six-weeks. Thematic analysis indicates that GTA provides five different modes of writing in English, offering options to use the app in-class and in everyday life, and serving as a language learning resource. The findings also indicate that the personal histories of learners with GTA related to their introduction to and frequency of using the app in everyday life, and the benefits they observed when doing so. The study recommends language instructors promote the use of the app as a mini dictionary, and encourage language learners to use it as a resource to ensure accurate spelling and pronunciation.",TRUE,FALSE,affordances|English learning|Google Translate App (GTA)|Saudi Second Language learners,2020-10-09T18:31:41.129774,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:31:33.148081,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/citation/,mw68j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e67a0a5e947011e1be39d/,5f7e67a0a5e947011e1be39d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mw68j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mw68j/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mw68j

In fact, planning is a critical factor in the document, which shapes it as a discourse of realization and fascination, made in the public interest. The present research aims to investigate the ways strategic planning has been articulated in the Vision 2030 document. It can help to get a deep linguistic understanding of this ideological discourse as well as to make it comprehendible for familiar readers. The core purpose of the present study is to examine this ideological discourse for the linguistic items that encapsulate the planning factor. For this purpose, the text has been reviewed using the foundational document model projected by Holland (2014). This semantic-grammatical based linguistic model helps to investigate the ideological strand of planning in the selected text. The research design is quantitative, using a content analysis method. The results reveal that planning strategies are well voiced in the Vision 2030 document, using a variety of vocabulary items; Investment, support, cooperation, provision, and increment are found as the fundamental strategies.

To attain this aim, 60 research articles have been randomly compiled and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively via AntConc.3.2.4 depending on Hyland’s (2005) classification of metadiscourse markers (MM). Taking the abstracts and discussions written by the natives as a benchmark, this study poses the following essential question: How close and far is the amount of the interactional and interactive resources in Egyptian and Saudi abstracts and discussions to and from the native level? The results showed that except for hedges, evidential markers, and endophorics, the usage of attitudes, code glosses, engagement markers, self-mentions and transitions in the E-abstracts (i.e. written by Egyptian researchers) was much far from the native level.  But in S-abstracts (i.e. abstracts written by Saudi researchers), only two close points to the native level have been recorded: transitions and engagements. In the E-discussion sections, unlike code glosses and frame markers, attitudes, boosters, endophorics, hedges, and self-mentions were reported very close to the N-level.

The quantitative research method uses descriptive statistics and T-test. A group of 258 students (61 males and 197 females) took part in answering two questionnaires on learners' autonomy in learning English and the roles of lecturers and students in developing learner-autonomy in learning English. The results showed that the students were not familiar with the term learning autonomy. However, students were aware that they played a fundamental role in improving this ability.

Identifying which strategies are adaptive and maladaptive could help them to promote student motivation in return. This study aims to identify the degree of importance and implementation of motivational strategies among EL teachers and explore to what extent they implement the strategies that they perceived as important. The online questionnaires were distributed to 49 teachers at 11 public universities in Malaysia, and ten of them were interviewed. The findings of this study suggested the implementation of motivational strategies heavily depended on teachers’ perceived motivation in teaching. The highest-rated strategy was Proper Teacher Behavior, and the least preferred was Promote Learner Autonomy, indicating that teacher behavior as an important element in ensuring effective language learning. Next, despite the findings that most students are not ready for learner autonomy, the teachers appeared to have a more positive outlook on the inclusion of learner autonomy, and this contradicts findings of previous studies in the Asian contexts. It also indicates that motivational strategies are neither cultural nor context-specific. However, some strategies are still regarded as very practical, while some are less practical in different learning situations.

Answering these questions of the study are expected to help language instructors determine the most feasible vocabulary learning strategies to help their students improve their vocabulary and so their language competences. Through purposive sampling, a group of 50 male students participated in this descriptive and analytic type of study. A questionnaire and a vocabulary test were used to collect data. The findings of the study revealed that in understanding a reading text, EFL Saudi students tend to figure out the meanings of unknown words, mainly by guessing word-meanings through different sub-strategies. The least used was the social interaction strategy. It was also found that students’ scores on the vocabulary test significantly correlated (positively and negatively) with the type of strategy they used.

Two decades on, the Department decided it is time for Returning to Graduation Project (RGP). In preparation for this, a Research Methods (RM) module was delivered to students, and an intense ‘research design and methodology’ course was taken by the staff. In this exploratory mixed-methods case-study research, the main question focuses on attitudes and perceived challenges facing students and staff concerning RGP. The aim is to tackle negative attitudes and perceived obstacles in anticipation of a successful RGP, which spells out the significance of the research. Data were collected through a questionnaire (n=52) and a focus group discussion with seventh-semester students (10); semi-structured interviews with staff (13). A small majority of students (54%) supported RGP; the remaining 46% raised two kinds of concerns: realistic challenges of lacking resources, inadequate RM skills, and supervisor issues; unrealistic challenges involved time constraints, fear of presenting, and problems of determining research topics. Staff members were receptive to RGP but raised numerous concerns. Whereas experienced members expressed cynicism due to low students competencies and lacking resources, others saw RGP as an opportunity for students to gain practical research experience ahead of postgraduate study. Several challenges were perceived, chief among them are students lack of research skills, inexperienced supervisors, inadequate resources, and an ever-lasting concern with plagiarism.

Multiple publications on what his work contributes to the field of education exist. But surprisingly, only two papers have appeared specific to teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL): one decades old, the other primarily arguing an early case for communicative language teaching (CLT) is presented. Ibn Khaldun lived in a kind of global world, an Islamic one: cosmopolitan, and having its own international language. Analogies with today’s globalism and English are obvious. This article therefore reviews the total Muqaddimah, comparing its content to dominant ideas and figures in contemporary English language teaching (ELT), and showing it is still relevant to ELT. Congruences include Ibn Khaldun’s constructivist-like conception of identity and realization of second language learner (L2) identity’s role and formation process. Also, what would today be called Whorfianism, leading to concluding a language should be taught together with its discourses—but English is no longer viewed as just Anglo-American or native-speaker—Ibn Khaldun’s case is saved by reimagining English as global and cosmopolitan, which TESOL exactly has. It will also be shown that not CLT, but rather study abroad or immersion education is being portrayed. The importance of affect, a case made for both learner and teacher autonomy, together with other issues, all current in TESOL today, make Ibn Khaldun’s Muqaddimah a rediscovered source of inspiration for the milieu of modern ELT.",TRUE,FALSE,communicative language teaching|Ibn Khaldun|immersion|Muqaddimah|TESOL,2020-10-09T18:16:23.250492,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:16:02.258485,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/citation/,s3dn5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e609a1f65a50135ed1be0/,5f7e609a1f65a50135ed1be0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3dn5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s3dn5/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s3dn5

This study aimed to find out the evaluation criteria for the ICC attributes in EFL textbooks generated from the literature and from EFL experts, and then construct an evaluation checklist for assessing the ICC attributes of the English majors’ textbook in China. The findings revealed that thirty-six items were identified from the literature and another thirty-six new items were generated from the interview with nine experts in the fields of ICC research and textbook selection. These items were constructed into a draft checklist and checklist was validated by another nine EFL teachers and native-speaker teachers. Consequently, a try-out checklist with two dimensions, eight themes and sixty-one items was developed. Given the vital role of ICC in English teaching, it is essential to understand the ICC attributes in EFL textbooks, which is a relatively new construct. The proposed checklist was a critical step towards a better evaluation of ICC attributes in English majors’ textbooks and would be a helpful tool for teachers in textbook evaluation. Future research is required to refine the try-out checklist.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL textbooks in China|English majors|evaluation checklist|ICC,2020-10-09T18:16:01.991006,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:15:34.710463,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/citation/,9jdct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e5fa5cc246f016f74bc7e/,5f7e5fa5cc246f016f74bc7e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9jdct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9jdct/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9jdct

An Innovation Experience at Universidad SEK Chile,"Teaching professional practice and thesis development are usually two independent and unrelated processes. However, some concerns arose at Universidad SEK (USEK) Chile Department of English. Students declared to be overloaded and that working on their theses did not contribute to solving real in-class problems. Professors considered that training was not achieving all the expected results and that theses quality of some students were below expectations. To address these concerns, the English department decided to create a direct and strong bond between these two vital processes through Action Research (AR). Studying this innovation process appears to be relevant as it may lead to a better understanding of its impact and the complexities involved. Consequently, the author aims to value the results of this innovation after five years of its implementation. How do involved agents such as students, professors, supervisors, and mentors ponder this experience? Qualitative information gathered through interviews evidenced some contentment regarding thesis and training improvement, a decrease in the students’ overload perception, renewed motivation, and a positive thesis-training connection. Despite this promising perception, there are still some pending challenges, such as enhancing the spreading of the innovation and the quality of the feedback provided to school mentors.",TRUE,FALSE,Action Research|professional training|thesis development|Universidad SEK,2020-10-09T18:15:41.014605,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:15:09.836968,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/citation/,y4zf3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e5ed2cc246f016a74cabf/,5f7e5ed2cc246f016a74cabf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zf3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4zf3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4zf3
