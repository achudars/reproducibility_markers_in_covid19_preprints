Findings from a Philippine study,"Background: A wide spectrum of indicators has been postulated to associate with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-2019) cases. Among which were demographic profile, latitude, humidity, temperature, and ozone concentration. Despite obtaining significant results, there is still a dearth of research exploring other substantial determinants of Covid-2019 cases. The Philippine government is currently challenged to address issues pertaining to poverty and substinence. Empirical evidence of these studies suggests how identification of potential indicators could aid in the formulation of targeted strategies to mitigate future health problems. In this study, seven socio-economic indicators were associated with Covid-2019 cases across 17 regions in the Philippines. This is a retrospective study utilizing readily accessible public data in the analysis. Socio-economic indicators used were poverty incidence, magnitude of poor families, substinence incidence, and magnitude of substinence poor population. In addition, the income, expenditure, and savings recorded per Philippine region were taken for the analysis. A single Philippine region was the sampling unit; hence, a total of 17 regions were assessed. Covid-2019 cases as of April 7, 2020 were considered for the analysis. Descriptive statistics, Kendall rank correlation, and stepwise regression were used to determine if the seven socio-economic indicators were associated with Covid-2019 cases. Substinence incidence and income were retained for the regression model, which explained 87.2 percent of the variance in the Covid-2019 cases (R2 = .872). The results indicated that for every 1,000 PhP increase in income, there was a decrease of 3.99 Covid-2019 cases in each Philippine region. Meanwhile, for every 1.0 percent increase in substinence incidence, there was an increase of 3.34 Covid-2019 cases in each Philippine region. High income and low substinence incidence are associated with significant reductions in Covid-2019 cases across the 17 regions of the Philippines. This provides additional knowledge to policy makers and health officials in formulating targeted strategies to regions that could potentially record high number of Covid-2019 cases in the future. Early identification of these high-risk regions would warrant prompt preventive measures. Given the seasonal and recurring nature of Covid-2019 with respect to previous outbreaks, it is essential for the Philippine government to formulate directed policies and innovate programs that would decrease substinence and increase income. Concerted multi-region efforts should be made to prepare for possible infection outbreaks in the future. Additional studies could be explored in the future to capture significant changes in the socio-economic indicators.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-2019|expenditure|income|novel coronavirus|poverty|SARS-CoV-2|savings|socio-economic|substinence,2020-04-14T05:03:32.200080,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T02:45:00.777304,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/citation/,e2hfa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e946466d69735038ebd9e4d/,5e946466d69735038ebd9e4d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2hfa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2hfa,NA

We find that individuals initially employed in sectors highly exposed to Chinese imports earned less and remained out of employment longer than workers in sectors that were less exposed to import competition in the period 2000-2007. Earnings losses were most severe when workers remained in the same industry, whereas those who switched out of their 2-digit sector were able to mitigate these losses. The effects are heterogeneous across the distribution of earnings within the same age cohort, with initially better-paid workers suffering less in terms of employment and earnings than those initially worse-paid. Female workers experienced a greater fall in total earnings, mostly through reduced years of employment. Furthermore, firms in industries flooded by Chinese products displayed lower employment growth and higher probability of going out of business than firms in sectors more insulated from competition with China.",TRUE,FALSE,China|ernings|trade|UK|unemployment,2020-04-14T05:03:32.469492,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T02:47:10.755549,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/citation/,3ws94,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6c37s/,6c37s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e944f79d697350383bdc034/,5e944f79d697350383bdc034,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ws94/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3ws94/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3ws94,NA

Yet in many cases their effectiveness is below expectations. One potential cause of this is that they struggle to account for local context, especially when working with ethnic minorities. Here we begin to address this gap through a qualitative case-study of how local contextual factors have impacted the  success  of  a  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  healthcare  training  programme  on  Type  2 diabetes with an ethnic minority group in rural central Vietnam. Design: A  qualitative  case-study  collected  data  during  2018.  We  conducted  25  semi-structured interviews,  two  focus  groups,  and  participant  observation  with  patients,  healthcare  professionals, and  members  of  a  local  non-governmental  organisation  involved  in  the  programme.  We  used thematic  coding  to  identify  important   contextual  factors  and  how  they  helped  or  hindered programme  delivery.  Next,  we  synthesised  each  of  these  themes  in  a  narrative  style,  drawing  on the rich detail provided by respondents. Results: We found that, despite using a notionally decentralised approach, the effectiveness of the training  was  hindered  by  social,  political,  and  economic  determinants  of  health  which  influenced the   inhabitants’   relations   to   healthcare   and   diabetes.   Particular   barriers   were   the   political perceptions  of  minorities,  their  economic  access  to  services,  the  healthcare  prejudices  toward ethnic rural populations and the rigidity of medical training. Conclusions: Given the similarity of our case with other WHO NCD programmes, we view that our findings are of wider relevance  to global public health policy  and practice. We suggest that better recognising   and   addressing   local   contextual   factors   would   make   such   programmes   more polyvocal,   grounded,   and   resilient,   as   well   as   enabling   them   to   better   support   long-term transformative   change   in   public   health   systems.   We   conclude   by   discussing   methods   for implementing this in practice.",TRUE,FALSE,determinants of health|development health|diabetes|ethnic minority|global health|non-communicable disease|primary care|Vietnam,2020-04-14T05:03:45.306751,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T02:47:56.154512,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/citation/,s78xa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e94252f430166036ba08c81/,5e94252f430166036ba08c81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s78xa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s78xa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s78xa,https://doi.org/10.9734/ARJASS/2020/v12i130182

The challenge that such undertakings have repeatedly faced in the past is that partner governments often have their own interests and priorities which can diverge significantly from those of Washington. Consequently, a host of observers have pointed out that while the United States has provided its partners with extensive assistance to combat insurgents and terrorist groups, an inability to convince them to adopt its counterinsurgency prescriptions or address what Washington sees as the political and economic “root causes” of a conflict has repeatedly emerged as a major impediment to success. In the absence of sufficient influence to convince a local government to address these shortcomings, critics suggest that significant American aid and support can actually reduce its incentives to address domestic discontent or govern inclusively, which can render a supported regime less stable than it would have been without U.S. assistance",TRUE,FALSE,COIN|Lansdale|Philippines|Security Assistance|United States,2020-04-13T04:27:57.291950,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-13T03:03:07.142855,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/citation/,r7xyv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e938ff2d697350353be327d/,5e938ff2d697350353be327d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7xyv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r7xyv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r7xyv,NA

Area planted with maize is the country’s largest agricultural land use, mostly planted by smallholder family farmers known as campesinos. Due to the large area they plant with saved seed from native varieties in a wide variety of environments across the country, maize evolution under domestication continues today at a very large scale and under a multiplicity of selection pressures. Campesinos have been considered mainly subsistence farmers. Here we show that subsistence production is insufficient for explaining the scale of the area they plant with maize and on which its contemporary evolution under domestication depends. Our hypothesis is that beyond supplying their own consumption needs, campesinos across Mexico collectively produce maize to respond to the demand of non-maize producing local consumers. Here we quantify the extent of subsistence versus surplus production among campesinos, showing that subsistence production cannot explain the scale of their maize cultivation. Then, we test statistically the association between the scale of maize cultivation and socioeconomic variables that link campesino production to the demand by other consumers and examine the implications of the results for the supply and conservation of native maize in the country. Our results suggest that maize trading linking campesinos to other consumers may be important and widespread. We conclude that there are important opportunities for maintaining maize evolution under domestication at large scale by strengthening local maize markets.",TRUE,FALSE,crop evolution|local markets|smallholder farmers|spatial lag models|Zea mays L.,2020-04-13T03:51:22.730231,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-13T03:02:23.026043,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|Food Security|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/citation/,fcyxe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/myv7h/,myv7h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e937e59f135350368d560c0/,5e937e59f135350368d560c0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcyxe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fcyxe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fcyxe,NA

This paper focuses on the newly born-digital relationship between Alan Turing, father of computer science, and Leonardo da Vinci, master of Renaissance art and science – both revered as visionary geniuses, prophets of the future. Given the continued growth of digitised materials that are daily entering global consciousness, it is only relatively recently that both da Vinci’s notebooks and paintings, and Turing’s archive, are online and searchable. Thus we are able for the first time to relatively easily juxtapose and compare their work, and see that they have much in common in terms of what it means to human in science, art and the natural world, from da Vinci’s in-depth studies of the mechanisms of the human body, mind, and soul, foundational to his art, and to Turing’s discoveries in Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and morphogenesis.

The paper analyses 131 publications published in the period 1982 – 2019 through quantitative analysis of frequencies, cross-tables, and Chi-square test, and qualitative thematic analysis of the publications. Eight research domains were identified: 'Characteristics and motivation of entrepreneurs', 'Business models', 'Audience development', 'Use of information and communication technologies', 'Urban development', 'Public policy', 'Incubators and clusters' and 'Entrepreneurial education'. Findings show that two-thirds of the papers are based on empirical research, most of which is conducted in the U.K. From a managerial perspective, the conclusions are that cultural entrepreneur is gradually becoming a central figure in contemporary cultural processes that has the potential to fulfil market and audience needs, fill the emerging business niches, and contribute to the revitalisation of cities and regions.
