But its strengths have also made the city particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of COVID-19, and potentially also to wider negative economic implications of the crisis. Many of London’s key sectors rely on proximity, agglomeration economies and externalities. We evaluate the available data on the impact of the pandemic on London to date, with a particular focus on the differential effects between sectors. We also identify seven key trends, affecting both the demand and supply side of the economy, that are likely to have significant medium- to long-term economic impacts, and assess the potential impacts on London’s major industrial sectors.

Although methodological issues of applying LCP analysis in Archaeology have frequently been discussed, the effect of vertical error in the DEM on LCP results has not been fully assessed. This research proposes the use of Monte Carlo simulation as a method for incorporating and propagating the effects of vertical error on LCP results. Random error fields representing the vertical error of the DEM are calculated and incorporated into the documented and reproducible LCP modelling process using the R package leastcostpath. By incorporating vertical error into the LCP modelling process the accuracy of the LCP results can be understood probabilistically, with the likelihood of obtaining an LCP result quantified. Furthermore, the effect of incorporating vertical error on the LCP results can be expressed through the use of probabilistic LCPs, allowing for a graphical representation of the uncertainty in the LCP calculation, as well as identifying the most probable location of the ‘true’ least cost path. The method of understanding LCP results probabilistically is applied to a Roman road case study, finding that the accuracy of the LCP from south-to-north without incorporating vertical error is not representative of the LCP population with vertical error accounted for. In contrast, the accuracy of the LCP without incorporating vertical error from north-to-south is representative of the LCP population. The use of probabilistic LCPs suggests that the location of the Roman road in the southern section of the study area was selected to minimise the time taken to move up and down slope, irrespective of the direction of movement. However, the identification of two corridors of similar likelihood of containing the ‘true’ location of the LCP in the northern section when modelling movement south-to-north suggests that the input data and parameters used in the LCP analysis are unable to discern which corridor contains the most probable ‘true’ location of the LCP. Therefore, this research suggests that different input data and parameters are used and tested.",TRUE,FALSE,least cost path|modelling|monte carlo|movement|probability|statistics,2020-07-18T15:22:23.334814,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-18T15:22:13.278157,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/terrain-50|https://data.gov.uk/dataset/640d5dab-4295-4b85-bc26-a8369abb73f6/scheduled-monuments-gis-data|https://data.gov.uk/dataset/298258ee-c4a0-4505-a3b5-0e6585ecfdb2/wfd-river-waterbody-catchments-cycle-2,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/citation/,mxas2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f11d2ae0870f2006409c77f/,5f11d2ae0870f2006409c77f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxas2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mxas2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mxas2

This leads to misjudgments due to subjective aggregations and interpretations that are necessary for providing answers. Tracking is regarded as the most advanced, unbiased, and precise method for observing smartphone use and therefore employed as an alternative. However, it remains unclear whether people possibly alter their behavior because they know that they are being observed. This is called reactivity. In this study, we investigate first, whether smartphone and app use duration and frequency are affected by tracking; second, whether effects vary between app types; and third, how long effects persist.
We developed an Android tracking app and conducted an anonymous quasi-experiment with smartphone use data from 25 people over a time span of two weeks. The app gathered not only data that were produced after, but also prior to its installation by accessing an internal log file on the device.
The results show that there is a decline in the average duration of app use sessions within the first seven days of tracking. Instant messaging and social media app use duration show similar patterns. We found no changes in the average frequency of smartphone and app use sessions per day. Overall, reactivity effects due to smartphone use tracking are rather weak, which speaks for the method's validity. We advise future researchers to employ a larger sample and control for external influencing factors so reactivity effects can be better interpreted.",TRUE,FALSE,behavior|media use|passive observation|reactivity|Smartphone use|tracking,2020-07-17T15:57:46.217032,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-17T14:40:37.679987,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon request,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,Roland Toth|Tatiana Trifonova,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/citation/,7aqdx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1185ad0870f2003b09bc04/,5f1185ad0870f2003b09bc04,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7aqdx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7aqdx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7aqdx

Social networks can differ depending on behaviour type and are typically hidden. However, we do often have large-scale behavioural data, albeit only snapshots taken at one timepoint. We present a method that jointly infers large-scale network structure and a networked model of human behaviour using only snapshot population behavioural data. This exploits the simplicity of a few-parameter, geometric socio-demographic network model and a spin-based model of behaviour. We illustrate, for the EU Referendum and two London Mayoral elections, how the model offers both prediction and the interpretation of our homophilic inclinations. Beyond offering the extraction of behaviour-specific network-structure from large-scale behavioural datasets, our approach yields a crude calculus linking inequalities and social preferences to behavioural outcomes. We give examples of potential network-sensitive policies: how changes to income inequality, a social temperature and homophilic preferences might have reduced polarisation in a recent election.",TRUE,FALSE,homophily|regression model|social networks|social space,2020-07-17T15:52:42.037638,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-17T14:40:15.121619,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://data.london.gov.uk/elections|https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/citation/,v7t26,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yzsd3/,yzsd3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1178c10596f6002f79aae7/,5f1178c10596f6002f79aae7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7t26/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v7t26/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v7t26

How French elite schools alumnis activate their relational ressources?,"Sociological or historical surveys on French elites highlighted at many occasions that ""grandes écoles"" graduated are over-represented at the top of the socio-professional hierarchy. These surveys showed that social capital constituted by passing through an elite higher educational institution and the co-optation networks among graduates from the same institution is a key asset to reach these prestigious social positions. But little is know on the concrete activation conditions of such relational resources. Focusing on one ""grandes écoles"" graduates subgroup (the graduates from one of the Ecole Normale Supérieure), our presentation aims to better understand how social capital is activated. Based on in-depth interview analysis and alumni associations archives analysis, we try to shed a light on the activation conditions of such relational school-based resources in diverse professional contexts. On the one hand, we show that crossing the analysis of the legitimate definition of the social link among the graduates and the norms and representations that structure the professional groups reached by graduates is a key insight to understand the relational resources activation possibilities. On the other, we analyze how the struggle within the alumni group to fix the « good » way of define school-based relational resources frame the activation possibilities of such resources.",TRUE,FALSE,Academia|Elite|France|Social capital,2020-07-17T15:50:01.017353,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-17T14:37:48.101758,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/citation/,93qvz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1159990596f6002779d298/,5f1159990596f6002779d298,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93qvz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93qvz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93qvz

Anthropologists have vigorously debated this concept during the latter part of the twentieth century. They have proposed that dietary specialization and dietary diversification are two mechanisms responsible for subsistence intensification trends over time. On the North American Great Plains, archaeologists attribute the observed record of human dietary variation of at least 13,000 years, partially to the effects of human agency, temporal and regional variability in environmental conditions, and human and prey population dynamics. Despite this variation, an apparent big-game hunting specialization persisted in this region alongside more diversified strategies, until much later than in adjacent areas. This interpretation of specialized bison hunting proposed by early archaeologists likely fueled two widespread hypotheses: A) that prehistoric Great Plains indigenous people's lives were highly contingent on the vast herds of bison that roamed the region, and B) that through time, a simplified progression of subsistence intensification took place. This progression begins with highly specialized big-game hunters during the Paleoindian period (13,500–9,000 BP) and culminates with a much more diversified economy during the Late Prehistoric period (1000–300 BP) that included foraged and domesticated resources. However, these inferences remain unevaluated across the Great Plains' vast geographic range and its complete cultural chronology. To assess them, we employ a large dataset of dietary remains and investigate the broad patterns of dietary specialization and diversification used by Great Plains indigenous people over the past 13,500 years. Our analyses led to a twofold conclusion: 1) we find that even though prehistoric indigenous people of the Great Plains maintained a way of life associated with bison over time, bison was not the dominant hunted species in their diet; and 2) the hunting strategies and dietary variation that we observed on the Great Plains, through time, does not support a model of progressive resource intensification from hunting and gathering to farming. Instead, the data support a model of constant diversification of hunting strategies from the Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric periods. In this model, hunters on the Plains (and elsewhere) maintained a consistently high resource diversity. We propose that this highly flexible and diversified portfolio of dietary strategies enabled the Great Plains people to successfully adapt their approaches to procuring food across different habitats and periods.",TRUE,FALSE,anthropology|archaeology|diversity|foraging behavior|Great Plains|Hunters and gatherers|Subsistence change,2020-07-17T15:58:42.138665,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-17T14:41:11.361761,FALSE,NA,no,Forthcoming,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/citation/,xptby,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nmqb2/,nmqb2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f10dded0596f6000f79d94b/,5f10dded0596f6000f79d94b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xptby/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xptby/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xptby
