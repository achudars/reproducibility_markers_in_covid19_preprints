But mechanisms for teaching---mechanisms that determine what information is available for learners to learn in the first place---are equally important to cultural evolution, especially in the case of humans. Here, we propose a simple model of teaching in the context of skill transmission. Our model derives the evolutionary cost and benefit of teaching by explicitly representing cognitive aspects of skill transmission. Results show that there is an ""explain-exploit"" trade-off inherent to teaching, which can give rise to an opportunity cost that goes beyond any direct cost that it may also entail. We then discuss how this opportunity cost can cause teaching mechanisms to be self-limiting, suggesting that such mechanisms may nevertheless play an important role in the evolution of cumulative culture in humans.",TRUE,FALSE,cumulative culture|dual-inheritance model|skill transmission|teaching,2021-06-01T04:00:29.869451,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-29T17:12:15.262413,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Rafael Ventura|Erol Akçay,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/citation/,r4egs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60aebba97982550069872828/,60aebba97982550069872828,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4egs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r4egs/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r4egs

The Usmeka system of thought.,"The ontological turn in humanities and social sciences showed that science was far from being neutral because it is embedded in power structures that determine what is accepted as “truth” excluding non-Western relational ontologies as scientific, or non-objective. There are many responses to scientific enquiry and its role in modern structures of power. They range from anti-scientific to scientific fundamentalisms, and from post-structural relational and more-than-human ontologies to institutional attempts to use science to validate indigenous knowledges. However, descriptions and analysis of how subaltern grassroots communities in the Global South are decolonising science while opening epistemic emancipatory spaces where they dialogue with the state are scarce. This paper contributes to the political and academic debate about how colonial subjects are subverting and challenging scientific enquiry, along with other modern tools of epistemic control. Based on ethnographic research, this paper describes the case of Usme community, who created a decolonial understanding of science. They use scientific knowledge as a mid-level language that allows Usmekas to reconnect semantically, materially, and spiritually with nature. This reinterpretation of science aims to deconstruct the dichotomy human/nature while at the same time mobilises epistemological emancipation demands into modern institutions such as the state.",TRUE,FALSE,decolonial thinking|decolonisation of science|epistemic emancipation|epistemic justice|social studies of science|subaltern knowledge,2021-06-01T04:00:33.783624,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-29T17:10:28.291430,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,"The paper draws on the ethnography I conducted during my PhD Studies.

The researcher was primarily concerned with three study questions. In this study, data were collected using an observation inventory, together with eight sets of performance assessments, all conceived by the researcher. A sample of 407 randomly selected students from a public university's department of educational administration took part in three quasi-experiments. The collected data were analysed using frequency counts and simple percentages. It was determined, among other things, that many higher education test-takers participate in various sorts of examination misconduct. Giraffing, copying from colleagues, exchanging scripts, discussing with peers, using microchips (little papers with answers), phones, swapping seats, handwriting on desks, using headphones, and requesting invigilators for help are all manifestations of these behaviours. It is found that test-takers' malpractice behaviours change depending on the test supervision design used. The educational assessment implications were examined in light of these findings.

However, the SPM still faces several critiques from scholars focused on poverty of non-metropolitan areas. Key among these critiques is the geographic adjustment for cost of living employed in the SPM, which is based solely upon median rental costs and pools together all non-metropolitan counties within each state. Here, we evaluate the current geographic adjustment of the SPM using both microdata and aggregate data from the American Community Survey for 2014-2018.

However, CS potential to enable new forms of collective governance of scientific research remains largely unexplored. At least, two confronting standpoints dominate debates around CS: from crowdsourcing perspectives supported by debates over cost-effectiveness of massive data collection, to more participatory views, which understand CS as a means to challenge current academic structures. In particular, the discussion around CS governance mechanisms that go beyond crowdsourcing models is still unfolding. Understanding CS as contributing to constitute science as a commons requires specific conditions that must be met. This study provides a framework for exploring the commons-related dimensions that characterize CS initiatives, as already applied in the study of commons-based peer production. It considers openness at the governance level, open knowledge at technological and data levels, and also social responsibility and impact of CS projects. The framework is tested and informed empirically with the analysis of 5 digital mapping CS projects. Data was gathered through web collection, based on a netnographic method. The results show that, overall, the dimensions considered prove useful to shed light on the commons-like formations that characterize CS. The results further point to the interplay of several institutional, legal, and practical dimensions in constructing and governing openness in CS. This preliminary adaptation of the framework is intended to place in an analytical context the debate around current challenges of both participatory science governance and public involvement in research initiatives.",TRUE,FALSE,citizen science|commons|digital platform,2021-05-26T13:27:03.481984,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:26:30.116520,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/citation/,pv78g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ad0b45a480c602d10d1e0f/,60ad0b45a480c602d10d1e0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv78g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pv78g/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pv78g

Against this background, how research funding may stimulate the societal orientation of scientific research has been underexplored. This paper proposes a two-fold exploratory approach both to characterize and observe societal targeting in individual researcher funding. First, stemming from literature, policy and practices, we select four key societal targeting dimensions: interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, prioritized research problems and user-oriented outputs. All these targeting dimensions of funding can potentially shape both research networks and practices towards societal goals. These dimensions may be identified in context through ex ante specifications of funding instruments, in rules and conditions for funding provision to researchers. Second, we also consider potential interactions of funding instruments, since researchers may engage with various instruments simultaneously when conducting their research. Therefore, each researcher funding configuration at a moment in time may generate bespoke shaping of research, depending on the societal targeting dimensions present and whether funding is co-used to support different research topics and activities within a researcher’s portfolio. The combination of the targeting dimensions and their potential interactions would allow for empirical exploration at different scales and in diverse settings. They expand our understanding of funding use dynamics that might shape research. This systematic perspective on funding instrument characteristics and their configurational possibilities will be relevant to assess the role of funding in research evaluation. We conclude with both policy implications of this exploratory societal targeting approach to funding and suggestions to expand it in further research.",TRUE,FALSE,Exploratory approach|Funding configurations|Funding instruments|Researchers|Research funding|Societal targeting,2021-05-26T13:25:44.862436,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:25:23.952910,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/citation/,8rdp6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ad0aa18a5d3d02eb0c7ca1/,60ad0aa18a5d3d02eb0c7ca1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8rdp6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8rdp6
