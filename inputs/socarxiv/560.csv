From a new perspective, the paper looks at the role of repetition as a separate entity that influences vocabulary learning despite subtitle types. To maximise vocabulary acquisition, the paper recommends that learners should be exposed to repeated input. The repetition should be comprehensible and to reach a comprehensible input, subtitles could be then considered. Overall, L1 subtitles are preferred for low proficiency learners whilst L2 subtitles could be geared towards high proficiency learners since the aim behind watching movies in the target language is to have a comprehensible input. Nonetheless, different subtitles should be used to facilitate the meaning and not as a final tool of acquiring new vocabulary as this acquisition will take place with repetition. Thus, the current paper could form a starting point in an approach that lays emphasis on repetition in movies watching rather than using a particular type of subtitle",TRUE,FALSE,comprehensible input|netflix|subtitles to learn the second language|visual materials|word repetition,2018-08-04T01:29:21.130658,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:28:58.144403,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/citation/,jmzur,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7jdch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/relationships/node/,7jdch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b65007f2ce076001c2d75da/,5b65007f2ce076001c2d75da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jmzur/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jmzur

In light of CALL, MALL, and CMC research, the purpose of this corpus driven study was to investigate the potential of the Instagram platform in learning English as a foreign language (EFL): particularly whether the type of Instagram post (vocabulary or grammar) had an effect on the amount of learners’ EFL output, the output accuracy, and the amount of feedback the learners received. The data was collected from authentic EFL use from the comments section of 15 Instagram accounts that were targeting the Saudi learners as their population. A total of 140 comments were analyzed (70 for vocabulary and 70 for grammar). A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was carried out and indicated a statistical significance Z (140)= -2.38, p. = 017 for output, with a relatively small effect size (d = .438), showing that vocabulary posts elicited more output from the commenters.

Further, an effort conducted by the Ministry of Education is developing e-Learning platform at universities. As one of the universities who supports the government policy, the English Department of Universitas Lambung Mangkurat applies for this e-Learning program through the http://elearning.ulm.ac.id. As a result, there is a need to unravel students’ perceptions in the implementation of this policy as one of the ways to see the successful standard and to explore students’ views. Employing qualitative method, this study uncovered the foci of English Department students’ view of the independent assessment, learning outcome, and evaluation of learning English online. Using a validated questionnaire and an interview, the results showed that e-Learning program supports students in learning English. It is seen from their perceptions of the independent assessment that the students gave a good response. On the learning outcome, the students responses were in the category of fair. Meanwhile, on the e-Learning evaluation, the students’ responses were in the fair category.

Although technology nowadays is more and more user friendly and may need no specific training on how to use it, teachers need to possess the knowledge that underpins the idea of using it for teaching and learning process. Teachers need to have solid pedagogical knowledge on how to use the technology to deliver contents to their students. Therefore, a technology-training course for teachers is always necessary. This paper presents the partial results of a design based study/research (DBR) on the development of online technology training for teachers with focus on CALL in Indonesia. Questions regarding factors affecting online CALL course and ways to improve the course in terms of training materials, activities, as well as the administration of the training are addressed in the study. Based on the study, some considerations on how to design such technology-training course are proposed. The considerations are ranging from aspects associated with technology competence for teacher standards, constructivism in online learning, adult learning theory, online instructional models, the technology, pedagogy and content knowledge (TPACK) framework and open educational resources (OER). Information regarding those aspects will be useful to assist other CALL teacher training course developers later to inform their decision in the development of the course which is based on a good theoretical understanding as well as highly practical in learning activities",TRUE,FALSE,OER|online CALL course development|online teacher-training|TPACK,2018-08-04T01:32:01.332325,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:31:34.762468,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/citation/,gs9xk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y2zke/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/relationships/node/,y2zke,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64f99d2ce076001c2d72c6/,5b64f99d2ce076001c2d72c6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs9xk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gs9xk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gs9xk

With both positive and negative feedback being reported about these systems, it is imperative to further explore users’ attitudes to CAT tools. Given the scarcity of research conducted in this field on the English-Arabic language pair, the present study attempts to examine users’ attitudes to CAT tools among 114 translation students and professional translators in Egypt. The main purpose of the research is to examine user attitudes towards these tools with specific reference to their perceived benefits, ease of use and compatibility. The survey instrument was adapted from Moore and Benbasat with some modifications. Drawing upon Dillon and Fraser’s premises, the research investigates the relationship between user attitudes to CAT tools and various factors, including years of experience, computer skills and type of texts translated. Semi-structured interviews were also used to achieve a mixed-method. The study points to an overall favorable attitude among participants towards using CAT tools, despite some mixed and contradicting opinions on some aspects. The findings also confirm that users with better computer skills have more favorable attitudes towards CAT tools unlike those with more experience in translation. The study concludes with some recommendations for future research.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|CAT tools|Egyptian students|teaching translation|translation memory (TM),2018-08-04T01:32:25.106868,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:31:58.201976,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/citation/,xpj5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jqgtb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/relationships/node/,jqgtb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64f8d57e433e001603a72a/,5b64f8d57e433e001603a72a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpj5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xpj5v/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xpj5v

The paper begins with a depiction of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and how technology has generally been employed in EFL classrooms in the past few decades. This critical appraisal, which provides the context for the paper, assesses how successfully technology has been viewed in relation to language teaching and learning and how it has developed up to the present day. The focus then moves to social media apps and mobile technology as a contemporary form of CALL. The discussion considers the ways in which social media is used in language classrooms and more importantly the things it can offer the EFL teacher and learner. Importantly, the paper concludes by proposing ways in which these types of technologies can be better incorporated across cultures and contexts to promote EFL teaching and learning.",TRUE,FALSE,CALL|EFL|language learning|social media|technology,2018-08-04T01:32:21.188600,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:32:11.864100,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/citation/,crenm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gb32n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/relationships/node/,gb32n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64f7fe7e433e001503b058/,5b64f7fe7e433e001503b058,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crenm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/crenm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/crenm
