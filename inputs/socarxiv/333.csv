The problem is not simply that Ethics as a domain of governance is not well understood by the technology industry, but that it is either restricted in mainstream dialogue to a discussion of risk and safety issues, or it is conflated with regulatory compliance. The terms used to for structures to manage ethics, such as ‘Ethics Boards’ and ‘Ethics Councils’ are also used interchangeably. What this paper proposes is to define Digital Ethics in terms where it becomes clear that it is necessarily a separate topic of governance to regulatory compliance and technical risk/ safety management. This paper also suggests some defining characteristics of Ethics Boards and Councils and proposes alternative models. Finally, a case is made for how the quality of ethics governance can be measured and therefore managed, in order to build comparisons between organisations in language that will be familiar to investors and consumers. It is believed that in doing so, the difficulty of talking of this subject in purely subjective terms can be avoided.",TRUE,FALSE,artificial intelligence|digital ethics|ESG|intersubjectivity|philosophy|regulation|risk management,2020-01-28T21:35:45.185076,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-28T17:55:24.849949,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/citation/,gj2kf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2fe1eae71ef80047190167/,5e2fe1eae71ef80047190167,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj2kf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gj2kf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gj2kf,NA

This issue is investigated quantitatively by connecting it with the way authorship on papers is distributed. I analyzed a large bibliographic dataset made available by Microsoft under the name Academic Graph  to create a histogram with the number of articles an author produces per year. The histogram has the shape of a pyramid, and different layers in it correlate with positions in the academic hierarchy. The super-prolific authors at the top of the pyramid with more than 40 publications per year are usually heads of large institutes with many subgroups and large numbers of PhD students, while the bottom of the pyramid is populated by PhD students and Postdocs with less than 5 publications per year. The mechanism that allows 'manager scientists' to appropriate publications generated in their sphere of influence is related to other issues, such as the evaluation of scientific performance based on scientometric indicators and the lenient enforcement of authorship rules.

Using an original dataset of about 44,000 British social scientists and bibliographic information about their published, peer-reviewed articles, I show that the introduction of standardized research evaluations disrupted local academic labor markets in British higher education, leading to patterns of interinstitutional mobility that altered the epistemic diversity of social science disciplines and the organization of their academic fields. Much like market-based interventions, research evaluations lead to a form of epistemic matching that has distinct consequences on how knowledge is generated. In particular, when evaluations affect organizational units (such as academic departments) and stress disciplinary norms, they foster forms of isomorphism that lead to reductions in a discipline’s thematic diversity and a more homogeneous structure for the field. This paper thus advances the sociology of knowledge by showing how epistemic change occurs not only through the individual realignments of quantified scholars but, as importantly, through the mediation of interinstitutional mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,computational social science|knowledge|quantification|research evaluation|science of science,2020-01-28T21:35:45.322606,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-28T17:56:16.777031,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/citation/,yzkfu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f5b29af7593003dbdc108/,5e2f5b29af7593003dbdc108,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzkfu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yzkfu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yzkfu,NA

Recently, authors claimed polygenic scores provide evidence that a significant portion of differences in cognitive performance between Black and white populations are caused by genetic differences due to natural selection, the “hereditarian hypothesis”. This study aims to show conceptual and methodological flaws of past studies supporting the hereditarian hypothesis.
Materials and Methods: Polygenic scores for educational attainment were constructed for African and European samples of the 1000 Genomes Project. Evidence for selection was evaluated using an excess variance test. Education associated variants were further evaluated for signals of selection by testing for excess genetic differentiation (Fst). Expected mean difference in IQ for populations was calculated under a neutral evolutionary scenario and contrasted to hereditarian claims.
Results: Tests for selection using polygenic scores failed to find evidence of natural selection when the less biased within-family GWAS effect sizes were used. Tests for selection using Fst values did not find evidence of natural selection. Expected mean difference in IQ was substantially smaller than postulated by hereditarians, even under unrealistic assumptions that overestimate genetic contribution.
Conclusion: Given these results, hereditarian claims are not supported in the least. Cognitive performance does not appear to have been under diversifying selection in Europeans and Africans. In the absense of diversifying selection, the best case estimate for genetic contributions to group differences in cognitive performance is substantially smaller than hereditarians claim and is consistent with genetic differences contributing little to the Black-white gap.",TRUE,FALSE,Evolutionary Biology|Genetics|Genomics|Hereditarianism|Natural Selection|Race,2020-01-27T23:10:41.382453,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-27T23:08:59.805186,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://zenodo.org/record/4284020#.YBnL__tKhuV,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/citation/,2qfkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f3e23e71ef8001f1896d6/,5e2f3e23e71ef8001f1896d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qfkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2qfkt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2qfkt,NA

These people are often vulnerable, and their safe and early return is a key factor in preventing them from coming to serious harm. One approach to quickly find missing people is to disseminate appeals for information using social media. Yet despite the popularity of twitter-based missing person appeals, presently little is known about how to best construct these messages to ensure they are shared far and wide. This paper aims to build an evidence-base for understanding how police accounts tweet appeals for information about missing persons, and how the public engage with these tweets by sharing them. We analyse 1,008 Tweets made by Greater Manchester Police between the period of 2011 and 2018 in order to investigate what features of the tweet, the twitter account, and the missing person are associated with levels of retweeting. We find that tweets with different choice of image, wording, sentiment, and hashtags vary in how much they are retweeted. Tweets that use custody images have lower retweets than Tweets with regular photos, while tweets asking the question “have you seen...?” and asking explicitly to be retweeted have more engagement in the form of retweets. These results highlight the need for conscientious, evidence-based crafting of missing appeals, and pave the way for further research into the causal mechanisms behind what affects engagement, to develop guidance for police forces worldwide.",TRUE,FALSE,investigation|missing persons|police|public engagement|social media|twitter,2020-01-27T17:41:42.073860,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-27T17:41:27.931116,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/citation/,wugxs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4w5eg/,4w5eg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f130787a1d9024e1cf640/,5e2f130787a1d9024e1cf640,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wugxs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wugxs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wugxs,NA

We explore how this inattention to race and racism developed. First, we outline a history of the new economic sociology as it emerged in the 1980s and defined itself against dominant trends in economics and sociology through its emphasis on the role of meso-level social orders in shaping economic action. Second, we offer a partial explanation for how economic sociology came to ignore race, highlighting both programmatic and contextual factors. Economic sociology's intellectual agenda emphasized identifying the local social factors that made possible the seemingly rational behavior of elite economic actors. As such, economic sociologists studied primarily white men and white- dominated institutions, but, in line with understandings of race and racism at the time and in keeping with the field's emphasis on networks over category memberships, did not recognize the role of race in these settings. Economic sociologists did not study poverty or racial inequality, and so economic sociology was understood as not being about race. This strategy was capable of succeeding in an academic context where studies of race and racism centered racial attitudes, failed to theorize whiteness, and typically treated race as an individual-level variable. Third, we elaborate on two consistent foci of the subfield – ethnic enclaves and corporate interlocks. The canonical literature on ethnic enclaves conceptualized these spaces as sites for researching social capital, but not as sites for studying processes of racialization, leading this literature to largely ignore the role of racism in differences between ethnic enclaves. In contrast, the literature on interlocks ignored race and gender, despite the overwhelming dominance of white men on corporate boards.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-27T17:40:26.168239,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-27T17:40:08.940841,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/citation/,eg9f7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f07fa87a1d9024c1ce1b4/,5e2f07fa87a1d9024c1ce1b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg9f7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eg9f7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eg9f7,NA

Each user has the capacity to potentially reach others, and in this way, social media challenges the traditional distribution of content through mass media. The advertising industry has had to adapt to this new ecosystem and develop audiovisual pieces specifically tailored to this environment as part of their communication strategies. These pieces aim at achieving not only views but to engage viewers in sharing content with their contacts. Recent research indicates that there are certain aspects of human behaviour related to emotions and motivations that have an impact on the decision to share information, news and content with others. However, there are few studies analysing how the features of the content shared influence that decision. This article presents the content analysis results of the 100 most widely shared advertising viral videos around the world from 2011 to 2015 according to Adweek.

Evidence from a case study on the individual and collective adaptation of British Sociologists.,"According to the Academic Capitalism-approach, research assessments have a negative impact on research autonomy and research diversity. They urge scholars to tailor their research in order to obtain funding and positive evaluations, which are indispensable for career advancement based on a limited set of quality-criteria. This is supposed to reduce the potential to understand phenomena and to diminish research diversity by nudging scholars to tailor their research towards short-termed, applied research. Our paper seeks to analyse the impact of research assessments on research autonomy, research diversity and the adaptation of scholars to quality criteria imposed by assessments. To do so, we focus on the impact of the British Research Excellence Framework (REF) on British sociology. In line with the Academic Capitalism-approach and Habitus-Fieldtheory, we suggest that the Research Excellence Framework exerts symbolic power and symbolic dominance on scholars. This affects both habitus and working conditions of scholars. To analyse the impact of the REF, a convergent parallel mixed methods-design is applied. On the individual level, we analysed interview data of six British sociologists. On the collective level, we analysed abstracts of 2546 REF submissions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our qualitative findings show that sociologists adapt by “focusing on mainstream topics” and apply strategies of “publication management”. Furthermore, “research profile development” and “recruitment of REFable” scholars is forced by the university management. The LDA uncovers a collective focus on a limited number of research foci including youth sociology, medical sociology, gender studies, or political sociology. The Jensen-Shannon divergence indicates research specialisation within universities, but low research diversity between universities. Taken together, the symbolic power and symbolic dominance of the REF urge scholars to use gaming the system strategies mirrored by low research diversity and high research specialisation on the collective level.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Capitalism|Habitus-Fieldtheory|Latent Dirichlet Allocation|Mixed Methods|Narrative Interviews|Natural Language Processing|Research Excellence Framework|Sociology of Sociology|Symbolic Dominance|Symbolic Power|Topic Modeling,2020-01-27T17:38:03.525542,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-27T17:37:41.751231,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/citation/,wda3j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2eb8c0c19c5d0209ee001e/,5e2eb8c0c19c5d0209ee001e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wda3j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wda3j,NA

online distance learning courses. Although recording on-campus lectures for on-
campus students is increasingly common, there has been little scrutiny of the role
of lecture capture in online courses. We address this gap by exploring online
distance learning students’ perceptions of two types of recorded media; video-to-
camera lectures and lecture captures through the lens of the Community of
Inquiry (COI) Framework. The study concluded that lecture captures do not
contribute to the creation of a COI as they do not substantially increase cognitive,
social or teaching presence. However, students were enthusiastic about lecture
captures due to the naturalistic lecturing style and the opportunity to learn
vicariously. We suggest that these findings should prompt greater consideration
of the role of vicarious learning in online education and the tendency to perceive
campus-based education as being more ‘authentic’.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-31T08:34:25.635211,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-31T08:34:06.712624,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5e|Education|Higher Education|Scholarship of Teaching and Learning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/citation/,wy9da,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g2rky/,g2rky,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2dce9887a1d9018d1ce6c9/,5e2dce9887a1d9018d1ce6c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wy9da/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wy9da,NA
