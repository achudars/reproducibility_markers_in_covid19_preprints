To answer this question, a theoretically-driven and empirically-based research was developed in a public library in Portugal, combining the analysis of documents uses, the ethnography of space and Internet use, of social relations developed while reading, with the analysis of representations of the public library. No clear-cut association emerged between social-demographics or user profiles, and representations, in general. No disruptive Internet ""impact"" was found: Internet use may contribute to reinforce traditional representations of the library, while it may also update and democratise other representations. If the library and the Internet are represented as synonymous, the former does not make sense without the latter; but an Internet widespread and intensive use conflicts with the image of an institution dedicated to high-brow culture.

The precise network, or mode of exchange varies according to context, but these modes of exchange tend to fall into a handful of categories: specifically, giving without expectation of receiving, reciprocal relationships, and pooling. In this manuscript we address whether the stability of populations to small perturbations can play a role in understanding why only a limited number of modes of exchange are typical. We develop a simple model of exchange between populations located in different environments, and show that any mode of exchange in our model will help to buffer the risk associated with local environmental variability. However, we find only a limited set of modes of exchange will guarantee population stability when resources are scarce, and these mirror the empirical classifications of exchange.

An emerging research field, using the latest global socioeconomic and climate scenarios – namely the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration (RCPs) – is exploring how different socioeconomic pathways will influence future society’s ability to cope with climate change impacts. While the SSPs have been extensively used at the global scale, their use at the local and urban scale has remained rare, as they first need to be contextualized and extended for the particular place of interest. In this study, we present and apply a method to develop multi-scale extended SSPs at the city and neighborhood scale. Using Boston, Massachusetts, as a case study, we combined scenario matching, experts’ elicitation, and participatory processes to contextualize and make the global SSPs relevant at the urban scale. We subsequently employed the extended SSPs to explore future neighborhood-level vulnerability to extreme heat under multiple plausible socioeconomic trajectories, highlighting the usefulness of extended SSPs in informing future vulnerability assessments.

Starting artistically as a diseuse and actress, she directed a feature film and a documentary in her youth, in 1946. Bárbara emigrated to Brazil in 1952 to work on radio and television, the country where she settled, formed a family, eventually abandoning the stages, and died in 2015. For this socio-biography, we collected and analysed public and private memory documents, a research interview and conversations with her family. To construct our analysis and strengthen a feminist perspective, we used Portuguese cinema’s History and memoirs. We both avoided mythologising and aimed at unveiling the patriarchal gaze which shapes some literature about Bárbara Virgínia. We built our questioning and analysis from Linda Alcoff’s and Teresa de Lauretis’s gender studies, from the sociology of culture by Pierre Bourdieu who Bev Skeggs borrowed for her intersection of class, gender and coloniality, alongside historical and social research about both countries’ context.

I intend to create a ground from which to clarify the present form of those constraints, as well as to understand how one can produce a practiced place of public reading that recognizes and welcomes a mode of reading for pleasure.",TRUE,FALSE,|contentamento|contentment|feminist viewpoints|joy|leitura por prazer|leitura pública|moralism|moralismo|perspetivas feministas|reading for pleasure|reading in public libraries,2019-08-09T22:43:06.580522,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T22:42:42.156258,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/citation/,beuvw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4adff10f488d00168e9c9d/,5d4adff10f488d00168e9c9d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beuvw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/beuvw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/beuvw,NA

This chapter addresses the commitments which Georgia has imposed on itself, be that on the basis of unilateral acts or in the framework of an international agreement, and are aimed at approximating the Georgian law to that of the EU. Obviously, in this sense, commitments undertaken under the EU-Georgia Association Agreement are of great significance. The chapter explores Georgian approach to the EU law which is reflected in unilateral acts adopted by the Georgian lawmaker. Furthermore, particular attention is given over to commitments assumed under the EU-Georgia Association Agreement, especially to preserve and respect common values and to approximate Georgian laws to EU norms. It is argued that the EU law will be — especially through the Association Agreement — a decisive factor in the further development of the Georgian legal order. GABRICHIDZE, Gaga.

A review of South Australian school uniform policy following mandated requirement for choice.,"Background: School uniform options such as skirts and dresses can impact physical activity and psychological wellbeing of girls. Restrictions that exclude trousers/pants or shorts as uniform options for girls can promote inequality in comfort and engagement in school activities. The South Australian Department of Education and Child Development (DECD) School Dress Code Procedure mandates school dress codes provide flexible uniform options with the right to choice, regardless of gender. This review examines public school adherence to DECD guidelines, and compares girls’ uniform options between public and private school sectors.

Method: The proportion of girls shorts and pants/trouser options provided in school uniform policies collated in 2018 were compared across 486 public and 193 private primary, secondary, and combined schools within South Australia. Policies were grouped based on the choice they provided girls for shorts, and separately for trousers/pants. The groups were gender specific choice/open choice, unisex choice, restricted choice, or no option.

Results: Overall, 98.6% of public and 26.4% of private school policies included shorts as a uniform option for girls. Of these schools, about nine in ten public, and just over half private, policies listed gender-specific or open choice shorts options. All public primary and high schools, and a majority of combined schools (98.8%) provided girls pants/trouser options, with 93.4% providing gender specific or open choices. This compared to 34.2% of private school policies including girls’ pants options. In total less than 1.0% of public, and 45.5% to 66.7% of private schools provide no opportunity for girls to wear shorts every day. Similarly, 56.0% of private schools do not provide any trouser/pant option.

Conclusion: The results highlight a small proportion of public schools fail to follow mandated uniform policy procedures set by the DECD, specifically in context of shorts. Moreover, this report clearly demonstrates the discrepancy in girls’ uniform options between the public and private school sectors. We present suggestions and recommendations with the aim to improve current policy, as well as a need to advance adherence to policy and South Australian anti-discrimination legislation in public and particularly private schools.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-discrimination|gender equity|girls uniform|school uniform|uniform|uniform choice,2019-08-07T12:58:22.330514,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-07T12:57:56.915382,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6b|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|Gender Equity in Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/citation/,kvwge,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4abb72272b140019eabaf1/,5d4abb72272b140019eabaf1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kvwge/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kvwge,NA
