Various methods have been used to assess the effectiveness of CCT programs but little attention has been devoted to finding out whether the grantees had benefited on an individual level. This study aimed to determine the enrollment status and academic performance of the pioneer beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), a human development program of the Philippine national government using the CCT scheme in a barangay situated in a poor municipality and province. Using data from the parent leader and from the scholastic records, it was found out that the program had a positive impact on the education of the pioneer children beneficiaries of the locality studied and it was highly successful in attaining its aim of making poor children stay in school. The study argues for the tracking of individual grantees as a measure of the CCT program’s success. Due to the study’s inherent limitations and exploratory nature, the following are recommended: replicate the study on a larger scale; continue tracking the pioneer as well as the other beneficiaries of the program to see whether its long-term desired outcomes are met; and study its possible negative aspects and effects.

To maintain the indivisibility of the 2030 Agenda, a growing number of approaches have been developed to provide knowledge of SDG interactions in the form of trade-offs and synergies. In this paper, we take stock of the rapid development, which has characterised the field, and conduct a critical review of the approaches available to support decision makers with the implementation of the UN Agenda. Our overall ambition is to provide a broad understanding of the support provided by existing methodologies to decision makers in light of the challenges emerging from the interconnected nature of the SDGs.
To achieve the aim of the study, we elect three specific objectives: (a) identify and categorise the most prominent approaches available for understanding SDG interactions based on a review of the literature and experience of SDG interaction analysis for decision making; (b) evaluate the requirements of decision makers based on an online survey of representatives of private and public organisations committed to SDG implementation at national and subnational level in Sweden; (c) assess how the approaches comply with the requirements of decision makers based on the views and opinions of developers of prominent tools. Sweden was selected due to the widely shared ambition of becoming a front runner of SDG implementation, and also considering the research team’s familiarity with the local context. The focus on local and national organisations is justified by the recognition that, while the 2030 Agenda is global in nature, its implementation is expected to take place primarily at local, regional and national level.
The results of the study highlight the existence of both methodological and conceptual challenges that are relevant to the empirical analysis of SDG interactions. To effectively contribute to decision making, approaches and tools need to be easy to apply, transparent in their logic, assumptions and limitations, but also flexible and adaptable to different empirical cases, while the knowledge generated should be directly actionable and easy to interpret by decision makers. Based on the opinions of the developers, the tools evaluated perform very differently against the requirements of decision makers. Most tool are easy to use and to adapt to the analysis of new cases, while the results are directly understandable by decision makers. This applies also to less important requirements, such as the provision of knowledge sufficiently complete, accurate and precise. At the same time, most tools appear unable to provide results directly actionable to develop initiatives. The only criterion against which all tools perform relatively well is that of transparency.
In the next steps of the research, we plant to assess the views of decision makers on the selected tools by conducting a focus group exercise with a representative sample of decision makers. Improved understanding of the limitations and potentials of existing approaches for studying SDG interactions is considered vital to advance their analytical validity and use in decision making and, ultimately, the usefulness of the 2030 Agenda as a means of national and global governance.",TRUE,FALSE,Decision support|Methodologies|Survey|Sustainable Development Goals|Sweden,2020-10-27T05:57:41.076351,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-27T05:57:18.797436,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Lorenzo Di Lucia,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/citation/,seq8n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f946711b1ea1700dbc93c9c/,5f946711b1ea1700dbc93c9c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/seq8n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/seq8n

These results corroborate previous estimates of the US’ transgender population size. Furthermore, these new questions’ implementations mirror the successful inclusion of other small populations represented in the GSS, such as lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, as well as Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus. Data on transgender and gender nonconforming populations can be pooled together over time to assess these populations’ attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and social inequality patterns. We identified some inconsistencies between interviewer-coded sex, self-reported sex, and gender identity.

We found that: (i) cross-level communication increased more than that of same-level, (ii) while within-team messaging increased considerably, meetings stayed the same, (iii) off-hours messaging became much more frequent, and that this effect was stronger for women; (iv) employees respond to non-managers faster than managers; finally, (v) the number of short meetings increased while long meetings decreased. These findings contribute to theories on organizational communication, remote work, management, and flexibility stigma.

Homicide and assault trends in 44 US cities with a police-involved protest were analysed using an interrupted time series design. Results were combined using a meta-analysis, and moderators were tested in meta-regressions.

Leveraging the kink in college enrollment, we estimate a negative effect of college on mortality, which is larger for men, but also sizable for women. Intermediate labor market outcomes (e.g., labor force participation) explain 30% of the reduction in mortality.

A broad partnership with 1,650 people from communities around 18 primary schools across Barcelona provided the capacity to obtain unprecedented high-resolution NO2 levels and an updated asthma Health Impact Assessment. It is shown that NO2 levels vary considerably with at some cases very high levels. More than a 1,000 new cases of childhood asthma could be prevented each year by lowering NO2 levels. Representativity of site selection and the minimal number of samplers for land use regression modelling are considered. Enhancement of community knowledge and attitudes towards collective response were observed and identified as key drivers for successful large-scale monitoring campaigns. The results encourage strengthening collaboration with local communities when exploring environmental health issues.",TRUE,FALSE,air quality|citizen science|citizen social science|city|collective action|community|health impact assessment|large-scale|nitrogen dioxide|schools|sensors,2020-10-26T02:51:02.845950,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-26T02:50:43.188234,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/citation/,4snhf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f930c3d87b7df00453b4b63/,5f930c3d87b7df00453b4b63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4snhf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4snhf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4snhf

Policing is thought to be one antecedent to collective efficacy, but little empirical research has explored this question. Using three waves of survey data collected from London residents over three consecutive years, and multilevel Structural Equation Modelling, this study tested the impact of police visibility and police-community engagement on collective efficacy. We explored direct effects as well as indirect effects through trust in police. The findings showed both levels of police visibility and police-community engagement predicted trust in police. Trust in police fairness, in turn, predicted collective efficacy. There was a small indirect relationship between police visibility and collective efficacy, through trust in police fairness. In other words, police presence in neighbourhoods was associated with more positive views about officer behaviour, which in turn was associated with collective efficacy. The findings have important implications for policies designed to build stronger, more resilient communities.",TRUE,FALSE,collective efficacy|community policing|police presence|police visibility|procedural justice|trust in police,2020-10-24T15:55:23.653374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-24T15:55:00.644704,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/citation/,k7ren,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f92d4951017210037a44663/,5f92d4951017210037a44663,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k7ren/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k7ren

But the approval process is slow and cautious and no vaccine has yet been approved. The faster but perhaps riskier Russian system produced an approved coronavirus vaccine months more quickly, leaving Americans at risk of dying for months longer than Russians. Our data from two national surveys in September show that a majority of Americans would willingly take the existing Russian vaccine and that a two-to-one majority – rich and poor, young and old, Democrat and Republican alike  –  believe that they ought to be allowed to do so. We estimate that making the Russian vaccine immediately available would save approximately 40 to 100 American lives each day after the first month and many more subsequently, To put the matter bluntly, current US government policy will kill some 40 to 100 people each day for a considerable period later this year and early next. To put those deaths in context, all American murderers combined kill only 45 people each day – not a record the US government should wish to emulate. There are also implications for the 2020 election; Since feelings about the Russian coronavirus vaccine are strongly favorable, and the benefits of allowing it in the US are large, making it available should be attractive politically. The Republican government has the power to adopt that policy and gain the credit. Alternatively, the Democratic opposition has the opportunity to advocate that policy, and claim the credit.",TRUE,FALSE,American public opinion|Deaths averted|FDA|Legitimate control|Lives saved|Public opinion|Responibility|Sputnik-V|Trust|Vaccine|Vaccine approval|Vaccine attitudes|Vaccine hesitancy|Vax,2020-10-24T15:54:21.814415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-24T15:54:10.285701,FALSE,NA,no,"Data are proprietary, but will be made public after the article is published in a peer-reviewed journal.",,no,No time to pre-register as we were writing the questions as the survey was going into the field.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/citation/,9dpa8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3tz7e/,3tz7e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f927a87b1ea170022c96d7a/,5f927a87b1ea170022c96d7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dpa8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9dpa8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9dpa8
