It uses cyberspace to collect diverse research participants, coordinate projects and keep costs low. Recently social scientists began crowdsourcing their peers to engage in mass research targeting a specific topic. This enables meta-analysis of many analysts’ results obtained from a single crowdsourced research project, leading to exponential gains in credibility and scientific utility. Initial applications demonstrate positive returns for both original and replication research using various research instruments, and secondary or experimental data. It can provide more reliable Bayesian priors for selecting models and is an untapped mode of theory production that greatly benefit social science.

Evolutionary game theoretic models represent individual’s thought processes by strategy update protocols. The most common of these are random mutation, individual learning, selective imitation, and myopic optimization. Recently we introduced a new strategy update protocol - foresight - which takes into account future payoffs, and how groupmates respond to one’s own strategies. Here we apply our approach to a new 2x2 game, where one player, a leader, ensures via inspection and punishment that the other player, a subordinate, produces collective good. We compare the levels of inspection and production predicted by Nash Equilibrium, Quantal Response Equilibrium, level-k cognition, fictitious play, reinforcement learning, selective imitation, and foresight. We show that only foresight and selective imitation are effective at promoting contribution by the subordinate and inspection and punishment by the leader. The role of selective imitation in cultural and social evolution is well appreciated.

Prior computational analyses attempting to analyze these elements have primarily relied on summarizing relatively low-level features. Beginning with the early work of Barry Salt, one particularly prominent metric is the distribution of median shot lengths. Works on shot length include Yuri Tsivian's Cinemetrics project, Arclight, and Jeremy Butler's ShotLogger. Other computational analyses examine the aggregation of language and average shot color, image compositions, and analysis of film scripts. These projects have demonstrated the feasibility of distributing extracted metadata from copyrighted materials and the power of computational techniques in accessing useful information over a large collection of moving images.

This paper identifies a fourth: transitional temporality. This approach is inspired by Polanyi's (1944) comparative analysis of the rate of change of economic transformation surrounding the respective commodification of land and labor. Following Polanyi, transitional temporality focuses not on the endpoints of social transformation (as in teleological approaches), nor on moments of transformation (as in eventful approaches), but on the potentially lengthy transitions between structures. While eventful temporality equates agency with the choices made by individuals during relatively rare events, transitional temporality identifies the capacity for agents to alter the rate of change and, in so doing, to prevent or bring about events.

Victim survival in these incidents is often contingent on the speed and quality of care provided. Increasingly, new research has identified the role that specialized trauma care plays in victim survival from firearm-related injuries. Using nearly four years of data on shooting victimizations in Philadelphia we test whether distance to the nearest level 1 trauma center is associated with victim survival. We employ different distance measures based on street network distances, drive-time estimates, and Euclidean distance - comparing the predictive accuracy of each.

We estimate the lifetime and age-specific risks of being killed by police by race and sex. We also provide estimates of the proportion of all deaths accounted for by police use-of-force. We find that African American men and women, American Indian / Alaska Native men and women, and Latino men face higher lifetime risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. We find that Latino women and Asian / Pacific Islander men and women face lower risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. Risk is highest for Black men, who (at current levels of risk) face about a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over the life course. The average lifetime odds of being killed by police are about 1 in 2,000 for men and about 1 in 33,000 for women. Risk peaks between the ages of 20 and 35 for all groups. For young men of color, police use-of-force is among the leading causes of death.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|health inequalities|mortality|Police|police violence,2019-08-06T22:35:49.654142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-06T22:35:29.119748,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/citation/,kw9cu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c8qxh/,c8qxh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d484fbe90489f001a4b2973/,5d484fbe90489f001a4b2973,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9cu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw9cu/,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821204116,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw9cu

It uses a sequential logit model to study the changing impact of family background on educational transitions and educational attainment, comparing birth cohorts that completed their schooling during different stages of the market transition process. Data are derived from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a large and nationally representative household survey that provides detailed retrospective information. The findings show that in reform-era China educational inequality has increased despite large-scale educational expansion. Since the onset of the market reforms the importance of social origin has continuously increased, particularly at the crucial transition to senior high school. I suggest that the resulting pattern of expanding inequality can be explained by a combination of market-based educational reforms, increasing returns to education and massive increases in wider social and economic inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-05T12:53:01.933714,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-05T12:52:45.524908,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/citation/,tgc86,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bmf5k/,bmf5k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d47fcb3bcd6d900188f5bc4/,5d47fcb3bcd6d900188f5bc4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgc86/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tgc86/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tgc86
