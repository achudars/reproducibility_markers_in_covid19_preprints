While their purpose and form varies greatly, they all rely on the discretion of a professionalised bureaucracy to manage these processes and prepare their outcomes in a manner that they can feed into policy-making. Bureaucrats thus have a gate-keeping role. They can substantially influence whether and how information from participatory processes feeds into policy-making. Bureaucrats can thereby impact to what extent participatory mechanisms can deliver on their promise of giving citizens greater direct control over the policy-making process. Formal political control over the bureaucracy is limited in this case. Could informal controls make bureaucrats comply more with the demands of participatory mechanisms? This study employs a large field experiment (N=7,532) to test (1) whether citizen input filters through to bureaucrats tasked with policy design and implementation and (2) whether bureaucrats’ engagement with citizen input can be in- creased by using non-monetary rewards and value-based communication. The experiment accounts for heterogeneity by bureaucrat seniority, central versus street-level roles and involvement in the collection of citizen input. It finds no meaningful engagement at the baseline (C=0%) but that motivational interventions can significantly increase engagement (T1= 14%, T2=15%). The findings suggest that currently little input from citizens filters through to bureaucrats, but small tweaks substantially increase the democratic potential of participatory initiatives.",TRUE,FALSE,bureaucrat|field experiment|gate-keeping|participation|responsiveness,2020-01-26T19:12:45.683444,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-26T19:12:18.745949,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,Annabelle S.

However, this form of stigma, termed weight stigma by association, is poorly understood.

Objective: To investigate the sources, forms, and impacts of weight stigma by association among mothers of children with overweight or obesity. 

Methods: Mothers of 5 to 16-year-old children (N=34; 54% non-Hispanic White) participated in semi-structured interviews. A coding scheme was developed using the constant comparative method and reliably applied to interview transcripts. Mothers’ self-reported sociodemographic information, and height and weight were measured.

Results: Family members were a common source of negative comments to parents about children’s weight; these comments were often critical of mothers’ parenting and caused hurt feelings and family estrangement. Many mothers also reported negative feelings about their children’s physicians due to interactions about their children’s weight. Almost all mothers expressed guilt and sadness for not parenting differently; many internalized beliefs that they were bad parents because of their children’s weight. 

Conclusion: Mothers of children with overweight and obesity are frequently the target of weight stigma by association. Additional research is needed to elucidate the impacts of this form of stigma on parents’ health, the parent/child relationship, and children’s health.",TRUE,FALSE,Obesity|Parenting|Weight Stigma,2020-01-26T00:06:43.371374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-26T00:06:23.450438,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/citation/,u6f83,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a76bx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/relationships/node/,a76bx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2cca3ec19c5d016fedf73e/,5e2cca3ec19c5d016fedf73e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6f83/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u6f83/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u6f83,NA

This literature has argued that high schools are an important determinant of college attendance, with some contending that high schools matter more for college attendance than for academic achievement. A separate branch of research has illustrated how place-based opportunities facilitate college attendance. We merge these two literatures by asking if schools’ geographic context can explain apparent variation in effectiveness among Wisconsin high schools. We find that geographic context explains nearly a third of the variance in traditional estimates of school effectiveness on college attendance, because factors like proximity to colleges are strongly associated with college attendance. Accounting for geography is therefore important in order not to overstate high schools’ role in higher education outcomes. In contrast, geographic context explains little of the variance in academic achievement growth. Thus, if high schools seem to matter more for college attendance than for academic achievement under traditional estimates, schools’ apparent importance for the two outcomes converge upon adjusting for differences in geographic context.

They then argue that recoding or dropping these 30% cases led to an attenuated and statistically non-significant estimate of the effect of these events on mental health outcomes among black American adults. In this reply, we argue that (1) our use of the Mapping Police Violence project data was carefully considered and scientifically valid both from a theoretical and analytic perspective, and (2) that the difference between our estimates and Nix and Lozada’s do not arise from “miscoding” as the authors claim, but rather a different definition of what constitutes an unarmed victim. To probe the robustness of our results, we estimate 128 regressions models representing all combinations of exclusions of the seven classes of events Nix and Lozada dispute as being unarmed.

The problem is that the relativization of facts – the claim that knowledge is merely a product of power, history, and perspective – is a core aspect of present-day ideological thinking. Critical theories have been unable to respond to this challenge, because their critique has been directed against the opposite claim, namely, the naturalization of facts. While acknowledging this problem, this article argues that post-truth discourse actually combines relativization and naturalization. It does not simply relativize truth, but also naturalizes the belief in specific ‘facts’ – notably the belief that ‘conspiracies are behind it all’. Once we recognise the twin character of post-truth, we must reject the view of Bruno Latour and others who have made critique responsible for the crisis. Instead, it then becomes apparent that there are deep and disconcerting similarities between post-truth politics and the totalitarian and authoritarian ideologies of the 20th century. The task of critique is to confront and counter this resurgent ideology, thereby providing direction and orientation in the struggle for emancipation.",TRUE,FALSE,belief|conspiracy theories|courage|critical International Relations theory|critical IR theory|critical theory|critique|critique of ideology|cynicism|disbelief|emancipation|ideology|ideology critique|International Relations theory|IR theory|knowledge|naivety|naturalization|postmodernism|poststructuralism|post-truth|power|relativism|relativization|Trump|truth,2020-01-24T12:08:01.099763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-24T12:07:49.811584,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/citation/,5gxd2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2ad2c8c19c5d00d8edfd89/,5e2ad2c8c19c5d00d8edfd89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5gxd2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5gxd2,NA

Participatory governance claims to ``deepen'' democracy by offering citizens opportunities to express policy preferences throughout the electoral cycle.
When citizen input derived from participatory governance initiatives is at odds with the orders of politicians in power, (i) do bureaucrats side with political principals as most political economy accounts would predict, (ii) do they shape policy as the bureau-shaping hypothesis proposes, (iii) or is their reaction much more ad-hoc and driven by behavioural biases as theories of representative democracy and behavioural public administration would predict?
This study assesses this using a survey experiment with bureaucrats with managerial responsibilities, employed in the UK and US public sector.
 It finds that when citizen input and demands of political principals are at logger-heads, bureaucrats behave in line with the bureau-shaping hypothesis - they will shape policy design according to their professional norms and values. There is no evidence that they react to differences in how the information is framed, speaking against purely behavioural interpretation.",TRUE,FALSE,bureaucrat|conflict|experiment|framing effects|principal-agent,2020-01-24T12:06:21.567167,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-24T12:06:01.947029,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",Annabelle S Wittels,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/citation/,4x8q2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gxtuw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/relationships/node/,gxtuw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2ad29c87a1d900c21ce766/,5e2ad29c87a1d900c21ce766,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4x8q2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4x8q2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4x8q2,NA
