We focus on three dimensions of familial poverty: poverty depth, volatility in family income, and poverty duration. Regression results suggest that for both the mother and the father, repeated changes in work status between standard daytime hours, nonstandard hours, or not working significantly increased the probabilities of families experiencing 1) not only near-poor conditions, but also falling into poverty, if not deep poverty, 2) volatility in family income, and 3) longer durations of poverty. Working nonstandard hours brought another layer of instability and insecurity.

polarized than in the years before. Empirical evidence for opinion polarization has
been found regarding specific topics but is there a general trend in society? We
compare various polarization measures and find that in empirical data most of
them correlate strongly with the average attitude discrepancy between randomly
selected pairs which we propose as a catch-all measure for polarization. In an
exploratory data analysis of the European Social Survey, we analyze distributions
of individual responses on the left-right political self-placements and several other
attitudes. We find that distributions are typically not unimodal or bimodal, but
show more structure with up to five modes.
We exploit this structure by fitting a new model to distributions of answers on
an eleven-point attitude scale, and demonstrate that distributions can be
apportioned into moderates, extremists, and centrists. We use the model to
decompose general polarization into empirically meaningful components which we
use to analyze the complete data set across topics, across countries, and with
respect to time-trends establishing an overview and new perspectives on
polarization in Europe.",TRUE,FALSE,measurement|opinion polarization|polarization,2021-03-30T14:59:21.457578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-30T14:58:48.465189,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/citation/,3pn5w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6063320f22950302736f0099/,6063320f22950302736f0099,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pn5w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pn5w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pn5w

This is a primary driver of the gender wage gap. Research describing the patterns of occupational sex segregation focuses on supposedly innate job characteristics that match gender stereotypical abilities and preferences, such as the use of mathematical skills or social skills, on income and status differences between occupations, and on organizational job characteristics, for example, the need to work long hours. However, beyond such occupational attributes, sex segregation is hypothesized to exhibit emergent patterns that are linked to the interdependent job mobility of women and men, in particular, men selectively leaving feminizing occupations. Developing new tools inspired by statistical network research, and using representative, longitudinal data that contain detailed occupational mobility from the UK between 2000 and 2008, this replacement mechanism is analyzed. I show that 19-28% of observed sex segregation is linked to this emergent phenomenon in a statistical model that disentangles the various predictors of the allocation of women and men to different occupations. This makes it the most important predictor of segregation in contrast to concurrently modelled explanations based on occupational characteristics.",TRUE,FALSE,Occupational Mobility|Sex Segregation|Social Networks|Statistical Methodology,2021-03-30T13:03:06.182101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-30T13:02:48.723657,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.data-archive.ac.uk/,no,,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Per Block,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/citation/,g3ev5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6062e40b763cf502541baa8f/,6062e40b763cf502541baa8f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3ev5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g3ev5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g3ev5

However, previous methods for estimating mobility effects may be inefficient for identifying within- and between-group heterogeneity due to distributional changes in socioeconomic indicators such as education and occupation.  In this research, we propose an improved method, called the ""mobility contrast model"" (MCM), that is more efficient and flexible for detecting heterogeneous mobility effects depending on one's origin and/or destination socioeconomic status.  We revisited the debate about the mobility effect on fertility and analyzed the data from the classical Occupational Changes in a Generation Study 1962 (OCG-1) and the more recent data from the 1974-2018 General Social Survey (GSS) using both previous models and the MCM.  The MCM suggested a small association between fertility and occupational mobility in the GSS data but substantial and heterogeneous educational mobility effects on fertility in the OCG-1 and the GSS.  Such effects were difficult to pinpoint using previous methods because mobility effects of different magnitudes and opposite directions among mobility groups may cancel out.

Contemporary evidence confirms that, in developed countries, women from larger families indeed tend to have more children themselves. There is considerable doubt, however, whether intergenerational continuity in childbearing constitutes a universal feature of human societies. Based on a large-scale web-harvested collection of online memorials, we show that intergenerational continuity in childbearing in the U.S. emerged only in the first half of the 19th century, paralleling the country’s marked fertility decline. Furthermore, we show that statewide differences in intergenerational continuity in childbearing coincide with statewide differences in abortion laws. This suggests that control over individual fertility was a major driver of the emergence of intergenerational continuity in childbearing.

Using data from the CPSS-5 national survey, the authors looked at the digital help provided by individuals to various demographic cohorts during the pandemic period in Canada. This survey comprised 3,961 adult respondents aged 15 years old who were interviewed in September, 2020. Digital helpers assisted fellow Canadians in through navigating digital technologies such as videoconferencing, online voice chats, online shopping sites or educational resources. Digital helpers comprised 48% of the total adult population where the most typical form was the assistance of adult respondents aged 18 to 64 years old. Assistance to specific demographic cohorts such as children, teens and seniors varied according to the socio-demographic profiles of helpers. Multivariate analysis of seven typical types of digital help suggests that the likelihood of digital help increased with a younger age of the helper, the presence of a child living at home, university education, urban residence status and/or living in large households. Overall, digital help outcomes appeared to be linked to the life course position of the individual and the types of family or non family networks situated around the helper. The role of young married women living with children and other individuals as the new ""Good Samaritans"" of digital help is relevant in this regard.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|Good Samaritans|Pandemic|Technologies,2021-03-29T20:20:44.873972,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-29T20:20:17.941754,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,Fernando Mata,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/citation/,kw2f5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6061a85c22950301cb6eb3f7/,6061a85c22950301cb6eb3f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw2f5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw2f5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw2f5

How Populist Attitude Scales Fail to Capture Support for Populists in Power","Surveys of the attitudes of voters for populist parties generally measure three non-compensatory factors of populism: anti-elitism, people-centrism, and Manicheanism. Using Comparative Study of Electoral Systems Module 5 data for 23 countries, we evaluate whether this approach explains voting for populist parties across countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas. We show that the existing scale of populist attitudes effectively explains voting for populists in countries where populist leaders and parties are in opposition but fails to ex- plain voting for populist parties in countries where they are in power. We argue that current approaches assume ‘the elite’ to mean ‘politicians’, thus failing to capture attitudes towards ‘non-political elites’ often targeted by populists in office – journalists, academics, bureaucrats, etc. The results reveal limits to the usefulness of existing survey batteries in cross-national studies of populism and emphasize the need to develop approaches that are more generalizable across political and national contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,cross-national|CSES|Measurement|Populism|Structural Equation Modeling,2021-03-29T20:19:43.147805,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-29T20:19:22.430685,FALSE,NA,no,"Almost all of the data in this study is available as part of Advanced Release 2 of the CSES Module 5 surveys: https://cses.org/2020/05/15/cses-announcement-cses-module-5-second-advance-release-is-now-available-for-download/ - but a small number of countries' data was provided to us prior to public release, and will be added to the public CSES data in due course.",,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/citation/,be39q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606154d022950301a86eb85b/,606154d022950301a86eb85b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be39q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/be39q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/be39q

In this paper we examine the perceived discrimination of subordinate groups and reach rather different conclusions. We present causal evidence demonstrating that education decreases discriminatory attitudes while increasing perceived discrimination, and show that these asymmetric effects underpin a paradoxical phenomenon whereby discriminatory attitudes and perceived discrimination are negatively correlated at the country level. While our micro level claims are based on analysis of ethnoracial and gender discrimination in Europe, we show that the “intergroup discrimination paradox” describes patterns of discrimination on grounds as diverse as disability, sexual orientation and religion, in geographic contexts spanning the whole globe. Our findings suggest that education may increase awareness of existing discrimination among victims more than it decreases prejudice among perpetrators, thereby worsening rather than improving intergroup relations.",TRUE,FALSE,Education|Intergroup attitudes|Perceived Discrimination,2021-03-29T19:55:02.047698,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-29T19:54:36.965674,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Margarita Gelepithis Marco giani,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/citation/,2v96u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6060fd107ae1960195acecdb/,6060fd107ae1960195acecdb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v96u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2v96u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2v96u
