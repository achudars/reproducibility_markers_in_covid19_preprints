Many studies exploring factors potentially driving these trends have highlighted the increasing role of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in young people’s lives, and social media use in particular.  However, some studies suggest that factors in the school domain may also be important. Using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study, we investigate a series of factors explaining declining life satisfaction (LS) in eight countries with the largest declines in LS among 15-year-old adolescents in the period 2015-2018 (Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the United States, Japan, Ireland and France), with a focus on gender differences. We conducted a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis of the cohort gap in LS in relation to three key domains: school well-being, material well-being and ICT use. We find that the decline in LS was largely due to students having more negative experiences at school. This explained approximately 20-65% of the cohort gap in LS, with the exception of Japan. Changes in material well-being and ICT use explained 5-10% and only in some countries. Results vary across nations and in Japan these differ significantly from those observed in the other countries. Some gender differences were evident, for example, increases in time spent playing video games had a negative impact on LS among girls but not boys.

However, there is little comparative research examining changes in adolescents’ life satisfaction (LS) across a large number of countries, and critically, how this differs across sociodemographic groups. This study addresses this question by investigating changes in the LS of 15-year-old students between 2015 and 2018, with particular attention given to differences by gender, socio-economic status, immigrant background and urbanity. Data for this study come from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Due to the skewed nature of LS scale variables, the current study includes both mean levels of LS in a 0 to 10 scale, and the proportion of students reporting low LS (5 points or less). Linear regression models were used. Results demonstrate a global decline in mean levels of LS in 39 out of the 46 countries. In most countries, mean LS declined more among girls than among boys. Mean LS declined more, and the proportion of students reporting low LS increased more, among non-immigrant students and those of higher SES in the majority of countries.

Yet, when incomes follow random multiplicative growth, the ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate is higher than the time-average growth rate achieved by each individual in the long run. This mathematical fact is the starting point of ergodicity economics. Using the atypically high ensemble-average growth rate as the principal growth measure creates an incomplete picture. Policymaking would be better informed by reporting both ensemble-average and time-average growth rates. We analyse rigorously these growth rates and describe their evolution in the United States and France over the last fifty years. The difference between the two growth rates gives rise to a natural measure of income inequality, equal to the mean logarithmic deviation. Despite being estimated as the average of individual income growth rates, the time-average growth rate is independent of income mobility.

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the psychological wellbeing of populations worldwide. In this study, we assess changes in mental health during the early months of the pandemic in Canada and examine its relationship with another prominent problem during this time, economic concerns. 
Methods
Analyses were based on two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (N=4,627 in March and 4,600 in May). We described the changes in mental health and economic concerns between March and May, and assessed the relationship between the two characteristics.
Results
Mental health declined significantly during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the proportion of Canadian adults who reported only good/fair/poor mental health grew from 46% to 52% from March to May. Economic concerns including food insecurity were an important correlate of ‘bad’ mental health, as was younger age, female gender, and Canada-born status. Contrary to expectations, however, economic concerns lessened during this time frame. 
Conclusions
These findings suggest that policies to mitigate economic stress, such as Canada’s Emergency Response Benefit, may have eased mental health deterioration in early pandemic months through a reduction in financial hardship. Interventions to increase the economic security of the population will have far-reaching consequences in terms of improved mental health, and should be continued throughout the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,adults|Canada|COVID-19|economic|mental health,2020-10-18T21:23:02.029901,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-18T21:22:47.007126,FALSE,NA,no,The data are available to Canadian researchers via Statistics Canada’s Data Liberation Initiative and to international researchers by request at dli-idd@statcan.gc.ca from Statistics Canada.,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/citation/,76me2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f88bc4037b6bb01ba309281/,5f88bc4037b6bb01ba309281,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/76me2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/76me2,NA

However, much of the world’s population is now digitally accessible, offering an opportunity for researchers with limited budgets and those seeking to study settings where in-person contact is impossible, such as natural disasters, violent conflicts, and pandemics. In this paper, we evaluate whether Facebook advertising can be used to cost-effectively generate representative survey samples in the Global South. We introduce a framework for evaluating quality in Facebook survey samples, highlighting key trade-offs for researchers considering the platform. We then quota-sample respondents in two countries: Mexico (n=5,168) and Kenya (n=1,452) to evaluate how well these samples perform on a diverse set of survey indicators related to both internal and external validity. We find that while the Facebook platform can quickly and cheaply recruit respondents, these samples tend to be more male, more educated, and more urban than the overall national populations.

Existing studies, with their focus on impersonal and procedural modes of governance, have largely neglected to examine the human labor through which platform companies attempt to elicit the consent of their users. This study describes the relationship labor that is systematically excised from many platforms’ accounts of what they do and missing from much of the scholarship on platform governance. Relationship labor is carried out by agents of platform companies who engage in interpersonal communications with a platform’s users in an effort to align diverse users’ activities and preferences with the company’s interests. The authors draw on ethnographic research conducted at AllDone (a for-profit startup that built an online market for local services) and edX (a non-profit startup that partnered with institutions to offer Massive Open Online Courses). The findings leverage variation in organizational contexts to elaborate the common practices and divergent strategies of relationship labor deployed by each platform. Both platforms relied on relationship workers to engage in account management practices aimed at addressing the particular concerns of individual users through interpersonal communications. Relationship workers in each setting also engaged in community management practices that facilitated contact and collaboration among users in pursuit of shared goals. However, our findings show that the relative frequency of relationship workers’ use of account management and community management practices varies with organizational conditions. This difference in strategies also corresponded to different ways of valuing relationship workers and incorporating them into organizational processes.

However, this may not be so since the prerequisites of coherence are varied and the criteria are language and culture specific. Cohesion plays a pivotal role in the realisation of coherence, in particular, and the texture of the text, in general. In Quranic Arabic, some of the linguistic mechanisms through which the text producer aims to attain coherence do not occur in other languages. Thus, the contribution to knowledge and originality applies to the current work. The plugging of a research gap in this field of linguistics can be demonstrated in the need to explain the prototypical discourse characteristics of Quranic Arabic. This is represented in the attainment of coherence through (i) morphological relatedness, (ii) the text producer’s selection of a grammatical category such as verb/noun/adjective that is fundamental to the central idea of the statement, (iii) the selection of a specific comparative adjective, (iv) the selection of a specific comparative God’s epithet, and (v) the selection of a specific sentence-final God’s couplet epithets. For the purpose of this paper’s analyses, a sample of Quranic lexical items has been selected from different sūrahs (chapters) and are provided with a discourse-oriented analysis with a view to their attainment of coherence.",TRUE,FALSE,coherence|cohesion|Quanic Arabic|Quranic linguistics.|sūrahs,2020-10-15T14:57:42.874783,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-15T14:56:50.190346,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d27|Arts and Humanities|Modern Languages,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/citation/,evmjn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f85df33d85b7000956578bf/,5f85df33d85b7000956578bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/evmjn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/evmjn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/evmjn,NA
