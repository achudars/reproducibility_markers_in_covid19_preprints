It is the key to the learners' success in ODL system. The geographical separation of the teachers and learners along with socio-psychological constraints i.e. language, culture, motivation, inadequate skill, anxiety etc., affects the distance learners in completing the courses successfully. The counselling sessions also offer the students an opportunity to interact with their peers. The counsellors perform various roles, such as facilitating learners about the subject matter content, assessing assignments, providing motivation and encouragement and supervising research papers/project works. Since counselling is an important component of distance education, it is necessary to understand the concept. The Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) provides highly integrated learner support services through the network of study centers, regional centers and the headquarters.

Though the student’s enrollment in Higher Education through ODL system has increased, but the ODL institutions need to emphasize on student success rates. There are a number of factors that contribute toward better success rate. In this article one online survey was undertaken among successful learners of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) through Google form with questionnaires on their success factors.

Yet despite the breadth and richness of his work, current sociology typically focuses only on individual dimensions. On the one hand, Simmel’s work is seen as foundational to a formal sociology, which is at the core of social network analysis. On the other hand, Simmel’s works on cultural issues yield astute analyses of modernity, which is why they are classics in the sociology of culture. However, such one-dimensional interpretations of Simmel’s work appear limited and in turn do not sufficiently capture his influence on the field of sociology. This chapter claims that the separated readings of the “two Simmels” need to be brought together to make full analytical use of Simmel’s most important heuristic distinction: form and content. Moreover, we will show that relational sociology of the past four decades has moved in that direction by taking the interrelation of structure and meaning seriously.",TRUE,FALSE,Formal Sociology|Interactionism|Relational Sociology|Simmel|Social Network Analysis,2020-06-23T18:19:01.335667,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-23T17:52:26.829748,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/citation/,3cwvg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef082f4145b1a019f52d669/,5ef082f4145b1a019f52d669,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cwvg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3cwvg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3cwvg

However, recent studies have questioned the validity of the theory. In this letter, we estimate the first meta-analysis of the relationship between the number of legislators and public spending. Based on a sample of 29 articles, we find no robust evidence for the effect of legislature size on government budgets. Yet the aggregate results show significant heterogeneity. While earlier studies provide moderate support for the ""law of 1/n"", papers using causal inference methods consistently find a negative relationship between seats and spending. The available evidence also indicates that proportional representation and mixed voting systems are no more likely to overspend than majoritarian ones.",TRUE,FALSE,distributive politics|law of 1/n|legislature size|meta-analysis|public spending,2020-06-23T07:53:49.763554,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-23T07:53:27.463801,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/danilofreire/distributive-politics-meta-analysis,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/citation/,xf7wp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef0453b6598280167cf0e01/,5ef0453b6598280167cf0e01,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf7wp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xf7wp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xf7wp

However, the extraction and use of natural resources is highly interconnected, spatially and sectorally, within a complex web of interactions and feedbacks. Conventional resource footprinting does not reveal how pressures on natural resources are distributed across country and sector supply networks. Within this study pressures across the global water, energy and land (WEL) system are located within the supply networks of 189 countries and 24 global sectors. Pathways of water, energy and land use are found to be mainly indirect, arising from country and sector resource dependencies on immediate (Scope 2) and upstream (Scope 3) producers in their supply network. However, the distribution of these pressures is found to exhibit a high level of variation within and between national and sectoral supply networks and resource systems. Such differences in the resource pressure profile of countries and sectors is scarcely recognised by existing modelling approaches or supplier reporting guidelines, but is of major consequence for the study and management of pressures across the WEL system. If measures are not taken to extend accountability for the indirect pressures imposed across the WEL system, the resource burden of consumption will be greatly mismanaged.",TRUE,FALSE,MRIOA|Production Layer Decomposition (PLD)|resource security|Scope 1-3|sector supply chains|water-energy-land,2020-06-23T04:12:31.974437,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-23T04:11:51.997461,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/zy9af/,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/citation/,ue45p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zy9af/,zy9af,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef036206598280156cfb277/,5ef036206598280156cfb277,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue45p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ue45p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ue45p

In this article, we apply computational word embeddings to a 200-million-word corpus of American print media (1930-2009) to examine how these stereotypes changed as women’s educational attainment caught up with and eventually surpassed men’s. This transformation presents a rare opportunity to observe how stereotypes change alongside the reversal of an important pattern of stratification. We track six stereotypes that prior work has linked to academic outcomes. Our results suggest that stereotypes of socio-behavioral skills and problem behaviors—attributes closely tied to the core stereotypical distinction between women as communal and men as agentic—remained unchanged. The other four stereotypes, however, became increasingly gender-polarized: as women’s academic attainment increased, school and studying gained increasingly feminine associations, whereas both intelligence and unintelligence gained increasingly masculine ones. Unexpectedly, we observe that trends in the gender associations of intelligence and studying are near-perfect mirror opposites, suggesting that they may be connected. Overall, the changes we observe appear consistent with contemporary theoretical accounts of the gender system that argue that it persists partly because surface stereotypes shift to reinterpret social change in terms of a durable hierarchical distinction between men and women.",TRUE,FALSE,computational sociology|cultural change|education|gender stereotypes|gender system|word embeddings,2020-06-23T04:09:12.638938,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-23T04:08:48.921905,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Andrei Boutyline|Alina Arseniev-Koehler|Devin J.
