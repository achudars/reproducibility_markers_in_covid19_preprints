We used two waves of the nationally representative Canadian Financial Capability Survey along with propensity score matching to compare outcomes between persons who had taken a financial education course to those who had not. After matching and adjusting for demographic and economic factors, financial education participants exhibited significantly higher financial knowledge and financial self-efficacy scores. Post-estimation analysis showed that higher overall financial knowledge scores of participants were at least partially driven by higher scores of men. There was no difference in knowledge scores for women across all age groups. Financial education participants had higher efficacy scores for both genders and across age.

Our design allows us to explore which groups of people actually exhibit different cognitive biases. We find that the majority of people in our experiment do not exhibit loss aversion bias and that several people exhibit an opposite bias we call “turtling.” Turtlers prefer smaller certain options when choices are framed as losses and larger uncertain options when they are framed as gains.

This was not an isolated case. Proactive monitoring and filtering found their way in the legal system as a privileged enforcement strategy through legislation, judicial decisions and private ordering. In multiple jurisdictions, recent case law has imposed proactive monitor obligations on intermediaries. These cases uphold proactive monitoring across the entire spectrum of intermediary liability subject matters: intellectual property, privacy, defamation, and hate/dangerous speech. In this context, however, notable exceptions—such as the landmark Belen case in Argentina—highlight also a fragmented international response. Legislative proposals have been following suit. As part of its Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Commission, would like to introduce filtering obligations for intermediaries to close a “value gap” between rightholders and online platforms allegedly exploiting protected content. In addition, proactive monitoring and filtering obligations would also feature in an update of the European audio-visual media legislation. Meanwhile, online platforms have already set up miscellaneous filtering schemes on a voluntary basis.

In this paper, I suggest that we are witnessing the death of “no monitoring obligations,” a well-marked trend in intermediary liability policy. Current Internet policy—especially in Europe—is silently drifting away from a fundamental safeguard for freedom of expression online. In this respect, this paper would like to contextualize this trend within the emergence of a broader move towards private enforcement online. The EU Digital Single Market Strategy apparently endorsed voluntary measures as a privileged tool to curb illicit and infringing activities online. As I argued elsewhere, the intermediary liability discourse is shifting towards an intermediary responsibility discourse. This process might be pushing an amorphous notion of responsibility that incentivizes intermediaries’ self-intervention. In addition, filtering and monitoring will be dealt almost exclusively by intermediaries through automatic infringement assessment systems. Due process and fundamental guarantees get mauled by algorithmic enforcement, limiting enjoyment of exceptions and limitations, use of public domain works, and silencing speech according to the mainstream ethical discourse. The upcoming reform—and the border move that it portends—might finally slay “no monitoring obligations” and fundamental rights online, together with the untameable monster.",TRUE,FALSE,caselaw|Copyright|courts|Defamation|filtering|Hate Speech|Intellectual Property|Intermediary Liability|international|Internet|monitoring|no monitoring obligations|Online Platform|Privacy|Private Ordering,2018-07-02T11:15:44.938601,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-09T15:14:48.276707,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3e|Law|Constitutional Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/citation/,hy7fk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s6m8r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/relationships/node/,s6m8r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59db91689ad5a102b19b39d5/,59db91689ad5a102b19b39d5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy7fk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hy7fk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hy7fk,NA

From Intermediary Liability to Responsibility,"Since the enactment of the first safe harbours and liability exemptions for online intermediaries, market conditions have radically changed. Originally, intermediary liability exemptions were introduced to promote an emerging Internet market. Do safe harbours for online intermediaries still serve innovation? Should they be limited or expanded? These critical questions—often tainted by protectionist concerns—define the present intermediary liability conundrum. In this context, this paper would like to explain the recent developments in intermediary liability theory and policy within a broader move towards private ordering online. Public enforcement lacking technical knowledge and resources to address an unprecedented challenge in terms of global human semiotic behaviour would coactively outsource enforcement online to private parties.

Online intermediaries’ governance would move away from a well-established utilitarian approach and toward a moral approach by rejecting negligence-based intermediary liability arrangements. Miscellaneous policy tools—such as monitoring and filtering obligations, blocking orders, graduated response, payment blockades and follow-the-money strategies, private DNS content regulation, online search manipulation, or administrative enforcement—might reflect this change in perspective. In particular, governments—and interested third-parties such as intellectual property rightholders—try to coerce online intermediaries into implementing these policy strategies through voluntary measures and self-regulation, in addition to validly enacted obligations. This process might be pushing an amorphous notion of responsibility that incentivizes intermediaries’ self-intervention to police allegedly infringing activities in the Internet. In this sense, the intermediary liability discourse is shifting towards an intermediary responsibility discourse.

Further, enforcement would be looking once again for an ‘answer to the machine in the machine’. By enlisting online intermediaries as watchdogs, governments would de facto delegate online enforcement to algorithmic tools. Due process and fundamental guarantees get mauled by technological enforcement, curbing fair uses of content online and silencing speech according to the mainstream ethical discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,Copyright|Defamation|Hate Speech|Intellectual Property|Intermediary Liability|Internet|Online Platform|Private Ordering,2018-07-02T11:15:44.898789,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-09T15:01:32.347090,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/citation/,t6ryb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/39rka/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/relationships/node/,39rka,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59db8eb8594d9002c699d4ef/,59db8eb8594d9002c699d4ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t6ryb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t6ryb,NA

Therefore, intermediaries have become a main focus of privacy regulations, especially in jurisdictions with a strong tradition of privacy protection such as Europe. In a landmark case, the ECJ ruled that an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties. The recognition by the European Union of a so called “right to be forgotten” (RTBF) has ignited disgruntled reactions from civil society and legal scholars, especially in the United States. Meanwhile, proposals for the adoption of a similar right have appeared in several jurisdictions, including Brazil, Japan, Korea, and Russia. Supposedly, the right to be forgotten would endanger freedom of expression (FoE) and access to information. Apparently, factoids — defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “an item of unreliable information that is reported and repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact” — dominated the recent debate surrounding the right to be forgotten. This paper will discuss and debunk these factoids, review data protection legislation in Europe, and explore the legal and policy implications of the newly emerging right to be forgotten. Finally, the idea that extra-territorial application of the RTBF might unleash a kraken that can break down the Internet will be contextualized within the present political scenario. The extra-territorial application of the RTBF follows in the footsteps of a global move towards data protectionism against the de facto market dominance of US Internet conglomerates.

Ultimately—as I have discussed elsewhere—resistance to the Digital Revolution can be seen as a response to Baudrillard’s call to a return to prodigality beyond the structural scarcity of the capitalistic market economy. In Baudrillard’s terms, by increasingly commodifying knowledge and expanding copyright protection, we are taming limitless power with artificial scarcity to keep in place a dialectic of penury and unlimited need. In this paper, I will focus on certain global movements that do resist copyright expansion, such as creative commons, the open access movement, the Pirate Party, the A2K movement and cultural environmentalism. A nuanced discussion of these campaigns must account for the irrelevance of copyright in the public mind, the emergence of new economics of digital content distribution in the Internet, the idea of the death of copyright, and the demise of traditional gatekeepers. Scholarly and market alternatives to traditional copyright merit consideration here, as well.

This notion has been largely forgotten by modern policies that regulate creativity and speech. As hard as it may be to believe, the most valuable components of our immortal culture were created under a fully open regime with regard to access to pre-existing expressions and reuse. From the Platonic mimesis to Shakespeare’s “borrowed feathers,” the largest part of our culture has been produced under a paradigm in which imitation—even plagiarism—and social authorship formed constitutive elements of the creative moment. Pre-modern creativity spread from a continuous line of re-use and juxtaposition of pre-existing expressive content, transitioning from orality to textuality and then melding the two traditions. The cumulative and collaborative character of the oral formulaic tradition dominated the development of epic literature. The literary pillars of Western culture, the Iliad and the Odyssey, were fully forged in the furnace of that tradition. Later, under the aegis of Macrobius’ art of rewriting and the Latin principles of imitatio, medieval epics grew out of similar dynamics of sharing and recombination of formulas and traditional patterns. Continuations, free re-use, and the re-modeling of iconic figures and characters, such as King Arthur and Roland, made chansons de geste and romance literature powerful vehicles in propelling cross-country circulation of culture.

The parallelism between past and present highlights the incapacity of the present copyright system to recreate the cumulative and collaborative creative process that proved so fruitful in the past. In particular, the constant development and recursive use of iconic characters, which served as an engine for creativity in epic literature, is but a fading memory. This is because our policies for creativity are engineered in a fashion that stymies the re-use of information and knowledge, rather than facilitating it. Under the current regime, intellectual works are supposedly created as perfect, self-sustaining artifacts from the moment of their creation. Any modifications, derivations, and cumulative additions must secure preventive approval and must be paid off, as if they were nuisances to society.

Rereading the history of aesthetics is particularly inspiring at the dawn of the networked age. The dynamics of sharing of pre-modern creativity parallel the features of digital networked creativity. As in the oral-formulaic tradition, digital creativity reconnects its exponential generative capacity to the ubiquity of participatory contributions. Additionally, the formula—the single unit to be used and reused, worked and re-worked—is the building block of the remix culture as well as the oral formulaic tradition. Today, in an era of networked mass collaboration, ubiquitous online fan communities, user-based creativity, digital memes, and remix culture, the enclosure of knowledge brought about by an ever-expanding copyright paradigm is felt with renewed intensity. Therefore, I suggest that the communal, cumulative, social and collaborative nature of creativity and authorship should be rediscovered and should drive our policies.

For millennia, the production of creative artifacts has lain at the intersection between gift and market economy. From the time of Pindar and Simonides—and until the Romanticism will commence a process leading to the complete commodification of creative artifacts—market exchange models run parallel to gift exchange. From Roman amicitia to the medieval and Renaissance belief that scientia donum dei est, unde vendi non potest, creativity has been repeatedly construed as a gift. Again, at the time of the British and French “battle of the booksellers,” the rhetoric of the gift still resounded powerfully from the nebula of the past to shape the constitutional moment of copyright law. The return of gift exchange models has a credible source in the history of creativity.

Today, after a long unchallenged dominance of the market, gift economy is regaining momentum in the digital society. The anthropological and sociological studies of gift exchange, such as Marcel Mauss’s The Gift, served to explain the phenomenon of open source software and hacker communities. Later, communities of social trust—such as Wikipedia, YouTube, and fan-fiction communities—spread virally online through gift exchange models. In peer and user-generated production, community recognition supersedes economic incentives. User-based creativity thrives on the idea of “playful enjoyment,” rather than economic incentives.

Anthropologists placed societies on an economic evolutionary scale from gift to commodity exchange; in a continuum from the clan to capitalist system of organization. I suggest that this continuum should now extend to the “crowd society,” which features new modes of social interaction in digital online communities. The networked, open, and mass-collaborative character of the crowd society enhances the proliferativeness of the gift exchange model that lies in what anthropologists and social scientists described as a debt-economy.

The exploration of the creative mechanics of online communities put under scrutiny the validity of utilitarian theories of copyright and traditional market economy models. From Émile Durkheim and Mauss to Alain Caillé, anti-utilitarian thought designed a new political economy that defines humans as a “cooperative species,” rather than Homo economicus. In this context, I look into commons theory, through the lens of Elinor Ostrom’s work, and its application to modern commons-based peer production with special emphasis on Yochai Benkler and Jerome Reichman’s work. 

In conclusion, I evoke Jean Baudrillard’s essential question: “Will we return, one day, beyond the market economy, to prodigality?” I consider whether the digital revolution that promoted the emergence of the networked information economy is that “revolution of the social organization and of social relations” that might bring about, according to Jean Baudrillard, “real affluence” through a return to “collective prodigality,” rather than our “productivistic societies, which [...] are dominated by scarcity, by the obsession with scarcity characteristic of the market economy.” I argue that a possibility for the reinstatement of Baudrillard’s “collective prodigality” might have materialized in the “crowd society” thanks to technological advancement and the emergence of a consumer gift system or “user patronage,” promoting an unrestrained, diffused, and networked discourse between creators and the public through digital crowd-funding.",TRUE,FALSE,Baudrillard|copyright|creativity|economics|gift economy|internet,2018-07-02T11:14:58.636524,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-08T22:34:07.429252,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4f|Law|Law and Economics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c58|Law|Law and Philosophy|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/citation/,qj3uh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rhnxy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/relationships/node/,rhnxy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59daa72c9ad5a102b49b7b32/,59daa72c9ad5a102b49b7b32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qj3uh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qj3uh,NA

Originally, intermediary liability exemptions were introduced to promote an emerging Internet market. Do safe harbours for online intermediaries still serve innovation? Should they be limited or expanded? These critical questions—often tainted by protectionist concerns—define the present intermediary liability conundrum. Apparently, safe harbours still hold, although secondary liability is on the rise. As part of its Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Commission would like to introduce sectorial legislation that would de facto erode liability exemptions for online intermediaries, especially platforms. Under the assumption of closing a “value gap” between rightholders and online platforms allegedly exploiting protected content, the proposal would implement filtering obligations for intermediaries and introduce neighbouring rights for online uses of press publications. Meanwhile, an upcoming revision of the Audio-visual Media Services Directive would ask platforms to put in place measures to protect minors from harmful content and to protect everyone from incitement to hatred. Finally, the EU Digital Single Market Strategy has endorsed voluntary measures as a privileged tool to curb illicit and infringing activities online. This paper would like to contextualize the recent EU reform proposal within a broader move towards turning online intermediaries into Internet police. This narrative builds exclusively upon governmental or content industry assumptions, rather than empirical evidence. Also, the intermediary liability discourse is shifting towards an intermediary responsibility discourse. Apparently, the European Commission aligns its strategy for online platforms to a globalized, ongoing move towards privatization of enforcement online through algorithmic tools. This process might be pushing an amorphous notion of responsibility that incentivizes intermediaries’ self-intervention to police allegedly infringing activities in the Internet.",TRUE,FALSE,copyright|EU|European law|internet|platform|platforms|reform|technology,2018-07-02T11:14:58.416009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-08T22:23:30.898153,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7b|Law|Common Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/citation/,w7fxv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3f4zc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/relationships/node/,3f4zc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59daa3fa594d9002c5991bc5/,59daa3fa594d9002c5991bc5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w7fxv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w7fxv,NA
