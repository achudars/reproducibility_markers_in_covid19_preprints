Methods: We included studies conducted in any population, describing either the impact of the closure or reopening of hospitality venues, or exposure to these venues, on the incidence or mortality from COVID-19. We used a snowball sampling approach with backward and forward citation search along with co-citations. 
Results: We found 20 articles examining the role of hospitality venues in the epidemiology of COVID-19. Modeling studies showed that interventions reducing social contacts in indoor venues can reduce COVID-19 transmission. Studies using statistical models showed similar results, including that the closure of hospitality venues is amongst the most effective measures in reducing incidence or mortality. Case studies highlighted the role of hospitality venues in generating super-spreading events, along with the importance of air flow and ventilation inside these venues.

In these newsrooms, Christin finds web journalists using algorithmically mediated metrics (or “analytics”) that document “the preferences of their readers, the popularity of their articles, and the reactions of their followers” (pxiii). The book demonstrates conclusively that these analytics have had far-reaching impacts on how newsrooms operate but these may not be what we commonly assume: analytics software did not lead journalists to maximize their clicks by producing more standardized material for the lowest common denominator. Instead, journalists responded in complex ways, drawing on their traditions and craft to balance their conflicting goals, such as seeking approval from their audiences and peers, and producing “good” journalism while also making a living wage. Christin labels these conflicts as arising from journalists’ “click-based” versus “editorial” modes of evaluation. The metrics were thus symbols through which journalists debated and constructed their “algorithmic publics”; they inspired debate on what journalism was, who it was for, and what its relationship to other institutions of society might be.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithms|journalism|metrics,2021-03-20T16:40:07.926761,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-20T16:39:43.666365,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/citation/,hxf4m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6054c9d090bb4e0120154ca6/,6054c9d090bb4e0120154ca6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxf4m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hxf4m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hxf4m,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12844

Considering individuals’ perceptions of the pandemic risks, we devised a ten-point tradeoff scale asking people to situate their concern between health and the economy. We administered this question seven times to a representative panel of French residents from April until November 2020, establishing a barometer that tracked changes and heterogeneity between these two concerns. We find overall concern moved in favor of the economy over time. There is substantial heterogeneity across respondents: those reporting risk from Covid-19, lower subjective social status and politically leftwing preferences were more concerned with health than the rest of the population.

However, changing jobs does not necessarily lead to higher job satisfaction in the long run: instead, previous studies have shown that changing jobs only increases job satisfaction for a shorter period of time before it gradually falls back to similar levels as before. This phenomenon is known as the honeymoon-hangover pattern. In our study, we identify an important new moderator of the relation between job changes and job satisfaction: the job-education match of job change. Based on relative deprivation theory, we argue that a job change out of overqualification lowers the likelihood of negative comparisons and thus increases the honeymoon period and lessens the hangover. In addition, we investigate whether this moderating effect is weaker for immigrants, since the phenomenon of overqualification occurs more frequently among them. We use data from the Socio-Economic Panel ranging from 1994-2018 and focus specifically on individual-periods of employees before and after job changes (N=134,417).

However, little is known about how long people could expect to be unemployed for more than one year during their lifespan, and which age groups are spending more time out of work while looking for jobs. We apply demographic techniques to enhance our understanding of long-term unemployment, and use the European Labour Force Survey and mortality data to calculate the time that a person could expect to be unemployed for more than a year in 25 European countries between 2000 and 2018. We identify four groups of countries that are characterised by different trends in the duration of long-term unemployment. Results show very different impact of the 2008 Recession on the length of long-term unemployment in Europe, and it was especially large in Southern and Eastern countries, as well as in Ireland. In addition, although younger workers record higher rates of long-term unemployment, older workers could expect to spend a larger proportion of their working lives unemployed.

To study this question, I analyze a formal model of political accountability where politicians can have authority over one or two policy areas. When all politicians act sincerely, voters are always better off with unbundled policies. However, the voter is indifferent when all politicians pander. When bundled politicians partially-pander, the optimal institution is dependent on how likely the politician is to be a good type. I then show that voters are willing to spend more to monitor politicians in charge of multiple policy areas.",TRUE,FALSE,Accountability|Elections|Pandering,2021-03-18T21:14:22.983768,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T21:13:59.779675,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/citation/,a6n58,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6053bd5ae8afef00c95f2420/,6053bd5ae8afef00c95f2420,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6n58/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6n58/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a6n58,NA

As a result, women are generally more likely than men to follow expert medical recommendations for avoiding health risks. In the context of rampant misinformation, however, the pressure women face to control risks may lead them to disproportionately oppose some new efforts to promote public health. We investigate this possibility using a novel mixed-methods study examining gendered opposition to two school-based public health initiatives related to COVID-19. Nationally representative surveys of 1,946 parents reveal that mothers are significantly more likely than other parents to oppose school-required immunizations against COVID-19 and significantly more likely to report planning not to vaccinate their children. This opposition is particularly pronounced among white Republican/Republican-leaning mothers (54% opposed). Simultaneously, however, mothers are significantly less likely than other parents to oppose school mask mandates, with white Democrat/Democrat-leaning fathers being most opposed (45%). In-depth interviews with a socioeconomically, politically, and racially/ethnically diverse group of mothers (N=64) link these patterns to mothers’ beliefs that they can control the risks of COVID-19 (including through use of masks) but not the risks of COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, we conclude that, in the context of rampant misinformation, gendered pressures lead mothers to disproportionately support initiatives they perceive as useful for controlling health risks and disproportionately oppose initiatives they perceive as introducing uncontrollable risks. Given high rates of parental opposition to COVID-related public health initiatives, we suggest that a consumeristic model of medicine, coupled with widespread misinformation, may lead to a crisis of confidence that undermines public health.",TRUE,FALSE,children|COVID-19|gender|health|immunizations|masks|misinformation|motherhood|politics|schools|vaccines,2021-03-18T20:23:03.103457,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T20:22:26.149427,FALSE,NA,no,Data used in the quantitative portion of this analysis are available from the authors upon request.,,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/citation/,tv8zw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6053a27cc402cc00ae975a19/,6053a27cc402cc00ae975a19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tv8zw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tv8zw,NA
