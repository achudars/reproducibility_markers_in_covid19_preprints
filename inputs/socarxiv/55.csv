For scientists engaged in this task, putting phages in a collection does not conduct, at any point of the process, to essentialization. Rather, it is a way to engage with pluribiosis, with the recognition of the existence of multiple relational spectrums between entities forever in the process of becoming, constantly shaped and transformed by their interactions with other living things.

The pathway of classical experimental science to be mathematized gradually and smoothly by more and more relevant mathematical models seems to be inapplicable. Anyway quantum mechanics suggests another pathway for mathematization; considering the historical reality as dual or “complimentary” to its model. The historical reality by itself can be seen as mathematical if one considers it in Hegel’s manner as a specific interpretation of the totality being in a permanent self-movement due to being just the totality, i.e. by means of the “speculative dialectics” of history, however realized as a theory both mathematical and empirical and thus falsifiable as by logical contradictions within itself as emprical discrepancies to facts. Not less, a Husserlian kind of “historical phenomenology” is possible along with Hegel’s historical dialectics sharing the postulate of the totality (and thus, that of transcendentalism). One would be to suggest the transcendental counterpart: an “eternal”, i.e. atemporal and aspatial history to the usual, descriptive temporal history, and equating the real course of history as with its alternative, actually happened branches of the regions of the world as with only imaginable, counterfactual histories. That universal and transcendental history is properly mathematical by itself, even in a neo-Pythagorean model. It is only represented on the temporal screen of the standard historiography as a discrete series of unique events. An analogy to the readings of the apparatus in quantum mechanics can be useful. Even more, that analogy is considered rigorously and logically as implied by the mathematical transcendental history and sharing with it the same quantity of information as an invariant to all possible alternative or counterfactual histories. One can involve the hypothetical external viewpoint to history (as if outside of history or from “God’s viewpoint to it), to which all alternative or counterfactual histories can be granted as a class of equivalence sharing the same information (i.e. the number choices, but realized in different sequence or adding redundant ones in each branch) being similar and even mathematically isomorphic to Feynman trajectories in quantum mechanics. Particularly, a fundamental law of mathematical history, the law of least choice of the real historical pathway is deducible from the same approach. Its counterpart in physics is the well-known and confirmed law of least action as far as the quantity of action corresponds equivocally to the quantity of information or that of number elementary historical choices.",TRUE,FALSE,Gadamer|Hegel|Heidegger|historical dialectics|Husserl|information conservation|jistorical phenomelnoogy|Law of least choice|mathemathical history|natural historical cybernetics|transcendental history,2020-12-16T19:21:22.893582,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-16T16:56:14.207484,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce5|Arts and Humanities|History|Other History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d01|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|History of Philosophy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/citation/,92s3g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd9c90d0694b70450f36ff4/,5fd9c90d0694b70450f36ff4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92s3g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/92s3g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/92s3g,NA

Drawing on original, hand-coded data of three decades of labor market and family policy reforms in Southern Europe, the findings show divergent social investment trajectories. While Spain and Portugal have started to develop contours of a social investment agenda, little progress has been made in Italy and Greece. Programmatic political competition and government partisanship play a role in accounting for these divergent trajectories. Center-left parties have acted as the primary social investment protagonists in Spain, Portugal, and Italy. However, the Italian center-left remains fragmented and has rarely been in government. In stark contrast, both center-right and center-left parties in Greece have acted as social investment antagonists.

By articulating their priorities in this community-led plan, the community are empowered to advocate for the sustainable development of their town with decision-makers and funding bodies.

Qualitative semi-structured interviews permitted in-depth exploration of issues such as biographical narrative, close relationships, loss, feelings of loneliness, and retirement living. It was our intention to conduct a large-scale, deep listening exercise that would provide further clues about existential loneliness in older people and the circumstances that give rise to such feelings. Data provided rich insight into older people’s inner lives. Core themes identified loss of close attachments, lack of physical touch and intimacy, deterioration of health and body, and lack of an emotional language through which to express EL as central to older people’s experiences. Furthermore, there was a suggestion that the move to retirement living was for many people inextricably connected to their experience of EL. Our data further support and extend the notion that EL can be thought of as a gradual sense of separation from the world and that ageing intensifies a myriad of social, emotional, and physical circumstances that prompt its emergence. This sense of existential isolation need not be thought of as exclusive to those experiencing extreme frailty or who face death imminently – our data pointed to a clear and gradual emergence of EL throughout later life.",TRUE,FALSE,Attachment|Existential loneliness|Loss|Old age|Retirement community,2020-12-16T19:17:43.309323,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-16T16:55:29.737451,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,Dr Sam Carr and Dr Chao Fang,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/citation/,74u89,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd91878149e7503c5027a8c/,5fd91878149e7503c5027a8c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74u89/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/74u89/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/74u89,NA

However, existing solutions for power analyses to find appropriate sample sizes for such studies have various shortcomings and accordingly, explicit sample size planning is rare. Based on recent advances in statistical inference for factorial experiments, we derive simple yet generally applicable formulae to calculate power and minimum required sample sizes for testing average marginal component effects (AMCEs), conditional AMCEs, as well as interaction effects in forced-choice conjoint experiments. The only input needed are expected effect sizes. Our approach only assumes random sampling of individuals or randomization of profiles and avoids any parametric assumption. Furthermore, we show that clustering standard errors on individuals is not necessary and does not affect power. Our results caution against designing conjoint experiments with small sample sizes, especially for detecting heterogeneity and interactions. We provide an R package that implements our approach.",TRUE,FALSE,average marginal component effect|conjoint|conjoint experiment|interactions|power analysis|randomization inference|statistical inference,2020-12-16T19:41:22.243513,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-16T17:03:51.842548,FALSE,NA,no,Will be made public later.,,no,Analysis (which is not the main focus of the paper) was not preregistered.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/citation/,9yuhp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd9015ff0df5403be2ee43f/,5fd9015ff0df5403be2ee43f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9yuhp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9yuhp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9yuhp,NA
