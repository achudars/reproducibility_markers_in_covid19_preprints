Thus, the quantity of information defined by units of choices, whether bits or qubits, describes that process of ordering happening in the present moment. The totality (which can be considered also as a particular or “regional” totality) turns out to be divided into two parts: the internality of the past and the externality of the future by the course of time, but identifiable to each other in virtue of scientific transcendentalism (e.g. mathematical, physical, and historical transcendentalism). A properly mathematical approach to the “totality and time” is introduced by the abstract concept of “evolutionary tree” (i.e. regardless of the specific nature of that to which refers: such as biological evolution, Feynman trajectories, social and historical development, etc.), Then, the other half of the future can be represented as a deformed mirror image of the evolutionary tree taken place already in the past: therefore the past and future part are seen to be unifiable as a mirrorly doubled evolutionary tree and thus representable as generalized Feynman trajectories. The formalism of the separable complex Hilbert space (respectively, the qubit Hilbert space) applied and further elaborated in quantum mechanics in order to uniform temporal and reversible, discrete and continuous processes is relevant. Then, the past and future parts of evolutionary tree would constitute a wave function (or even only a single qubit once the concept of actual infinity be involved to real processes). Each of both parts of it, i.e. either the future evolutionary tree or its deformed mirror image, would represented a “half of the whole”. The two halves can be considered as the two disjunctive states of any bit as two fundamentally inseparable (in virtue of quantum correlation) “halves” of any qubit.

A Spatiotemporal Analysis of the Concentration of Police Presence and Crime,"Purpose Police patrol has undergone an evidence-based and data driven transition in the beginning of the 21st century. While crime patterns are well researched, patterns of police presence are not. Despite the abundance of available GPS data, little is known about the spatiotemporal patterns of police forces. Given the paucity of evidence on where everyday policing takes place, we ask: what spatiotemporal patterns of police exist, how do these patterns change over time, and how do these correspond to local crime patterns? 
Methods Therefore, we analysed more than 77 million GPS signals from 130 police patrol cars and more than 50,000 recorded crimes from 2019.to investigate where and when police patrols are present. All data were geocoded and map matched using high performance computing.
Results We found that police, much like crime, concentrates on a small proportion of street segments and that the spatial concentration experiences temporal instability at the micro level. Further, spatiotemporal police presence and its concentration appear to be unrelated to local levels of crime and crime concentration. 
Conclusions These findings inform police chiefs and researchers alike and enable alterations of patrol deployment in order to refine the spatiotemporal focus of police on local crime.

The review also investigates concepts of police presence and differences between reported effects. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and protocols are used to systematically identify and review eligible studies on police presence. Further, quality assessment and findings synthesis are used to map limitations of current research as well as grounds for future avenues. The systematic search strategies yielded 49 studies focusing on testing the effects of police presence or evaluating its measurement. We find evidence that police presence has mostly positive effects on reducing crimes related to motor theft, property, violence, and guns. Police presence also reduces calls for service and improves traffic behaviour. Police presence focused on specific areas, times, and types of crime achieves maximum efficacy. The reviewed studies show a high degree of heterogeneity in reporting, which limits comparability of findings across studies.

Previous studies have revealed a rapid increase in the SRB over the past 15 years and the presence of important variations across regions. More recent studies suggested that the nation’s SRB may have plateaued during the 2010s. Given the lack of exhaustive birth registration data in Vietnam, it is necessary to estimate and project levels and trends in the regional SRBs in Vietnam based on a reproducible statistical approach. We compiled an extensive database on regional Vietnam SRBs based on all publicly available surveys and censuses and used a Bayesian hierarchical time series mixture model to estimate and project SRB in Vietnam by region from 1980 to 2050. The Bayesian model incorporates the uncertainties from the observations and year-by-year natural fluctuation. It includes a binary parameter to detect the existence of sex ratio transitions among Vietnamese regions. Furthermore, we model the SRB imbalance using a trapezoid function to capture the increase, stagnation, and decrease of the sex ratio transition by Vietnamese regions. The model results show that four out of six Vietnamese regions, namely, Northern Midlands and Mountain Areas, Northern Central and Central Coastal Areas, Red River Delta, and South East, have existing sex imbalances at birth. The rise in SRB in the Red River Delta was the fastest, as it took only 12 years and was more pronounced, with the SRB reaching the local maximum of 1.146 with a 95% credible interval (1.129, 1.163) in 2013. The model projections suggest that the current decade will record a sustained decline in sex imbalances at birth, and the SRB should be back to the national SRB baseline level of 1.06 in all regions by the mid-2030s.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian hierarchical model|probabilistic projection|sex ratio at birth|sex-selective abortion|subnational modeling|time series models|Vietnam,2021-03-03T14:16:02.797408,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-03T14:15:32.706917,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/citation/,9xrbk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603f8d17035cf7039fc80d7c/,603f8d17035cf7039fc80d7c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9xrbk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9xrbk

The largest number of international students are from mainland China and some programmes have a large majority of Chinese students. This has raised important questions around the internationalisation of the curriculum in these contexts. While many studies have addressed the needs and challenges of international students there is relatively less work on the potential contributions of these students with respect to the curriculum. This paper conducts a bibliographic analysis of the academic references (n=7,264) used by students to construct their final essays on the theme of education and international development at a ‘leading global university’ based in the UK. It examines (1) what knowledge resources (i.e. references) are used by international students in their essays and (2) what are the characteristics and patterns present in these choices. The study finds that, when allowed to construct their own essays, Chinese students choose to use ‘Chinese’ knowledge resources within English and Anglophone academic essays.

The filling of this reopening was done with the accumulation of a great set of stones, on top of which this elongated and serrated metal element of atypical typology was identified.
This piece, due to the absence of direct parallels in the national territory, allows to discuss not only typological and terminological questions, in face of its formal distance from the Palmela Points/arrowheads or the tanged daggers. At the same time allows to think about its biography (presence of a serrated edge and distortion), contextual and chronological insertion, being noted a recurrence of certain types of late depositions in Perdigões, as is the case of this re-cutting in Ditch 7, dated from the third quarter of the 3rd millennium BC.",TRUE,FALSE,3rd/2nd Millennium BC|Archaeology|Bell Beaker|Bronze Age|Chalcolithic|Ditched Enclosure|Metallurgy|Palmela Points|Perdigões|Southern Portugal,2021-03-03T14:13:06.110350,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-03T14:12:33.664159,FALSE,NA,no,Directly contacting the author,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/citation/,c8dwg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603e82e6441575032d57ef7e/,603e82e6441575032d57ef7e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8dwg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c8dwg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c8dwg
