Drawn from the city register of Duisburg, a metropolis of 500,000 inhabitants, voters eligible for the September 2021 Bundestag elections are the target population. They are stratified into four groups by onomastic classification: native Germans, Germans of Turkish Descent, Germans with a (Post-) Soviet background and Germans of any other immigrant origin. This note presents ten measures of optimising the recruitment of individuals from these four groups under the constraints of an all-encompassing high-incidence pandemic with distance measures and curfews in place, with closed shops and schools and reduced other care facilities. In addition, the report puts forward statistical analyses of some measures applied in an experimental design and estimates the overall and per-person-recruited costs. 
Overall, the pandemic forced us to make drastic changes to research design and field organisation and to invest much more time and money than planned. Especially overburdened postal deliveries and restrictive policies for public places made the endeavour most difficult. So far, the ongoing fieldwork has produced a response rate of 8.2 % (only individuals willing to participate in telephone interview) with 11.0 % as a likely expected outcome. One individual recruited to take part in the telephone panel survey costs an estimated 53-71 €.
Early-bird incentives produced a positive response (meaning the willingness to partake in the survey) of 5.5 % compared to 4.0 % among those without early-bird incentives. The most effective measure to boost overall positive response among initial non-responders was in-person canvassing with unconditional incentive (21.3 %) instead of postal reminders (9.9 %). Canvassing a smaller group of people in person proved to be as costly as reminding a larger group of people in writing: we estimated costs of 60-61 € per additionally recruited survey participants through either channel.",TRUE,FALSE,canvassing|corona|covid-19|election|immigration|incentive|reminder|response|response rate|survey|voting,2021-05-25T10:26:23.765912,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:25:59.354837,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/citation/,dpz9q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60abaf998a5d3d020f0cc717/,60abaf998a5d3d020f0cc717,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dpz9q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dpz9q,NA

However, contrary to this general finding, illicit drug offence detections increased significantly. In this study, we explore the geographical distribution of the increase in Queensland, Australia, using spatiotemporal generalised additive model (GAM) to identify locations in the Local Government Area (LGA) of Brisbane where drug offence detection rates were unusually high during the three months of the COVID-19 lockdown (April-June 2020). Contrary to expectation, we find that the increase in drug offence detection rates appears to have been modest in most places, but widespread and diffuse throughout the city. We conclude that drug offence detections are most likely to have increased incidentally, probably as a consequence of general street policing initiatives which saw an increase in the visibility and vulnerability of drug user communities. We do, however, identify five locations in Brisbane where the drug offence detection rate exceeded the prediction by a considerable margin (in one case, more than double the worst case prediction). We argue that in these locations the increase was likely the result of some spatial displacement of inner-city drug markets coupled with a series of targeted policing activities. Further research is needed to clarify the true mechanism of change in these locations.",TRUE,FALSE,Australia|Brisbane|COVID-19|Crime|Drug Markets|Drug Offences|Queensland,2021-05-25T10:23:25.403978,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:23:11.098491,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,Not required for this study,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/citation/,2bxyw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ab465e0b6c6901f09c2146/,60ab465e0b6c6901f09c2146,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bxyw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2bxyw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2bxyw,NA

We find that priming the COVID-19 pandemic increases altruism and reciprocity towards compatriots, citizens of other EU countries, and non-EU citizens. Priming common European values also boosts altruism and reciprocity but only towards compatriots and fellow Europeans. Priming common economic interests has no tangible impact on behaviour.

This paper focuses on the relationship between neighborhood walkability and the changing walking behavior of 514 individuals during these lockdowns. The spatial context of this relationship highlights three main urban design aspects of the novel and innovative urban neighborhood planning: walkable access, spatial proximity, and social cohesion. This study demonstrates how restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 Pandemic affect the walking behaviors of the individuals, within 15-20 minute walkable and non-walkable neighborhoods located in different socio-economic geographies from American, European, Asian, Western Pacific, African, and Eastern Mediterranean cities. The discussion section of the methodology is supported by a survey questionnaire conducted in 24 disparate neighborhoods. Our data obtained from survey questionnaires is indicating that lockdown restrictions during the Pandemic influenced the walking purpose.

Proposed solutions range from encouraging more selective sharing by individuals, to platform removal of false content and accounts that create or promote it. How, whether, and which strategies to implement depends on their relative and combined ability to reduce viral misinformation spread at practical levels of enforcement. Here we provide a framework to evaluate interventions aimed at reducing viral misinformation online both in isolation and when used in combination. We begin by deriving a generative model of viral misinformation spread, inspired by research on infectious disease. Applying this model to a large corpus of misinformation events that occurred during the 2020 US election, we reveal that commonly proposed interventions--including removal of content, virality circuit breakers, nudges, and account banning---are unlikely to be effective in isolation without extreme censorship. However, our framework demonstrates that a combined approach can achieve a substantial, ~50%, reduction in the prevalence of misinformation.

This study uses mobile device data from SafeGraph to explore the temporal patterns of visits to health care points of interest (POIs) during 2020 and examines how these patterns are associated with socio-demographic and spatial characteristics at the block group level in North Carolina. Specifically, using the k-medoid time-series clustering method, we identify three distinct types of temporal patterns of visits to health care POI. Furthermore, by estimating the multinomial logit models, we find that socio-demographic and spatial characteristics are strongly correlated with both the intensity and trend of medical visits during the pandemic.

In this study, we use a survey instrument to examine how pro-environmental attitudes and two types of altruism relate to the tendency to follow social distancing guidelines and limit voluntary social exposure during the pandemic. We find that pro-environmental behaviors predict a feeling of moral obligation to reduce COVID-19 risk and a lower level of voluntary social exposure. Voluntary, individual-level altruism has no relationship with social exposure. These findings point to important insights about the nuances in altruistic behavior. These insights may lead to essential guidance for public health and environmental messaging that respects and leverages the differences in voluntary, individual-level altruism and collective altruism.",TRUE,FALSE,altruism|COVID-19|pro-environmental attitudes|risk behavior,2021-05-23T18:33:42.689136,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-23T18:33:14.877136,FALSE,NA,no,Email tshrum@uvm.edu for access to the data.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dad|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Applied Behavior Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/citation/,fm29j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a7f59ba480c600c00d200b/,60a7f59ba480c600c00d200b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm29j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fm29j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fm29j,NA

Palm oil was initially considered a potential nutrition and environment solution that would replace fossil fuel and trans-fats in the nutrition chain. That promise of replacing fossil fuels and trans-fats is far from met; palm tree monoculture has led to devastation of rainforests in Indonesia and Malaysia, which together account for 85 of global palm oil production. Symmetrical rows of palm trees have replaced once-dense irreplaceable habitats of trees and plants. The initial deforestation was induced by European innovation and consumption. India and China have now outstripped European buyers as the main buyers of palm oil.

The global cropscape of the palm is reviewed in this paper in the Indian context. Policy appears to encourage palm oil imports in the face of India’s dire agricultural landscape, with negative returns for farmers, a growing nutritionally bereft food chain and exponential deforestation of tropical forests in Indonesia and Malaysia. The paper explores the inherently economically and the socially destructive substitution of ethnically produced and consumed seed oils such as mustard, sesame and coconut. Small farm holdings comprise nearly 85 per cent of India’s total cultivated area. This paper studies the global supply chain of the palm seed oil that potentially has multi-pronged externalities of destruction of farm income in the importing nation, disruption of nutrition needs and augmenting global emissions through deforestation .",TRUE,FALSE,deforestation|food supply chain|India|nutrition|Palm olein,2021-05-23T18:32:16.040349,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-23T18:31:41.862307,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.india.gov.in/website-national-mission-oilseeds-and-oil-palm-nmoop|https://www.agricoop.nic.in/sites/default/files/Final%20Compendium%204-10-2018.pdf,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/citation/,k5gsn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a7be1e8a5d3d00960ca200/,60a7be1e8a5d3d00960ca200,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5gsn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k5gsn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k5gsn,NA
