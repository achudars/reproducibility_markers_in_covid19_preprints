In this paper we use agent-based modeling to explore this concern, focusing on the interactive role of ethnic and socio-economic homophily preferences and housing constraints as determinants of residential choice. Specifically, we extend the notorious Schelling’s model to a random utility discrete choice approach to simulate the relocation decision of people (micro level) and how they translate into spatial segregation outcomes (macro level). We model different weights for preferences of ethnic and socioeconomic similarity in neighborhood composition over random relocations, in addition to housing constraints. We formalize how different combinations of these variables could replicate real segregation scenarios in Bradford, a substantially segregated local authority in the UK. We initialize our model with geo-referenced data from the 2011 Census and use Dissimilarity and the Average Local Simpson Indices as measures of segregation. As in the original Schelling model, the simulation shows that even mild preferences to reside close to co-ethnics can lead to high segregation levels. Nevertheless, ethnic over-segregation decreases, and results come close to real data, when preferences for socioeconomic similarity are slightly above preferences for ethnic similarity, and even more so when housing constraints are considered in relocation moves of agents.

These measures require substantial changes in established practices of social interaction, raising the question of which factors motivate individuals to comply with these preventive behaviours. Using Austrian panel survey data from April to October 2020 we show that perceived health risks, social norms, and trust in political institutions stimulate people to engage in preventive behaviour. Moderation analyses show that the effectiveness of social norms and trust in institutions in facilitating preventive behaviour increases when people's perceptions of health risks decrease. This result suggests that trust in institutions and strong social norms play a crucial role in achieving high rates of preventive behaviour when perceived levels of health risks are low.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|Institution|Preventive Behaviour|SARS-CoV-2|Social Norms|Trust,2021-01-04T17:41:45.078494,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-04T17:40:43.945663,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,Bernhard Kittel|Fabian Kalleitner|David Wolfgang Schiestl,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/citation/,q9b23,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/375nh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/relationships/node/,375nh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff2f577e9ccb904abaee697/,5ff2f577e9ccb904abaee697,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q9b23/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q9b23,NA

Do political and economic factors help us signal the (un) favourable paths taken by countries with different degrees of welfare state development in the XXI century? This paper addresses limitations of previous comparative research to continue (re) searching the conditions of welfare state development. A composite multidimensional welfare state development index (WeSDI) is constructed for 18 countries between 2000–2015. The four dimensions are the magnitude of social expenditure, the scope of coverage of welfare programmes, quality of the coverage of welfare programmes and outcomes of welfare institutions. The WeSDI uses goalposts (i.e. natural zeros and aspirational targets) to normalise individual indices and avoid the “relativity problems” of results. We use crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to test how necessary and/or sufficient eight political and economic conditions are (alone or in combination) to foster multidimensional welfare state development in the region. The causal conditions are openness to external shocks, debt obligations, revenue-collection capabilities, labour movement strength, strength of the left, policy legacies of welfare institutions, size of the outsider population and quality of democracy. The paper confirms the relevance of democratic strength, revenue-collection capabilities (and to a lesser degree policy legacy of welfare institutions) as sufficient conditions of high and medium levels of welfare state development in the (post) neoliberal era. In addition to labour movement strength, these same economic and political factors are relevant to understand the conditions behind very low levels of welfare state development.",TRUE,FALSE,comparative social policy|development|latin america|social assistance|social insurance|social policy|social protection|welfare state,2021-01-04T17:41:00.666870,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-04T17:39:35.083384,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/citation/,5pjgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5t732/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/relationships/node/,5t732,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff2f324e3acd104c14a529c/,5ff2f324e3acd104c14a529c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pjgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5pjgs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5pjgs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-020-02575-6

countries. Millions of refugees made their way to Europe between 2014 and 2015, with more
than 160 000 arriving in Sweden alone. Little is known about the impact of this influx on
voting behavior, criminality rates, labor markets, and local price levels. By using data on the
Swedish municipalities, the analysis estimates the short-run consequences of the refugee
inflow. The results are found through a dynamic difference-in-difference estimator, which
compare municipalities in Sweden who received relatively many refugees (treated) compared
to those hosting relatively few refugees (control). The quasi-randomized allocation process of
refugees in combination with a very high variation among the different municipalities
refugee-intake creates stable conditions for reliable estimations through the difference-indifference
approach. Regarding the labor market, the findings suggest that the treated groups
hosting many refugees face higher unemployment rates and simultaneously lower wage
levels. Additionally, the result indicates that the municipalities hosting more refugees face
higher crimes committed per capita, particularly regarding assault- and fraud-related crimes.
Furthermore, the results stress that the treated group meet higher vote shares in the
subsequent national election in favor of the right-wing parties and decreasing support for the
center-right, center-left, and left-wing parties. Surprisingly, the vote share of the antiimmigration
party SD does not correlate with refugee-influx.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-04T17:39:20.951881,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-04T17:38:17.020685,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://scb.se/hitta-statistik/|http://statistik.bra.se/solwebb/action/index|https://pro.se/sa-tycker-vi/halsa-friskvard-och-konsumentpolitik/pros-prisundersokning/prisundersokningen-2019.html,no,No preregistration is done.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/citation/,7yrxq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vcfq7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/relationships/node/,vcfq7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff2d12d1e6d97047a301764/,5ff2d12d1e6d97047a301764,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7yrxq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7yrxq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7yrxq,NA
