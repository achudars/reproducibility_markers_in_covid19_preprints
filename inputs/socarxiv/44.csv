These projects’ benefits sometimes partially accrue to interest groups and not entirely to voters. Since these projects are costly to implement, this provides an incentive for interest groups to intervene in the policy-making process by offering legislative subsidies to politicians. In addition, voters are frequently ill-equipped to scrutinise politicians’ actions and can often only imperfectly monitor them. This paper shows how these considerations interact in a stylised two-periods political agency model with moral hazard and adverse selection. I show how and when voters benefit from the existence of self-interested interest groups and of their involvement in the policy-making process.  I also consider how voters monitor politicians in the presence of interest groups that might capture projects’ benefits.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|imperfect monitoring|information|interest groups|legislative subsidies|politicians|rational inattention,2021-04-05T15:11:03.018213,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-05T15:10:42.443091,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/citation/,ydfbs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6069ffc451f7ae0111f56319/,6069ffc451f7ae0111f56319,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydfbs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydfbs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydfbs

Most recently, the US was swept by a wave of protests, urban riots, and violent confrontations between left- and right-wing extremists. Understanding how future crises will unfold and assessing the resilience of different countries to various shocks is of foremost importance in averting the human costs of state breakdown and civil war. In a recent publication (Turchin et al. 2018) we proposed a novel transdisciplinary approach to modeling social breakdown, recovery, and resilience. This approach builds on recent breakthroughs in macrosocial dynamics (and specifically structural-demographic theory), statistical analysis of large-scale historical data, and dynamic modelling. Our main goal is to construct a series of probabilistic scenarios of social breakdown and recovery. We called this approach—similar to ensemble forecasting in weather prediction—multipath forecasting (MPF). In this article I develop a “prototype” of the MPF engine with the goal of illustrating the utility a fully developed version may have. I first apply the computational model to the period of American history from the beginning of the nineteenth to the end of the twentieth century, with the goal of parameterizing the model and testing it against data. Then I use the parameterized model to forecast the dynamics of instability in the USA beyond 2020 and illustrate how the MPF engine can be used to explore the effects of different policy interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,forecasting|model|political instability|USA,2021-04-05T15:09:24.247235,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-05T15:09:12.513476,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/citation/,f37jy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6069f16551f7ae0111f53b53/,6069f16551f7ae0111f53b53,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f37jy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f37jy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f37jy

Also important are their dynamically changing personal perception of the situation and beliefs about actions and expectations of others as well as psychological phenomena such as cognitive dissonance,  and social projection.  To better understand these processes, I develop a modeling framework describing the joint dynamics of actions and attitudes of individuals and their beliefs about actions and attitudes of their group-mates.  I consider which norms get internalized and which factors control beliefs about others.  I predict that the long-term average characteristics of groups are largely determined  by  a  balance  between  material  payoffs  and  the  values  promoted  by  the  external authority.  Variation around these averages largely reflects variation in individual costs and benefits mediated by individual psychological characteristics.  The efforts of an external authority to change the group behavior in a certain direction can, counter-intuitively, have an opposite effect on individual behavior.  I consider how various factors can affect differences between groups and societies in tightness/looseness of their social norms.  I show that the most important factors are social heterogeneity, societal threat, effects of the authority, cultural variation in the degree of  collectivism/individualism,  the  population  size,  and  the  subsistence  style.

At present, there is no consensus among political scientists and economists on that issue, as it has been extraordinarily politicized and distorted during ideological struggles among various currents of socialism. From the very beginning, fascism was depicted by Marxists as belonging to the Right, while Fascists themselves wanted to build a society that transcends the Left-Right paradigm. However, few voices in academia have noted that practical implementation of the fascists’ ideas, inherited from the works of revolutionary and national syndicalists, exhibited predominantly leftist characteristics.
The ambiguity of placing fascism in its proper place on the political spectrum can be confidently resolved by applying three primary factors that govern political spectrum polarization: attitude to private property, scope of individual freedom, and degree of wealth redistribution. The article argues that fascism is a particular current of non-Marxian socialism that utilized collectivization of consciousness and wealth redistribution as the main paths toward socialism rather than outright expropriation of private property or means of production. Simultaneously, it is acknowledged that private property rights were inhibited by the fascist state, even though de jure they were permitted.
The fascist ideal of the “alternate way” had a logical inconsistency that produced an unstable equilibrium between labor and capital as well as between the man and the state.

about the length of life and heterogeneity in population health. We propose a novel and
timely lifespan variation measure, which we call the Cross-sectional Average Inequality in Lifespan. This new index provides an alternative perspective on the analysis of lifespan inequality by combining the mortality histories of all cohorts present in a cross-sectional approach. We demonstrate how differences in the Cross-sectional Average Inequality in Lifespan measure can be decomposed between populations by age and cohort to explore the compression or expansion of mortality in a cohort perspective. We apply these new methods using data from ten low-mortality countries from 1879 to 2013. The Cross-sectional Average Inequality in Lifespan measure reveals greater uncertainty in the timing of death than the period life table-based indices of variation indicate. Also, country rankings of lifespan inequality vary considerably between period and cross-sectional measures. These differences open intriguing questions as to which temporal dimension is the most relevant to individuals when considering the uncertainty in the timing of death in planning their life courses.",TRUE,FALSE,cohort|cross-sectional measures|decomposition|formal demography|lifespan variation|mortality,2021-04-05T15:00:36.526038,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-05T14:59:48.771422,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.mortality.org/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/citation/,vtz3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6066e3c851f7ae0066f55337/,6066e3c851f7ae0066f55337,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtz3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vtz3u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vtz3u

Bring people’s perceptions of systemic racism into procedural justice theory. Test an expanded model of police legitimacy that includes people’s perceptions of the under-policing and over-policing of Black communities. 
Methods. A cross-sectional survey based on a quota sample of 1,500 US residents designed to resemble the general population on the bases of race, gender, and age. Key measures are procedural justice, distributive justice, bounded authority, police legitimacy, perceptions of under-policing of Black communities, perceptions of over-policing of Black communities, and perceptions of systemic racism in the police. Structural equation modelling examines conditional correlations between latent constructs.
Results. People’s perceptions of systemic under-policing and over-policing of Black communities are strongly associated with perceived police racism. Perceptions of under-policing and over-policing predict perceptions of the fairness and legitimacy of the police. These findings holds for both white and Black respondents.
Conclusions. We provide ‘proof of concept’ in this particular approach to centering race in procedural justice theory. Findings also point to a pressing need to address the paradoxical law enforcement practices that have kept American police forces in service to structural racism and left Black communities both unprotected and over-regulated.",TRUE,FALSE,distributive justice|legitimacy|police|procedural justice|systemic racism,2021-04-01T20:29:02.264961,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-01T20:28:15.052942,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/citation/,kgwhc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60661c57f6585f0020611ada/,60661c57f6585f0020611ada,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgwhc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kgwhc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kgwhc

This study connects contemporary trends in Native family separation to histories of Indian child removal, and provides insights into the geographies and institutional sites where inequalities emerge. We find that the total number of AIAN children in foster care or adoptive homes in states with large Native populations has increased since the passage of the Indian Child Welfare Act (1978). We find that risks of child welfare system contact are highest for AIAN infants, and that risk is highly variable across states. Our estimates show that in high risk states at 2014 - 2018 levels of risk, more than half of AIAN children will ever be investigated by a child welfare agency, more than one in five will experience a substantiated maltreatment case, and more than one in five will ever enter foster care. We further find that child welfare agency case processing exacerbates inequality. AIAN children are more likely than white children to enter foster care, conditional on experiencing a substantiated maltreatment case, than are white children. These exceptionally high levels of risk indicate that the crisis of Indian family separation is ongoing. For AIAN children in states like Minnesota, Alaska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, contact with the child welfare system is a routine part of growing up.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-01T20:29:22.615745,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-01T20:29:07.470788,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon request from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/citation/,fcz5p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60661ba6f2ad330016a762a3/,60661ba6f2ad330016a762a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcz5p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fcz5p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fcz5p
