Strategies to streamline data management across disciplines are of key importance. This paper presents the results of an institutional survey (N=258) at Graz University of Technology, supplemented with interview data (N=18), to give an overview of the state-of-play of RDM practices across faculties and disciplinary contexts. RDM services are on the rise but remain somewhat behind leading countries like the Netherlands and UK, showing only the beginnings of a culture attuned to RDM. There is considerable variation between faculties and institutes with respect to data amounts, complexity of data sets, data collection and analysis, and data archiving. Data sharing practices within fields tend to be inconsistent. RDM is predominantly regarded as an administrative task, to the detriment of considerations of good research practice. Problems with RDM fall in two categories: Generic problems transcend specific research interests, infrastructures, and departments while discipline-specific problems need a more targeted approach. The paper extends the state-of-the-art on RDM practices by combining in-depth qualitative material with quantified, detailed data about RDM practices and needs.

This study examines the travel behaviour impact of major investments in active travel infrastructure in three Outer London boroughs (the ‘mini-Hollands programme’).
Methods: The People and Places survey, conducted annually in May-June, treats the mini-Holland interventions as a ‘natural experiment’. Participants in other Outer London boroughs form a control group. The survey had over 3,000 respondents at baseline (May-June 2016). Three follow-up waves each had over 1400 repeat respondents. A difference-in-differences analysis was used to compare changes in active travel uptake in intervention and control groups. Further analysis examines likelihood of meeting targets for past-week active travel and all physical activity. Finally, the article conducts a health economic benefit assessment based on uptake of active travel at Wave 3.
Results: At all waves, living close to mini-Holland interventions (‘high-dose’ areas) was consistently associated with increased duration of past-week active travel, compared with the control group (44.0 extra minutes in Wave 2, 41.0 in Wave 1, and 41.5 in Wave 3). Changes in active travel behaviour were stronger in the high-dose area than in the low-dose area. Most of the increase was in walking. People living in high-dose areas were 13% more likely at Wave 3 to achieve 140 minutes active travel than people in control areas. People living in high- or low-dose areas in mini-Holland boroughs were more likely to be physically active for 5 days in the past week. The 20- year health economic benefit in high-dose areas from three years’ of interventions (costing £80 million) is £724 million.
Conclusion: Ambitious interventions can yield substantial health economic benefits from changes in active travel. This includes early uptake of walking as well as cycling. Most of the increase was in walking but the ratio varied by year.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-01T09:47:00.784134,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-01T09:46:29.890959,FALSE,NA,no,Data is not public but an anonymised dataset may be available to other researchers on request.,,no,Analysis plan outlined for the funder before the project started but not publicly registered.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/citation/,5ny4c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4cd31d0f9a0800a9ade22b/,5f4cd31d0f9a0800a9ade22b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ny4c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ny4c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ny4c,NA

However, the scientific landscape on the integration of GIS in the COVID related studies is largely unknown. In this systematic review, we assessed the current evidence on the implementation of GIS and other geospatial tools and technologies in COVID-19 pandemic. We systematically retrieved and reviewed 79 research articles that either directly used GIS or other Geospatial tools as part of their analysis. We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental, socio-economic, and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer-aided modeling, and data mining. The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was noticeable among the reviewed papers. Although GIS has substantial potential in planning to slow down the spread, surveillance, contact tracing, and identify the trends and hotspots of breakdowns, it was not employed as much as it could have been. This review not only provided an overarching view on how GIS has been used in COVID-19 research so far but also concluded that this geospatial analysis and technologies could be used in future public health emergencies along with statistical and other socio-economic modeling techniques.

When compared to paper based voting, online voting can vastly increase the speed that votes can be counted, expand the overall accessibility of the election system and decrease the cost of turnout. Yet despite these advantages, online voting for political office is subject to fraud at various levels due to its centralised nature. In this paper, we describe a general architecture of a centralised online voting system and detail which areas of such a system are vulnerable to electoral fraud.  We then proceed to introduce the key ideas underlying blockchain technology as a decentralised mechanism that can address these problems.   We discuss the advantages and weaknesses of the blockchain technology, the protocols the technology uses and what criteria a good blockchain protocol should satisfy (depending on the voting application).  We argue that the decentralisation inherent in the blockchain technology could increase the public's trust in national elections,  as well as eliminate voter impersonation and double voting. We conclude with a discussion regarding how economists and social scientists can collaborate with the blockchain community  in a research agenda on the design of efficient blockchain protocols and new voting systems such as liquid democracy.",TRUE,FALSE,Blockchain|Electoral Fraud|E-voting|Incentive Constraint|Liquid Democracy|Voting,2020-08-31T14:29:22.546253,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-31T14:28:49.364696,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,Amrita Dhillon|rammateia Kotsialou|Peter McBurney and Luke Riley,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/citation/,34df5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4b836fe23f3e00588ea16f/,5f4b836fe23f3e00588ea16f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34df5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/34df5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/34df5,NA

All classical science obeys the postulate about the fundamental difference of model and reality, and thus distinguishing epistemology from ontology fundamentally. The theorems about the absence of hidden variables in quantum mechanics imply for it to be “complete” (versus Einstein’s opinion). That consistent completeness (unlike arithmetic to set theory in the foundations of mathematics in Gödel’s opinion) can be interpreted furthermore as the coincidence of model and reality. The paper discusses the option and fact of that coincidence it its base: the fundamental postulate formulated by Niels Bohr about what quantum mechanics studies (unlike all classical science). Quantum mechanics involves and develops further both identification and disjunctive distinction of the global space of the apparatus and the local space of the investigated quantum entity as complementary to each other. This results into the analogical complementarity of model and reality in quantum mechanics. The apparatus turns out to be both absolutely “transparent” and identically coinciding simultaneously with the reflected quantum reality. Thus, the coincidence of model and reality is postulated as necessary condition for cognition in quantum mechanics by Bohr’s postulate and further, embodied in its formalism of the separable complex Hilbert space, in turn, implying the theorems of the absence of hidden variables (or the equivalent to them “conservation of energy conservation” in quantum mechanics). What the apparatus and measured entity exchange cannot be energy (for the different exponents of energy), but quantum information (as a certain, unambiguously determined wave function) therefore a generalized law of conservation, from which the conservation of energy conservation is a corollary. Particularly, the local and global space (rigorously justified in the Standard model) share the complementarity isomorphic to that of model and reality in the foundation of quantum mechanics. On that background, one can think of the troubles of “quantum gravity” as fundamental, direct corollaries from the postulates of quantum mechanics. Gravity can be defined only as a relation or by a pair of non-orthogonal separable complex Hilbert space attachable whether to two “parts” or to a whole and its parts. On the contrary, all the three fundamental interactions in the Standard model are “flat” and only “properties”: they need only a single separable complex Hilbert space to be defined.",TRUE,FALSE,|confinement|entanglement|general relativity|model and reality|quantum gravity|quantum information,2020-08-31T14:29:09.833650,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-31T14:28:03.176188,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/citation/,m8p5b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4b7a6fe23f3e00598eadf3/,5f4b7a6fe23f3e00598eadf3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8p5b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m8p5b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m8p5b,NA

Yet, social disadvantage might also result from the transmission of adverse experiences from children to their parents. This paper explores one such adverse experience by examining the influence of a son’s incarceration on his mother’s health. Using panel data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and its young adult follow up (n=2,651 mothers; 18,390 observations), the paper shows that mothers are more likely to suffer health limitations after a son is incarcerated. A time-distributed fixed effects analysis indicates that the effect on maternal health may persist or even grow over time. Rather than a short-term shock whose effect soon diminishes, a son’s incarceration is a long-term strain on mothers’ health.

Using pooled 2009-2018 CPS MORG data of 630,799 respondents covering almost a decade, we find that union membership is especially beneficial for people with disabilities compared to the larger population, as well as other status groups. Furthermore, people with the severest disabilities benefit the most from being in unionized work, increasing weekly earnings by 36% for people with self-care and independent living-related disabilities. Because union membership increases disabled workers’ weekly earnings by more than double the increase experienced by people without disabilities, it brings unionized disabled workers closer to overall average earnings with important implications for inequality. Unionized work reduces earnings inequality between disabled and non-disabled workers, but earnings boosts associated with union membership generate more pronounced inequality within groups of workers with disabilities depending on whether individuals have access to unionized employment. We find that gaps among employed unionized and non-unionized disabled workers are significantly larger than those experienced by unionized and non-unionized female, Black, and Hispanic workers.",TRUE,FALSE,disability|earnings|inequality|stratification|unions,2020-08-29T19:54:49.963204,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-29T19:54:28.193603,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://cps.ipums.org/cps/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",.,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/citation/,kg2pm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4a7a450f9a08004bad94b0/,5f4a7a450f9a08004bad94b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg2pm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kg2pm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kg2pm,NA

Why do terrorists target MNCs and which factors are sufficiently predictive to matter to decision makers? We identify potential theoretical explanations from the literature on MNCs and transnational terrorism. Then, using conflict forecasting methods, we show the best predictors are whether a country experienced attacks before, and whether such attacks are common in the region. In addition, exogenous factors such as income improve performance, but many of the typical explanations for transnational terrorism, such as those involving regime type, do not help to identify MNC targets. Furthermore, despite using multiple behavioral and economic measures of MNC activity, it does not appear that their actions have much of an impact on whether MNCs are targeted.

Although these databases have distinct coding rules, all attempt to capture incidents of social conflict. We argue, however, that due to a variety of sources of measurement error, subjective coding decisions, and operational specifications, no single indicator of protest adequately measures how much protest exists in a given place at a given time. As a result, empirical studies that employ these measures yield inferences with limited generalizability. To increase the generalizability of the empirical findings, we suggest using an Item Response Theory (IRT) approach to estimate a latent dimension of protest using nine different protest measures that vary in their operational specifications as well as their temporal and spatial coverage. The estimates of the IRT models are used in two ways. First, to demonstrate how existing measures differ, the IRT’s item estimates are used to compare the nine measures of protest based on their degree of difficulty (the quantity of latent protest required to observe a ‘1’ in the data) and their ability to discriminate (the speed with which changes in the latent quantity of protest affect the probability of observing a ‘1’ in the data). Second, the estimated quantity of protest is applied to both monthly and yearly models of authoritarian breakdown. The results demonstrate that the latent protest variable increases the out-of-sample classification of authoritarian breakdown events; and improves in-sample prediction relative to existing global protest variables. Our study illustrates the potential value of modeling a latent dimension of protest rather than solely relying on observed indicators.",TRUE,FALSE,authoritarian breakdown|item response theory|political protest,2020-08-29T19:53:00.738008,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-29T19:52:39.116288,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/citation/,2wqfb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4a53a73461bf0039bea8bf/,5f4a53a73461bf0039bea8bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wqfb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2wqfb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2wqfb,NA
