An important part of topology is counting the numbers of pieces and holes in objects, and people use this information to group objects into different types. For example, a doughnut has the same number of holes and the same number of pieces as a teacup with one handle, but it is different from a ball. In studies that resemble activities like “connect the dots”, scientists use ideas from topology to study the shape of data. Data can take many possible forms: a picture made of dots, a large collection of numbers from a scientific experiment, or something else. The approach in these studies is called 'topological data analysis', and it has been used to study the branching structures of veins in leaves, how people vote in elections, flight patterns in models of bird flocking, and more. Scientists can take data on the way veins branch on leaves and use topological data analysis to divide the leaves into different groups and discover patterns that may otherwise be hard to find.",TRUE,FALSE,computational topology|data analysis|education|mathematics|topological data analysis|topology,2020-04-14T05:03:40.928826,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T02:22:32.016464,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/citation/,7qd4t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gsb58/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/relationships/node/,gsb58,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e94cec7f1353503c0d5479a/,5e94cec7f1353503c0d5479a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qd4t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7qd4t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7qd4t,NA

A broad look at this “sacralization” of dogs in the United States reveals that this changing valuation has altered dogs’ place within economic processes. In particular, these changes parallel Viviana Zelizer’s work on the changing valuation of children a century ago.

Although there have been efforts to rectify this through the creation of scholarships, there have been no systematic studies of the full cost of archaeological field schools. Here, we present a study of 208 field schools from 2019, including their tuition, room and board, and airfare, as well as the wages that students may lose by participating in them rather than working. We also explore how archaeologists interviewed for Heath-Stout’s dissertation study of diversity issues in the discipline have navigated finding field experiences. We argue that scholarships are an ineffective and insufficient means of promoting equity and accessibility in the field because the root of the problem lies in institutionalized inequality and exclusivity. We provide strategies that students and faculty can use to address these problems on both individual and systemic levels.

The ethical dimension of the use of neuro interfaces is hardly questioned, neither in research nor in its artistic applications, which is surprising but a necessity for the self-determined user who is more than an object of produsage. In the centre of this inquiry stand very actual critical art works with life science devices and its corresponding participative games, in an emerging critical art form of neuro-games, in a new form of expanded game art. Brain interfaces for the consumer market target life improvement but in fact they capitalise our inner states in a mode of prosumption. 
Expanded game art settings in public installations can fruitfully contribute to the sciences with the advantage of a controllable set of rules, which is useful for the research validity. These art pieces correspond to citizen science games, where scientists use games to analyse data in a collective mode.

However, the spread of the virus has been uneven in both prevalence and speed of its propagation. Given the role of social factors in the spread of contagious diseases and the known demographic, economic and cultural differences in Europe, we analyse the contribution of such factors in the coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: Diagnosed COVID-19 cases from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and the European Social Survey for 20 European countries were used to estimate bivariate associations between cumulative reported case numbers ten-day intervals during March 2020 and ten social, demographic and economic variables. To avoid overfitting, we first reduce these variables to three factors (labelled “socially and economically vibrant”, “high-educated and not aged”, and “densely populated and traditional”) by means of factor analysis before conducting a multiple regression analysis. We also perform a sensitivity analyses using rates and new cases between two time periods.
Findings: The socially and economically vibrant factor has a strong and positive association with COVID-19 throughout the study period. The association with the densely populated and traditional factor was initially low but by mid-March similar to the socially and economically vibrant factor.
Conclusions: For future influenza-like pandemics where a vaccine is not yet available, early movement restrictions will be especially crucial to curb the spread of such diseases in economically, socially, and culturally vibrant and densely populated countries.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID19|Europe|Social tie,2020-04-14T05:03:50.469704,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T02:35:27.422898,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/citation/,sb8xn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ea248/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/relationships/node/,ea248,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e947916430166037ba07fa9/,5e947916430166037ba07fa9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sb8xn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sb8xn,NA
