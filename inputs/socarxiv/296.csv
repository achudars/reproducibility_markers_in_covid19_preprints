We detail the application of CurmElo to the problem of generating approximately preference-neutral identifiers, in this case four-letter and five-letter nonsense words patterned on the phonological conventions of the English language, using a population of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. We find evidence that human raters have significant non-uniform preferences over these nonsense words, and we detail the consequences of this finding for social science work that utilizes identifiers without accounting for this effect.

Yet conservationists increasingly recognise the importance of implementing demand-side interventions that target the end consumers in the trade chain. Their aim is to curb the consumption of wildlife or shift consumption to more sustainable alternatives. However, there are still considerable knowledge gaps in our understanding of the diversity of consumer motivations in the context of illegal wildlife trade, which includes hundreds of thousands of species, different uses, and diverse contexts. We developed a typology of common motivations held by wildlife consumers that can be used to inform conservation interventions, based upon consultation with multiple experts from a diversity of backgrounds, nationalities, and focal taxa. We identified five main motivational categories for wildlife use: experiential, social, functional, financial, and spiritual, each containing sub-categories. This framework is intended to facilitate more nuanced approaches to demand reduction, such as the tailoring of interventions—whether behaviour change campaigns, enforcement efforts, or incentive programmes—to the specific context in which they will be used. It is an important step towards producing a more systematic approach to designing demand reduction interventions that are more likely to succeed.",TRUE,FALSE,Behavior change|Behaviour change|Conservation social science|Consumer research|Demand reduction|Illegal wildlife trade,2019-10-26T19:15:21.749746,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-26T19:15:07.157171,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/citation/,7vjrg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db3180b46b571000e098a0c/,5db3180b46b571000e098a0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7vjrg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7vjrg,https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13578

Experimental evidence on the efficacy of childcare subsidies in raising parental labor supply","As a policy tool aimed at raising parental labor supply, childcare subsidies come with high expectations. Using data from a factorial survey, we examine whether childcare subsidies reach their goal. Because of the simultaneity of the decision to take up a job and arranging childcare, we experimentally alter hypothetical income (e.g., gross earnings from a job, income from other sources) as well as aspects of the childcare setting including subsidy levels. Using an alternative specific conditional logit model, we show that subsidies have the expected effect of increasing parents’ labor supply. Moreover, the results from simulations based on the estimated utility function show that varying subsidy levels have different effects on subgroups of parents. Subsidies are especially efficient in raising the labor supply of high income, Swiss-born parents, and especially for women. We also find that subsidies already have the desired effect at 25% of total childcare costs and that the marginal utility of higher subsidy levels decreases quite sharply beyond that threshold. Subsidies covering 25% of the total costs for childcare lead to an approximately 3 hours per week increase in the labor supply of women.",TRUE,FALSE,childcare subsidies|economics of the household|factorial survey experiment|family policy|labor supply,2019-10-26T19:02:43.815727,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-26T19:02:24.357830,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/citation/,sbp48,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db2f43946b571000c07c428/,5db2f43946b571000c07c428,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sbp48/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sbp48,NA

An experimental examination of reference group effects in secondary school,"It has often been suggested that reference group effects in education work through the self-concept of pupils.
At the same time, it has been shown that teachers compare students with their peers when making evaluations.
This observation gives rise to an alternative explanation of reference group effects on educational attainment: When deciding whether or not to recommend a student for grammar school, teachers consider not only the individual student's performance and abilities but use the wider group of motivated students as a frame of reference. Thus, given the limited number of places available in grammar school, a student's chances of being recommended also depend on his or her standing in the performance distribution as well as on the number of competitors. Using choice experiments presenting groups of three to five students to secondary school teachers in Switzerland, we show how the individual probability for a grammar school recommendation depends on the size of the reference group. Furthermore, individual chances are especially affected by the number of other students in the group that the teacher perceives as fit for grammar school. Our findings point towards a competition effect: The more and the better the competitors, the smaller the individual chances. In this respect, it seems better to be a big fish in a small pond.",TRUE,FALSE,Choice Experiment|Compositional Effects|Group Size|Reference Group Effects|Teacher Recommendation,2019-10-26T18:59:05.884793,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-26T18:58:41.129999,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/citation/,wqzx6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db2f270365cb8000ddae091/,5db2f270365cb8000ddae091,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqzx6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wqzx6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wqzx6,NA

An experimental examination of ethnic preferences in housing decisions,"Residential preferences are often treated as exogenous causes of social and ethnic segregation. In this paper, this assumption is challenged. Instead, this contribution proposes and evaluates how residential preferences are shaped by the conditions of one's neighbourhood. This approach acknowledges the mutual dependence of experienced neighbourhood and housing conditions, residential preferences, and segregation patterns. Doing so, an alternative explanation for the often documented ethnic preferences in housing decisions is elaborated and tested by applying multilevel generalized linear latent and mixed logit models to unique, geocoded data from a choice experiment. Results indicate that people differ in their evaluation of the social and ethnic composition of housing alternatives' residential surroundings. Moreover, these heterogeneous evaluations are largely independent of respondents' own ethnic background. Instead, the observed taste heterogeneity varies over respondents' bespoke neighbourhoods. However, the evaluation of the social and ethnic composition of the housing alternatives does not vary over larger administrative neighbourhoods.

This article discusses novel possibilities of these participatory practices through the critical analysis of a concrete community-based project. We here embrace under the “Social” tag of Citizen Social Science both Computational Social Science methodologies and the Social concerns expressed by the mental health community. The interpretation place persons with a mental condition, as well as caregivers and relatives, at the center of the research cycle by taking the role of Competent Experts In-The-Field. A synergetic relation between Citizen Science, Mental Health research and Computational Social Science also imply a conceptual shift in comparison to standard approaches such as the inclusion of research subjects as active co-designers or the consideration of communitarian spaces as most natural experimental spaces. We here describe how these concepts are put into practice during the whole duration of a research project that has studied the social interactions inside the Community Mental Health Care ecosystem. Important steps entail the creation of a Knowledge Coalition, including a diversity of relevant actors with diverse knowledge and expertise, that is later involved in co-designing the research and in embedding experimental settings in communitarian spaces. The experience allows us to open a wider discussion on the possibilities and limitations of Citizen Social Science practices. Having in mind the ethical debate raised by Citizen Science Public Health and Patients’ driven research, we propose a set of values and practices to be agreed on. We also analyse the participation of the scientists in these kind of projects, which forces them to adopt the role of “camaleons” when executing diverse and versatile tasks. We additionally advocate for a more extended collective interpretation of the results in order to produce socially robust knowledge and enhance actions and policies grounded on these results.

Departing instead from (fugitive) theories and practices of (under)commoning from peoples (presumed to be) excluded from ‘modernity’ suggests however there is much more and less to the picture than is often presented, and perhaps, following Benjamin (2001[1940]), it’s the past to (and from) which we should look in our efforts of and for futurity. Cautious against the often totalising and universalising accounts that constitute much of ‘radical left’ (or whatever) thought, this thesis instead recognises those insurgent and inventive intensities that remain elusive(ly everywhere), fugitive and excess yet never forgotten despite the serial efforts of (the) settlement. By centring the unsettling and unsettled, this thesis hopes (against hope) to offer a decolonial intervention in left discourses of the commons, media communication technologies, and futurity—namely via the examples of Cooperation Jackson, Open Source Gender Hacking, and Indigenous Ranger programs—emphasising the insurgent generativity of diverse local contexts in (de)forming and (un)settling fugitive modernities from the 'bottom-up' (Mignolo 2009; Smith 2012; Moreton-Robinson 2015; Moten 2018). Moving with and from Stefano Harney and Fred Moten’s (2013:28) visionary call to “inhabit the ruptural and enraptured disclosure of the commons that fugitive enlightenment enacts”, this research suggests ultimately ‘a way forward’ is not only (im)possible but (always) already everywhere underway.",TRUE,FALSE,apocalypse|blackness|communism|decolonisation|decolonization|digital culture|sovereignty|technology,2019-10-24T15:59:02.165138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-24T15:58:41.990439,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c89|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c8a|Arts and Humanities|Race, Ethnicity and Post-Colonial Studies|Indigenous Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d00|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Feminist Philosophy|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d03|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/citation/,dyheg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db13e0846b571000e06f60a/,5db13e0846b571000e06f60a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dyheg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dyheg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dyheg,NA

When we use an instrumental variable (IV) to estimate a LATE, the IV only has an indirect effect on the treatment of interest. Such IVs do not work as intended and will produce severely biased and/or uninterpretable results. This comment demonstrates that the LATE does not work as previously thought and explains why using the natural experiment proposed by Angrist and Evans (1998) as the example.",TRUE,FALSE,causal inference|instrumental variable|IV|LATE|local average treatment effect|natural experiment,2019-10-24T16:04:07.199642,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-24T16:03:35.861651,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/citation/,acdv4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/84vs3/,84vs3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db050c80db187000d399aa7/,5db050c80db187000d399aa7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acdv4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acdv4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/acdv4,NA
