The study analyzes the cultural representation in three types of culture: source, target, and international of English as a foreign language (EFL) textbooks used in English classrooms at public universities in Saudi Arabia. Through the method of content analysis, it was discovered that a cultural representation balance was not maintained, indeed, as the contents were skewed toward target culture representation. Analyses of the study data, including a survey taken by EFL learners (N= 120), showed that source culture was the least interesting for these participants.

This paper critically discusses types of motivation strategies in the EFL classroom and their increase in popularity. Following this, it critically considers ways in which motivation strategies are still lacking and hence presents some approaches to better promote these from the perspective of students, teachers and policy makers.

To some extent the high levels of crime at such hot spots are likely to be related to flows of people. City center locations with large flows of people are quite often also hot spots, e.g. hot spots for pick pocketing at a central train station, or hot spots for assault in the nightlife district. This can be related to crime pattern theory, or to the routine activity perspective, which both suggest that flows of people can affect crime. 
The present study attempts to explore and quantify whether there are differences in the association between flows of people and crime for different crime types. The analysis considers locations with high crime counts for six crime types in the city of Malmö, Sweden. For each crime type, hot spots are identified and mapped, and in order to explore whether, or how, these are related to flows of people, the crime levels are then analyzed in relation to the number of people who boarded a local bus (N=33,134,198) nearby. The paper shows that all six crime types are associated with flows of people, although less so for arson and vandalism.

In Austria, like in other European countries, informal care is carried out overwhelmingly by (non-cohabiting) relatives. Limited care services available during the crisis, social-distancing, economic uncertainty and competing care needs within households may have changed the profile of informal caregiving and/or increased the psychological strain experienced by caregivers. Focusing on Austria, this study aims to empirically analyse the following research questions: how has the pandemic affected the incidence and intensity of informal caregiving? How has the psychological wellbeing during the first wave of the pandemic compared across different groups of informal caregivers, depending on their gender and parental status? We use a novel representative survey carried out in Austria after the implementation of lockdown measures (June 2020, N=2000). Bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis is applied to a set of survey items dedicated to respondent’s informal caregiving before and after the start of the pandemic and psychological wellbeing. Findings suggest a tightening of care networks, with new carers likely to have stepped in to provide low intensity care to relatively autonomous people. Overall, both prevalence and intensity of informal care did not change significantly (compared to pre-crisis levels). Caregiving was associated with poor psychological outcomes, especially among those without children. Findings are discussed in relation to the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic and to the policy measures implemented in Austria.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|informal care|psychological wellbeing|quantitative methods,2020-10-13T11:15:01.172238,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-13T11:14:30.170394,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be available publicly in March 2021 at AUSSDA: https://aussda.at/,,not_applicable,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/citation/,bj3fk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f85487337b6bb005630adef/,5f85487337b6bb005630adef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj3fk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bj3fk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bj3fk

Through a combination of spatial and historical methods, we discovered that homicide was more than a social problem, it was a tool for advancing a diverse set of policy agendas. Specifically, city policy responses were the outcome of struggles between government and non-government actors over the definition of homicide and its causes. The struggles produced a repetitive cycle of city responses that included efforts to 1) delegitimize Black social movements, 2) expand policing, 3) frame homicide as an individual rather than systemic problem, and 4) exclusively credit police for homicide decreases.

Phenomena like fake news and hate speech show that political discourse on micro-blogging can become strongly polarised by algorithmic enforcement of selective perception. Some political actors actively employ strategies to facilitate polarisation on Twitter, as past contributions show, via strategies of 'hashjacking'. For the example of COVID-19 related hashtags and their retweet networks, we examine the case of partisan accounts of the German far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and their potential use of 'hashjacking' in May 2020. Our findings indicate that polarisation of political party hashtags has not changed significantly in the last two years. We see that right-wing partisans are actively and effectively polarising the discourse by 'hashjacking' COVID-19 related hashtags, like #CoronaVirusDE or #FlattenTheCurve. This polarisation strategy is dominated by the activity of a limited set of heavy users.

Preliminary Evidence from Machine Learning Models,"There is vigorous debate as to whether influential social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook should censor objectionable posts by government officials in the United States and elsewhere. Although these platforms have resisted pressure to censor such posts in the past, Twitter recently flagged five posts by the United States President Donald J. Trump on the rationale that the tweets contained inaccurate or inflammatory content. In this paper, we examine preliminary evidence as to whether these posts were retweeted less or more than expected. We employ 10 machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate the expected number of retweets based on 8 features of each tweet from historical data since President Trump was elected: number of likes, word count, readability, polarity, subjectivity, presence of link or multimedia content, time of day of posting, and number of days since Trump’s election. Our results indicate agreement from all 10 ML algorithms that the three flagged tweets for which we had retweet data were retweeted at higher rates than expected. These results suggest that flagging tweets by government officials might be counterproductive towards the spread of content deemed objectionable by social media platforms.",TRUE,FALSE,censorship|flagging|politics|social media|Trump|Twitter,2020-10-12T08:55:42.117132,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-12T08:55:25.977230,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/citation/,69hkb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f83c03e1f65a502dded4092/,5f83c03e1f65a502dded4092,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69hkb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/69hkb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/69hkb

Risk for heightened stress reactivity during these social challenges may be influenced by individual differences in social interaction anxiety (SIA) and the common gene variant, OXTR rs53576, but this relationship remains to be elucidated. We tested the relationship between SIA, OXTR rs53576, and cortisol stress response over time in 53 young adults (Mage=20.13yrs) using an experimental design. Participants were randomized to receive either scripted rejection or acceptance from a group of peer confederates. Saliva samples were collected pre- and post-evaluation and assayed for cortisol. In the peer rejection condition, participants showed significantly lower cortisol responses over time when social interaction anxiety levels were not elevated (versus elevated), and when possessing the GG genotype (versus AA/AG). In the peer acceptance condition, when SIA was not elevated, the GG genotype was associated with significantly lower cortisol responses than the AA/AG genotype. Individual differences in SIA and OXTR 53576 are related to cortisol responses to peer social stressors, with non-elevated levels of SIA and the GG genotype generally contributing to reduced cortisol responsiveness.",TRUE,FALSE,Acceptance|Cortisol|OXTR|Peer groups|Rejection|Social anxiety|Stress,2020-10-12T08:57:02.106596,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-12T08:56:47.315369,TRUE,DAG is founder and chief scientific and strategy advisor at Salimetrics LLC and Salivabio LLC and these relationships are managed by the policies of the committees on conflict of interest at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and University of California at Irvine.,no,"Data may be made available under limited circumstances following publication.
