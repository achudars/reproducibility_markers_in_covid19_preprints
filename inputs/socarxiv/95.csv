The study further investigated if there were gender differences in learners’ perceptions. The nonverbal aspects of communication focused on were teachers’ actions in class and their dressing and grooming. A sample of 465 form three secondary school learners was selected using stratified simple random sampling technique, out of whom 221 were female while 244 were male from Nakuru County, Kenya. Data was collected using a secondary school learner’s questionnaire. The reliability of the questionnaire was estimated using Cronbach alpha and yielded a coefficient of 0.88. The findings show that learners’ perceived their teachers’ nonverbal communication moderately influences their aspirations to pursue STEM. However, the perception on the influence of maintaining eye contact when asking and responding to questions and being always clean and neat were high. Therefore, science and mathematics teacher education programs should enhance pre and in service teacher awareness of the effect of their nonverbal behaviour on their learners. The Teachers Service Commission which is the national teacher regulator and employer in Kenya should ensure that the policy guidelines on teachers’ dressing and grooming are straightforwardly interpreted by all teachers and properly enforced.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-01T15:17:26.603743,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-01T15:16:37.149906,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/citation/,c25qp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60156904dd222503aa58978f/,60156904dd222503aa58978f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c25qp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c25qp/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.171,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c25qp

It acquiring prominence around the world however incapable to accomplish goals, reason was lack of awareness, lack of public intention and participation towards vertical farming. This study filled the gap in prior literature and adding more creativity to influence public intention. The research used TPB to investigate the factors influencing public intention toward vertical farming and a moderating role of awareness. Data collected from Chinese consumers by convenience sampling technique, total 335 responses obtained and analyzed by using Structural Equation Model. The result of the study demonstrated that food safety and environmental concern are the best predictors of public intention towards vertical farming. Further awareness significantly strengthened the relationship between food safety concern and public intention.

The participation of voters (turnout) in Malaysia’s elections from 2004–2018 is 73.90–84%. The participation of voters in Indonesia’s elections from 2004–2019 is 70.99–84.09%. This means that voter participation in the last three election periods was stable in both countries. This study shows that four factors cause stable participation: political awareness, rationality, political perceptions, and electoral orientation that is candidate-oriented. The theoretical implication of this study was to strengthen Timothy Feddersen and Alvaro Sandroni, and John G.

This study analyzes numerous archaeological, linguistic and historical evidences to claim that the words used for ivory and elephant (‘pīri’, ‘pīru’, etc.) in ancient Mesopotamian and Persian civilizations were borrowed from the Proto-Dravidian elephant-word ‘pīlu’, prevalent in the Indus valley civilization, and related to the Proto-Dravidian tooth-word ‘*pal’. It further argues that ‘pīlu’, the ancient and commonest phytonym of the toothbrush tree Salvadora persica, a characteristic flora of Indus valley, had also originated from the same Proto-Dravidian tooth-word.  Since ‘tooth’ belongs to the core non-borrowable ultraconserved vocabulary of a speech community, these evidences prove that many Indus people spoke Proto-Dravidian languages, as they used a Proto-Dravidian tooth-word.

It also argues that the inscriptions logographically encoded a commercial sublanguage to convey information about kinds of taxes/tithes, tax-receiving entities; tax-rates and modes; and activities (such as cultivation, manufacture, and trading of specific commodities) that these taxes covered and authorized. Building on the functional classification of Indus logograms performed in the author's previous structural analysis of Indus inscriptions and analysing various script-internal, archaeological, historical and linguistic evidence, this article seeks to interpret the semantic functionalities of different sign-classes. It proposes that:  i) The numerical and metrological signs were used to represent certain tax-collection rates fixed for certain commodities, whereas the lexeme-signs following them (   ) represented those taxed commodities. ii) The Crop-signs (  ) represented different harvested grain-based taxes. iii) The phrase-final/terminal logograms ( ) encoded certain metrological modes (volumetric, weight-based, reed-measure-based etc.) of tax-collection, and thus  metonymically encoded certain broad tax-categories.  iv) The lexeme-signs appearing in the initial parts of the grammatically complex inscriptions ( ) represented the tax-collector entities and purpose of tax-payment. v) The signs mostly occurring in pre-phrase-final positions ( ) represented the mode of tax-payments through predefined equivalencies. vi)  The bird-like logograms ( ) represented different precious stones including lapis lazuli, cornelian, agate etc.; while the fish-like logograms ( )  signified different apotropaic ""fish-eye-beads"", which were one of the most precious exported Indus commodities,  coveted in ancient Near East. Analysing the related lexical roots of such commodities— e.g. ivory (""piru""); lapis lazuli whose colour was compared to the iridescent pigeon-neck (""kāsaka hya kapautaka""); and ""eye-beads"" (maṇi), in Mesopotamian lexicons, Amarna letters, ancient texts in Old-Persian language, BMAC languages, Sanskrit, Pali, Tamil etc. — this study claims that such words had originated in the Indus valley, and had spread to the languages of other civilizations through trade networks.

When the relative losers of technological change lack the political power needed to pursue redistribution through the political system, they may turn to informal tactics of protest and redistribution, include violence. The argument is applied to the green revolution in India. The spread of a new crop technology, high-yielding variety (HYV) crops, improved agricultural productivity, but also generated rising inequality between landowners and the rural poor. Drawing on a panel dataset linking district-level estimates of HYV crop adoption to digitized crime records, this paper provides evidence that the spread of the new crop technology contributed to an epidemic of dacoity (banditry), an economic crime with elements of social protest against inequality. However, the spread of the new crop technology did not benefit left-wing parties electorally, suggesting that violence was not a precursor to but substitute for redistribution at the ballot box.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-31T01:02:44.531483,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-31T01:02:26.018367,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Aditya Dasgupta,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/citation/,qhxnp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/601460fbc5784b0392d03f57/,601460fbc5784b0392d03f57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhxnp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qhxnp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qhxnp

In the last years, researchers have started to apply PSI on videogame streaming environments, where the audience can interact with the observed media persona and get immediate feedback on their messages and requests. In a 3×2 online experiment (N = 251), we manipulated how a streamer addressed participants (individual vs. collective vs. no addressing) and whether he paid attention to and answered messages in the chat (attention vs. no attention to the chat). Findings show that the more individually participants were addressed and whether the streamer reacted to messages in the chat affected experiences of PSI. Further, alongside their overall enjoyment, PSI predicted viewers’ commitment to social norms. We discuss these findings regarding their implications for the conceptualization of PSI in light of interactive novel technologies.",TRUE,FALSE,"commitment to social norms|enjoyment|opencomm|parasocial interaction|Twitch|videogame streaming,",2021-01-31T01:01:07.811422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-31T01:00:51.142577,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/jwxdz/,available,NA,https://aspredicted.org/pt8kj.pdf,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/citation/,cfds9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jwxdz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/relationships/node/,jwxdz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60144637dd2225033958962c/,60144637dd2225033958962c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfds9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfds9/,https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0546,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfds9
