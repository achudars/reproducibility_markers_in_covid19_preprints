According to the cognitive linguistic approach, the stereotype is considered to be an element of the cultural and linguistic world view and an integral part of reality categorization mechanism. Ethnic stereotypes are very important in the process of intercultural communication since they can increase its effectiveness and eliminate interethnic problems or they can act vice versa. So auto- and hetero-stereotypes play a significant role in intercultural communication. This fact underlines the relevance of ethnic stereotype studies. The notions of ""auto- stereotype” and “hetero-stereotype"" are considered in the article, using the examples of English-language political media text headlines. Special attention is given to the headlines of English-language media texts about Russia. Basic features of the stereotype ""modern Russia"", formed by the English-language media, are defined by the analyzed political media text material.",TRUE,FALSE,auto- stereotype|cultural and linguistic world-view|ethnic stereotype|hetero-stereotype|political discourse,2019-01-05T04:55:01.244956,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:54:49.227176,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/citation/,8p4qy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c31a3a7c0a70018404880/,5c2c31a3a7c0a70018404880,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p4qy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8p4qy/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.34,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8p4qy

The subjects of this study were 100 students from different backgrounds who had been exposed to the English language for a significant period of time. They were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of a test on the use of politically correct English vocabularies and terms, and a survey of their opinions and attitudes towards the use of English with political correctness. Five of the respondents were interviewed about their attitudes. The findings reveal that students are able to identify certain politically correct words and terms regardless of the categories. Respondents also have positive attitudes and they consider this type of language as a formal and respectful language. They also suggest that this type of language is important and it should be implemented in workplaces and certain fields. However, there are few limitations of English with political correctness as it is considered unclear and sometimes it is overused. Moreover, there is no institution or academic initiative to standardize the use of English with political correctness.

Specifically, the objectives are to describe the syntax error patterns committed by the student while engaging in speaking and to explore the contributing factors that may affect the errors. To address these objectives, a qualitative research method is employed. Data was collected through audio-tape recordings and a face-to-face interview with the participant. The recorded data was transcribed and coded based on Noor Hashim's (1996)  seven categories of errors. The findings indicate that some of the  first language (L1) negative transfer errors fall into five out of seven categories of Noor Hashim's classification; however, new categories are discovered, such as wrong verb choice, noun forms, overly restricted use of pronouns, and omission of necessary complementizers. These errors can be explained by interference from the L1 and another contributing factor is the limited use of some strategies, such as repetition and confirmation. The significance of this study is a direct pedagogical implication to expose post-graduate students to academic spoken English.

Twelve of them are written by non-native Iraqi female students and the rest by native American female students. To do so, the researchers have set two aims: examining the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in terms of nativity and major and comparing the usages of metadiscourse markers’ types and subtypes in terms of nativity. To achieve the present aims, Hyland’s model (2005) is adopted. It aids in classifying the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in both data. The findings show that the Iraqi and American researchers use the interactive resources more than the interactional ones but the American researchers are capable of engaging their readers since their use of the interactional markers is higher than their counterparts. The field has no effect on the use of metadiscourse markers. There is diversity in the usage of the interactive resources in Iraqi data. Accordingly, the researchers recommend metadiscourse markers to be added to M.A courses as part of abstract writing exercise and the instructors of fourth-year college students to include metadiscourse markers in the writing of their research papers for coherence and clarity.",TRUE,FALSE,interactional resources|interactive resources|metadiscourse markers|the reader|the text|the writer,2019-01-05T04:52:01.510837,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:51:38.891765,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/citation/,zs3mc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c279328af78001c647fb2/,5c2c279328af78001c647fb2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zs3mc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zs3mc/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.26,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zs3mc

Forty students were chosen via purposely selected sampling. The research instruments included a reading and writing pretest-posttest, a speaking pretest-posttest, and a questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into three parts: the students’ demographic information, the students’ opinions about Pre-Task, During Task or Task Cycle, and Post-Task, as well as their additional opinions and suggestions of TBL. The data was statistically analyzed by mean, standard deviation, and t-test for dependent samples.  The results of this study indicated that the reading-writing and speaking abilities of EAP students through TBL after the experiment were significantly higher at the .05 level.
