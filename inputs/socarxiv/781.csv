problems that stump the experts, and that the lone genius will do so only
if properly incented. We deny patents on inventions that are ""obvious"" to
ordinarily innovative scientists in the field. Our goal is to encourage
extraordinary inventions – those that we wouldn’t expect to get without the
incentive of a patent.

The canonical story of the lone genius inventor is largely a myth. Edison
didn’t invent the light bulb; he found a bamboo fiber that worked better as
a filament in the light bulb developed by Sawyer and Man, who in turn built
on lighting work done by others. Bell filed for his telephone patent on the
very same day as an independent inventor, Elisha Gray; the case ultimately
went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which filled an entire volume of U.S.
Reports resolving the question of whether Bell could have a patent despite
the fact that he hadn’t actually gotten the invention to work at the time
he filed. The Wright Brothers were the first to fly at Kitty Hawk, but
their plane didn’t work very well, and was quickly surpassed by aircraft
built by Glenn Curtis and others – planes that the Wrights delayed by over
a decade with patent lawsuits.

The point can be made more general: surveys of hundreds of significant new
technologies show that almost all of them are invented simultaneously or
nearly simultaneously by two or more teams working independently of each
other. Invention appears in significant part to be a social, not an
individual, phenomenon. Inventors build on the work of those who came
before, and new ideas are often ""in the air,"" or result from changes in
market demand or the availability of new or cheaper starting materials. And
in the few circumstances where that is not true – where inventions truly
are ""singletons"" – it is often because of an accident or error in the
experiment rather than a conscious effort to invent.

The result is a real problem for classic theories of patent law. If we are
supposed to be encouraging only inventions that others in the field
couldn’t have made, we should be paying a lot more attention than we
currently do to simultaneous invention. We should issuing very few patents
– surely not the 200,000 per year we do today. And we should be denying
patents on the vast majority of the most important inventions, since most
seem to involve near-simultaneous invention. Put simply, our dominant
theory of patent law doesn’t seem to explain the way we actually implement
that law.

Maybe the problem is not with our current patent law, but with our current
patent theory. But the dominant alternative theories of patent law don’t do
much better. Prospect theory – under which we give patents early to one
company so it can control research and development – makes little sense in
a world in which ideas are in the air, likely to be happened upon by
numerous inventors at about the same time. And commercialization theory,
which hypothesizes that we grant patents in order to encourage not
invention but product development, seems to founder on a related historical
fact: most first inventors turn out to be lousy commercializers who end up
delaying implementation of the invention by exercising their rights.

If patent law in its current form can be saved, we need an alternative
justification for granting patents even in circumstances of
near-simultaneous invention. I consider two other possibilities. First,
patent rights encourage patent races, and that might actually be a good
thing. Second, patents might facilitate markets for technology. Both have
some logic to them, but neither fully justifies patent law in its current
form. As a result, I offer some suggestions for reforming patent law to
take account of the prevalence of simultaneous invention.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:44.590750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:14:55.534000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/citation/,ncyh7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s3zjh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/relationships/node/,s3zjh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc8490594d9001fdd0d977/,57bc8490594d9001fdd0d977,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncyh7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ncyh7

rights has long been neglected in debates over the economics of
intellectual property. In a path-breaking work, Rob Merges studied what he
calls ""collective rights organizations,"" industry groups that collect
intellectual property rights from owners and license them as a package.
Merges finds that these organizations ease some of the tensions created by
strong intellectual property rights by allowing industries to bargain from
a property rule into a liability rule. Collective rights organizations thus
play a valuable role in facilitating transactions in intellectual property
rights.

There is another sort of organization that mediates between intellectual
property owners and users, however. Standard-setting organizations (SSOs)
regularly encounter situations in which one or more companies claim to own
proprietary rights that cover a proposed industry standard. The industry
cannot adopt the standard without the permission of the intellectual
property owner (or owners).

How SSOs respond to those who assert intellectual property rights is
critically important. Whether or not private companies retain intellectual
property rights in group standards will determine whether a standard is
""open"" or ""closed."" It will determine who can sell compliant products, and
it may well influence whether the standard adopted in the market is one
chosen by a group or one offered by a single company. SSO rules governing
intellectual property rights will also affect how standards change as
technology improves.

Given the importance of SSO rules governing intellectual property rights,
there has been surprisingly little treatment of SSO intellectual property
rules in the legal literature. My aim in this article is to fill that void.
To do so, I have studied the intellectual property policies of dozens of
SSOs, primarily but not exclusively in the computer networking and
telecommunications industries. This is no accident; interface standards are
much more prevalent in those industries than in other fields. In Part I, I
provide some background on SSOs themselves, and discuss the value of group
standard setting in network markets. In Part II, I discuss my empirical
research, which demonstrates a remarkable diversity among SSOs even within
a given industry in how they treat intellectual property. In Part III, I
analyze a host of unresolved contract and intellectual property law issues
relating to the applicability and enforcement of such intellectual property
policies. In Part IV, I consider the constraints the antitrust laws place
on SSOs in general, and on their adoption of intellectual property policies
in particular. Part V offers a theory of SSO intellectual property rules as
a sort of messy private ordering, allowing companies to bargain in the
shadow of patent law in those industries in which it is most important that
they do so. Finally, in Part VI I offer ideas for how the law can improve
the efficiency of this private ordering process.

In the end, I hope to convince the reader of four things. First, SSO rules
governing intellectual property fundamentally change the way in which we
must approach the study of intellectual property. It is not enough to
consider IP rights in a vacuum; we must consider them as they are actually
used in practice. And that means considering how SSO rules affect IP
incentives in different industries. Second, there is a remarkable diversity
among SSOs in how they treat IP rights. This diversity is largely
accidental, and does not reflect conscious competition between different
policies. Third, the law is not well designed to take account of the modern
role of SSOs. Antitrust rules may unduly restrict SSOs even when those
organizations are serving procompetitive ends. And enforcement of SSO IP
rules presents a number of important but unresolved problems of contract
and intellectual property law, issues that will need to be resolved if SSO
IP rules are to fulfill their promise of solving patent holdup problems.

My fourth conclusion is an optimistic one. SSOs are a species of private
ordering that may help solve one of the fundamental dilemmas of
intellectual property law: the fact that intellectual property rights seem
to promote innovation in some industries but harm innovation in others.
SSOs may serve to ameliorate the problems of overlapping intellectual
property rights in those industries in which IP is most problematic for
innovation, particularly in the semiconductor, software, and
telecommunications fields. The best thing the government can do is to
enforce these private ordering agreements and avoid unduly restricting SSOs
by overzealous antitrust scrutiny.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:27.580957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:12:53.909000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/citation/,cbf9r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uszf5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/relationships/node/,uszf5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc84179ad5a101f868d3fd/,57bc84179ad5a101f868d3fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cbf9r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cbf9r

more harm in the software industry than in other industries such as
pharmaceuticals. They have pointed to a variety of problems and offered a
variety of solutions.

While there is some truth to each of these criticisms, the real problem
with software patents lies elsewhere. Software patent lawyers are
increasingly writing patent claims in broad functional terms. Put another
way, patentees claim to own not a particular machine, or even a particular
series of steps for achieving a goal, but the goal itself. The resulting
overbroad patents overlap and create patent thickets.

Patent law has faced this problem before. The Supreme Court ultimately
rejected such broad functional claiming in the 1940s as inconsistent with
the purposes of the patent statute. When Congress rewrote the Patent Act in
1952, it adopted a compromise position: patentees could write their claim
language in functional terms, but when they did so the patent would not
cover the goal itself, but only the particular means of implementing that
goal described by the patentee and equivalents thereof. These
“means-plus-function” claims permitted the patentee to use functional
language to describe an element of their invention, but did not permit her
to own the function itself however implemented.

Most software patents today are written in functional terms. If courts
would faithfully apply the 1952 Act, limiting those claims to the actual
algorithms the patentees disclosed and their equivalents, they could
prevent overclaiming by software patentees and solve much of the patent
thicket problem that besets software innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:07.992758,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:10:19.373000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/citation/,kb8d5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/429mk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/relationships/node/,429mk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc837d9ad5a101f668d64f/,57bc837d9ad5a101f668d64f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kb8d5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kb8d5

will be used to exclude competitors, only a tiny fraction of patents are
ever enforced. Legal and economic scholars have theorized as to how to
identify valuable patents based on their individual characteristics. In
this paper, we present the results of the largest empirical study ever
conducted of the patent system. We compare the characteristics of litigated
patents to those of issued patents generally, and we find important
differences in a range of dimensions. These data confirm some predictions
in the literature regarding patent value and refute others. New patents are
more likely to be litigated than old patents. Foreign patent owners are
less likely to litigate than domestic patent owners. Patents that issue to
individuals or small companies are much more likely to be litigated than
those that issue to big companies, though many of those patents have
changed hands by the time they are brought to court. Patents that cite more
prior art are more likely to be litigated, and those that are litigated
tend to be cited more elsewhere. Most significantly, there are substantial
differences between industries in the likelihood of patent litigation.
Patents in the mechanical, computer, and medical device industries are
significantly more likely to be litigated, for example, than patents in the
chemical and semiconductor industries.

In the paper, we explore the implications of these findings in detail.
Taken together, the data give a profile of a few valuable patents that
stand out from a field of ordinary ones. They are the patents that their
owners spend the most time and money in prosecuting. They are the ones that
competitors recognize as most important. They are concentrated in a few
industries in which patents play a more significant role in encouraging
innovation. And they are patents that issue to individuals or small
companies with asymmetric stakes in patent litigation, not to large
companies. These conclusions in turn have significant implications for the
design of the patent system, patent reform efforts and patent valuation

a form of property, and have applied the economic insights of Harold
Demsetz and other property theorists to condemn the use of intellectual
property by others as ""free riding."" In this article, I argue that this
represents a fundamental misapplication of the economic theory of property.
The economics of property is concerned with internalizing negative
externalities - harms that one person's use of land does to another's
interest to it, as in the familiar tragedy of the commons. But the
externalities in intellectual property are positive, not negative, and
property theory offers little or no justification for internalizing
positive externalities. Indeed, doing so is at odds with the logic and
functioning of the market. From this core insight, I proceed to explain why
free riding is desirable in intellectual property cases except in limited
circumstances where curbing it is necessary to encourage creativity. I
explain why economic theory demonstrates that too much protection is just
as bad as not enough protection, and therefore why intellectual property
law must search for balance, not free riders. Finally, I consider whether
we would be better served by another metaphor than the misused notion of
intellectual property as a form of tangible property.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:11.343237,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:05:05.794000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/citation/,3bdp6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vs6mb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/relationships/node/,vs6mb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc8243b83f6901f6655e23/,57bc8243b83f6901f6655e23,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3bdp6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3bdp6

We propose the following solution to this important cultural evolution question: Illness or injury often leaves people incapacitated for long periods. Caregiving - the provision of food, shelter etc. - is an important medical practice that enables ill or injured people and their dependents to survive these periods. However, caregiving is vulnerable to exploitation via illness deception whereby people feign illness in order to gain access to care. Harmful treatments helped to solve the problem of illness deception because only individuals who stand to gain substantially from care will accept the treatment. To investigate the plausibility of this theory we develop a mathematical model using evolutionary game theory and invasion analysis. We show that decreasing the benefit of caregiving via aversive and unpleasant medical treatments can counter-intuitively increase the range of conditions where caregiving is evolutionarily viable.

I examine the place of lesbians and queer women in the big data debates through the Lesbian Herstory Archive’s not “big” enough lgbtq organizing history dataset—perhaps the largest dataset known to exist on lgbtq activist history—as one such alternative.

outcomes of medical treatment. The objective to test the following
explanation: People who have a positive outcome tend to tell more people
about their disease/treatment than people with poor or average outcomes.
Akin to the file drawer problem in science, this systematically and
positively distorts the information available to others. *Design. *A
comparison of average health outcomes in clinical trials with average
outcomes in online health product reviews. *Methods*. If people with good
outcomes are more inclined to tell other people, then they should also be
more inclined to write online medical product reviews. Therefore average
outcomes in these reviews should be more positive than those found in RCTs.
Data on duration of treatment and outcome (weight or cholesterol change)
was extracted from user-generated health product reviews on Amazon.com and
compared to RCT data for the same treatments using ANOVA. The sample included
1,675 reviews of cholesterol reduction (Benecol, CholestOff) and weight
loss (Orlistat) treatments and the primary outcomes were Cholesterol change
(Bencol and CholestOff) or weight change (Orlistat). *Results*. In three
independent tests, average outcomes reported in reviews were substantially
more positive that outcomes reported in the medical literature (η2:  .01 to
.06; p: .04 to .001). For example, average cholesterol change following use
of Benecol is - 14mg/dl in RCTs and -45mg/dl in online reviews.
*Conclusions*. People with good outcomes are more inclined to share
information and this distorts the information available to others. Patients
who select treatments based on word of mouth, electronic or otherwise, are
likely to have unduly positive expectations.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:03.575637,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-19T09:25:59.577000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/citation/,htkn6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n356p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/relationships/node/,n356p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e670896c613b01f313b054/,57e670896c613b01f313b054,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htkn6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/htkn6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/htkn6
