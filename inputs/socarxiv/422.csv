Evaluating word embeddings as a complement to survey-based ratings of affective meaning.,"Central to affect control theory are culturally shared meanings of 
concepts. That these sentiments overlap among members of a culture presumably reflects their roots in the language use that members observe.  Yet the degree to which the affective meaning of a concept is encoded in the way linguistic representations of that concept are used in everyday symbolic exchange has yet to be demonstrated.  The question has methodological as well as theoretical significance for affect control theory, as language may provide an unobtrusive, behavioral method of obtaining EPA ratings complementary to those heretofore obtained via questionnaires.  We pursue a series of studies that evaluate whether tools from machine learning and computational linguistics can capture the fundamental affective meaning of concepts from large text corpora. We develop an algorithm that uses word embeddings to predict EPA profiles available from a recent EPA dictionary derived from traditional questionnaires, as well as novel concepts collected using an open-source web app we have developed. Across both a held-out portion of the available data as well as the novel data, our predictions correlate with survey-based measures of the E, P, and A ratings of concepts at a magnitude greater than 0.85, 0.8, and 0.75 respectively.",TRUE,FALSE,affect control theory|machine learning|natural language processing|pre-registered predictions|sentiment analysis|word embeddings,2019-07-10T12:50:22.100488,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-10T12:49:51.127419,FALSE,NA,no,Replication package including data is under construction,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,Austin van Loon|Jeremy Freese,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/citation/,r7ewx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d24d4371c5b4a001c9c238e/,5d24d4371c5b4a001c9c238e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7ewx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r7ewx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r7ewx,NA

Two decades later such concerns had virtually disappeared. Rather than as a problem, IFDI were now portrayed as a solution - even symbols of national economic success. To better understand the ideational dynamics underlying this remarkable transformation in perceptions of IFDI, this research traces the evolution of economic discourses in the United Kingdom over the post-war period. Deviating from conventional accounts in constructivist IPE, the investigation indicates that the rise of first-generation neoliberal discourses in the 1980s played only a secondary role in these processes. Instead, the discursive reshaping of IFDI was primarily driven by the rise of the narrative of national competitiveness in the early 1990s – a discourse inspired by managerial rather than neoclassical economic theory. Building a framework that prioritizes (multinational) firms over national economies, the rise of this second-generation neoliberal narrative played a critical role in promoting now taken-for-granted imaginaries of the global economy as an economic ”race” between nations-as-platforms-of-production. The findings highlight both the ideational underbelly of the rise of the competition state and how it re-shaped dominant social representations of IFDI.",TRUE,FALSE,business schools|competitiveness|economic ideas|foreign direct investments|United Kingdom,2019-07-10T12:50:41.364278,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-10T12:50:32.358185,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Lukas Linsi,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/citation/,s4j6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d24bd82a26b340019063aca/,5d24bd82a26b340019063aca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s4j6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s4j6y,https://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2019.1687557

loglinear models of tables of spouse pairs properly capture evidence of the  preferences behind assortative mating. Can we tell what sort of mechanisms bring about the patterns we see? Is there a female hypergamy preference and do loglinear models capture it? Four different ideal-typical simulations of spouse choice processes are presented: homophily, competition, social segregation, time segregation. All produce ""realistic"" patterns of educational assortative mating.  Imposing a simulated female hypergamy preference yields more asymmetric outcomes, directly detected in loglinear models. But the relationship between the size of the hypergamy estimate and the strength of the hypergamy differs according to the pairing mechanism. Notably, for homophily the estimate is lower, and for time-segregation higher. Indeed, for zero simulated hypergamy, the homophily simulation shows negative, and the time-segregation simulation positive, hypergamy. This is shown to be due to the dynamic nature of the simulations: as individuals pair off the distribution of single individuals changes. For homophily perfectly symmetric choices at each iteration sum into a table of spouse pairs in which loglinear models detect hypogamy.  Conclusions: these biases are small, and depend on very large simulation populations. They are less likely to be detectable in typical survey data. However, we demonstrate a clear mechanism by which loglinear models of tables of spouse pairs can be biased. This suggests that if longitudinal data is available, a time dimension should be included in the loglinear models.

One of the key foci of the article is its elaboration on the new Presidential Complex (Cumhurbaşkanlığı Külliyesi) as a case that, in its representational and conceptual aspects, reflects the spatialization of Islamist and populist discourses and symbolizes the recent transformations of social space and the emergent sociospatial order in Turkey.",TRUE,FALSE,Ankara|Islamism|neo-Ottomanism|politics of space|populism|spatialization of discourse|Turkish Presidential Palace,2019-07-09T11:54:06.703372,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-09T11:53:51.625459,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d87|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Other Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76def|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Other Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",Cambridge University Press,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/citation/,7dpw3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d23711fce16db001a5bfffe/,5d23711fce16db001a5bfffe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dpw3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7dpw3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7dpw3,https://doi.org/10.1017/npt.2019.15

We layer these images with a published, geo-referenced collection of Land Survey Maps of China (1903–1948), which includes the earliest large-scale maps of major cities and regions in China that are produced with modern cartographic techniques. By bringing together historical illustrations depicting spatial configurations of localities and the earliest modern cartographic maps, researchers of Chinese history can study the different spatial epistemologies represented in both collections. We report our workflow for creating this web GIS platform, starting from identifying and extracting visual materials from local gazetteers, tagging them with keywords and categories to facilitate content search, to georeferencing them based on their source locations. We also experimented with neural networks to train a tagger with positive results. Finally, we display them in the web GIS platform with two modes, Images in Map (IIM) and Maps in Map (MIM), and with content- and location-based filtering. These features together enable researchers easy and quick exploration and comparison of these two large sets of geospatial and visual materials of China.",TRUE,FALSE,art history|cartographic history|digital humanities|historical GIS|image|local gazetteers|machine learning|spatial humanities,2019-07-09T11:53:29.440960,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-09T11:53:12.807758,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf0|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Asian Art and Architecture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies",Nung-yao Lin|Shih-pei Chen|Sean Wang|and Calvin Yeh,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/citation/,sfz9t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7my9g/,7my9g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d233fa1fe43a1001724c27d/,5d233fa1fe43a1001724c27d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfz9t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sfz9t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sfz9t,https://doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2020.0246

However, the use of these umbrella-concepts in educational contexts has caused issues when used in conjunction with concepts such as affordances and integration. In this paper, eight Chinese preservice early childhood teachers’ perceptions of ICT and its affordances are explored through online interviews. The participants conceptualised ‘ICT’ as screen-based technologies such as interactive whiteboards and computers. These technologies were perceived to afford efficiency and assistance, particularly for teacher-centred practice, but to constrain children’s tactile and direct hands-on experience. The results highlight the importance of sociocultural contexts (e.g. practicum places and educational traditions) in shaping preservice teachers’ perceptions of technology and technology use. Implications for future technology integration research and teacher education are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,Affordance|China|Early childhood education|ICT|Preschool|Preservice teacher|Technology,2019-07-09T11:52:49.821454,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-09T11:52:28.462746,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/citation/,cq58g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d22e5ecce16db00195d1c3b/,5d22e5ecce16db00195d1c3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq58g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cq58g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cq58g,https://doi.org/10.1080/09575146.2019.1627293
