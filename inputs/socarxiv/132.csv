A vaccine will be the most effective global preventive strategy to end the pandemic. Studies have maintained that exposure to negative sentiments related to vaccination on social media increase vaccine hesitancy and refusal.  Despite the influence social media has on vaccination behavior, there is a lack of studies exploring the public's exposure to misinformation, conspiracy theories, and concerns on Twitter regarding a potential COVID-19 vaccination. 
Objective: The study aims to identify the major thematic areas about a potential COVID-19 vaccination based on the contents of Twitter data.  
Method: We retrieved 1,286,659 publicly available tweets posted within the timeline of July 19, 2020, to August 19, 2020, leveraging the Twint package. Following the extraction, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelling and identified 20 topics discussed in the tweets. We selected 4,868 tweets with the highest probability of belonging in the specific cluster and manually labeled as positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant. The negative tweets were further assigned to a theme and subtheme based on the content
Result: The negative tweets were further categorized into 7 major themes: ""safety and effectiveness,” ""misinformation,” ""conspiracy theories,” ""mistrust of scientists and governments,” ""lack of intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine,” ""freedom of choice,"" and ""religious beliefs.  Negative tweets predominantly consisted of misleading statements (n=424) that immunization against coronavirus is unnecessary as the survival rate is high. The second most prevalent theme to emerge was tweets constituting safety and effectiveness related concerns (n=276) regarding the side effects of a potential vaccine developed at an unprecedented speed. 
Conclusion: Our findings suggest a need to formulate a large-scale vaccine communication plan that will address the safety concerns and debunk the misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading across social media platforms, increasing the public's acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccination.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-11T17:56:21.848971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-11T17:55:08.051686,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,None.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/citation/,vc9jb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd21e140694b700b9f3897c/,5fd21e140694b700b9f3897c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vc9jb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vc9jb,NA

Although growing COVID-19 case numbers, deaths, and hospitalizations are concerning, this spread is particularly alarming in the United States where polarizing opinions, changing policies, and misinformation abound. In particular, American college campuses have been a venue of rampant transmission, with concerning spillover into surrounding, more vulnerable, communities. We surveyed over 600 college students from across the United States and modeled predictors of compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions. We identified concern with severity (p &lt; .001), constitutional originalist ideology (p &lt; .001), news exposure (p &lt; .001) and religiosity (p &lt; .05) as significant positive correlates with compliance, and general trust in science (p &lt; .05) as a significant negative correlate. To determine how applicable nationwide modeling might be to individual local campuses we also administered this same survey to nearly 600 students at two large universities in Utah County. In this population, concern with severity was the only significant positive correlate with compliance (p &lt; .001); Additionally, feelings of inconvenience was negatively correlated (p &lt; .001). The effects of feelings of inconvenience, and news exposure were significantly different between populations (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001). These results suggest that we should focus our efforts on increasing knowledge about the pandemic’s effects on our society and informing about constitutionality amongst college students.

Our analyses, based on a standardized definition of fiscal income, allow us to locate, for top-income groups, the sources of discrepancy. We find, using the cases of the United States, Germany, and France, that the results from survey-based and tax data correspond extremely well (in terms of total income, mean income, composition of income, and income shares) above the 90th percentile and up to the top 1 percent of the distribution. Information about income composition, available in the US, allows us to investigate the determinants of this gap in the US. About three-fourths of the tax/survey gap is due to differences in non-labor incomes, especially self-employment (business) income. The gap itself may be due to tax-induced re-classification of income from corporate to personal or/and to lower ability of surveys to capture top 1 percent incomes.

Evictions, destructions, and securitisations exclude 'non-citizen' migrants from this border city, defining those allowed to exist within it as citizens by contrast. They also destroy the physical infrastructures, social communities, and political solidarities facilitating migrants' irregular journeys to the UK. Thus, the erasure of irregular migrants' autonomous home-spaces reproduces citizenship while reasserting it as the determinant of who can freely exist in, or move beyond, Calais. 

However, anti-migrant domicide also produces unconventional citizenships beyond nationality or status. The thesis analyses two examples---environmental and humanitarian citizenship---to show how citizen communities in Calais can reconfigure themselves around alternative, nominally more inclusive, sets of values while continuing to exclude irregular migrants. In these cases citizens define themselves either against migrants who are perceived as failing to fulfil citizenship's substantive criteria, or through migrants who are the object of citizen-defining humanitarian or environmentalist performances. While not immediately excluded by their status, migrants 'non-citizens' because of their racialisation in Calais' racist environment and how this has been compounded by the effects of domicide against them.
Counter-mapping in this project takes three different forms: cartographic, presenting a map of domicide between 2009-19; narrative, elaborating descriptions of select case studies in Calais' anti-migrant domicidal history; and conceptual, demonstrating how citizenship is produced by these exclusionary spatial interventions. These three modes are combined to map how migrants' spatial exclusion from Calais' 'spaces of citizenship' and their socio-political exclusion reciprocally reinforce one-another.

While countering progressive conceptions of citizenship by showing how all citizenship forms analysed in Calais are constituted through migrants' exclusion, the thesis raises questions for the continued invocation of citizenship politics in scholarly analyses of resistance to the border regime. It also argues for the need to (re)create spaces of anti-citizenship as part of struggles for free movement for all. These spaces prefigure coalitional relations beyond citizenship categories, and provide toe-holds from which to resist their institutionalisation in bordering technologies.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-citizenship|bordering|Calais|citizenship|domicide|enclosure|environmental racism|eviction|migrants|mobile commons,2020-12-10T03:44:22.997541,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-10T01:44:48.102020,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/citation/,35284,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd11b0fab03ed001db1394f/,5fd11b0fab03ed001db1394f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35284/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/35284/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/35284,NA

Yet we waste it. The information we get from observing other humans and from communicating with them is a cheap and reliable informational resource. It is considered the backbone of human cultural evolution. Theories and models focused on the evolution of social learning show the great adaptive benefits of evolving cognitive tools to process it. In spite of this, human adults in the experimental literature use social information quite inefficiently: they do not take it sufficiently into account. A comprehensive review of the literature on five experimental tasks documented 45 studies showing social information waste, and 4 studies showing social information being over-used. These studies cover “egocentric discounting” phenomena as studied by social psychology, but also include experimental social learning studies. Social information waste means that human adults fail to give social information its optimal weight.

This structure of journalistic coverage is a result of conditions on the micro-level of actions and decisions of individual journalists. Among these conditions are restrictions that derive from the process and constitution of scientific publishing and research results. We argue that the parameter of such power law distributions can potentially be used to describe selectivity in journalism on a high aggregation level. Differences in the value of the parameter point to differences in the conditions present on the micro-level. To test this assumption, we chose a field of research that has attracted a considerable degree of public attention over the last few years: neuroscience. We expected to find differences in the exponent of power law distributions between neuroscience and other scientific disciplines. Our results show that the frequency distribution of journalistic references to single studies and journals in the coverage of neuroscientific research can be described by a power law. The selection of scientific journals is more homogenous in neuroscience in the sense that there is a less pronounced dominance of just a few journals. It is proposed to interpret this as an effect of the greater popularity of neuroscience.",TRUE,FALSE,media attention|neuroscience|news selection|power law|science communication|science journalism|scientific journals,2020-12-10T03:43:23.225449,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-10T01:41:22.272549,TRUE,This research was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG).,available,NA,https://osf.io/qxw2y/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/citation/,s9dy7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd0e75ed0982b008174d6d0/,5fd0e75ed0982b008174d6d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9dy7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s9dy7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s9dy7,NA

Problems once framed in social terms gradually became redefined as individual with regards to scope and remedy, with economics and psychology winning influence over the other social sciences. By the 1970s, both economics and psychology had spread their intellectual remits wide: psychology's concepts suffused everyday language, while economists entered a myriad of policy debates. Psychology and economics contributed to, and benefited from, a conception of society that was increasingly skeptical of social explanations and interventions. Sociology, in particular, lost intellectual and policy ground to its peers, even regarding 'social problems' that the discipline long considered its settled domain. This introduction frames the book's ten chapters, each of which explore this shift refracted through a single 'problem': the family, crime, urban concerns, education, discrimination, poverty, addiction, war, and mental health, examining the effects an increasingly individualized lens has had on the way we see these problems.",TRUE,FALSE,history of economics|history of psychology|history of social science|history of sociology|public policy|social policy|social problems,2020-12-10T03:41:22.084888,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-10T01:39:49.269477,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/citation/,w59f3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd0d59d08ec9e0087b8d216/,5fd0d59d08ec9e0087b8d216,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w59f3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w59f3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w59f3,https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108765961.001

But what do those politics hide? In this paper we seek to partly answer this question by developing the concept of racialized burdens. Racialized burdens are the experience of learning, compliance and psychological costs, which serve as tools to reinforce racial inequality; they are the handmaidens of the racialized state. To develop this concept, we examine the role of administrative burdens in the US state from the theoretical perspective of racialized organizations. This framework puts the focus on the effects of organizations on individuals, rather than using individual agency – of the client, or bureaucrat – as the starting point for analysis. Using examples from attempts to access citizenship rights – via immigration, voting and the social safety net – we show how burdens have historically been used to normalize and facilitate racially disparate outcomes from public organizations that promise fair and equal treatment.",TRUE,FALSE,Administrative Burden|Immigration|Racialized Organizations|Safety Net|Voting Rights,2020-12-09T18:48:03.398082,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-09T13:13:04.183800,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/citation/,q3xb8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd0cb43d0982b006974e10c/,5fd0cb43d0982b006974e10c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3xb8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q3xb8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q3xb8,NA
