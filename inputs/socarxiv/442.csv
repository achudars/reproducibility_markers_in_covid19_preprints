This editorial introduction describes the role that we envision for the journal.  First, we explain what computational communication science is and why a new journal is needed for this subfield.  Then, we elaborate on the type of research this journal seeks to publish, and stress the need for transparent and reproducible science.  The relation between theoretical development and computational analysis is discussed, and we argue for the value of null-findings and risky research in additive science. Subsequently, the (experimental) two-phase review process is described. In this process,  after the first double-blind review phase, an editor can signal that they intend to publish the article conditional on satisfactory revisions. This starts the second review phase, in which authors and reviewers are no longer required to be anonymous and the authors are encouraged to publish a preprint to their article which will be linked as working paper from the journal.

This paper explicitly distinguishes the association of mortality with macroeconomic fluctuations from that with fiscal policy measures, using data for 28 European Union (EU) countries covering the period 1991-2013. The main results present a nuanced, complex picture about the mortality impact of fiscal policies. We confirm the mortality decreasing (increasing) effect of recessions (booms), with the exception of suicide mortality, which shows the opposite effects. Austerity regimes are associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (0.7%). At the same time, fiscal stimuli tend to significantly increase death rates due to cirrhosis or chronic liver disease (3%) and those due to vehicle accidents (4.3%). Overall, the results appear to be sensitive to the set of countries included: when excluding the Baltics, Romania and Hungary, austerity policies turn out to significantly increase suicide-related mortality (2.8%), while the effect on all-cause mortality remains the same (0.7%).",TRUE,FALSE,Austerity|Recession and health|Socioeconomic determinants of health,2019-05-18T18:42:07.512548,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-18T18:41:53.297414,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/citation/,b2t4x,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ya96c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/relationships/node/,ya96c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce023a123fec40019e122f5/,5ce023a123fec40019e122f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b2t4x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b2t4x,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2019.03.002

The identified gap was addressed using multilevel logistic regression models.
Methods: Pooled 2008 and 2013 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Surveys datasets were used. Single level logistic regression analyses were conducted on 24,032 women, and multilevel logistic regression models were performed on 23,329 women. Statistical significance was pegged at p≤0.01 and p≤0.05.
Results: About 22.1% of the reproductive age women ever used a modern contraceptive. The best-fitted model indicated that the effects of individual, household, and geo-residential level factors on the use of modern contraceptives among Sierra Leone Women vary from one community to another. The woman’s age, marital status, educational qualification, listening to the radio, recent sexual activity, household wealth, place of residence, and region of residence were the statistically significant predictors of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age Sierra Leone women.

GDELT provides a vast, open source, and continuously updated repository of online news and event metadata collected from tens of thousands of news outlets around the world. Despite GDELT’s promise for advancing communication science, its massive scale and complex data structures have hindered efforts of communication scholars aiming to access and analyze GDELT. We thus developed iCoRe, an easy-to-use web interface that (a) provides fast access to the data available in GDELT, (b) shapes and processes GDELT for theory-driven applications within communication research, and (c) enables replicability through transparent query and analysis protocols. After providing an overview of how GDELT’s data pertain to addressing communication research questions, we provide a tutorial of utilizing iCoRe across three theory-driven case studies. We conclude this article with a discussion and outlook of iCoRe’s future potential for advancing communication research.",TRUE,FALSE,Big Data|Computational Social Science|Event Data|Global Database of Events Language and Tone|Online News|Open Science,2019-05-17T23:59:10.424054,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-17T23:58:46.684238,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,NA,Frederic R.

that resemble traditional editorial decisions. However, the decisions for social media may
deviate from traditional ones because they are often made outside the newsroom and guided
by audience metrics. This study focuses on selective link sharing as quasi-gatekeeping on
Twitter – conditioning a link sharing decision about news content. It illustrates how selective
link sharing resembles and deviates from gatekeeping for the publication of news stories.
Using a computational data collection method and a machine learning technique called
Structural Topic Model (STM), this study shows that selective link sharing generates a
different topic distribution between news websites and Twitter and thus significantly revokes
the specialty of news organizations. This finding implies that emergent logic, which governs
news organizations’ decisions for social media can undermine the provision of diverse news,
which relies on journalistic values and norms.",TRUE,FALSE,gatekeeping|selective link sharing|Structural Topic Model,2019-05-17T20:24:47.578633,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-17T20:24:25.517614,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/citation/,pt7es,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdf15b723fec40017e12fe2/,5cdf15b723fec40017e12fe2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt7es/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pt7es/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pt7es,NA

Much of this gap has be attributed to industrial composition, however employment composition also likely plays a key role. Underemployment and labor force non-participation have been become significant issues in rural areas. This study uses data from the Current Population Survey for 1970 to 2018 to understand how poverty rates among 6 employment groups —(1) not in the labor force, (2) discouraged workers, (3) unemployed workers, (4) low hours workers, (5) low income workers, and (6) adequately employed workers— can explain the persistent gap in poverty between urban and rural areas. Demographic standardization and decomposition techniques reveal that majority of the poverty gap is explained by differences in poverty rates for the employment groups. Rural individuals in all employment group have higher poverty rates than urban individuals in the same group. Analysis also shows that if rural America had either the employment structure or the employment specific poverty rates of urban America than poverty rates would be much lower in rural areas.",TRUE,FALSE,Labor Force Participation|Poverty|Rural|Underemployment|Urban,2019-05-17T17:48:27.949608,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-17T17:48:04.778618,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",NA,Matthew M Brooks,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/citation/,a9qex,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdedf8623fec40019e0852b/,5cdedf8623fec40019e0852b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qex/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a9qex/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a9qex,NA
