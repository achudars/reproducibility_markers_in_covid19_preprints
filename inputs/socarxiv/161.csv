Testing the effect of ethnic appearance on citizen perceptions of the police,"Ethnic minority officers continue to be underrepresented across UK police forces. Further, some ethnic minority groups consistently report lower levels of confidence in police compared to their White British counterparts. Although there is consensus that a more ethnically representative police service is a good idea, there is limited evidence in the UK on how the public perceives officers of different ethnic appearance, and how this relates to trust, confidence and legitimacy. This paper presents findings from an online experiment (n=260) exploring how ethnic appearance affects perceptions of police. Our findings offer rare empirical support for a more ethnically representative police force. First, across respondents, we found that Black officers were perceived significantly more favourably than White or Asian officers. Second, we found that Black respondents had more negative responses to White officers, yet there was little evidence that Black officers elicited more negative reactions from White or Asian respondents. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.",TRUE,FALSE,affect|ethnic representation|police diversity|policing|trust,2020-10-27T12:14:21.798806,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-27T12:10:03.912517,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://osf.io/mh8ag,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/citation/,yzspk,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f97f34887b7df02593af95d/,5f97f34887b7df02593af95d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yzspk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yzspk

Closing donation centers influences blood donor lapse","In this paper, we use register data on all blood donors (n = 259,172) and changes in geographical locations of blood donation centers in the Netherlands over the past decade, to examine the strength of altruistic motivations in blood donation by testing how blood donor behavior changes after the cost of donating in the form of time and inconvenience increases. We examined whether closing donation centers influences blood donor lapse, and whether the risk for lapse varies between donors with different blood groups. A lower lapsing risk for donors with universal, O-negative blood as costs increase is considered as evidence of altruism: continued efforts in making a societal impact despite the increased time commitment would indicate altruism in donor behavior. In the total sample, 137,172 (52.9%) donors lapsed at least once. We found a very strong effect of changes in the distance to the nearest collection point on donor lapse. Donors whose nearest donation center closed were 53% more likely to lapse than donors whose donation center remained open, with the risk for donor lapse increasing with each extra kilometer distance to the new nearest donation center. While O-negative donors were 10.5% less likely to lapse after closing a donation center compared to donors with other blood groups, the effect of closing was similar across blood groups. Based on these results, we conclude that blood donors are clearly sensitive to cost changes imposed by blood banks and that they are not particularly motivated by altruistic concerns. Future studies are recommended to further examine the role of contextual factors in motivational change across the blood donor career. Blood banks are advised to strategically place donation centers throughout the country to promote blood donations, and design interventions to reduce donation barriers after changing their donation centers’ locations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-27T12:13:29.916831,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-27T12:09:36.045120,FALSE,NA,no,Analyses are based on registry data of all blood donors and locations of blood donation locations in the Netherlands.

However, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), differences emerge in the opposite direction and the national-expatriate gap in academic competence is equivalent to almost three years of schooling. This gap is a concern in the UAE, where national students mainly attend public schools and expatriates, mostly private schools. To investigate the competence gap between national and expatriate students, we estimate group differences and conduct linear regression analysis using data from the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment. Results show that the gap varies by emirate and country of origin and is greater among boys, better-off students and in private schools. Between 33% and 47% of this gap is explained by school type, whether public or private.

I study this question using multilevel regression to analyse data from the 2015 Programme for International Students Assessment on 15-year-old students in 33 countries. Several measures of SES are studied. Results indicate that 1) distinct school-related factors may shape students’ LS differently for students of higher and lower SES; 2) schools can moderate the association between SES and students’ LS; and 3) for all the above, although some general patterns are observed across countries, there are important differences across societies and measures of SES.

We examined peer reviewed and gray literature reports to answer this question. Reporting on different HFI levels is key for targeting and evaluating policies and programs. In addition, there are dose-response or curvilinear relationships between HFI levels and diverse physical and mental health outcomes, and early childhood development indicators. The process of introduction of HFI experience-based measures in Latin America improved the understanding of the meaning of different HFI levels among policymakers, media and population at large.  Findings strongly suggest that HFI can only be properly understood and addressed by assessing and reporting on all levels of HFI at the local, provincial, national, regional and global levels.

The work documents a substantial rise in the total value of inheritance and gifts as a share of national income, from 8.4% in 1995 to 15.1% in 2016. Consistent with the increasing role of total personal net wealth in the economy, the weight of inheritance and gifts in Italy appears relatively high by international standards. Over the same period, total wealth left at death has also become increasingly concentrated. The estates valued at at least one million Euros were worth 18.7% of total estate in the mid-1990s and 24.8% in 2016. This paper also documents that revenues collected from the inheritance tax underwent a large decline from 0.14% to 0.06% of total tax revenue between 1995 and 2016.

One way in which policy makers have responded to this tension is by repurposing existing institutions to serve new ends. We investigate the system of Universal Credit (UC) in the UK as an example of such a ‘conversion’. UC expands the mantra of ‘active citizenship’ to a much larger population than ever before. However, far from producing uniform outcomes, UC’s implementation has been marked by chaos and ultimately failure for individuals and communities. We argue that UC exemplifies a broader shift from social security to state-sanctioned social insecurity as policy reforms come to mimic the insecurities and risks commonly associated with the market",TRUE,FALSE,active citizenship|austerity|policy conversion|social security|universal credit,2020-10-26T18:02:24.329311,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-26T18:02:14.190359,FALSE,NA,no,Ethnographic data collected by IK is not available to other researchers.,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/citation/,kavf9,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f96c5b087b7df01ab3afb54/,5f96c5b087b7df01ab3afb54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kavf9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kavf9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kavf9

Online dating was the single biggest way people met their spouses. Bigger than work, friends, and school combined.” Aziz Ansari, (2015).
	Romantic relationships have drastically changed in today’s world, affected by the role of social media and deeply changing the way we interact with each other. The way we approach one another might seems standard today, but importantly differs from what people did even just decades ago. The percentage of people meeting online keeps rising while traditional ways of finding your partner are constantly decreasing.
Online dating transformed our romantic lives; single people today have more romantic options than ever. The new trend of online romantic relationships leads to various questionings. Why do people decide to use social media to interact with each other rather than approaching someone in the street and invite him/her for diner? The issue of online self-presentation, the necessity of body language, and how does this change affect us in finding our life partner? It is this change we want to focus on, to try and find out how the rise of online dating drastically affected the art of finding a companion.  
The aim is to intent to understand the different intentions behind social media when concerning romantic relationships. We can ask ourselves for instance, do people search today for long term connection when chatting on the net or maybe more alternative motives.
Of course, the rise of social media implies some new challenges and risks that are necessary to mention, we will mainly focus on how social media negatively affects the beginning of romantic relationships.
Throughout the paper we will first focus on 5 focus points based on related work to the topic, in order to organize the information. The aim is to understand the connection between romantic relationships and social media, how do we present ourselves online, media richness, the Initiation of social ties on social media and finally analyzes the initiation of romantic ties on social media. 
We will discuss prior research and go further into our research questioning focusing on the negative impact of this new kind of romantic relationship by conducting a survey and analyze how people perceive the role of social media in their own romantic life. 
People have become so used to using social media that a more traditional way of dating is less and less considerable nowadays. Using social media to approach someone has become the new norm, and maybe the reason why we should be more alert and consider the negatives impacts it has on the initiation of romantic relationships.",TRUE,FALSE,relationships|social media,2020-10-26T18:03:10.377338,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-26T18:01:26.646660,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/citation/,2enxc,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/twsge/,twsge,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f967d92101721014ba4423e/,5f967d92101721014ba4423e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2enxc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2enxc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2enxc

Among other things, authoritarianism is reliably found to be associated with greater religiosity. Though education and human development are often thought to reduce religiosity, we show in this study that the relationship between authoritarianism and various indices of religiosity is stronger in the presence of greater educational attainment and living in a society with a higher level of human development. Using two large cross-cultural datasets from the World Values Survey, we find evidence that authoritarianism is more strongly associated with religious involvement and practice among individuals at higher levels of education and individuals living in societies with higher level of human development. Thus, we demonstrate that the connection between authoritarianism and religiosity is contingent on both individual-level and societal moderators.",TRUE,FALSE,authoritarianism|education|human development|religiosity,2020-10-26T03:01:04.932027,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-26T03:00:36.243211,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Personality and Social Contexts,NA,Christopher M.
