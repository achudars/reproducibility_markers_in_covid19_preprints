Schutz himself is an important philosopher and sociologist because of his theory in sociology and philosophy studies. In the world of philosophy, he is a figure who studies the Husserlian tradition of phenomenology. Meanwhile, in the world of sociology himself, Schutz chose to explore Weber's methodological project. With the methodology proposed by Weber, he seeks to develop an interpretive methodology as an attempt to counter the tendency of the positivism tradition of science. The book was written to provide a discussion of the phenomenological methodology by Schutzian, which Schutz pioneered. Through his methodology, he taught that every individual is present in the stream of consciousness obtained from the process of reflecting on daily experiences. This book focuses on explaining the phenomenological methodology by Schutzian which later can become a reference for academics in Indonesia in developing the Schutzian methodology for Indonesian academics. In addition, this book also introduces Alfred Schutz as a critical intellectual who is not widely known, but whose thoughts and contributions have an impact on the world of social science.
This book is written and aimed at Indonesian academics, especially in the realm of philosophy and sociology. Although the name Schutz himself lost to other philosophers, he had a very large contribution in the fields of philosophy and sociology, especially for science in Indonesia. The methodology adopted by Schutz has inspired many academics to read reality. It is evident from the many studies in Indonesia that use the phenomenology of the Schutz methodology. This phenomenology is used to read reality in society. As in research conducted by Ristia (2020), it was found that people have different opinions, this is due to the influence of the applied norms. These different opinions become absolute and become freedom by each individual. Research using the Schutz phenomenology method can also be used to explore types of phenomenology and ethnography. Research in the genre of ""transcendental phenomenology"" is a phenomenon outside the egos of the researcher because the source of truth can be obtained by direct observation of the natural surroundings.
              The author presents a biography of Alfred Schutz, who was a unique and influential intellectual but little known. The introduction of the background, politics, and culture in Schutz can inspire readers to get inspiration on Schutz's life. In addition, by knowing his background, readers will be able to analyze how a Schutz gets his thoughts. Apart from the history of Schutz's travels, its also provides a brief biography of Husserll. Husserll himself was an influential figure who influenced Schutz's thinking, he himself had the aim of building a scientific basis for philosophy and phenomenology in social science. Schutz's thoughts on phenomenology did not stop there, especially regarding sociology. Schutz's ideas were also continued by his students, such as Schutz himself who inherited knowledge from Husserll. Peter Berger and Luckmann, Schutz's students who could be said to shine were also briefly discussed in this book. They are both known for their work entitled The Social Construction of Reality, which is a work inspired by Schutz. Apart from the two of them, George Psathas, a Schutz student, will also be discussed briefly. Psathas himself prefers to discuss empirical studies in phenomenology which will later be useful for building knowledge about individuals in the subjective world.
	The book is very important for many people to know, because Alfred Schutz himself was an intellectual who was quite influential in the development of sociology for both the western and non-western worlds (such as Indonesia). The phenomenological study put forward by Schutz itself is a study that can be used by academics, especially sociologists to examine cases and realities in society. Indonesian sociologists and anthropologists can also apply Schutz's methodology and phenomenology studies to research Indonesian society. Indonesian academics have the opportunity to contribute to the scientific space globally to continue developing Schutz's ideas and thoughts. By reading the book, academics and readers will get inspiration from Schutz's thoughts that have been described. Indonesian academics have the opportunity to be involved in global academic activities. So that it is the right choice for academics (social science) to read and implement the knowledge that has been obtained into existing cases and realities.",TRUE,FALSE,Alfred Schutz|Phenomenology|social sciences,2021-06-13T00:03:29.995057,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-13T00:02:55.206490,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/citation/,5mkjs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c45433f3ce9402b324c5ea/,60c45433f3ce9402b324c5ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mkjs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5mkjs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5mkjs

While NPIs aim at avoiding fatalities related to COVID-19, the previous literature on their efficacy has focused on infections and on data of the first half of 2020. Still, findings of early NPI studies may be subject to underreporting and missing timeliness of reporting of cases. Moreover, the low variation in treatment timing during the first wave makes identification of robust treatment effects difficult.

Methods: To circumvent problems of reporting and treatment variation, we analyse data on daily confirmed COVID-19-related deaths per capita from Our World in Data, and on 10 different NPIs from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker for 169 countries from 1st July 2020 to 31st May 2021. To identify the causal effects of introducing NPIs on COVID-19-related confirmed fatalities per capita, we apply the generalized synthetic control (GSC) method to each NPI, while controlling for the remaining NPIs, weather conditions, vaccinations, and NPI-residualized COVID-19 cases.

Findings: We do not find substantial and consistent mitigating effects of any NPI under investigation on COVID-19-related deaths per capita. We see a tentative change in the trend of COVID-19-related deaths around 30 days after workplace closing, public transport closing, and stay at home rules have been implemented, but none of them exerts a statistically significant effect.

Interpretation: The study enhances the literature on the effectivity of NPIs with respect to the time frame, the number of countries, and the analytical approach. The results provide further guidance to judge the proportionality of NPIs.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|global public health|health policy|lockdown|non-pharmaceutical interventions,2021-06-13T00:09:24.175071,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-13T00:09:08.476678,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data|https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",Authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/citation/,v2ef8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c3879b18f70b028aa7a63a/,60c3879b18f70b028aa7a63a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2ef8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v2ef8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v2ef8

As well as knowing the philosophical ideas, how the opinions of Paulo Freire see that an uncontrolled capitalist process causes unequal education, besides this, it is associated with a system that is being in education in Indonesia. Adding to the intellectual treasures and multiplying the various thoughts on education that exist, which arise from higher education experts and education activists.
Mi'raj's book is essential to read. Of course, it is also studied in depth by various groups, especially by educational thinkers and people in the academic sphere. Discusses in-depth Paulo's thoughts on educational renewal. So that is perfect for the community, including education activists, so that later it can contribute to renewing the structural and cultural dimensions of the nation.
Information or new knowledge from the book is about educational renewal from Paulo Freire's thinking. Education is understood in the form of liberation efforts in thinking and independence in terms of thinking; formal education is not the only solution to thought implications. Not only efforts in liberating thought but also maturing oneself make it well accepted by the wider community and nation. The existence of alternatives or options per the thought input is formal but has breakthroughs, as in Freire's idea. Freire's critical alternative education model can be applied in Indonesia, which can be pursued in structural liberation, welfare, dialogue, and developing essential awareness.
          	The importance of reviewing Mi'raj's book because it can be used material in the discourse on the development or renewal of thinking from the world of education in Indonesia. With this, it is hope in the future, the revival of educational thought from Freire can dynamize the dialogue of the world of education as a whole and continuously, where the development of this thought does not stop here but will continue to advance per developments.

Phenomenological research itself is conducted by looking at the phenomena that exist around us with the aim of digging awareness in each individual. Usually, this researcher is conducted by conducting interviews with participants. Some of the figures who used this approach in his research were Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean Paul Sartre, Mauriche Marleau-Pounty, Jaques Derrida, Alfred Schutz, Peter Berger and Luckmann. The figures use phenomenological research because they can decipher or obtain clear information from a phenomenon. In addition, it also explains what stages need to be carried out in phenomenological research. The author hopes that with this book, the readers can use it as a guideline in doing real research so that they can get maximum results. 
	For readers who want to know more about phenomenological research methods, it is highly recommended to read this book because this book contains a lot of information about phenomenological research, such as the theory used by the figures, phenomenological methodology, and what steps can be done in conducting research using this approach so that it can increase the reader's knowledge about phenomenological research that will be used in the future.
	Research using phenomenological methods is not easy because, basically, phenomenology is an indisputable basis of thinking. In this research, science can be scientifically proven by using qualitative phenomenological research. Using qualitative phenomenological research, researchers created a list of questions that became important factors for expressing the feelings and experiences of an informant. So by preparing some questions, researchers will get a lot of information obtained directly from each individual. In qualitative research, logic also plays an important role. Therefore, a researcher must understand what the meaning of facts, concepts, principles, laws, hypotheses, and theories is to facilitate researchers in conducting qualitative research.

In this paper, we examine evidence for the seasonal scheduling of resource procurement and technological investment in the Oldowan. The mortality profiles, taxonomic composition, and taphonomy of the bovid assemblages at Kanjera South (Homa Peninsula, Kenya) and FLK-Zinj (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) illustrate the behavioral flexibility of Oldowan hominins, who were targeting different seasonally-vulnerable demographics. In terms of the lithic assemblages, the combined influences of high competition risks, high procurement costs, and low success rates in carcass acquisition during the dry season at FLK-Zinj may have disincentivized lithic investment, resulting in a more expedient toolkit for fast carcass processing. This pattern is reinforced by the effectiveness of unretouched flakes in defleshing tasks. In contrast, wet season plant abundance would have offered a predictable set of high-quality resources at Kanjera South, associated with low levels of competition and reduced search times. These factors appear to have fostered technological investment to reduce resource handling costs, and enhanced planning of lithic deployment throughout the landscape, as a result of more consistent net returns. While data are scarce, we also propose that the spatial patterning of Oldowan technological investment at Gona (Ethiopia) may relate to seasonal shifts in habitat availability and resource distribution. We subsequently discuss the seasonality of freshwater resources in Oldowan procurement strategies, focusing on FwJj20 (Koobi Fora, Kenya). While more analytical studies with representative sample sizes are needed, we argue that inter-assemblage differences evidence the ability of Oldowan hominins to adapt to seasonal constraints and opportunities in resource exploitation.",TRUE,FALSE,Early Pleistocene|Lithic Technology|Oldowan|Seasonality|Taphonomy|Zooarcheology,2021-06-13T11:43:23.959043,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-13T11:42:51.419112,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/citation/,q4dn8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c35373da0ff20242395274/,60c35373da0ff20242395274,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4dn8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q4dn8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q4dn8
