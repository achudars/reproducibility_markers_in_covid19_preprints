evolution of intellectual property law. As professors and practitioners in
this field know all too well, Congress and the courts continue to develop
intellectual property law and jurisprudence at a rapid pace. For that
reason, we have significantly augmented and revised ""Intellectual Property
in the New Technological Age.

The 2016 Edition reflects the following principal developments:

● Trade Secrets: Congress passed the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, one
of the most momentous changes in the history of trade secret protection. The
new law opens up the federal courts to trade secret cases, provides for ex
parte seizures of misappropriated trade secrets in “extraordinary
circumstances,” and establishes immunity for whistleblowers.

● Patents: The past several years have witnessed some of the most
significant developments in U.S. patent history — from the establishment of
the new administrative review proceedings at the Patent Office to important
shifts in patent-eligibility, claim indefiniteness, and enhanced damages at
the Supreme Court and means-plus-function claim interpretation and
infringement doctrine at the Federal Circuit. We have restructured the
patent chapter to illuminate these areas. We have also significantly
expanded coverage of design patents in response to the growing importance
of this form of protection.

● Copyrights: The Supreme Court issued important decisions addressing the
public performance right and the first sale doctrine. The past few years
also witnessed important developments in the Online Service Provider safe
harbor, fair use, and state protection for pre-1972 sound recordings. We
have also integrated the digital copyright materials into a unified
treatment of copyright law and substantially revamped the fair use section
to reflect the broadening landscape of this important doctrine.

● Trademarks: We have integrated important cases on federal registrability
of disparaging marks, merchandising rights, likelihood of confusion on the
Internet, and remedies.

● Other State Protections: We have updated material on the right of
publicity, an active and growing area. We have also reorganized the chapter

punishes willful infringers by subjecting them to treble damages. An odd
set of legal rules stemming from patent law's effort to determine what
constitutes willful infringement effectively requires companies confronted
with a patent first to obtain a written opinion of counsel and then to
disclose that opinion in court. To do that, the accused infringer will have
to waive its attorney-client privilege in virtually every case. Even worse,
the law puts the question whether an accused infringer will have to waive
privilege in the hands of the patent owner, who can send a carefully
crafted letter putting a potential defendant on notice of the patent. A
patent owner thus triggers the obligation to obtain a written opinion of
counsel without actually threatening to sue anyone. In turn, accused
infringers who are aware of these rules respond to such letters by
obtaining a sort of pseudo-legal advice that both they and their attorneys
recognize to be a construct. Both plaintiffs and defendants are playing a
costly game.

The rules of this game have perverse consequences for patent law. Some of
these consequences affect litigation - lawyers and clients who know that
the lawyer's advice will be disclosed to the other side will behave
differently, withholding information and candid advice from each other. But
other consequences extend beyond litigation. They infect pre-litigation
advice, essentially making it impossible for a competent lawyer to advise a
client that a competitor's patent should be avoided. The rules of the
willful infringement game set traps for the unwary, who may not realize the
consequences of failing to obtain the necessary written opinion of counsel.
They interfere with a client's ability to choose counsel. And they
discourage engineers and companies from reading a competitor's patents at
all, thereby undermining the disclosure function that is at the foundation
of the patent system.

One possibility is to abolish the willfulness rule entirely. We ultimately
reject this approach because we worry that ordinary patent damages alone
will be insufficient to deter infringement optimally in many cases. Another
possibility is to abolish the rule that requiring disclosure of opinions of
counsel. While a good idea, this option would not solve the problems
created by the willfulness game, because many defendants will still need to
rely on the opinion of counsel in order to disprove willfulness.

Instead, we think the better approach to willful infringement is first to
redefine it as adopting a technology with knowledge that it was derived
from the patentee, and second to adjust the premium charged for it. Many of
the problems with the willfulness rules stem from the fact that willfulness
is an ongoing inquiry. The ongoing nature of the inquiry adversely affects
a defendant that develops or adopts a technology in good faith but later
learns it is infringing a patent. Changing the focus of the inquiry to the
time of adoption is consistent with the ordinary understanding of
willfulness outside of patent law and would help end the willfulness game.
An independent developer could never be a willful infringer, and thus would
not need either to obtain or disclose in court a written opinion of counsel
merely because it later learned of a patent. By contrast, an accused
infringer would need advice of counsel if it was aware of a patent and
affirmatively sought to design around the patent. Such an accused infringer
therefore would have to waive privilege. But since only the accused
infringer's intent at the time of adoption would matter, the scope of
privilege waiver would be limited to communications at the time of
adoption, and would not infect the advice given by litigation counsel.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:08.311391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-26T19:15:17.337000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/citation/,sgkf7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wj7cu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/relationships/node/,wj7cu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c09546594d900206358a61/,57c09546594d900206358a61,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sgkf7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sgkf7

Property Rights and Collective Rights Organizations,” Rob Merges makes the
case that intellectual property (IP) owners vested with property
entitlements can and do contract away their right to an injunction when it
is efficient for them to do so. The result was to cement for many the
superiority of property over liability rules, since Merges demonstrated a
seemingly critical asymmetry between the two. Merges’s evidence suggested
that if a judge or a legislature gets the damages calculation wrong, we are
stuck with an inefficient liability rule, but that we weren’t similarly
stuck with an inefficiently-allocated property rule.

The evidence Merges brought to bear in his path-breaking article is
extremely important. But it is incomplete. True, parties can contract
around inefficient property rules in IP cases. But as I show in this paper,
they can - and do - contract around inefficient liability rules as well.

rules, but it does undermine a major premise that has been used to support

as a mental act and a competing vision that focuses on the actual building
of a working product. The definition of invention in the 1952 Patent Act
incorporates both conception and reduction to practice, sometimes choosing
the first to conceive as the inventor and at other times choosing the first
to reduce an invention to practice. But in trying to walk that middle
ground, patent law has actually discouraged inventors from getting their
inventions to work in practice, rewarding those who run to the patent
office before they are fully done with the invention and giving them
precedence over those who take the time to make sure their invention works
by building and testing it. The problem is even worse under the new America
Invents Act passed in 2011, which encourages patentees to file their
applications as soon as possible.

The fact that the law encourages inventors to file first and figure out
later how (or even if) the invention works for its intended purpose is
unfortunate. It produces underdeveloped patent applications that do not
communicate useful information to the world. It facilitates the rise of
patent trolls who obtain patents but never bother to produce a product,
instead making a business of suing those who do. And it pushes people to
patent things just in case, adding more patents into a system already
overburdened with them.

I reject proposals to go to the opposite extreme, requiring patentees to
make products. But we should not be in the position in which we currently

contribution to the creation of new products. Patents serve the social
interest if they provide not just invention, but innovation the world would
not otherwise have. Non-practicing entities (NPEs) as well as
product-producing companies can sometimes provide such innovation, either
directly, through working the patent or transfer of technology to others
who do, or indirectly, when others copy the patented innovation. The
available evidence suggests, however, that patent licensing demands and
lawsuits from NPEs are normally not cases that involve any of these
activities.

Some scholars have argued that patents can be valuable even without
