The results of these surveys can be used to shape and evaluate policing policy and practice. Yet the extant evidence base is hampered when people use different methods and where there is no common data standard. In this paper we present a set of 13 core national indicators that can be used by police services across Canada to ensure measurement quality and draw proper comparisons between regions and over time. Having identified a set of 50 survey questions through an expert consultation process, we field those items on a quota sample of 2,500 Canadians. Our analysis of the subsequent data has three stages. First, we use confirmatory factor analysis to assess scale properties. Second, we use a form of substitutability analysis to identify 13 single indicators that ‘best stand in’ for each scale. Third, we use the set of 50 and the sub-set of 13 measures to test procedural justice theory for the first time in the Canadian context. Overall, those commissioning and managing public attitudes surveys can use the 13 core indicators as a conceptually-rich and empirically-validated tool through which to understand local survey data in the context of other municipal, provincial and national data.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperation|legitimacy|measurement|police|policing|procedural justice|trust,2020-03-24T18:25:45.691644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-24T18:25:19.200210,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/citation/,fea62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7a2205d2927f003edd5d48/,5e7a2205d2927f003edd5d48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fea62/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fea62,NA

This paper investigates how the socio-economic background of learners affects their own experience and their chances of course completion. The analyses test whether learners from low socio-economic status (SES) have lower chances of completing the online course and whether participation in online discussion forums mediates the role of SES. Analyzing data from two MOOCs provided by Stanford University, we find that in both cases a negative association between low SES, course completion and course engagement is observed. Moreover, we find that forum participation has an ambiguous role, reinforcing the advantage of well-educated learners enrolled in one course, while does not have any significant effect for the other course.

It is unclear, however, exactly how public culture becomes private culture. In this paper, we provide a theoretical account of such cultural learning. We propose that neural word embeddings provide a parsimonious and cognitively plausible model of the representations learned from natural language. Using neural word embeddings, we extract cultural schemata about body weight from New York Times articles. We identify several cultural schemata that link obesity to gender, immorality, poor health, and low socioeconomic class. Such schemata may be subtly but pervasively activated in public culture; thus, language can chronically reproduce biases.

Here we conduct a global empirical test of long-standing theories from ecology, economics, and anthropology regarding potential drivers of land ownership and territoriality. Prior theory suggests that resource defensibility, subsistence strategies, population pressure, political complexity, and cultural transmission mechanisms may all influence land ownership. We applied multi-model inference procedures based on logistic regression to cultural and environmental data from 102 societies, 71 with some form of land ownership and 31 with no land ownership. We found an increased probability of land ownership in mountainous environments, where patchy resources may be more cost effective to defend via ownership. We also uncovered support for the role of population pressure, with a greater probability of land ownership in societies living at higher population densities. Our results also show more land ownership when neighboring societies also practiced ownership.

In breaking structural boundaries, consequently, the grotesque appears as deformations, aberrations, exaggerations, metamorphosis, or startling portmanteaus. Given both its nightmarish texture and the evil ingenuity of Dr. Lecter’s murders, Hannibal (NBC, 2013-15) ploughs fertile ground in putting together conceptually distant and even contradictory elements. Hence, this article explores how the aesthetic and philosophical principles of the grotesque are a pervasive presence throughout the entire Hannibal TV series, defining its style, characters’ personality and metaphorical themes. Putting art theory in dialogue with the Hannibal televised text, this article demonstrates how the grotesque – one of the key concepts in Gothic horror – permeates every level of the show, from the opening credits to the protagonist’s inner transformation, converting the narrative into a comprehensive and cohesive liminal artistic ecosystem.",TRUE,FALSE,Aesthetics|Gothic Horror|Grotesque|Hannibal|Television Studies|TV Series,2020-03-24T18:29:07.343828,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-24T18:28:38.164626,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c90|Arts and Humanities|Television|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d24|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Visual Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d26|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Other Film and Media Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/citation/,rg9de,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qpydc/,qpydc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e785c204a60a50693bb1a45/,5e785c204a60a50693bb1a45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rg9de/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rg9de,https://doi.org/10.1386/host_00012_1

Both samples—one from the mid-series episode “Stingers” (3.10.), and the other from the series finale, “START” (6.10.)—show how the protagonists, two KGB spies living undercover in the United States as a married couple with two kids, disclose their secret identity to characters with whom they have a special emotional bond: their daughter, who has become a devout Christian; and their best friend and neighbor, who happens to be a counterintelligence officer in the FBI. After exploring how identity and performance play a crucial role in the spy-thriller genre, the article investigates whether it is possible for the audience to interpret the feelings and thoughts of characters with multiple identities who excel in the art of duplicity; and whether the viewer can infer intention from performance. Following this epistemological discussion, the article then sets out to explain the sociocultural relevance and timeliness of The Americans as a text whose thematic and aesthetic concerns ultimately revolve around individual identity vis-a-vis collective allegiances and ideologies.",TRUE,FALSE,Aesthetic Criticism|Authenticity|Spy-Thriller|Television Aesthetics|Television Series|Television Studies|The Americans,2020-03-24T18:29:23.786639,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-24T18:29:07.506803,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c90|Arts and Humanities|Television|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d24|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Visual Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/citation/,2uhkp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qpydc/,qpydc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e784e190cd06c069d00531a/,5e784e190cd06c069d00531a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2uhkp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2uhkp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2uhkp,https://doi.org/10.1080/10509208.2020.1747354

A large proportion of them, perhaps around 60%, fermented at temperatures close to body temperature, according to a survey of 287 independent accounts of farmhouse brewing practices in 10 different countries. Recent genetic studies indicate that this was possible because the yeasts used in farmhouse brewing, although domesticated, were different from those used in modern brewing. Since wild yeast appears to have high temperature tolerance and modern commercial brewing arose out of earlier farmhouse brewing practices, it seems that the lack of high temperature tolerance in modern brewer’s yeast may be due to a loss of function as the yeast adapted to commercial brewing practices.",TRUE,FALSE,Beer|Brewing|Ethnography|Farmouse brewing|Yeast,2020-03-22T16:16:02.830289,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-22T16:15:43.648217,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/citation/,wmyfe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e775b7b4a60a50640bb9cb5/,5e775b7b4a60a50640bb9cb5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmyfe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wmyfe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wmyfe,NA

They can also be a source of vulnerability when cities and regions specialize in export-intensive industries. Foreign competition and technological change can threaten the survival of exporters, and shocks to these industries can have long-run effects on the communities which rely on them. In this paper, I study the impact of a rapid and large-scale trade shock: The quartz crisis, which devastated the globally dominant Swiss watch industry in the 1970s. I document the geographic agglomeration pattern of the industry and the impact of the crisis on exports, employment, and wages. Using a differences-in-differences strategy, I show that this trade shock led to a large and rapid loss of population in affected areas, and a long-run change in growth patterns. I explore the mechanisms behind this population change, including the role of manufacturing employment and immigration. I discuss the implications of these results for theories of urban growth, and contrast them with recent work on the China shock in Europe and the United States.",TRUE,FALSE,export competition|growth|quartz crisis|Switzerland|trade,2020-03-22T16:14:25.037477,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-22T16:14:03.672805,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,Tate Twinam,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/citation/,twscm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e765ac44a60a5060abb3a3f/,5e765ac44a60a5060abb3a3f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/twscm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/twscm,NA
