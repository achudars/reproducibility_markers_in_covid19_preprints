text-based Japanese version, kaomoji (""face-marks""). We analyze a corpus of CMD drawn from English and
Japanese sources at the micro-level using an approach modeled on Conversation Analysis. Japanese kaomoji were chosen because they are an understudied phenomenon in the CMD research and because they vary quite dramatically from English emoticons, in both their construction and in their variety (Katsuno &amp; Yano, 2002; Nishimura, 2003). Overall, we found that emoticons and kaomoji serve primarily as punctuating devices within text-based conversations.

in the fan productions of Star Trek fans. Fan-produced video represents an opportunity for
ordinary people to take the means of cultural production into their own hands. However, because
of its roots in an already-existing, culture industry-produced world, there may exist limits to the
amount of resistance this form of vernacular culture can provide. To explore these tensions, I
compare two fan film productions based on the popular Star Trek television and movie franchise.

in instant messenger (IM) conversations. Data were collected from 104 undergraduate students
who engaged in both task-based and social IM conversations. Although LOL was initially an
acronym for the phrase “laughing out loud,” this paper provides evidence that suggests that LOL
has become lexicalized (to lol) and can be understood as sharing characteristics typically
associated with discourse markers. Several recurring patterns of lol usage are described,
including the stand-alone lol, transmission-final lol, and transmission-initial lol. While lol was
found significantly more frequently in social vs. task conversations, but there were no broad
gender differences in lol usage. However, dyad composition (mixed-sex vs. same-sex) did

However, the operationalization of public stigma nearly always comes from an individual-level generalization of what others believe. Using data from over 60,000 students on 75 U.S. college and university campuses between 2009-2015, we contextualize public stigma by creating a school-level measure of students’ individual-level endorsed mental health treatment stigma. We present multilevel logistic regression models for 21 different dependent variables. We find that even after controlling for individual-level stigma scores, school-level stigma is negatively associated with self-reports of suicidal ideation and self-injury, although not associated with screens for depression or anxiety. Moreover, school-level stigma is negatively associated with medication use, counseling and therapy visits, and to a lesser degree, informal support.

Although this method provides strong causal evidence of racial/ethnic discrimination, these claims depend on the signal being clearly conveyed through names. Few studies have pretested individual racial and ethnic perceptions of the names used to examine discrimination. The author conducts a survey experiment in which respondents are asked to identify the races or ethnicities they associate with a series of names. Respondents are provided with combinations of Hispanic and Anglo first and last names. Hispanic first names paired with Anglo last names are least likely to be recognized as Hispanic, while all versions of Hispanic first and last names are highly recognized (≥90 percent). The results suggest that researchers must use caution when trying to signal Hispanic ethnicity in experiments, and prior findings from correspondence audits may be biased from poor signals.",TRUE,FALSE,audit|audit study|correpsondence|correspondence study|ethnicity|field experiment|names|race|survey experiment,2018-07-02T11:19:45.630637,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-30T15:44:52.438485,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/citation/,43frs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/usgq2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/relationships/node/,usgq2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f7483c9ad5a1026e11f023/,59f7483c9ad5a1026e11f023,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43frs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/43frs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/43frs,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023117737193

Are some major world religions more conducive to equality than others? This study answers these questions using country-level data assembled from multiple sources. Much of the research on religion and gender has focused on the relationship between individual religious belief and practice and gender attitudes. This study, alternatively, compares the macro effects of the proportion of religious adherents in a country on two indicators of material gender equality: the United Nations Gender Inequality Index and the Social Watch Gender Equity Index.

We find that the propulsive power of Britain’s public schools has diminished significantly over time. This is driven in part by the wane of military and religious elites, and the rise of women in the labor force. However, the most dramatic declines followed key educational reforms that increased access to the credentials needed to access elite trajectories, while also standardizing and differentiating them. Notwithstanding these changes, public schools remain extraordinarily powerful channels of elite formation. Even today, the alumni of the nine Clarendon schools are 94 times more likely to reach the British elite than are those who attended any other school. Alumni of elite schools also retain a striking capacity to enter the elite even without passing through other prestigious institutions, such as Oxford, Cambridge, or private members clubs.

Participants (N = 147) watched spontaneous and rehearsed statements of liars and truth-tellers, and indicated whether they felt lied to as well as other impressions. Whereas during spontaneous statements liars came across more deceptive than truth-tellers, during rehearsed statements this distinction disappeared; rehearsed truths looked like lies.

In this paper, I question how representations of tourist destinations color and are colored by development. Presenting the results of ethnographic fieldwork conducted on the southern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, I find that the authenticity of portrayals of place is important not for its veracity, but for the social work it performs. Authenticity is not merely socially constructed but expressive of social relations which value people and places. Tourist perceptions of the caribe sur as genuinely underdeveloped—gauged by an analysis of photos and guidebooks as well as surveys—produce an approach to resource use within the community that is limiting. Because the value of the place is its underdevelopment, development itself constrains the possibility of sustaining further growth. Ultimately, reading development via place can be a guide for critically appreciating contemporary patterns of tourism and sustainable development in the caribe sur and elsewhere.",TRUE,FALSE,authenticity|Costa Rica|place|sustainable development|tourism,2018-07-02T11:19:43.179090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T17:51:58.298562,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/citation/,2ha5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kyw9f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/relationships/node/,kyw9f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f4c2d7594d90026cd6848d/,59f4c2d7594d90026cd6848d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2ha5v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2ha5v,https://doi.org/10.1080/14616688.2012.699090

Non-profit, consumer, and government advocates are working to expand access to locally-produced foods as a way of addressing major social and ecological issues. Some activists, however, suggest that farms “scaling-up” production and distribution may lose sight of the movement's aims by circumventing a direct exchange between growing and consumer and by delivering “local” shares long distances. I argue that in order to answer whether scaling-up is misguided, we first have to understand how farms come to scale differently. I describe the varied practices that three community supported agriculture (CSA) farms in the Midwest perform in order to give their products market value as embedded in a specific socio-ecological context. I focus on three key moments of CSA that advocates are concerned about in scaling-up: 1) the employment of different kinds of labor; 2) operating within the seasons; 3) the management of sharer expectations about produce quantity and quality. As what I call commodity practice, farm decisions about these factors produce differently scaled local food commodities. These different practices are not necessarily incongruent with the aims of the movement. My main point in this approach is to advance an awareness of hybridity in local food institutions. As CSAs and other institutions like food hubs grow and evolve, a look at commodity practices can shed light on and confound some of the apparent contradictions in scaling-up.",TRUE,FALSE,commodification|Community Supported Agriculture|local food|Midwest US|scale,2018-07-02T11:19:43.144301,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T17:47:01.728209,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/citation/,jh8ac,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6w79f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/relationships/node/,6w79f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f4c190594d90026bd68440/,59f4c190594d90026bd68440,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jh8ac/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jh8ac,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2014.01.001
