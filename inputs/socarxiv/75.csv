Recent literature on framings in political discourse have re-directed attention from static models of issue ownership to more interactive models of strategic framing contests. This article proposes a robust action approach, and tests hypotheses about the dual repertoires of local action: First, we test for the presence of exploratory local action, when discourse positions are altered in response to positions by others, and second, we show evidence for the presence of role claim behavior, when a dominant discourse position is taken that silences others. Using the case of economic policy discourse in Hungary in 1997, we show how the “GDP growth” discourse position silenced opposition positions on the right, mostly built from stigmatizing frames. Discourse positions beyond the one built around growth did not silence alternative framings, but elicited discourse shifts. We coded 8632 utterances over 100 days of discourse into a two-mode network of speech acts and statements and used a two-mode blockmodeling approach to identify positions and frames. We used a pooled time series approach to test hypotheses of local action dynamics.

This paper is a conceptual study conducted with an extensive review of relevant literature on mentoring. The reviewed literature centres on meaning, forms and types of mentoring, qualities of a good mentor, stages and benefits of mentoring, challenges of mentoring, mentoring and academic excellence. This study was anchored on the descriptive mentoring theory by Kram (1985). The study found that regardless of how well a mentor and mentee fit together, either in form or in a positive way, the relationship should be professionally structured as well as considered and respected by both parties. The study also concludes that most successful mentorship usually evolve into friendship with both partners learning and providing support for each other.

It is based on a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental study employing IRCT, composed of self–study reading assignments and a structured peer-teaching project. The participants who were purposively sampled to partake in the study included 105 second- and third-year undergraduates from various faculties who were enrolled in a functional reading course, of which 46 was assigned to the control group and 49 was treated as the experimental group. One-on-one and group oral assessments were administered to both groups at the end of the course after IRCT implementation. The results showed IRCT had a very positive effect on the oral communication skills of the students in the experimental group, significantly improving their confidence and motivation toward speaking English. The students’ opinions from a questionnaire also revealed high speaking improvement, reinforced by evidence from close observations, interviews, and student work samples.

This condition illustrates that the social rehabilitation mechanism for drug abusers in Indonesia still has the opportunity to present shameless. Therefore, this study seeks to see the significance of Lifestyle-related shaming as an important part of the mechanism for implementing shaming for the shameless, especially drug relapse offenders in urban areas. This study was conducted based on the analysis of John Braithwaite's shaming theory which states that the public's response to perpetrators is divided into 2 (two) namely reintegrative shaming which means re-acceptance of the shameless by giving shame to them and stigmatization which means treating the shameless by giving a negative stigma permanently. The method used here was literature review by utilizing and trying to develop existing theories (grounded theory) by presenting concepts (variables) in accordance with the affordability of study data so as to produce new findings regarding the significance of Lifestyle-related shaming in its role for drug relapse offenders. Lifestyle-Related Shaming is part of a combination of reintegrative shaming theory, desistance theory and routine activity theory. In the literature study conducted, the combination of (3) three macro theories produces Lifestyle-related shaming which is closely related to urban lifestyle. It is expected that later, this study will be able to provide a broad understanding to the government to prepare the best program for solving shameless phenomenon, especially drug abuse in Indonesia.

As a group of 20 diseases, NTDs are typified by their prevalence among the poor, excluded, and marginalised within society. In the absence of quality healthcare provision, many NTDs lead to long term disability, disfigurement, and stigma, which in turn act to reinforce the exclusion and poverty experienced by the afflicted. The path leading to illness is often determined by a widespread lack of access to formal education, timely healthcare, adequate living conditions, employment and nutrition. The reasons for such deprivation are complicated, but ultimately reduce to a persistence of inequalities in affected regions. These inequalities can manifest differently depending on the demographic being studied: gender, ethnicity, geographic location, level of formal education, can all determine the ease with which NTDs are transmitted, diagnosed or treated. Yet, regardless of contextual differences, NTDs continue to persist because individuals within endemic regions experience a healthcare system that is, either directly or indirectly, inequitable. The healthcare system referred to in this context is not confined to simply formal healthcare settings. Rather, it encompasses local healers, community healthcare professionals or volunteers, drug administration programmes, community mental health provision, the formal education system, and, in extension, even the infrastructure that exists to physically connect individuals to their healthcare provider. Failing to ensure parity across each of these components for every citizen equates to a discriminatory healthcare system which fails to recognise the individual’s basic human right to “a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of themselves and of their family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services” (Article 25- Universal Declaration of Human Rights). To ensure NTDs are managed in a way that is sustainable in the long term, the underlying societal inequalities which allow them to persist must be first understood.",TRUE,FALSE,equality|equity|gender|gender equality|health equity|human rights|Neglected Tropical Disease|NTD|poverty|universal healthcare,2021-03-04T13:10:43.083421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T13:10:25.817193,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",Kirsty Mackinlay,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/citation/,m7kpu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040c3ca035cf70425c80956/,6040c3ca035cf70425c80956,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7kpu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m7kpu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m7kpu,NA

It uses a nationally representative survey experiment to estimate how the various components of the Green Industrial Revolution affect public support, and which policy proposals are most popular.

Executive Summary:

- The Prime Minister has recently unveiled a ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution to meet net-zero emissions targets.
- We conducted an original survey experiment to causally identify the public’s support for particular points of this plan and their overall level of support.
- Public support is increased substantially by consumer grants for electric vehicles, funding of electric public transport, planting of trees, and wind power.
- Investment in air and sea vehicles and nuclear power does not meaningfully increase the public’s support.
- An ambitious version of the Green Industrial Revolution sees majority support amongst the public, while taking no action is widely opposed.
- This ambitious version of the Green Industrial Revolution sees support across party lines, being similarly popular amongst Conservative and Labour supporters.

Thus, the quantity of information defined by units of choices, whether bits or qubits, describes that process of ordering happening in the present moment. The totality (which can be considered also as a particular or “regional” totality) turns out to be divided into two parts: the internality of the past and the externality of the future by the course of time, but identifiable to each other in virtue of scientific transcendentalism (e.g. mathematical, physical, and historical transcendentalism). A properly mathematical approach to the “totality and time” is introduced by the abstract concept of “evolutionary tree” (i.e. regardless of the specific nature of that to which refers: such as biological evolution, Feynman trajectories, social and historical development, etc.), Then, the other half of the future can be represented as a deformed mirror image of the evolutionary tree taken place already in the past: therefore the past and future part are seen to be unifiable as a mirrorly doubled evolutionary tree and thus representable as generalized Feynman trajectories. The formalism of the separable complex Hilbert space (respectively, the qubit Hilbert space) applied and further elaborated in quantum mechanics in order to uniform temporal and reversible, discrete and continuous processes is relevant. Then, the past and future parts of evolutionary tree would constitute a wave function (or even only a single qubit once the concept of actual infinity be involved to real processes).

A Spatiotemporal Analysis of the Concentration of Police Presence and Crime,"Purpose Police patrol has undergone an evidence-based and data driven transition in the beginning of the 21st century. While crime patterns are well researched, patterns of police presence are not. Despite the abundance of available GPS data, little is known about the spatiotemporal patterns of police forces. Given the paucity of evidence on where everyday policing takes place, we ask: what spatiotemporal patterns of police exist, how do these patterns change over time, and how do these correspond to local crime patterns? 
Methods Therefore, we analysed more than 77 million GPS signals from 130 police patrol cars and more than 50,000 recorded crimes from 2019.to investigate where and when police patrols are present. All data were geocoded and map matched using high performance computing.
Results We found that police, much like crime, concentrates on a small proportion of street segments and that the spatial concentration experiences temporal instability at the micro level. Further, spatiotemporal police presence and its concentration appear to be unrelated to local levels of crime and crime concentration. 
Conclusions These findings inform police chiefs and researchers alike and enable alterations of patrol deployment in order to refine the spatiotemporal focus of police on local crime. Future considerations are required to research optimal spatiotemporal alignment of police presence to effectively prevent crime.",TRUE,FALSE,GPS|hot spots|police presence|policing|tracking,2021-03-04T09:58:43.850013,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T09:57:52.786224,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/citation/,rxa8h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040a97767386c03ef61d2b8/,6040a97767386c03ef61d2b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxa8h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rxa8h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rxa8h,NA

The review also investigates concepts of police presence and differences between reported effects. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and protocols are used to systematically identify and review eligible studies on police presence. Further, quality assessment and findings synthesis are used to map limitations of current research as well as grounds for future avenues. The systematic search strategies yielded 49 studies focusing on testing the effects of police presence or evaluating its measurement. We find evidence that police presence has mostly positive effects on reducing crimes related to motor theft, property, violence, and guns. Police presence also reduces calls for service and improves traffic behaviour. Police presence focused on specific areas, times, and types of crime achieves maximum efficacy. The reviewed studies show a high degree of heterogeneity in reporting, which limits comparability of findings across studies. Research on police presence presents evidence for crime preventative effects of focused police actions. Police forces can be focused on certain areas, times, and types of crimes. We encourage future research to focus on police presence en route and its effects, including crime prevention, traffic regulation, and fear of crime.",TRUE,FALSE,crime prevention|deterrence|patrol|police presence,2021-03-04T09:59:23.029034,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T09:58:36.473596,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/citation/,ezk5f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6040a78744157503fd582d85/,6040a78744157503fd582d85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezk5f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ezk5f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ezk5f,NA
