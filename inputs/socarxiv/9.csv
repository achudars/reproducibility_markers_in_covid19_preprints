Stylised consequentialist perspectives on valuable knowledge moving from public science to society in linear and recursive pathways, whilst informative, cannot fully capture the broad spectrum of value creation possibilities. As an alternative we experiment with an approach that gathers together diverse science-society interconnections and reciprocal research-related knowledge processes that can generate valorisation. Our approach to value creation attempts to incorporate multiple facets, directions and dynamics in which constellations of scientific and societal actors generate value from research. The paper develops a conceptual model based on a set of nine value components derived from four key research-related knowledge processes: production, translation, communication, and utilization. The paper conducts an exploratory empirical study to investigate whether a set of archetypes can be discerned among these components that structure science-society interconnections. We explore how such archetypes vary between major scientific fields. Each archetype is overlaid on a research topic map, with our results showing that different archetypes correspond to distinctive topic areas.

Existing research explains the partisan climate gap through a process of manufactured doubt, with a network of corporate and conservative organizations using their considerable resources to deny the reality of climate change and its anthropogenic causes, and to spread denial of climate science among conservative and Republican voters. I argue that this explanation is incomplete and increasingly unable to address the contours of the contemporary partisan climate gap. Building on existing research in science and technology studies, environmental sociology, and political partisanship, I explore an alternative hypothesis for the partisan climate gap: distrust in science. I apply a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis to a large non-probability sample of Democrats and Republicans (n = 1808). Results show that lower levels of trust in science among Republicans explains a larger amount of the partisan climate gap than does climate science denial. Rather than being purely a product of manufactured doubt, contemporary climate partisanship is largely the product of manufactured distrust, reflecting an anti-science conservative movement that predates and extends beyond the climate change countermovement and its efforts to deny climate science. I conclude by discussing how focusing on manufactured distrust, in conjunction with manufactured doubt, can enrich the sociological study of climate change and science communication.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|partisan polarization|trust,2021-05-18T08:36:03.299193,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-18T08:35:45.823951,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,Dylan Bugden,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/citation/,k9x24,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a2ab87e2a9800017a5fa23/,60a2ab87e2a9800017a5fa23,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k9x24/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k9x24/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k9x24,NA

This paper offers an ethnographic analysis of a pilot program promoted as a “progressive” form of truancy intervention. Midvale Truancy Center claimed to focus on education, rather than punishment. In practice, however, the crime control tactics used to capture, isolate, and discipline truants often overshadowed the Center’s educational objectives, locating the Center in a liminal space between school and detention facility. The Center’s competing goals—revenue creation, truancy deterrence, and organizational survival—resulted in rehabilitation being pushed aside in favor of normalization and behavioral control. These findings illustrate a recent larger cultural turn toward control and punishment (Garland 2001), and the encroachment of crime control tactics into the civil sphere.",TRUE,FALSE,criminology|education|organizations|social control|truancy,2021-05-18T20:08:05.828997,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-18T20:07:53.119516,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/citation/,tbyze,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a2a8368b826b000a8b9cd7/,60a2a8368b826b000a8b9cd7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tbyze/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tbyze/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tbyze,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11133-010-9181-x

Because the construction of such external data is typically opaque and subject to potentially serious measurement error, it may be best not to depend exclusively on this approach.  This paper develops an alternative approach, using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), of which the simple Pareto is a subset, extending an estimation strategy developed by Castillo and Hadi [1997].  The greater flexibility of the GPD allows the possibility of modeling the tail of the wealth distribution, using a larger set of data for support than is typically the case with the simple Pareto.  Moreover, the elaboration of the estimation method presented here allows explicitly for the possibility that the extreme of the observed upper tail is measured with error or that it is not captured at all.  The approach also allows the incorporation of external data on total wealth as a constraint on the estimation.  For the applications considered here using Austrian and U.S. micro data, the model relies on an estimate of total household wealth from national accounts, rather than rich-list information.  The results suggest that where sufficiently comparable and reliable estimates of aggregate wealth are available, this approach can provide a useful way of mitigating problems in comparing distributional estimates across surveys that differ meaningfully in their effective coverage of the upper tail of the wealth distribution.  The approach may be particularly useful in the construction of distributional national accounts.

And 3) What patterns of collaboration between regions of the world are being stimulated by AI? We analyzed AI papers from 2000 to 2019 using the IEEE Xplore database by: 1) Identifying the number of AI papers that address SDGs in their titles, abstracts, and keywords. 2) Developing a composite indicator based on the number of documents produced, citation impact, and inventive impact to distinguish areas with an emerging interest in SD; 3) Exploring co-authorships at three levels: region, income group, and country. The results show that a small share of papers is explicitly focused on SD, but there is an emerging interest in Broadcast technology, Systems Engineering and Theory, Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, Sensors, and Education.

Background: The pandemic had strong repercussions on the Austrian labour market. The short-time work (STW) programme covered a third of employees in the first half of 2020 and helped to maintain employment levels. We provide evidence on how an unprecedented labour market crisis of this sort and in particular the exceptionally wide use of STW had affected the (gendered) employment situation of parents and the financial well-being of different types of families. Method: The study draws on representative panel survey data that cover 905 families with underage children. The data include information on the employment situation and financial well-being of single and cohabiting parents before the onset of the crisis, three months and ten months after its onset. Results: In contrast to other countries, mothers were not more strongly affected by the labour market crisis of 2020 than childless women or fathers. About a third of couples with underage children experienced income losses. Despite the wide use of STW and government support to families, the share of families in financial difficulties has substantially increased, especially among those with many children and single parents, many of who were at risk of poverty already before the crisis.

Most young and aspiring scientists who sucessfully complete their tertiary
education and go on to train as a PhD or doctoral student, never make it to
becoming a 'working scientist'. Most of those who do become postdocs,
never make it to becoming a tenured professor. And most of those who
become professors, never make it to becoming famous in their field,
receiving prestigeous prices or even being highly cited. Careers in science
are a trial of attrition, where only the best (or the luckiest?) prevail in the
competition for careers. Scientists themselves tend to believe, generally, that
science is a meritocracy, with the most productive being selected along these
career junctures. While there is no logical contradiction between meritocracy
and competitivity and while many scientists believe that the meritocraticideal explains and justifies the high competitivity sufficiently, there is at least
some ambivalence. Robert K. Merton (1973) noted the general ambivalence
that results from the interplay between the normative structure and the
reward system in science. Since then it is not just the increased competitivity
and the rising inequalities, that have changed; more importantely, it is the
way visibility regimes have been changing over the last 20 years, mainly due
to digital communication, that has forced scientists to acknowledge the
ambivalence inherent in the meritocratic narrative. This essay is an attempt
to explore this ambivalence, which, as of yet, has no ready-made description.A first way of describing this ambivalence may start from a series of
first-person accounts, empirical research results, and theoretical insights, that
come from an emerging literature on the subject. Science as an “engine of
anxiety” (Espeland and Sauder, 2016; Fochler, Felt and Müller, 2016),
“imposter syndrome” (Loveday, 2018; Grey, 2020; Keogh, 2020), “publish-
or-perish” (Dalen and Henkens, 2012; Rijcke et al., 2016), or just
“ambivalence” (Flink &amp; Simon 2014) are some of the terms used to describe
a perceived shift in research cultures, where meritocracy and competitivity
have lost balance. This literature refers to processes of quantification
(Desrosières, 1998), medialization (Weingart, 1999), projectification (Torka,
2009, 2018; Franssen et al., 2018), or to significant shifts from block
funding to temporary and third-party-funding. The result of these
overlapping and sometimes mutually reinforcing processes is felt by
individual researchers as a source of anxiety, leading to feelings of
inadequacy, and, ultimately, to the belief that science may be more of a
lottery than a meritocracy (Loveday, 2018; Reinhart and Schendzielorz,
2020). It is easy to dismiss these feelings as the reactions of those who have
lost out in the competition for recognition. That would, however, be
premature for two reasons. First, these feelings may still be a reaction to a
shift in research cultures, irrespective of whether this reaction is deemed
adequate or not. Second, these feelings and beliefs have become a relevant
force in movements and policy initiatives that push for such diverse goals as
more reproducibility of research results, more gender equality and diversity
in academia, or more careful use of quantitative indicators in the (self-
)governance of science. To address these issues, my argument in this essay will ,first, describe the ambivalence in a current understanding of science both as competitive
and meritocratic, by relating it to changes in scientific visibility regimes.
Second, I will briefly discuss the theoretical concepts that emerge from such
a description, mainly 'visibility', 'background emotions', and 'digital selves'.
Third, I will lay out one strategy that highly visible individual scientists
seem to employ, to deal with the ambivalence of these new visibility
regimes. Finally, forth, I will discuss what the ensuing politics in science
might be, that result collectively from such individual strategies. The
argument will result in a paradox: The current visibility regime in science, resulting from digital communication and online platforms, leads to
excitement among scientists over the possibilities for attaining
hypervisibility. Increasingly, however, the excitement of fashioning digital
selves is taken over by anxiety over being exposed to the possibility of
negative, reputation threatening attention. Pardoxically, anticipating and
preventing such a possibility leads to even more vigorous fashioning of
digital selves, for which the open science movement provides the most
suitable policy narrative. In short: to protect themselves from the possible
negative effects of visibility, scientists push for more visibility; while
becoming fatalistic about their careers and about science policy.",TRUE,FALSE,academic careers|digital selves|meritocracy|open science|scholarly publishing|visibility,2021-05-18T08:21:20.992615,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-18T08:20:43.477866,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/citation/,2vr7j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a231fd1521de00e8175283/,60a231fd1521de00e8175283,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vr7j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2vr7j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2vr7j,NA

Our analysis uses unique datasets from the International Organization for Migration and Gallup World Polls. We find that refugees are positively self-selected with respect to human capital, as are female irregular migrants. Male irregular migrants are negatively self-selected. These patterns hold whether analyzing individually stated main reason to emigrate, country-level conflict intensity, or sub-regional conflict intensity. Several additional analyses show that our results are unlikely to be driven by omitted variable bias or liquidity constraints.

This review argues for the literature’s emerging cumulative cohesiveness and for its value as a source of concepts and problems for researchers exploring organizational behavior, organizational complexity, knowledge and innovation, organizational justice, and leadership. By mapping the literature onto the elements of the source model, the review induces several constructs that – though requiring integration and development – outline a distinctive conception of organization: the collective exercise of moral sense is necessarily coterminous with decision and policy making; information and formal structures and practices arise out of it, as opposed to forming its context; the core concern of management is the functionality of the socio-material networks in which it unfolds. After defining several integrative and developmental research questions and locating the roots of the literature’s variety in the specificities of the economies of worth’s interdisciplinary translation, the review concludes by proposing a research approach based on four epistemological and methodological shifts that retains the model’s core assumptions but moves beyond its special conceptual confines and uses more general tools.",TRUE,FALSE,Decision making|Economies of worth|Literature review|Management|Moral competence|Organizational behavior|Preprint,2021-05-18T08:21:25.100087,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-18T08:21:12.068184,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Alfredo Grattarola,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/citation/,bu5n2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a218fa3b0d2c00e373015c/,60a218fa3b0d2c00e373015c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu5n2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bu5n2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bu5n2,NA
