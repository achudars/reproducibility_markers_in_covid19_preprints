Contrary to the dominant paradigm of civil-military relations in the West, civil-military relations in Vietnam follow a very different logic, that of the Leninist system. The relationship between the military and the party-state in Vietnam is characterized by mutual embeddedness. This is not a zero-sum game as the concept of civilian control implies. In the Leninist system, the military's politicization, political influence and involvement in politics are critical for the Communist Party's hegemony. The Party's absolute, direct, and comprehensive control of the military is the core of civil-military relations in the Leninist system. However, Party control is a reciprocal relationship that gives military leaders more say and more privileges than they would have under more democratic conditions. This reciprocity explains the system’s endurance as well as its internal stability. The Vietnam People's Army is deeply politicized and the political control of the military serves the interests of both the Party and the military leadership. Barring a major political reform in the Vietnam Communist Party itself, the Vietnam People's Army will remain more political than professional and commercial.",TRUE,FALSE,Civil-military relations|Vietnam|Vietnamese Politics,2021-02-20T23:39:44.669796,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-20T23:39:16.467881,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Military and Veterans Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Defense and Security Studies",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/citation/,4a9z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60316ca64ad52e021e6e180d/,60316ca64ad52e021e6e180d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4a9z7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4a9z7,NA

Class-Biased Economic Reporting in the United States,"There is substantial evidence that voters’ choices are shaped by assessments of the state of the economy and that these assessments, in turn, are influenced by the news. But how does the economic news track the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality? Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of U.S. news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households, with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further, we present evidence that this “class bias” emerges not from pro-rich journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the media’s focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the relationship between economic growth and distribution.

This paper investigates relationships between gendered differences in language use and socioeconomic status and age factors of such use. It specifically examines how Kui minority language use and competence are conditioned by gender and discusses potential reasons for this variation by examining gendered language awareness and sociolinguistic attitudes. Moreover, it discusses whether societal role expectations in collectivistic cultures influence the model of linguistic change and if women in the Kui society function as “leaders of linguistic change,” as represented in Labov’s sociolinguistic model. The findings reveal current Kui-speaking preferences and give predictions on prospective language use, which is a stable situation of multilingualism whereby current Kui speakers continue to socialize and teach the language to prospective Kui speakers. The results confirm the applicability of Labov’s model; however, the unique characteristics of Kui’s linguistic situation indicate a need to adapt the model to account for cultural differences in collectivistic non-western societies.",TRUE,FALSE,gender variation|gener and language use|linguistic awareness|linguistic change|minority language|multilingualism|social networks|socioeconomic status and language use,2021-02-20T19:19:04.411139,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-20T19:18:53.698929,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e06|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Other Linguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e12|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Interpersonal and Small Group Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction",Dr. Stefanie Siebenhütter,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/citation/,7ap3q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6030f4e934d30401efe3ae6d/,6030f4e934d30401efe3ae6d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ap3q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7ap3q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7ap3q,NA

economic structure, population and economic growth have impacted energy intensity and
productivity. Thus, the paper provides a first approximation to the long-term relationship between
economic growth and energy utilisation in Mexico. The period 1880- 1920 saw both growths in
population and income increase energy consumption, the period 1921-1960 is mostly driven by

A validated questionnaire was the main instrument used for data collection, with reliability properties meeting the internal consistency criteria.

The understanding provided by the majority of modern scholars differs from the one provided in the era preceding the colonial age. So much so that riba al nasa’a which is a primary type of riba has been grossly misunderstood as interest whereas it is a kind of riba al fadl; the other primary type of riba. Not only has this but the concept of riba has been usually discussed in isolation that has led to confusion among scholars and students alike. Such understanding has also resulted in a multibillion-dollar Islamic finance industry that is mired with suspicion and increasingly visible convergence with traditional finance. This article is based on the classical understanding of riba and places its concept into its larger context and compares and differentiates it from other components of the framework of exchange. Under Islamic Law (Shariah) an equivalent exchange is without temporal, corporal, or incorporeal excess as well as deficit caused by either party to each other or third parties. Whereas profit and loss are the differences between two equivalent exchanges, riba and deficit are differences between unequal and equivalent exchanges. As per the definition of riba, the absence of a counter value against the inflicted excess makes the exchange unequal.

RCTs are meant to be governed by the three principles laid out in the Belmont Report, but often violated them, e.g. when local laws are flouted. In other cases, the framework of the Belmont Report itself has proved inadequate: for instance, when there are unintended outcomes or adverse events for which no-one is held accountable. Primarily using RCTs conducted in India, this paper highlights eight areas of concern. RCTs also have a disproportionate influence on shaping research agendas and on policy. Though ethical issues have been raised, there has been little engagement from the RCT community – a manifestation of its power in the profession. As current safeguards (such as oversight by Institutional Review Boards) have failed to protect human subjects, the concluding section discusses possible ways to resolve these issues.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-20T19:13:59.808794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-20T19:13:22.263241,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/citation/,fgxun,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60307deb4ad52e01cd6e8fa7/,60307deb4ad52e01cd6e8fa7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxun/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fgxun/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fgxun,NA

I argue that most examples of ‘doing’ critical mapping tend to fall into one of two camps with very different manifestations, goals and assumptions, whether from Donna Haraway’s invocation of – and desire to counteract – what she calls the “god trick”, or from the spirit of “strategic positivism” advocated by the geographer Elvin Wyly. The rest of the paper argues, however, that these two positions are not mutually exclusive, and that practitioners of critical mapping need not choose between the twin imperatives of destabilizing our understanding of the objectivity of cartographic knowledge and taking advantage of such a pervasive understanding in order to produce a more socially and spatially just world. Instead, I argue that it is possible to simultaneously use maps to prove that inequality exists, while also demonstrating that the ways we conventionally think about such inequalities through maps are insufficient to understand the complex realities of the processes that we are mapping. Using examples from my own research on mapping the relational geographies of vacant and abandoned properties in Louisville, Kentucky, I demonstrate one possible example of what such an approach to situated mapping might look like.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-19T22:50:25.048217,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T22:50:11.728135,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/citation/,8zswy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6030357c34d30401b8e3c357/,6030357c34d30401b8e3c357,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zswy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8zswy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8zswy,NA

MEASURING DISABILITY CROSS- NATIONALLY IN CENSUS DATA,"Despite established recommended standard definitions, measures, and methods by the UN Washington Group on Disability Statistics and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to assess dimensions of disability, national censuses vary widely in the questions used to identify people with disabilities. Although many seek to conform ex-ante to ICF definitions, they also deviate from this basic framework in different ways. This complicates ex-post harmonization and standardization for cross-national comparisons of disability prevalence and outcomes influenced by disability status, such as labor market participation. Addressing these issues, this study uses IPUMS International Census microdata since 2,000 to examine disability mea- surement across 65 countries. We find that definitions, terminology, measurement, and instructions to both respondents and enumerators matter for understanding disability prevalence cross-nationally. For instance, questions that included potentially stigmatizing language were associated with lower rates of disability reporting, but questions that listed specific limitations were associated with higher rates. Beyond disability, our findings also speak more broadly to ongoing challenges in survey harmonization for cross-national comparison.",TRUE,FALSE,Census|Cross-National|Disability|Harmonization|IPUMS|Measurement|Surveys,2021-02-19T22:50:23.931023,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T22:49:51.012636,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://international.ipums.org/international/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",David Pettinicchio,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/citation/,j2uzp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603033ed88ea1a01bdeecacf/,603033ed88ea1a01bdeecacf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j2uzp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j2uzp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j2uzp,https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smaa046
