In this paper, we use the framework of institutional logics as an analytical lens and scheme to understand the fundamental institutional challenges prompted by the advent of the online gig economy. We view gig-economy platforms as corporations that organize and self-regulate markets. In doing so, they span two parallel markets: the market for platforms competing to provide intermediation services and the market for the self-employed competing on platforms to provide peer-to-peer services. Self-regulation by platforms also weakens the traditional roles of the state. While the corporation and market logics empower the platform, they weaken self-employed suppliers as platforms' design constrain suppliers to grow into a fully-fledged business by limiting their entrepreneurial freedom. At the same time, current labor law generally does not classify suppliers as employees of the platform company, which limits the possibility to unionize. The current resolutions to this institutional misalignment are sought in ""band aid solutions"" at the level of sectors. Instead, as we argue, macro-institutional reform may be needed to re-institutionalize gig work into established institutional logics.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-26T01:17:05.970491,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T01:16:46.898127,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Koen Frenken|Taneli Vaskelainen|Lea Fünfschilling|Laura Piscicelli,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/citation/,uqn9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cyz6u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/relationships/node/,cyz6u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd22ee18b330000162101ed/,5bd22ee18b330000162101ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uqn9v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uqn9v

Skills produce external goods while habits and virtues produce internal goods, though in distinct ways, with virtues more related to a specific vision of the good and habits more open to different forms of growth. A distinction between these three forms of practice—skills, habitus, and virtues—can help sociologists recognize and study different forms of goods in schools, better empowering them to examine alienation and the relationship between power and morality.

In particular, what studies have been performed generally rely on the reproduction of aggregate statistics, rather than being based on individual-level data. 
The objective of this study is to (a) identify the extent to which registration is complete in a part of the historical Russian region of Bessarabia for the period 1833-1885 and, then, (b)  identify trends of IMR in a part of the historical Russian region of Bessarabia for the period 1833-1885. The study utilises church records of births (N=21,984) and deaths (N=7,194) from the German colony of Glückstal, a village near modern-day Grigoriopol in Transnistria (Moldova). Three methods of calculating IMR are performed. While there appears to be a significant degree of under-reporting of births which is inconsistent over time as well as gaps in the data more generally, it is possible to account for much of this through adjustment post linkage. After accounting for this, a linked net IMR can be generated. The range over the period is around 100- 190, with some periods of crisis mortality. These figures are lower than has been reported for the region. The comparison of different methods of calculating IMRs suggest that birth registration may be incomplete, however. This means that nominative linkage is required to derive accurate rates and other statistics. The findings challenge the widely held view of very high IMRs across the Russian Empire in the nineteenth century. By utilising appropriate methods, this analysis suggests that such colony church records may represent a valuable source for further analysis of this neglected period in Russian demographic history.",TRUE,FALSE,19th century|infant mortality|Moldova|mortality|population|Russian Empire,2018-10-26T13:15:25.564986,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T13:15:06.868205,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/citation/,x6vde,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/64n3c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/relationships/node/,64n3c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd16ce2cce43e001777efb9/,5bd16ce2cce43e001777efb9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x6vde/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x6vde

Sustainability research pioneer Donna Meadows has thus called the power to transcend mind sets or paradigms out of which a system arises the most potent leverage point for interventions. One barrier to such interventions is the colonization of the imaginary by capitalism, the root cause of environmental destruction and addiction to economic growth. Latouche argues as part of the debate on degrowth that the colonized Western imaginary must thus be decolonized. In this paper, we ask how this might be achieved and propose (re)introducing human traditions of seeking knowledge that transcend established Western norms and conventions. Drawing upon concrete examples, we describe four types of decolonizers and how they might help decolonize Western imaginaries: 1) Future generations; 2) past generations; 3) non-humans, and 4) spiritual beings and concepts.

On the basis of evidence from literature review and an exploratory survey of 8 European countries, we investigate European CE through the lens of Social Innovation (SI). Broadly, three main phases of SI in CE can be identified. The environmental movements of the 1960s and the “oil shocks” of the 1970s provided the catalyst for a series of innovative societal responses around energy and self-sufficiency. These first wave CE innovations included cooperatives (e.g. in Sweden and Germany) who financed and managed risks for RE developments in the absence of support from governments and banks. A second wave of SI relates to the mainstreaming of RE and associated government support mechanisms. In this phase, with some important exceptions, successful CE initiatives were mainly confined to those countries where they were already embedded as innovators in the previous phase. In former communist countries of central and eastern Europe (Poland, former East Germany) CE development was hindered by societal mistrust of cooperative movements for their association with the state socialism of the past. In Scotland, UK, strong public support was given to CE, and a new form, the Community Development Trust, emerged and was later replicated elsewhere in the UK.
The third phase of CE innovation relates to the societal response to the Great Recession that began in 2007-8 and lasted most of the subsequent decade.  Though climate change had become a pressing concern, CE initiatives formed around this time were also strongly focused around democratization of energy and citizen empowerment in the context of rising energy prices, a weak economy, and a production and supply system dominated by excessively powerful multinational energy firms.  CE initiatives today are more diverse than at any time previously, and though seriously constrained by mainstream energy policy in most countries, are likely to continue to act as incubators for pioneering initiatives addressing virtually all aspects of energy.",TRUE,FALSE,community energy|cooperative|crisis|energy democracy|grassroots|participation|renewable energy|social innovation,2018-10-24T18:48:45.176447,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-24T18:45:20.273281,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/citation/,hswzg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6bhk9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/relationships/node/,6bhk9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd0815c64dabd001d5dce30/,5bd0815c64dabd001d5dce30,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hswzg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hswzg

Causal Evidence from Great Britain,"Parents with better-educated children are healthier and live longer, but whether there is a causal effect of children’s education on their parents’ health and longevity is still unclear. Previous research has been largely associational and was thus not able to account for all circumstances that confound children’s education and parental longevity. First, we demonstrate an association between adults' offspring education and parental mortality in the 1958 British birth cohort study, which remains substantial - about two additional years of life - even when only comparing parents with similar socio-economic status. Second, we use the 1972 educational reform in England and Wales, which increased the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16 years, to identify the presence of a causal effect of children’s education on parental health and longevity using census-linked data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS-LS). Results reveal that children’s education has only very limited causal effects on a wide range of outcomes related to parental mortality and health.

Recent literature suggests that educational gradients in health are particularly dependent on contextual environments; higher-level social features, such as state of residence, have indeed been shown to modify how advanced educational credentials matters to well-being. To add resolution to this emerging insight, this study examines how \neighborhood environments, an especially salient level of geographic organization, impact educational gradients in the US. Using data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Study (n = 3,105) and Bayesian multilevel regression models, I examine how educational disparities in self-rated health and depressive symptomatology, between college and non-college degree holders, grow/shrink in response to a neighborhood-provided resource and with exposure to a neighborhood-level health challenge. Findings suggest that how tightly coupled a college degree is with well-being is strongly contingent upon one's immediate external risks, but less so on one's access to neighborhood social resources.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian multilevel models|educational health disparities|neighborhood context|population health,2018-10-23T21:57:01.971380,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-23T19:50:46.972263,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Michael H.

their existence over time (e.g., Mount &amp; Garcia Martinez, 2014; Nonaka &amp; von Krogh, 2009;
Von Krogh, 2012). Recently, organizations typically strive to create new knowledge by setting
up social media platforms (Razmerita, Kirchner, &amp; Nabeth, 2014). Hence, there is growing
scholarly interest in the role of social media, i.e. digital technologies of the Web 2.0 generation
(Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2017) in collaborative knowledge endeavors (Hemsley &amp; Mason, 2013;
Kallinikos &amp; Tempini, 2014; Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2016; Neeley &amp; Leonardi, 2018; Voigt &amp;
Ernst, 2010; Wagner, Vollmar, &amp; Wagner, 2014).
Yet, the majority of social media studies focuses on knowledge sharing (e.g., Majchrzak, Faraj,
Kane, &amp; Azad, 2013; for recent overviews, see Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2016; Panahi, Watson, &amp;
Partridge, 2013). In particular, scholars highlight that social media facilitate knowledge sharing
behavior in organizations in a unique manner due to their unique affordances, i.e., the
“perceptions of an objects’ utility” (Treem &amp; Leonardi, 2012, p. 145), which cover visibility,
editability, persistence, and association for the ‘object’ social media (Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2015;
Treem &amp; Leonardi, 2012). These scholars further speculate that the affordances of social media
might also contribute to knowledge creation (Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2017).",TRUE,FALSE,knowledge creation|social media,2018-10-23T13:28:21.211293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-23T13:18:16.025848,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/citation/,w7sd6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pm9sn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/relationships/node/,pm9sn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bcedebfab09bf001a9d2fde/,5bcedebfab09bf001a9d2fde,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w7sd6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w7sd6
