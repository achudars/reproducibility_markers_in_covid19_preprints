The effects of these negative experiences are known. They can lead to depression, suicidal ideation, lowered earning potential, and a range of other negative outcomes. Also known are the effects of diversity on a college campus. These outcomes are positive for all members of the campus community. This is why it is incumbent on universities to provide safe, inclusive, and diverse campus communities.
The present results make clear that LGBTQ students at USM do not find themselves subject to a supportive and inclusive environment. They are almost twice as likely to become the victim of assault or harassment on campus as their counterparts. They report hearing negative comments from staff, administrators, and other students more often than their counterparts. They witness threatening behavior more often, particularly with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity. That experience isn’t unique to LGBTQ students, though. Across all students sampled, 1 in 5 report witnessing threatening behavior on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity at least somewhat often on the USM campus. Although nearly 4 in 10 students surveyed agreed that a diverse and inclusive campus environment was a factor in deciding which college to attend, LGBTQ students surveyed were less likely to find the USM campus inclusive and committed to diversity.
These results present a clear picture of a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to serve the university’s LGBTQ students and create an inclusive campus environment despite budget shortfalls and a difficult political/cultural environment in Mississippi for LGBTQ issues. The opportunity is that there is already much work going on at USM to create just such an environment, and that diversity and inclusion may lead to increases in recruitment and retention, particularly among LGBTQ students.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.864838,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T18:03:17.654985,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education,Research Initiative on Social Justice and Equity,2014,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/citation/,wujkn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j8whb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/relationships/node/,j8whb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d46b86b219000f8aed45/,5a26d46b86b219000f8aed45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wujkn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wujkn,NA

They report experiencing discrimination, harassment, assault, and negative experiences with public official, among others. These experiences with bias and discrimination begin early on, with pervasive issues in the K-12 schooling system, and continue through college and university settings. In adult life, LGBT Mississippians experience workplace bias and discrimination, medical stigma, difficulty accessing medical care, and public bias and harassment. All of these experiences take a toll, resulting in a number of negative outcomes. These include depression, suicidal thoughts, lowered academic outcomes, lowered ability to perform at the job, and lower overall physical health. However, these experiences can be lessened and negative effects mitigated.
Diversity resolutions, nondiscrimination policies, and nondiscrimination ordinances make a real and positive difference in the lives of LGBT people.

Data were collected from 161 SANE nurses from 23 SANE organizations across the central and west United States through standardized tools and a demographic questionnaire. Both personality, namely agreeableness, and workplace characteristics, particularly perceived empowerment and job satisfaction, combine to predict intention to leave the job of these sampled SANE nurses. One particularly curious finding is the positive prediction of agreeableness on turnover intention – that is, the more agreeable people would be more likely to leave their jobs as SANE nurses. Professionals can gain insight from the path analysis results that show the need to address both personal and organizational factors in mitigating turnover intention among SANE nurses.

Guided by an open-systems perspective and functional (Ballantine &amp; Roberts, 2007) and expectancy-value (Eccles, 2005; Eccles, 2007) theories, we focused on school related socialization processes and the role of parents and teachers in shaping children’s abilities and skills. Participants included 153 children from 23 rural, Oklahoma schools and provided matched sets of parent, teacher, and child surveys. Weisgram and Bigler’s (2006) science self-efficacy subscale organized survey items where wording changes allowed parallel parent and teacher versions of the scale. Achievement was determined by test scores on the state-administered Oklahoma Core Curriculum Tests (OCCT). Results showed teachers’ expectancy for children’s success in science did not significantly predict students’ fifth grade science achievement. However, regression analyses showed parents’ expectancy did predict students’ fifth grade science achievement. The relationship was statistically significant and explained about 19% of the variance in fifth grade science achievement test scores (R2 = .19). We further determined that children’s science self-efficacy significantly influenced science achievement scores (β = .20) (however this was a far weaker influence than the direct effect of parents’ expectancy (β = .38) of children’s success in science). The novel finding is that parents have an influence on children’s achievement over and above children’s own self-efficacy beliefs about science. Clearly, parents matter when it comes to science achievement. Though it seems parents are more influential than teachers when it comes to children’s own expectations and achievement success in elementary science, we encourage further consideration of parent expectancy as it relates to child ability and achievement, modified classroom strategies, and home-school relations to better align teachers’ positive influence on children’s expectancy for success.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.685583,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:52:26.142454,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Journal of Research on Science Teaching,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/citation/,p6na5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8gu4b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/relationships/node/,8gu4b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d171b42121000c163319/,5a26d171b42121000c163319,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6na5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p6na5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p6na5,https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21382

In the present study, a multi-staged experiment was undertaken to expand the work in implicit racial
bias by using a similar research design focused on sexual orientation. We attempted to elicit sexual orientation identification one-word changes (wife, partner, or husband to refer to significant other) in graduate school admission essays and investigated differences in
participants’ ratings of those essays on a number of relevant dimensions. Results indicate that essays referring to a partner or husband were perceived as more feminine/less masculine and more gay/less straight versus those referring to a wife. We also found that the essays mentioning the partner or husband were rated as being a poorer “fit” to the university versus those referring
to a wife. These results have implications for research, as this introduces a useful research paradigm for LGBTQ work, and for practice as it highlights the ways that single-word variations can elicit sexual subjectivities and impact subsequent decisions about admissions and fit.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.571555,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:58:55.234917,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/citation/,zkquv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2nh7k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/relationships/node/,2nh7k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26cf2686b219000e8aeb89/,5a26cf2686b219000e8aeb89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkquv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zkquv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zkquv,https://doi.org/10.1037/sgd0000136

In a sample of 1,496 undergraduate students (600 men, 891 women, 5 gender unreported; M age = 20.6 yr., SD = 3.2), the AGQ-R was subjected to an exploratory factor analysis that suggested three factors. Then, in a different sample of 1,125 undergraduate students (270 men, 750 women, 5 gender unreported; M age = 21.7 yr., SD = 5.4), the measure was subjected to a confirmatory factor analysis, in which a three-factor solution, again, showed the best fit to the observed data.

According to the
Five Factor Model, personality can be understood in terms of openness, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Ross, Canada, and Rausch (2002) found lower
conscientiousness predicted higher self-handicapping. However, their study was limited by the
use of concurrent data. As a result, the purpose of this study was to 1) replicate the findings of
Ross, Canada, and Rausch (2002) in predicting self-handicapping from conscientiousness and
neuroticism, and 2) extend on those findings by cross-validating the prediction equation in a
longitudinal sample. The results essentially replicated the findings of Ross, Canada, and Rausch
(2002), and demonstrated the relationship between personality and self-handicapping tendencies
was stable over a one-semester timeframe.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.498178,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:56:56.309495,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Personality and Social Contexts,Personality and Individual Differences,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/citation/,rb4s7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/phtm4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/relationships/node/,phtm4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26ce6eb42121000d162dd7/,5a26ce6eb42121000d162dd7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rb4s7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rb4s7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rb4s7,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2013.04.010
