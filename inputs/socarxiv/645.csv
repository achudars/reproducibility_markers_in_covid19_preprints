One particular aim of this study is to help second-year students at Sétif 2 University (Algeria) reduce subject-verb (S-V) disagreement and run-ons in their writing. Ten students took part in this study; they wrote 120 drafts, and were provided with teacher’s oral feedback on their written compositions at the editing stage. Corpora of students’ compositions were examined and instances of errors were counted before each conferencing session for four weeks. The findings reveal that the participants successfully show progress in grammatical accuracy over time to reach elimination for Subject-Verb disagreements and a significant reduction for run-ons.",TRUE,FALSE,accuracy|feedback|grammar correction|teacher-student conferencing|writing,2018-07-02T10:55:08.950808,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T04:55:38.867892,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/citation/,n3kvj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fyx2s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/relationships/node/,fyx2s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5c94e9ad5a100456bd314/,58e5c94e9ad5a100456bd314,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3kvj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n3kvj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n3kvj

Using Google Scholar with the exact topics as search terms, 50 research reports were obtained. The results obtained from the critical analysis of the methodologies used in these reports are discussed in this review. Most studies were on power distance and individualism/collectivism dimensions of culture. A large number of conceptual frameworks and as many as 121 measurement instruments have been proposed by different workers. Research approach in any particular study is determined by the framework and the instrument chosen or self-developed instruments. Surveys and interviews are more commonly used. Not estimating internal consistency or reliability tests in some works makes it difficult to judge the validity of the method of data analysis. Generally the sample size is in the range of 200-500 participants in surveys. Small sample sizes used in a few works may affect the validity and applicability of their findings. It is concluded that large groups of scientists doing a common research programme across several countries is better than individual researches. Meta-analyses are also superior to individual researches. Such methods ensure validity and replicability of the findings.

Multiple resources can be placed on a site easily accessible 24/7 and computer mediated communication in various forms can supply needed human interaction spaces. But how are these sites used by the local students? Following the path of several individuals in detail can allow more understanding and depth of the precise usage of space.
This paper tracks two Arab students exploring and using a newly formed online self-access centre (SAC) for writing or online writing lab (OWL) for the best part of a semester. As an exploratory action research study, it was data driven and multiple data sources were mainly unobtrusive so that the study could proceed very naturally. The choices, learning style, autonomy types and personality differences between the two students suggest a range of support is ideal in an online SAC to cater for individuals in this context, including resources, how to learn, 1-1 asynchronous with advisor (emails), forums, electronic writing raters, and a high profile test.

Examining Object-Relations in a Postwork Society.,"In this article we look at repair as an emergent focus of recent activism in affluent societies, where a number of groups are reclaiming practices of repair as a form of political and ecological action. Ranging from those that fight for legislative change to those groups who are trying to support ecological and social change through everyday life practices, repair is beginning to surface tensions in everyday life and as such poses opportunities for its transformation. We survey a few of
the practices that make up this movement in its various articulations, to take stock of their current political import.
While we suggest that these practices can be seen as an emergent lifestyle movement, they should not be seen as presenting a unified statement. Rather, we aim to show that they articulate a spectrum of political positions, particularly in relation to the three specific issues of property, pedagogy and sociality. These three dimensions are all facets of current internal discrepancies of repair practices and moreover express potential bifurcations as this movement evolves. Drawing on a diverse methodology that includes discourse analysis and participant observation, we suggest some of the ways in which this growing area of activity could play a significant role in resisting the commodification of the everyday and inventing postwork alternatives.",TRUE,FALSE,commons|feminist pedagogy|object-relations|postwork|property|repair,2018-07-02T10:55:08.647101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-05T11:33:04.599623,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/citation/,7um9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3mevh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/relationships/node/,3mevh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e4d4be9ad5a1022ff4d307/,58e4d4be9ad5a1022ff4d307,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7um9v/,https://doi.org/10.1080/09502386.2017.1298638,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7um9v

The dual nature of networks creates a challenge – if the observed network ties are a single random draw, is it realistic to expect that diffusion only follows the observed network ties?  This study takes a first step towards integrating these two perspectives by introducing a social space diffusion model.  In the model, network ties indicate positions in social space, and diffusion occurs proportionally to distance in social space.  Practically, the simulation occurs in two parts.  First, positions are estimated using a statistical model (in this example, a latent space model).  Then, second, the predicted probabilities of a tie from that model – representing the distances in social space – or a series of networks drawn from those probabilities – representing routine churn in the network – are used as weights in a weighted averaging framework.  Using longitudinal data from high school friendship networks, I explore the properties of the model.  I show that the model produces smoothed diffusion results, which predict attitudes in future waves 10% better than a diffusion model using the observed network, and up to 5% better than diffusion models using alternative, non-model-based smoothing approaches.",TRUE,FALSE,social networks,2018-07-02T10:55:08.511477,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-04T20:14:54.418604,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/citation/,cgftk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2phst/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/relationships/node/,2phst,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e3fe40b83f69023611390f/,58e3fe40b83f69023611390f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cgftk/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0081175018820075,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cgftk

Turkish nationalism has long been an enigma for scholars interested in the formation of national identity. The nationalist movement that succeeded in crafting the Republic of Turkey relied upon rhetoric that defined the nation in explicitly secular, civic, and territorial terms. Though the earliest scholarship on Turkish nationalism supported this perspective, more recent research has pointed to Turkey's efforts to homogenize the new state as evidence of the importance of ethnicity, and particularly religion, in constructing Turkish national identity. Yet this marked mismatch between political rhetoric and politics on the ground is perplexing. If Turkey was meant to be a secular and civic state, why did Turkish nationalist policies place such a heavy emphasis on ethnic and religious purity? Moreover, why did religious identity become such a salient characteristic for determining membership in the national community and for defining national identity? This article draws upon historical research and social identity complexity theory to analyze this seeming dichotomy between religious and civic definitions of the Turkish nation. I argue that the subjective overlap between religious and civic ingroups during the late Ottoman Empire and efforts by nationalists to rally the populace through religious appeals explains the persistence of religious definitions of the nation despite the Turkish nationalist movement's civic rhetoric, and accounts for much of the Turkish state's religiously oriented policies and exclusionary practices toward religious minorities in its early decades.",TRUE,FALSE,Islam in Turkey|Minorities|Nationalism|Religion|Social Identity|Social Identity Complexity|Turkey,2018-07-02T10:55:08.480022,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-04T19:50:56.192708,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c89|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c8e|Arts and Humanities|Race, Ethnicity and Post-Colonial Studies|Ethnic Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c92|Arts and Humanities|European Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c98|Arts and Humanities|Near Eastern Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd7|Arts and Humanities|History|Islamic World and Near East History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd9|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Religion|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce0|Arts and Humanities|History|Social History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce3|Arts and Humanities|History|European History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Gregory Goalwin,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/citation/,gdj43,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pnc4k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/relationships/node/,pnc4k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e3f7ff9ad5a1022ff4a78e/,58e3f7ff9ad5a1022ff4a78e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gdj43/,https://doi.org/10.1017/ssh.2018.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gdj43

In particular, attention is given to examining how representations of Farah were related to discourses on British multiculturalism. A brief discussion of recent rejections of multiculturalism is provided, with specific reference given to political and public calls for immigrants to assimilate with ‘British values’. By turning away from a dichotomous understanding of assimilation, this article suggests that processes of assimilation reflect a complicated coalescence of national inclusion and exclusion. That is, rather than simply highlighting how the national press serve to reproduce simple ‘us’ and ‘them’ binaries, this article draws upon Elias and Scotson’s established–outsider perspective in order to examine how the discursive construction of the ‘nation’ rests upon a dynamic process of identifying and managing ‘outsider’ individuals. As a result, while ‘outsider’ groups are frequently subjected to negative media portrayals, it is argued that Farah’s significance was underscored by discourses that sought to highlight his assimilated Britishness and through his promotion as a symbol of Britain’s achieved multiculturalism.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:55:08.028220,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-03T21:23:05.661204,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/citation/,xj2bm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t9nxb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/relationships/node/,t9nxb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e2bb2cb83f690047e304ca/,58e2bb2cb83f690047e304ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xj2bm/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443716635863,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xj2bm
