According to the kin selection theory, grandparental investment has its evolutionary roots in the individuals’ aim to maximise their inclusive fitness. Owing to an increasing overlap between successive generations in modern affluent populations, the importance of grandparental investment remains high. Despite the growing literature on this topic, there is limited knowledge regarding how the survival status of different grandparent types influences each other’s investment in grandchildren. 

OBJECTIVE
The present study examined how the survival status of grandparents influenced grandparental investment among other grandparent types using a wide range of grandparental investment variables divided into two latent constructs measuring relationship quality between grandparents and grandchildren and grandparental involvement in grandchildren.

METHODS
We used Bayesian structural equation modeling with multiple-indicator latent variables and the Involved Grandparenting and Child Well-Being Survey, providing nationally representative data of British and Welsh adolescents aged 11–16-years.

RESULTS
Maternal grandmothers’ investment was most strongly influenced by whether other grandparents were dead or alive. Living maternal grandfathers and paternal grandmothers had an almost identical positive influence on the investment of maternal grandmothers in their grandchildren. Weaker evidence suggested that living maternal grandmothers decreased the investment of paternal grandmothers and grandfathers. 

CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest the opposite influences of the survival status of paternal and maternal grandmothers on their investment. The results are discussed with reference to kin competition and incidental exposure.

We find evidence of slowdown, pauses, and reversals in infant mortality decline in large parts of India in 2017 and 2018, the last two years for which SRS data are available. In urban areas, the infant mortality rate stagnated at 23 deaths per 1,000 births between 2016 and 2018. Worse, overall infant mortality increased in the poorer states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh in this period. This occurred despite sustained improvements in household access to sanitation and clean fuel. One possible interpretation of these findings is that, in addition to their impact on unemployment and poverty, the demonetization experiment in late 2016 and the subsequent economic slowdown had an adverse effect on child health.

I ask to what extent working-time flexibility is sought after by those who are not parents of young children, if similar trade-offs may ensue, and with what consequences for disparities among and between women and men. I evaluate the effects of a 2014 reform that extended the “right to request” working-time flexibility from parents of young children to all employees in the UK. Using a difference-in-differences design, I find that women without young children reduce their working hours and move to part-time employment. These adjustments are coupled with a reduction in job-related stress and monthly earnings, but not hourly wage rates. Effects are sizeable, suggesting that right-to-request laws can enhance working-time flexibility within workplaces and mitigate gaps between women with and without children. This holds mainly for the tertiary-educated though, and, as no accompanying changes are observed among men, gender gaps in working hours and earnings are unintendedly amplified.

Survey Data Quality with Innovative Item Formats,"Introduction: Survey research is often designed based on multiple-choice questions although many other formats, also referred to as innovative item formats (IIF) exist, such as ranking, sorting, questions with pictures or smileys as response options. Research has suggested that IIF in a broad sense can strengthen data quality, but research is needed on a more specific level. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to present research for separate IIFs about the data quality for that type of item. Method: A literature study was conducted to identify articles that test the data quality of IIF. For each IIF research was discussed regarding aspects of data quality, such as reliability, validity and response rate. Results: A total of 166 research articles were identified with data from 218,532 participants revealing aspects of 22 IIFs with 13 subcategories. The type of evidence on data quality is quite varied and for some IIFs the evidence is supportive, for some it is not and for some it is inconclusive. With 6 IIFs the evidence was estimated in favour hereof, for 11 IIFs the evidence was inconclusive, 1 unfavoured and for 3 there was no evidence. With 6 IIFs potential confounders were identified. Discussion: The study suggests further research is needed where evidence is scarce.

Background: Previous work has considered how father identities shape father involvement, but has not focused on parenting stress. Understanding parenting stress is important as it is linked to fathers’ and children’s well-being. 
Method: We analyzed Fragile Families (FFCW) data (N = 2,547), using OLS and fixed-effects analyses.  The FFCW follows the families of a cohort of new children who were born in large urban areas of the U.S., in the late 1990s.
Results: OLS results indicated that positive attitudes about fatherhood, wanting to provide direct care, and having higher levels of support from the birth mother predicted lower levels of father’s parenting stress one year after a birth; father engagement, changes in birth mother’s support, and inconsistent financial support were also significantly associated with parenting stress. Fixed effects results indicated that changes in father engagement were negatively associated with changes in father’s parenting stress over years 1-5; changes in father’s inconsistent financial support were positively associated with parenting stress. Finally, we found evidence that father identity characteristics moderate predictors of parenting stress. 
Conclusion: Father identities seem to play an important role in shaping fathering experiences and father’s parenting stress. 
Implications: Fathers should be encouraged and supported in developing more salient father identities and fathering commitments by significant others, family practitioners, and public policies.",TRUE,FALSE,fatherhood|father identity|fathering|parenting|parenting stress,2020-11-09T03:56:01.930185,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-09T03:55:50.247580,FALSE,NA,no,Free to download; registration information available at : https://fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/documentation,,available,NA,https://fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/documentation,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Wiley,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/citation/,wj2p6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa717749c7a4e006ba00de6/,5fa717749c7a4e006ba00de6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj2p6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wj2p6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wj2p6,https://doi.org/10.1111/fare.12263

This analysis rebuts this expectation. Based on empirical analysis of 72 interviews with key stakeholders, 40 documents and participant observation at key international CE events, we show that optimistic win-win narratives on China-EU CE cooperation depoliticize cooperation goals, postponing deep-rooted tensions of identity, trust, negative competition and the scaling of environmental solutions. This prevents a paradigm shift towards a CE and will likely prevent fruitful cooperation on any other environmental paradigm. Traditionally, explanations for the challenges of international environmental cooperation have focused on issues of collective action and disparate interests. Our argument adds a different dimension to these explanations. It highlights the critical importance of identity, trust, negative competition and the scaling of environmental solutions. We propose more research on narrative strategies for identifying and promoting areas of trust, mutual identity building and shared conceptualizations of the scales of environmental governance.",TRUE,FALSE,China|circular economy|environmental cooperation|EU|identity|international trade|trust,2020-11-09T03:56:40.909748,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-09T03:56:21.997709,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/citation/,s8v7e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa69f1ed1894f005d68db68/,5fa69f1ed1894f005d68db68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8v7e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s8v7e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s8v7e,NA

Findings from an Online Survey in the UK,"Despite significant research into the education of autistic children and young people (CYP) and an increased awareness of the employment needs and rights of autistic adults, little attention has been paid to autistic teachers. We discuss findings drawn from an online survey in the UK in which autistic teachers and other education staff (n = 149) describe the lack of understanding, sensory impacts, mental health issues and the complexities associated with revealing an autism diagnosis as a result of their work. These issues can represent significant impediments to either entering or remaining in the school education profession. Positive experiences were also found and, from a social justice perspective, the possibilities of autistic school staff to constitute a role model for autistic CYP and to facilitate their educational inclusion are considered.  Future directions in this under-researched area are also discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,autism|autistic teachers|burnout|disability rights|inclusion|social justice,2020-11-09T04:02:40.831587,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-09T04:02:15.997351,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5a|Education|Special Education and Teaching|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6c|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|Accessibility|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|School Psychology,Rebecca Wood and Francesca Happé,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/citation/,92bqn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa675e19c7a4e004ca03fc2/,5fa675e19c7a4e004ca03fc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92bqn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/92bqn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/92bqn,NA
