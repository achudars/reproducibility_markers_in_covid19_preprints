It is an analytical literary study from a linguistic standpoint using Kenny’s (2011) ideas. In addition to focusing on differences, the aim of this study is to scrutinize silence and its different meanings inasmuch as silence is a distinctive feature that groups and differentiates both plays. The study sheds light on a different aspect of research. Hence, besides focusing on interpreting speeches, this paper analyzes silences in both plays. It vindicates that silences are as important in literary interpretation as speeches. While Beckett’s silences indicate the void of modern life, Pinter’s silences convey threats and violence. Albeit much attention is given to verbal utterances and  silences are generally neglected in terms of literary analysis, they are a sine qua non in terms of understanding Beckett’s Waiting for Godot and Pinter’s The Dumb Waiter and most importantly understanding the different languages of silence that greatly contribute to the whole meaning of both plays.

The poem is a dramatic monologue, exploring Persephone’s part of the story and her journey to the Underworld with Hades. The poem is approached from a feminist point of view. The paper sets two sections, the first reviews the theoretical parts concerning mythology and feminism, the second presents the application of the feminist theories on Kizer’s poem. The study aims to provide answers to crucial questions of the differences between the myth and the poet’s interpretation, portrayals of Demeter and her daughter Persephone, and the myth’s reinvented themes, as well as the depictions of her heroine. The study has arrived at some outcomes; first, Kizer’s poem is describing womanhood in Persephone’s individuation. Second, Kizer’s version is exploring woman’s psychological rather than social states.

My principal research question is: to what extent could the study of the various types of schemata benefit translation students, professionals and trainers? Drawing on Grice’s cooperative principle (1975), Martin and White’s appraisal theory (2005), and Pym’s risk management analysis (2015), three English excerpts with their corresponding Arabic translations are thoroughly analyzed. This is followed by linking the findings to translator training. The comparative analysis demonstrates that activating schema seems to reflect the translator’s ideology and power relations as a result of asymmetric information that characterizes the relation between translators, commissioners and readers. It also shows that the lack of formal schema leads to an inaccurate employment of the linguistic schema and image schema. Finally, the paper argues that the same schema building techniques, such as semantic mapping, adopted in EFL teaching methods could be applied to translator training. The study, therefore, concludes with a call for empirical translation research into the functions of schemata, particularly the linguistic schema, in light of think-aloud protocols.",TRUE,FALSE,English-Arabic translation|Grice’s maxims|risk management|schema|translator training,2018-07-02T11:39:47.971757,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:39:04.949904,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/citation/,3k6ux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e6xj4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/relationships/node/,e6xj4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba99960511e000edc874a/,5a8ba99960511e000edc874a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3k6ux/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3k6ux

However, as a result of technology, globalization and political changes, women suffer not only because of their gender but also because of their class, race or religion, which Crenchaw (1989) summarizes in the term “intersectionality” (p. 538). Shedding light on women’s multiple identities can help contemporary societies spot the discrimination that contemporary women suffer from; consequently, these societies can find solutions to eliminate the sources of women’s double marginalization. Race, class, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation are intersecting loci of discriminations or privileges (McCall, 2005, p. 1771). Although this is a western paradigm, it can be applied to Saudi Arabian literature. The elements of gynocriticism and intersectionality are evident in the works of Raja Alem, a feminist writer from Mecca, Saudi Arabia and the first woman to win the International Prize for Arabic Fiction. Due to the dearth of structured feminist literary criticism in the Arab world, this paper traces the history of feminist literary criticism and applies a gynocritic-intersectional model to Raja Alem’s novel, The Dove’s Necklace (2012) in order to examine the projection of women and help close the research gap in Arabic feminist criticism. The researcher probes the biological, linguistic, psychoanalytical and cultural depiction of the female characters in the novel along with their intersectional identities.

Mantel has received praise for her depiction of Cromwell, but also endured criticism for portraying him in an overly positive light. This paper examines the role of Mantel’s work and depiction of Cromwell in the evolution and potential re-framing of the historical fiction genre. It seeks to achieve four things: to assess the compelling nature of her fiction, to situate her depiction of Cromwell in opposition to other depictions, to highlight her literary approach, and to contextualise Mantel’s writing within ‘women’s writing’. Through this multifaceted approach it is conclusively established  that although Mantel’s narratives are situated within a female-dominated genre, they are told from a masculine perspective and gaze. Nonetheless, they still hold a significant subtext suggestive of the ‘feminine’. This paper thereby reinforces the argument of feminist critic Julia Kristeva and shows Hilary Mantel and her ‘embodied’ depiction of Cromwell in a light previously unseen, holding merit for the genre of historical fiction as a whole.",TRUE,FALSE,Cromwell|historical fiction|Mantel|semiotics|women’s writing,2018-07-02T11:39:47.902862,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:37:12.132318,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/citation/,3pzfu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b2uhs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/relationships/node/,b2uhs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba82b60511e000fdc913e/,5a8ba82b60511e000fdc913e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pzfu/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pzfu

In mocking Malvolio’s morality and ridiculous behaviour, Shakespeare wanted to denounce Puritans’ sober society in early modern England. Indeed, Puritans were depicted in the play as being selfish, idiot, hypocrite, and killjoy. In the same way, many other writers of different generations, obviously influenced by Shakespeare, have espoused his views and consequently contributed to promote this anti-Puritan literature, which is still felt today. This article discusses whether Shakespeare’s portrayal of Puritans was accurate or not. To do so, the writer first attempts to define the term “Puritan,” as the latter is quite equivocal, then take some Puritans’ characteristics, namely hypocrisy and killjoy, as provided in the play, and analyze them in the light of the studies of some historians and scholars, experts on the post Reformation Puritanism, to demonstrate that Shakespeare’s view on Puritanism is completely caricatural.",TRUE,FALSE,caricature|early modern theatre|Malvolio|Puritans|satire,2018-07-02T11:39:47.835387,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:36:39.695963,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/citation/,kangw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vpn4q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/relationships/node/,vpn4q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba6ab571031000d450980/,5a8ba6ab571031000d450980,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kangw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kangw

It has generated new attitudes towards childhood and changing practices around literature. The concept of literature for entertainment along with instruction, as proposed by Peter Hunt, has changed the traditional mode of reading methods and gave new dimensions in reading and experiencing children’s books. Nowadays, children’s books are available in various forms like printed books, audio/video recordings, animated movies, Disney cartoons etc. New developments in computational field and digital media have opened wider ways of exploring children’s stories. This has also led to the notion of cross-reading. Most of the stories for children are re-told or    re-visioned adapting to different socio-cultural, linguistic domains. This adaptation is both a product and process as seen by Hutcheon (2012). The chief characteristics of postmodern picture books include usually a non-linear plot structure, using pictures or texts to position the reader and focalizing ideas through the point of view of a character, construction of meaning by the reader, intertextual references and above all, the varied design layout and styles of illustration as envisioned by Anstey (2002). All these developments appease the tastes of the modern child as well as the adult reader. This paper is an attempt to explore the evolving styles in contemporary children’s books where it is thought of more in terms of multimodal texts, with self-referential elements adding to it the notion of metafiction.",TRUE,FALSE,children’s literature|media|multimodality|picture books|postmodern,2018-07-02T11:39:47.799848,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:36:20.903337,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/citation/,jh9ez,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p82e4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/relationships/node/,p82e4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba5ff60511e000fdc8ff6/,5a8ba5ff60511e000fdc8ff6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh9ez/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jh9ez/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jh9ez

The problem is more aggravated when the translation occurs from a sacred and sophisticated text such as the Holy Quran. As a result, losses in translation occur. This study, therefore, is an attempt to identify the losses in the translation of connotative meaning in the Holy Quran, propose strategies to reduce such losses, and identify the causes of such losses. For this purpose, seven examples were extracted from the Holy Quran and were qualitatively analysed. The analysis of the extracted data revealed that connotative meaning was quite challenging in translation and losses occurred. These problems in preserving the connotative meaning of the source text (ST) word or playing it down are due to two main causes: the first cause is the lack of equivalence, while the second one is the translator’s failure to pick the most appropriate equivalent. Non-equivalence problems were mainly represented in lack of lexicalization, semantic complexity, culturally-bound terms, difference in expressive meaning, and difference in distinction of meaning between the source language (SL) and the target language (TL). Some strategies were suggested to reduce such loss in the translation of connotative meaning. These strategies include footnoting, transliteration, periphrastic translation, and accuracy of selecting the proper equivalent that can be achieved by triangulation procedures such as peer-checking and expert-checking.",TRUE,FALSE,connotative meaning|the Holy Quran|translation loss|translation strategies,2018-07-02T11:39:47.766143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:35:24.405540,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/citation/,qvk95,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cjubw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/relationships/node/,cjubw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba53860511e000ddcd64b/,5a8ba53860511e000ddcd64b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qvk95/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qvk95

It also makes use of feminist concepts given that the content in question is written by Egyptian women writers and hence blends general social transformations with those affected by feminism. Four Egyptian authoresses were selected for this study along with samples of their literary works, written between 2011 and 2017, in an attempt to unpick the social transformations taking place in the short story during that critical period. The study shows that social transformations begin with the subject that is aware of those transformations embedded in the short story and taking different forms. It, in addition, underlines the impact and significance of the setting and how it is used by the women writers to locate and shed light on those transformations. Moreover, there are two types of social transformations, namely negative transformation, embodied in the deterioration of social relations or any undesired behavior, and positive transformation, characterized by the awareness of the subject of the sources of power in relation to the act of change and the influence of the revolutionary action on it. In addition, feminist conceptions are shown to be used in resisting male dominance and its relation to social oppression.",TRUE,FALSE,Egypt|genetic structuralism|social transformations|sociology of literary|women’s  short stories,2018-07-02T11:39:47.731327,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:36:03.872107,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/citation/,axqm9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/whg6y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/relationships/node/,whg6y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba449571031000f44d075/,5a8ba449571031000f44d075,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axqm9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/axqm9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/axqm9
