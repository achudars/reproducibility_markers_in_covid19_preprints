Increased access to point-of-care-tests (POCTs) to detect Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection could reduce transmission and development of reproductive sequelae. Yet diagnostics with good clinical effectiveness evidence can fail to be implemented into care.   Here we assess values beyond clinical effectiveness for molecular CT/NG POCTs. 
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications in Medline and Embase reporting on molecular CT/NG POCT implementation in routine clinical practice until 16th February 2021. Article titles, abstracts and full-texts were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results were synthesised to assess the tests against guidance criteria and develop a CT/NG POCT value proposition. 
Findings
The systematic review search returned 440 articles; 28 were included. The Cepheid CT/NG GeneXpert was the only molecular CT/NG POCT implemented and evaluated in routine practice. It did not fulfil all guidance criteria, however, studies of test implementation showed multiple values across various healthcare settings and locations. Our value proposition highlights that the majority of values are setting-specific. 
Interpretation
Those wishing to improve CT/NG diagnosis should be supported to identify the values most relevant to their settings and context, and prioritise implementation of tests that are most closely aligned with those values.",TRUE,FALSE,Chlamydia trachomatis|diagnostics|implementation research|laboratory medicine|Neisseria gonorrhoeae|point-of-care test|Sexually Transmitted Infections|systematic review|technology adoption|value proposition,2020-08-29T19:52:09.683829,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-29T19:51:43.532908,TRUE,"Dr. Fuller reports grants from binx health,  outside the submitted work;  and Consultant to World Health Organization, 3rd Technical consultation on point-of-care tests for sexually transmitted infections (2019).

These surveys, however, are only designed to allow the aggregation of responses and production of reliable direct estimates (i.e., weighted means or totals) at very large spatial scales, such as countries or states. Sample sizes are generally too small to produce direct estimates of adequate precision at the increasingly refined spatial scales of the criminology of place. Model-based small area estimation may be used to increase the reliability of small area estimates produced from victimization surveys. Small area estimation techniques are designed to produce reliable estimates of parameters of interest (and their associated measures of error) for areas for which only small or zero sample sizes are available. In 2008, the US Panel to Review the Programs of the Bureau of Justice Statistics recommended the use of small area estimation to produce subnational estimates of crime. Since then, these techniques have been applied to study many variables of interest in criminology. This chapter introduces theory and a step-by-step exemplar study in R to show the utility of small area estimation to analyze crime and place.

To make effective use of crowdsourced data, it is important to understand its key strengths to emphasize, and limitations to mitigate.

Yet, like the functionalists who introduced the concept, socialization has fallen out of favor, critiqued for ignoring power and agency, for its teleology and incoherence, and for its link to misguided “culture of poverty” arguments. In this review, we argue for renewed, post-functionalist use of socialization. We review the concept’s history, its high point under Parsons, the reasons for its demise, its continued use in some subfields (e.g., gender, race and ethnicity, education), and alternative concepts used to explain social reproduction. We then suggest that something is lost when “socialization” is avoided or isolated in particular subfields. Without socialization, conceptions of social reproduction face problems of history, transferability, and power.

Previous work on identifying specialization relies on typological or linear metric analysis. Here we demonstrate how to investigate ceramic standardization by analyzing outlines of ceramic vessels. Outline analysis is useful because, unlike more commonly-used landmark analysis methods, it can effectively quantify shape differences for objects that lack distinctive measurement points needed for landmark analysis. We demonstrate this method using pottery from Kiwulan, a large multi-component Iron Age site (AD 1350-1850) in northeastern Taiwan. To measure ceramic specialization, we quantified pottery standardization by analyzing shape variables with reproducible geometric morphometric methods. We computed coefficients of variation (CVs) for shape coefficients obtained by elliptical Fourier analysis to test for shape standardization. We found significant differences in pottery shape and shape standardization that indicate changes in pottery production resulting from contact with mainland Han Chinese groups in northeastern Taiwan.

disease prevalence and mortality. However, little is known about how these trends are reflected in
combined measures of morbidity, disability and mortality.
Method: We use two nationally representative surveys of the Spanish population for the years
2008 to 2017 and standard measures of expected duration of disability and illness to assess time
trends and social disparities in mortality, morbidity and expected years lived in disability (DFLE)
and with chronic illness (chrDFLE). We provide empirical evidence of shifting trends for these
measures. We then decompose these changes into contributions associated with disability, chronic
illness and mortality. Finally, we estimate the size of education differentials in DFLE and chrDFLE
and evaluate the magnitude and direction of changes of these differentials over time.
Results: While the disability based indicator suggests a decrease of expected years without
disability for both men and women (expansion of morbidity), the morbidity based indicator shows
an increase in time spend free of chronic disease for women but a slight decrease for men. The
decrease in time spent without disability was observed for all education groups but is particularly
marked for those with low education.
Conclusion: We find evidence of an expansion of morbidity in Spain between 2008 and 2017.
The bulk of this development is related to increases in time spent with functional limitations over
this period. These patterns occur in conjuncture with growing social disparities in time spend with

The virus spread unequally across the country, with northern regions witnessing more cases and deaths than those in the centre and south. We investigate demographic and socio-economic factors that contributed to the diverse regional impact of the virus in Italy. Within a smoothing framework, we divide regions into three well-defined groups of High, Middle and Low mortality by cluster analysis. Extending the Poisson regression model to account for regional clusters, we find that COVID-mortality is positively associated with the share of ICU utilization, GDP per capita, proportion of the older population and the number of COVID-19 positive cases, while it is negatively associated with the delay of region-specific outbreaks and the number of tests performed.

Assortative Mating by Place of Origin in the United States,"Previous studies showed that assortative mating occurred based on different social dimensions, such as age, education, and race or ethnicity. However, these studies ignored the potential impact of place of origin on people’s place identity and habitus and their associations with assortative mating in the United States. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), in conjunction with the Current Population Survey (CPS), this study finds a clear pattern of assortative mating based on place of origin. Moreover, the results suggest that there are regional differences in assortative mating by place of origin, especially for women. Also, the length of residence shapes people’s habitus and thus the pattern of homogeneous matching by place of origin. The significant effects of race or ethnicity and the conditions of the marriage market before marriage vary by scale of place and gender. These findings suggest that place of origin is another dimension of assortative mating.",TRUE,FALSE,assortative mating|habitus|homogeneous matching|place of identity|place of origin,2020-12-16T19:25:22.111916,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-16T16:57:00.767408,TRUE,"This project has received the “William H.
