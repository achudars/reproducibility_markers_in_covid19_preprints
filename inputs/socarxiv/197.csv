In an effort to quantify these changes, Google released an open-source dataset pertaining to regional mobility trends—including park visitation trends. This dataset offers vast application potential, containing aggregated information from location data collected via smartphones around the world. However, empirical analysis of these data is limited. Namely, the factors causing reported changes in mobility and the degree to which these changes can be directly attributable to COVID-19 remain unknown. The goal of this study is to address these gaps in our understanding of both the changes in park visitation and the causes of these changes. Results suggest that seasonality, not the COVID-19 pandemic, serves as the primary driver of reported changes in park visitation. Specifically, latitude-driven seasonal changes significantly influence visitation trends. Median age of a county is also a statistically significant driver.",TRUE,FALSE,age|big data|coronavirus|COVID-19|Google|outdoor recreation|parks|park visitation|spatial analysis|spatial error model,2020-05-19T15:03:27.629371,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-19T14:21:56.522298,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/citation/,97qa4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec2e3c1edc58c002e0acaec/,5ec2e3c1edc58c002e0acaec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97qa4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/97qa4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/97qa4,NA

Many suggest that employing such quantifications will lead to more efficient, more effective or otherwise better quality policy making. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent these benefits materialize and if so, how they are brought about. This paper draws on the sociology and policy science literature to study how algorithmic models, a particular type of quantification, are used in policy analysis. It presents the outcomes of 38 unstructured interviews with data scientists, policy analysts, and policy makers that work with algorithmic models in government. Based on an in-depth analysis of these interviews, I conclude that the usefulness of algorithmic models in policy analysis is best understood in terms of the commensurability of these quantifications. However, these broad communicative and organizational benefits can only be brought about if algorithmic models are handled with care. Otherwise, they may propagate bias, exclude particular social groups, and will entrench existing worldviews.",TRUE,FALSE,government analytics|machine learning|policy analysis|Responsible data science,2020-05-19T15:10:47.506257,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-19T14:22:59.191014,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/citation/,hpma8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec2d85cc7d4ab002621c638/,5ec2d85cc7d4ab002621c638,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hpma8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hpma8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hpma8,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2020.101488

Can one generalize the periodic table?,"In fact, the first law of conservation (that of mass) was found in chemistry and generalized to the conservation of energy in physics by means of Einstein’s famous “E=mc2”. Energy conservation is implied by the principle of least action from a variational viewpoint as in Emmy Noether’s theorems (1918): any chemical change in a conservative (i.e. “closed”) system can be accomplished only in the way conserving its total energy. Bohr’s innovation to found Mendeleev’s periodic table by quantum mechanics implies a certain generalization referring to the quantum leaps as if accomplished in all possible trajectories (according to Feynman’s interpretation) and therefore generalizing the principle of least action and needing a certain generalization of energy conservation as to any quantum change. The transition from the first to the second theorem of Emmy Noether represents well the necessary generalization: its chemical meaning is the generalization of any chemical reaction to be accomplished as if any possible course of time rather than in the standard evenly running time (and equivalent to energy conservation according to the first theorem).
The problem: If any quantum change is accomplished in all possible “variations (i.e. “violations) of energy conservation” (by different probabilities), what (if any) is conserved?
An answer: quantum information is what is conserved. Indeed, it can be particularly defined as the counterpart (e.g. in the sense of Emmy Noether’s theorems) to the physical quantity of action (e.g. as energy is the counterpart of time in them). It is valid in any course of time rather than in the evenly running one.

To contribute to overall national- and global-scale SDG achievement, local communities need to focus on a locally-relevant subset of goals and understand potential future pathways for key drivers which influence local sustainability. We developed a participatory method to co-create local socioeconomic pathways by downscaling the SDGs and driving forces of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) via a local case study in southern Australia through contextual analysis and community engagement. We linked the SSPs and SDGs by identifying driving forces and describing how they affect the achievement of local SDGs. We co-created six local socioeconomic pathways with the local community which track towards futures with different levels of fulfilment of the SDGs and each encompasses a narrative storyline incorporating locally-specific ideas from the community. We tested and validated the local pathways with the community. This method extends the SSPs in two dimensions – into the broader field of sustainability via the SDGs, and by recontextualizing them at the local scale.

The paper argues that, contrary to common sense, journalists can more accurately shape representations of reality, while clarifying authorities’ statements, by arbitrarily depriving themselves from prior knowledge and relying, instead, on personalizing space and time in the inquiry process.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazil|covid-19|crisis management|critical inquiry|discourse analysis|journalism|Kant,2020-05-18T02:49:20.602524,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-18T02:49:11.745449,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognition and Perception,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/citation/,vz9cu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec1e32033a74b009a3b514a/,5ec1e32033a74b009a3b514a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz9cu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vz9cu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vz9cu,NA

Reported case rates vary across counties from zero to 126 per thousand population (around a state prison in the rural county of Trousdale, Tennessee). Overall, rural counties are underrepresented relative to their share of the population, but a growing proportion of all daily cases and deaths have been reported in rural counties. This analysis uses daily reports for all counties to present the trends and distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural counties, from late March to May 21, 2020. I describe the relationship between population density and case rates in rural and non-rural counties. Then I focus on noteworthy outbreaks linked to prisons, meat and poultry plants, and nursing homes, many of which are linked to high concentrations of Hispanic, American Indian, and Black populations. The growing epidemic in rural counties is apparently driven by outbreaks concentrated in these institutional settings, which are conducive to transmission. The impact of the epidemic in rural areas may be heightened due to their weaker health infrastructure and more vulnerable populations, especially due to age, socioeconomic status, and health conditions. As a result, the epidemic may contribute to the ongoing decline of health, economic, and social conditions in rural areas.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|covid-19|epidemics|health disparities|mortality|rural health,2020-05-17T21:21:40.683988,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-17T21:21:17.902583,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/wd2n6/,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/citation/,pnqrd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wd2n6/,wd2n6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec1a950221cb100841359ba/,5ec1a950221cb100841359ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnqrd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pnqrd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pnqrd,https://doi.org/10.29333/ejeph/8331

While theoretically sound, this expectation has never been tested at larger scales in ongoing episodes of political violence. Instead, conceptual progress has been made in lab experiments. Combining insights from observational research and stylized experiments, we predict that fear for personal safety due to witnessed violence causes prejudice against out-groups, enhanced internal cohesion, and support for extremist actors. To test these predictions, we conducted surveys in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh over three waves involving the same 783 respondents starting in January 2017. the surveys continued during the tense Legislative Assembly elections in the Spring. The results largely corroborate the theoretical expectations and present a hard in-vivo test of long-standing conjectures.",TRUE,FALSE,Hindu-Muslim conflict|India|Panel survey|Religious conflict|Survey experiment,2020-05-17T21:07:41.737789,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-17T21:07:11.546059,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/citation/,42w6h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec1871a221cb1007b130e7c/,5ec1871a221cb1007b130e7c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42w6h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42w6h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42w6h,NA
