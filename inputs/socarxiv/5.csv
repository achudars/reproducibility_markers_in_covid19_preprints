Yet in an era of China’s rise to power, this focus has overlooked both China’s influential political engagement with the global tax system, and how its changing economy alters its interests at home and abroad. In this paper, we address this oversight by providing an account of the sources and nature of the new Chinese global tax diplomacy. We argue that China's becoming a global net capital exporter, emergence as a major consumer market, and the growth of its own digital giant firms like Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, underpins its interest in simultaneous ‘going out’ and ‘bringing in’ foreign direct investment by selectively and strategically engaging with Western-liberal institutions. Specifically, we show how China variously challenges, defends, and develops alternatives to global tax standards in three cases: global efforts to tackle corporate tax avoidance, bilateral tax treaty negotiations, and administrative tax cooperation. A better understanding of China’s significant, distinctive and varying diplomatic engagement with Western economic institutions, will help inform debates on the Chinese business-politics nexus and expand analyses of global tax and economic politics beyond US-centrism",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-01T16:21:43.541905,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-01T16:21:15.730449,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.treaties.tax/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies,NA,Rasmus Corlin Christensen|Martin Hearson,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/citation/,pzvy3,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603ca79367386c0273620579/,603ca79367386c0273620579,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pzvy3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pzvy3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pzvy3,NA

Immanent in them, however, is a structure of great simplicity and utility. The concept at the heart of the antitrust laws is the linear supply chain, consisting of an essential input, a downstream market in which competition is harmed through the discriminatory supply of the input to downstream firms, and consumers who pay higher prices for finished products as a result of the discriminatory behavior. Antitrust attacks this problem of the discriminatory supply of inputs in two ways. First, it seeks to prevent any one intelligence from taking control over the input, because absent such centralized control, competition from input suppliers eliminates any attempt at discrimination. Stopping the centralization of control over inputs is not always possible, however, because sometimes centralized control improves the quality of the input, and antitrust follows an implicit rule of “innovation primacy,” which holds that any act that plausibly improves the product likely does more good for consumers than any resulting increase in prices harms them, and so the act must be immune from antitrust scrutiny. 
-------&gt;Second, antitrust regulates attempts by input controllers to use their power to increase their profits other than by charging what they know to be the highest possible prices for their products given their level of knowledge of consumer willingness to pay. Profits can be increased in this way by only three routes, each of which involves discrimination by the input controller in the supply of inputs to downstream firms. The input controller can discriminate in favor of firms that improve the final product ultimately sold to consumers and so increase consumers’ willingness to pay. The input controller can discriminate in favor of downstream firms that supply the input controller with information about consumer willingness to pay, enabling the input controller better to choose its prices to maximize its profits. And the input controller can discriminate against downstream firms that refuse to give the input controller access to profits that the firms have in turn extracted from consumers. The doctrine of innovation primacy protects discrimination that improves the final product sold to consumers, but not discrimination that facilitates information acquisition or the disciplining of refractory downstream firms. 
-------&gt;This analysis resolves numerous longstanding conundrums in antitrust, including (1) whether antitrust picks winners (it must), (2) whether picking winners limits consumer sovereignty (impossible, because whenever a firm discriminates in the supply of inputs, the firm picks winners, and antitrust, which does no more than challenge such discrimination, therefore only ever substitutes its judgment for that of firms, never for that of end consumers), (3) whether antitrust should have a monopoly power requirement (it should, but the requirement should apply to the input market and not, as at present, to the downstream market in which competition is harmed), (4) whether firms should be allowed to compete on their own platforms as a general matter (of course they should, unless it is thought that consumers always know better than firms how everything they buy should be made, from start to finish), and (5) how to define the limits of the firm (the boundary of the firm does not end where formal ownership ends, but rather where discrimination in the supply of inputs ends). The analysis also shows why Lorain Journal, Aspen Skiing, Linkline, Trinko, Microsoft, Qualcomm, exclusive dealing, and tying are all the same basic case.",TRUE,FALSE,antitrust|antitrust foundations|innovation|input control|law and economics|mergers|monopolization|platforms|price fixing|product improvement|supply chain|tech giants,2021-02-28T23:36:11.239449,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-28T23:35:40.500192,TRUE,This research was funded by a grant from the John S. and James L.

Since cultural beliefs form webs of implications that become more connected with similar experiences until an equilibrium point is reached, correlations between beliefs should become stronger and the changes in the structure of personal culture should decrease with age.

Consequently, such discussions have clouded the facts, resulting in a large number of factoids. According to these popular beliefs, very few farmers benefit (6% only), and primarily large farmers of Punjab and Haryana (and to some extent western Uttar Pradesh) benefit. In this article, we examine these three factoids and draw on multiple data sources to distil the facts. We argue that existing evidence suggests a more complex picture – (1) the MSP impacts 13(16)% paddy (wheat) sellers; (2) the geographies of procurement have expanded to new states including notably, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, and (3) Although, at the national level, there is a large farmer bias, this doesn’t imply exclusion of small and marginal farmers. In fact, majority of the beneficiaries are marginal and small farmers on both the extensive and the intensive margins. Further, we find substantial heterogeneity by states. Haryana for instance has a bias in favour of small and marginal farmers. We conclude that debates on the MSP and procurement must therefore take into account the changed geography of procurement and the profile of sellers and recognize the diversity of experiences with procurement across states.",TRUE,FALSE,India|minimum support price|paddy|price support|procurement|wheat,2021-02-28T03:26:06.321827,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-28T03:25:38.809016,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://fci.gov.in/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,NA,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/citation/,ufw9k,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6039eb43035cf701bac82ad4/,6039eb43035cf701bac82ad4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ufw9k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufw9k,NA

Family background and graduates' career trajectories,"The literature on social stratification has paid considerable attention to whether and to what extent attending prestigious universities is advantageous for graduates’ labor market returns. This paper contributes to the literature by applying a more dynamic perspective in asking whether graduates from prestigious and less prestigious universities differ in their career progression across fourteen years since labor market entry. It further investigates whether graduating from prestigious universities pays off more or less for graduates from different educational backgrounds. The positive selection hypothesis suggests that students most likely to attend prestigious universities will benefit the most. The negative selection hypothesis suggests the opposite. Using multilevel growth curve modeling and the 1970 British Cohort Study (N = 939), the findings show no discernible differences in occupational prestige between graduates from diverse universities.

These changes could alter inequalities in mobility and therefore contribute to many forms of social stratification. Relying on SafeGraph cellphone movement data in 2019-2020 we focus on the 25 largest cities in the U.S. and measure inequality in mobility between census tracts by using two indexes proposed by Phillips and colleagues (2019). These measures capture the importance of hubs in a mobility network (Concentrated Mobility Index) and neighborhood isolation (Equitable Mobility Index). We find that the pandemic affected mobility inequality in all 25 cities. In the earliest phases of the pandemic, neighborhood isolation rapidly increased, and the importance of downtown central business districts declined. Mobility hubs generally regained their importance, whereas neighborhood isolation remained elevated started and to increased again during the latter half of 2020. Furthermore, we estimate linear regression models with city and week fixed effects predicting changes in neighborhood isolation relative to 2019 baseline. We find that larger numbers of new COVID-19 cases are positively and statistically significantly associated with changes in neighborhood isolation a week later. Additionally, we find that places with larger populations, more public transportation use, and greater racial and ethnic segregation all had larger increases in neighborhood isolation during 2020. Our results indicate that few cities returned to “normal” mobility patterns and that cities may remain more unequal than before the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|mobility|mobility inequality|neighborhood isolation|networks|urban sociology,2021-02-26T16:34:09.925780,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-26T16:33:36.434302,FALSE,NA,no,Mobility data is available for researchers through Safegraph after signing a data use agreement.,,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,NA,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/citation/,rs4qz,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6038bb87035cf70151c7f1bb/,6038bb87035cf70151c7f1bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4qz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rs4qz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rs4qz,NA

(2010) describe in their paper, which has been published in the American Economic Review, that risk aversion and impatience are negatively related to cognitive ability. This topic is important because controlling for cognitive ability might be necessary if someone is interested in the link of risk preferences or time preferences to real-world outcomes. We re-examine their key results by conducting an experimental study using two subject pools (agricultural students and farmers) and three levels of monetary incentives. Similar to Dohmen et al. (2010), our study finds the above-described negative correlations. However, the strength of the association is smaller and the p-values are quite large.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive abilities|impatience|replication|Risk aversion,2021-02-26T06:58:41.642220,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-26T06:58:23.256526,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,NA,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/citation/,7tvrb,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60381e4b67386c00c961a824/,60381e4b67386c00c961a824,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7tvrb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7tvrb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7tvrb,NA
