The present paper is a descriptive-analytical investigation of the challenges of the current pandemic-imposed E-teaching of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) courses to female preparatory (PY) year students at King Khalid University (KKU). It identifies teachers’ and students’ responses about the ongoing issues with E-teaching of ESP with to put practical solutions to them. The study is conducted at The University Center for Girls’ Studies- Al-Samir Campus-Abha during the academic year 2020-2021. Twenty English Language instructors at the English Language Center (ELC) and eighty students of the preparatory year at the College of Medicine enrolled in Intensive English Course (Njl-019) participated in the study. It adopts mixed qualitative methodology with the teachers’ semi-structured interview and students’ questionnaire as tools to collect data, and descriptive analysis as a method to interpret data. The study finds out reciprocity of teachers’ and students’ responses in pinpointing the factors posing serious challenges in teaching and learning ESP courses as majorly related to technology, pedagogy, and Assessment. Considering these challenges, the study puts forth practical suggestions to promote virtual teaching and learning of ESP courses. The suggested solutions are hoped to help providing successful standards for virtual ESP teaching and learning as per the constraints of quality modern education.",TRUE,FALSE,Assessment|Covid-19|ESP|E-teaching|King Khalid University|pedagogy|Saudi Arabia|technology,2021-05-20T13:56:07.568777,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T13:55:43.346262,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/citation/,94f27,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5f293e2a9800159a67310/,60a5f293e2a9800159a67310,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94f27/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/94f27/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.25,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/94f27

The main task is to assess the existing and desired level of this competence, to develop an organizational model of its formation which consists of the following components: goals and objectives, pedagogical conditions and evaluation criteria. The model was implemented simultaneously at the Drahomanov National Pedagogical University and National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute” by teachers of humanities in experimental and control groups (16 people) in three stages: ascertaining, formative and final. A questionnaire and a self-assessment map of the formation of the culture of working with information were developed for the ascertaining stage; purposeful work with students was conducted (special tasks, discussion conversations, discussions) at the formative stage the results before and after the experiment were compared at the final stage in particular. Positive dynamics in the experimental group was noted, the average rate of formation increased. The proposed evaluation criteria – motivational, cognitive and activity ones have demonstrated practical value. It is advisable to recommend their use at other faculties.

Almost all teaching/learning activities must be changed and adjusted with the virtual classes. One among other activities commonly done in an English language education program is group work or collaborative work between or among students. Due to the pandemic situation, this particular activity should also be done online. This study aims to describe freshmen’s perspectives on collaborative work done in a Procedural Writing class. The teacher of the writing class randomly paired the students to work collaboratively. There is only one research question in this study: What challenges do Procedural Writing students experience in doing collaborative learning during the pandemic COVID 19? Data were derived from reflections that fourteen (14) Procedural Writing students at an English Language Education Program (ELEP), UKSW, Indonesia, wrote in the sixth week of Semester II/ 2020-2021 academic year, and from interviews with two participants who said that they were not happy with collaborative learning. Findings showed that in general, the freshmen felt that collaborative work helped them write better, they got more ideas, helped in their grammar, and exchanged knowledge. Only two students felt unhappy due to misunderstanding and ideas which were not delivered successfully.

However, learners require knowledge and skills on how to use Web 2.0-based learning tools. Thus, there is a need to focus on how Web-based tools can be used to enhance learning outcomes. Therefore, this study aims to explore the challenges and benefits of Web 2.0-based learning among international students of English as a Second Language (ESL) at the Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU), North Cyprus during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data were collected from a purposive sample of 15 ESL learners at EMU using focus group interviews. The interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. The findings showed that challenges faced by international students of English at EMU during the Covid-19 pandemic include inadequate knowledge of technology and technical issues such as poor internet connectivity, inability to upload large files, and loss of password. Additionally, the findings showed that Web 2.0 technologies can help the students to enhance collaborative learning, independent learning, flexible learning, as well as competence in using technology for learning purposes. It was envisaged that this study would be beneficial to the management of higher learning institutions, educationists, and students in general.

One of these measures included shutting down schools and universities. Consequently, the teaching, learning and assessment processes were entirely shifted from face-to-face to online. The current study aimed to investigate online vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs) amid COVID-19 pandemic used by Saudi EFL students. It attempted to find out the online strategies Saudi EFL astudents use to get the meaning of new vocabulary, the strategies they use to study new vocabulary and the strategies they follow to revise the learned vocabulary and keep them as part of their repertoire. The sample of the study was 119 male and female English and non-English majors. The study modified Kulikova’s (2015) questionnaire.  This study was conducted at the University of Bisha, Saudi Arabia, during a fully online learning period in September and October 2020 at the time of COVID-19 outbreak. The data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire form. It was distributed via teachers of the English Department. The study found out that English majors used vocabulary learning strategies more than non-English majors.  It also showed that students do not ask their teachers about the meaning of new vocabulary (77%), they also do not ask their classmates (92%), nor they ask their friends (85%), which could be attributed to online study and due to social distance during coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19 pandemic|online learning strategies|Saudi EFL students|vocabulary learning strategies,2021-05-20T14:37:04.179401,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T14:36:36.943097,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/citation/,qu326,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5edbc8b826b014a8bacf7/,60a5edbc8b826b014a8bacf7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qu326/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qu326/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qu326

Recent contemporary and postmodern literary theories have catered to burgeoning notions of logic that go beyond human survival on the planet. Science fiction is a genre of fiction that encompasses imaginative concepts like futuristic scientific-technological settings, faster than light, past and future spatial time travel, the existence of parallel universes and extraterrestrial life etc. An outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The outbreak was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020. During this crisis, literature also plays an important role and apocalyptic literature has shown the disastrous consequences if humans didn’t stop their behaviour and attitude towards the world.  This research project aims to take literature out of the realm of imagination and present the harsh realities of culture. This study revealed how literature represents the truth of the world that science is learning every day, and how certain inventions can have harmful effects if they are not halted in time.

The current study examines students’ answers to identify their satisfaction in ESP online courses. The study’s research questions were divided into four categories: the effectiveness of online ESP learning, the availability of learning material used by ESP instructors, the evaluation of ESP teachers’ results, the effectiveness of online testing, and students’ difficulties with ESP distance learning. A descriptive statistical method was used to validate the study. The statistics package JASP was used for data analysis. The authors chose observation, literature analysis, a questionnaire provision, and descriptive data analysis as the research tools. The study results show that students are primarily pleased with ESP courses taught online, students fulfil the expected progress in ESP learning performance.  It is revealed that the main problems that influence and impact online ESP learning during COVID-19 are related to technical, academic, and communication challenges. Student satisfaction surveys may lead to changes in ESP online learning activities that may, in turn, boost students’ outcomes. The results provide valuable insight into students’ satisfaction with online learning and pose practical questions for its implementation. As a result, this study is just a preliminary attempt at offering considerate analysis to Ukraine’s policymakers.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-05-20T14:38:10.036458,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T14:37:41.868544,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/citation/,2d587,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5e9302cb36e013cc14ec0/,60a5e9302cb36e013cc14ec0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2d587/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2d587/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2d587

The differences between male and female learners and learners of the different study levels in terms of anxiety caused by COVID-19 were investigated. Moreover, the study sheds light on two factors which are the internal factors and external factors that increase learning anxiety during COVID-19 and the strategies used by the learners to decrease the negative effects of COVID-19 on learning anxiety. The data of the study were collected from 80 EFL learners (40 males and 40 females) at the University of Bisha. This study is considerable as it deals with something that is important in the learning and teaching processes these days. The study revealed that COVID-19  causes normal anxiety to the EFL learners at the University of Bisha. It was also revealed that there is no significant difference between the male and female learners in terms of anxiety caused by COVID-19 and external factors. There is a significant difference between them in terms of the internal factors and strategies used by the learners to decrease the negative effects of learning anxiety during COVID-19. Lastly, there was no significant difference between the learners of the different study levels in terms of anxiety, internal factors and external factors that increase negative learning anxiety and the strategies used by the learners to decrease the negative learning anxiety during COVID-19.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|EFL learners|learning anxiety|University of Bisha,2021-05-20T14:38:24.437632,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T14:37:59.465946,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/citation/,wxn36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5e82e8b826b014a8ba08b/,60a5e82e8b826b014a8ba08b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wxn36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wxn36/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wxn36
