The conveniently selected participants were thirteen ESL learners and a native speaker of English instructor. Two data collection instruments were employed to gather the primary data for this research study. The first instrument was a student survey to explore the perceptions and beliefs of the students about MMCs. The second measure involved a set of semi-structured interviews with four students and their instructor. The results of the statistical data analysis of the student survey indicated that the majority of the student participants expressed their preference for using MMCs because this writing approach enabled them to more completely and professionally explain their meanings to others. The findings from the analysis of the data gathered from the semi structured interviews demonstrated that the students believed that MMCs made writing easier than writing with words only. However, the perception of the teacher was that some students believe that MMCs add an extra burden to their writing assignments and do not constitute an integral part of an assignment itself. Suggestions and recommendations for the more effective use of MMCs in ESL writing classrooms in the USA context, based on this research study, are provided at the end of this study.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a Second Language (ESL) context|mixed methods|Multimodal composition (MMC)|TESOL,2019-04-08T02:02:23.900250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:40:54.584431,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/citation/,wzrab,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa54fb641d100018c03c76/,5caa54fb641d100018c03c76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzrab/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wzrab/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.24,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wzrab

Theoretically speaking, the goal behind such reform is to shift from a content-based to a process-based learning/teaching and thus to make learning more relevant and realistic for students. However, in practice, teachers find difficulties in putting into practice the two approaches. The aim of the present paper is to explore those obstacles that hinder the execution of the PBL approach in the third-year secondary education English classes and to identify to what extent English language teachers master and use PBL methodology in their classes. To reach the aim of the study, the following hypothesis is put forward: teachers lack both training and background knowledge on the approaches that help to implement PBL in classrooms. For the sake of collecting information about the issue tackled in this study, twenty EFL teachers from some secondary schools in Mostaganem city received a questionnaire. The research findings confirm the hypothesis mentioned above. They reveal that teachers neither master nor use the project-based instruction proficiently in their classrooms despite the guidance provided in the third-year pedagogical documents. Those hindrances are due to the lack of professional training and the insufficient theoretical knowledge on the diverse approaches, methods and strategies related to PBL",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-20T21:40:45.231744,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:40:30.931275,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/citation/,b8jpu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa5437df977b001af3da5d/,5caa5437df977b001af3da5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8jpu/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.23,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8jpu

One of the most challenging tests faced by Saudi students in their studies, is the summative speaking test. The test is consisting of three tasks in which students required to go through them all. Accordingly, there is a need to seek approaches to enhance students’ performance in the speaking test. In other words, formative assessment has not been used to overcome the challenges faced by the Saudi students at Taibah University in the speaking test. This research aims to investigate whether a formative speaking assessment has a significant impact on students’ performance in the summative test. Also, it aims to monitor student learning and to provide constructive feedback that can be used by teachers to improve students’ learning and help the students to identify their strengths and weaknesses in speaking skills.

They were divided in to two groups and each group comprised 200 advanced EFL learners. Explicit morphological instructions were given to group two in the classroom for full one semester whereas group one wasn't given any kind of morphological knowledge. To collect data, exactly the same lists of word-formation on different morphological processes and their use in the writing samples were administered to both the groups. The main objective of this research was to examine the correlation between the morphological awareness and the EFL writing after testing learners' reflection on word-formation. Then it also tried to explore the difference between their performances to check whether the morphological instructions improved their writing or not. The findings stated that group two students always performed far better than group one and showed a strong understanding of word-formation structure while applying and manipulating in the morphological-instructed tasks. The formulated hypothesis-the teaching of explicit morphemic rules improves not only morphological awareness to a large extent but also grammatical, intralingual, lexical and syntactic awareness that results to enhance collaboratively EFL writing competence. A promising contribution of this current study to pedagogy was that explicit teaching of morphology improved writing to a concrete, large extent and revealed clearly that it must be introduced to EFL learners from the early education so that their writing skill can be developed effectively.",TRUE,FALSE,derivation|EFL writing|inflection|internal change|Morphological awareness|suppletion,2019-07-20T21:40:04.709820,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:39:36.129524,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/citation/,s7f5r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa514308a3bf001902ca4c/,5caa514308a3bf001902ca4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s7f5r/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s7f5r

It is assumed that adjectives in online comments do not keep the same linguistic structure and function like in spoken English and new forms emerge as the result of using СMС. It analyses adjectives used by non-native English speakers through collecting a corpus of fifty utterances obtained from comments posted publically in Facebook.

Particularly, the paper attempts to analyze transitivity or process types from a semantic-grammatical point of view based on Halliday's (1985) framework of Systemic Functional Grammar. The study aims to describe and compare the process types used by the authors to transmit their experiences/ideations and fulfill the intended purposes. To this end, eight articles from Washington Post (WP) &amp; Arab News (AN) online newspapers were analyzed. The selected texts were divided into clauses and the process types (material, mental, relational, verbal, existential &amp; behavior) were identified and compared. The analysis reveals that the authors of both newspapers give prominence to the use of material and relational processes seeming to focus exclusively on the actions of physical nature and make links between actions and actors with some qualities associated with them. The subsequently used processes in WP articles are verbal, mental and existential; whereas in AN articles they are mental, existential and verbal. Behavior process is the last and least frequently used process type in both newspapers articles showing that the physiological responses of the actors are not a major involvement.

The framework consists of systematization of most of existing scientific results of verbal representation, structuring of the concept of ""money"" in the context of Russian, English, German, French languages. A comparative analysis of the ways and means of language representation of the concept ""money"" in Russian, English, German, French, sets the combination of versatile and specific features that embody the nature of the concept of ""money"" in these national languages. The obtained scientific findings represent the opportunities of an embodiment of the general cultural concept of ""money"" in national linguocultures. The practical value is determined by the fact that the obtained structured scientific data in the specified conceptual field can be used by scientists when developing linguoculturological dictionaries of basic concepts of European culture, as well as in the development of training courses, for which these dictionaries will become a content database.",TRUE,FALSE,concept|European culture.|language representation|money|national language,2019-07-20T21:36:01.343632,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:35:49.173604,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/citation/,2kys6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa4ccd2aa0d90018d2fc86/,5caa4ccd2aa0d90018d2fc86,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kys6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2kys6/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2kys6

The transition from a student into a pre-service teacher and turn out into an effective teacher is a challenging task in the teaching field. We all know the nexus between the significant roles of a lesson plan in an effective teaching-learning process. This study aims to analyze the pre-service trainee teachers' attitudes, ideas, and obstacles in designing lesson plans. The sample involved pre-service teachers who enrolled in a teaching practice course at the College of Education and Arts Northern Border University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Fifty pre-service trainee teachers participated in the research and the data collected through casual informal interviews, daily and weekly lesson plans. This study used a methodological triangulation research design that combined ways of quantitative and qualitative data collection. This method offers better and localized insights about pre-service teachers’ attitudes of the lesson plan designing. Also analyze the problems in organizing and arranging the information related to the lesson or topic. The finding of the research revealed that the pre-service trainee teachers were well aware of lesson planning and its importance but, they found some problems during their planning.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-20T21:35:46.006830,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:35:22.972648,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/citation/,edjcb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa4c272aa0d90016d3f346/,5caa4c272aa0d90016d3f346,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edjcb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/edjcb/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/edjcb
