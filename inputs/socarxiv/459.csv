Bias and Bayesian affective polarization,"I present a model of affective polarization---growth in hostility over time between two parties---via quasi-Bayesian inference.  In the model, two agents repeatedly choose actions.  Each choice is based on a balance of concerns for private interests and the social good.  More weight is put on private interests when an agent's character is intrinsically more self-serving and when the other agent is believed to be more self-serving.  Each agent Bayesian updates about the other's character, and dislikes the other more when she is perceived as more self-serving.  I characterize the effects on growth in dislike of three biases: a prior bias against the other agent's character, the false consensus bias, and limited strategic thinking.  Prior bias against the other's character remains constant or declines over time, and actions do not diverge.  The other two biases cause actions to become more extreme over time and repeatedly be ``worse'' than expected, causing mutual growth in dislike, i.e., affective polarization.  The magnitude of dislike can become arbitrarily large---even when both players are arbitrarily ``good'' (unselfish).  The results imply that seemingly irrelevant cognitive biases can be an important cause of the devolution of relationships, in politics and beyond, and that subtlety and unawareness of bias can be key factors driving the degree of polarization.",TRUE,FALSE,affective polarization,2018-10-19T13:22:05.081917,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T13:21:51.058026,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/citation/,58sru,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uxjae/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/relationships/node/,uxjae,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc74c418811c10019567033/,5bc74c418811c10019567033,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58sru/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58sru,NA

Less is known about how discrimination varies in multi-ethnic societies, where the ethnic composition of populations is different across locations. Inter-group contact and institutional arrangements for ethnic minorities can mitigate the sense of group threat and reduce discrimination. To provide empirical evidence of this, we conduct a field experiment of ethnic discrimination in Russia with a sample of over 9,000 job applications. We compare ethnically homogeneous cities and cities with ethnically mixed populations and privileged institutional status of ethnic minorities. We find strong discrimination against visible minorities in the former but much weaker discrimination in the latter.

This reconfiguration used cultural and religious fundamentalism in the form of Hindutva as its instrument to assert their right to access the resources and strive towards a non-State centric redistribution. However, this new middle class, which was mainly conversing in the vernacular and had its base in the smaller urban areas, was also faced with the assertion of the lower class identarian groups. In such a situation, a large section of the urban Indian middle class shied away from taking part in the electoral process citing moral crises of the corrupt secular English speaking elite on one hand and the lowly criminal nature of the lower class political assertion on the other. Taking hints from the works of Christophe Jaffrelot, I would try to argue in this paper, that non-participation of a major section of the urban middle class was a manifestation of securing the rechanneled and partially redistributed rent legitimised through the instrument of Hindutva. This has led to increased persona-centric populist narratives from the mid-1990s to the present times with efforts to undermine parliamentary democracy (which is associated as an institiution of the immoral secular nationalists). This in turn, I would try to argue by the end of this paper, has again assisted in concretising the very rent-seeking practices and patron-client political relationships that the new middle class had initially opposed to rise to political prominence throughout the late 1970s and 1980s",TRUE,FALSE,Contemporary History|Cultural Fundamentalism|Middle Class|Political Economy|Post Colonial|Religious Fundamentalism|Rent Capitalism|Secularism|Socialism,2018-10-17T11:19:02.650804,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-17T11:18:02.145925,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/citation/,jy38u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kbmx9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/relationships/node/,kbmx9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc6fa528811c1001b55f6d2/,5bc6fa528811c1001b55f6d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy38u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jy38u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jy38u,NA

We find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior.

International Journal of Discrimination and the Law, Vol 16(2-3), 61-65","‘The Equality Act 2010: five years on’ conference was organized as a collaboration between the Forum for Research into Equality and Diversity (University of Chester) and the School of Law and Social Justice (University of Liverpool). The Equality Act 2010 has arguably been one of the most important and challenging pieces of legislation introduced in the last decade in the United Kingdom. As such, it was felt that the 5-year anniversary of its implementation provided an excellent opportunity to bring together those researching and practising in this area of law. In particular, the conference was intended to provide the opportunity for a review of the implications and impact of the legislation during this period, but also to consider the way in which it can continue to promote equality and protect against discrimination into the 21st century.

As organizers, we were keen to focus the themes of the conference around the broad range of socio-legal study taking place across the United Kingdom in relation to the Equality Act 2010. While many conferences have focussed on the implications of the legislation for practitioners and wider exploration of equality across a variety of sectors, it was felt that there were few academic gatherings permitting researchers to explore the impact of the Equality Act from a socio-legal perspective. Contributors were invited to submit papers and poster presentations across a range of themes around the legislation including, but not limited to, the public sector equality duty, intersectionality, positive action, strategic enforcement, hierarchy of protected characteristics, education, etc.

The quality and range of papers and posters submitted and presented at the conference exceeded expectations. As had been hoped, the variety of socio-legal study being carried out across the United Kingdom around the Equality Act was exceptional. The conference, therefore, provided the space and opportunity to come together to explore the implications of this work and to build upon existing dialogues and networks in order to provide a better connected and less isolated evidential basis for the future development of the legislation. The collection of articles within this publication is an excellent representation of some of the themes explored at the conference.

We study ``horse race'' news (news on candidates' chances in an upcoming election) from six major online outlets for the 2012 and 2016 US presidential campaigns. We find robust evidence that horse race headlines were slanted congenially with respect to the preferences of the outlets' typical readers. However, evidence of congenial slant in the timing and frequency of horse race stories is weaker. We also find very limited evidence of greater within-outlet demand for headlines most congenial to outlets' typical readers, and somewhat stronger evidence of greater demand for relatively \emph{uncongenial} headlines. We discuss how various aspects of our results are consistent with each of the major mechanisms driving slant studied in the theoretical literature, and may help explain when each mechanism is more likely to come into play. In particular, readers may be more likely to click on uncongenial headlines due to inferring that these stories are particularly informative when they stand in contrast to an outlet's typically congenial slant.",TRUE,FALSE,echo chambers|horse race news|media bias|media slant|polarization|selective exposure,2018-10-16T22:13:21.822344,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T22:13:06.619437,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/citation/,fy2we,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c2k56/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/relationships/node/,c2k56,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc64f058811c1001a54f681/,5bc64f058811c1001a54f681,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fy2we/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fy2we,NA
