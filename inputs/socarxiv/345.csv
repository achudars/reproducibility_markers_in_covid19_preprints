The movement is predominantly located in working class communities of color and has fought for decades to turn vacant land into beneficial community spaces. However, many of these communities are struggling with gentrification, which has the potential to transform access to and use of community gardens in the city and the politics around them. Drawing on separate multi-year ethnographic projects, this article compares two community gardens in food insecure communities in Queens and Brooklyn: one that is undergoing gentrification and one that is not. We analyze how race and class transformations in each community shape the trajectories of urban agriculture spaces, specifically the ideologies, agricultural practices, and daily interactions among gardeners and as well as between gardeners and nongardeners. We find significant differences in how the two sets of community gardeners conceptualize the purpose of their gardens, particularly in constructing them as green spaces, agricultural production sites, and tools for achieving food justice. We argue that these differences can be best understood at the intersection of the personal histories of individuals, the organizational settings in which the gardens are embedded, and each neighborhood’s history of urban renewal and gentrification. Our findings show why some community gardens in food insecure communities adopt a food justice vision, while others do not, and how gentrification can amplify racial and class tensions within community gardens and between gardeners and nongardeners.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|community gardens|ethnography|food justice|gentrification|New York City|race|urban sociology,2020-01-03T19:18:22.315179,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-03T19:18:13.033801,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/citation/,kw9zd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0f4c5357341900cf803eaa/,5e0f4c5357341900cf803eaa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw9zd/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-019-10011-w,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw9zd

Boardgames also have immense potential as naturalistic laboratories for studying psychological phenomena, providing players opportunities for small-group and interpersonal interactions with social, emotional, and cognitive consequences. Although different boardgaming motivations likely modulate these processes and outcomes, no grounded, validated instrument exists to measure them. This three-study investigation explored gaming motivations of and gratifications enjoyed by boardgamers (Study 1) and drew from this exploration to develop the Boardgaming Motivations Scale (Study 2; N = 1,045). Exploratory structural equation models provided initial evidence of the scale’s validity (Study 2). The scale was further refined, confirmed, and validated with an independent sample of less involved boardgamers (Study 3; N = 652). The diverse pool of motivations for playing boardgames inductively identified in Study 1 were reduced to seven dimensions in Study 2 and finally to six in Study 3. These dimensions reflected lusory, immersion, group sociality, community, escapism, and mastery boardgaming motivations. Relationships among these motivations and preferences for boardgame mechanics and genres, individual differences, and videogaming motivations provided initial evidence of the construct, convergent, predictive, and discriminant validity of the Boardgaming Motivations Scale.

Drawing on ethnographic data collected in the saltpans of Se-ovlje (Slovene Istria) and Janubio (Lanzarote--Canary Islands) this article examines informant`s perceptions about the awareness of the importance and the enhancement of the holistic values of both saltpans, as well as the impacts and benefits of tourism. Comparing these perceptions about both cultural landscapes, I try to suggest that the complex fruitfully relations between humans and nature in these saltpans are at odds with the neoliberal logic of nature which exploit and commoditize its resources depriving them of their respective agency. A sustainability to contrast the harmful activities of the market ought to be understood not as a simply isolation and fencing of nature for the sake of conservation, but as a preservation that need to foster the continuity of the deep interactions between human culture and non-human nature which are the core of the cultural landscapes.",TRUE,FALSE,Anthropology of tourism|Cultural anthropology|Cultural Landscapes|Culture-Nature Relations|Enhancement Of The Values|Enviromental ethics|Ethnographic fieldwork|Janubio Saltpans|Sečovlje Saltpans,2019-12-30T17:56:02.116070,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-30T17:55:09.444732,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/citation/,aswct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zg4kj/,zg4kj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e09e63b1a65e9003c72c89d/,5e09e63b1a65e9003c72c89d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aswct/,https://doi.org/10.25145/j.pasos.2019.17.048,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aswct

The amazon rainforest is a portion of the planet in which for thousands of years its human dwellers have been interacting with nature that it is understood beyond its physical condition. Thus, to what extent Amazonian’s approaches to nature could be considered as a moral philosophy through which the way of conceptualizing nature and its non-human denizens enhances the continuity of life and the intimate relations between entities?

Big data research has thus become one of the most prominent topic of discussion garnering simultaneous attention from academia and industry. This paper attempts to understand the significance of big data in current scientific research and outline its unique characteristics, otherwise unavailable from traditional data sources. We focus on how big data has altered the scope and dimension of data science thus making it severely interdisciplinary. We further discuss the significance and opportunities of big data in the domain of social science research with a scrutiny of the challenges previously faced while using smaller datasets. Given the extensive utilization of big data analytics in all forms of socio-technical research, we argue the need to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases; thereby advocating the need for creating a just and ethical big data world.",TRUE,FALSE,Artificial Intelligence|Big Data|{Data Science}|Healthcare|social media|Social science|Twitter,2019-12-29T21:35:02.520847,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-29T21:34:43.533688,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/citation/,ft27y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e08ffc01a65e9003c725571/,5e08ffc01a65e9003c725571,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft27y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ft27y/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ft27y
