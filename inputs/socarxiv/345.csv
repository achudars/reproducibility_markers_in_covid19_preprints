When put in traditional competitive settings, students worry more about their self-esteem and tend to shy away from participating in the activities, while, only those with higher level of oral skills volunteer in answering the questions. This inequity in practice causes a discrepancy in students’ performance in the oral expression exams and thus, results in a gap in the achievement. This paper suggests cooperative learning as a means to reduce the achievement gap between high and low achievers in the oral expression classes. This study is an endeavor to highlight the effectiveness of cooperative learning in reducing the disparity between high and low achievers and also to accentuate the benefits of this method in the English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. The study followed an experimental pretest-posttest non-equivalent groups design with a sample of 44 second year EFL students from the University of Khenchela, Algeria. The intervention lasted for a semester. The results showed that the achievement gap was reduced in the experimental group after using cooperative learning instructions, while the traditional method, in the control group, failed in closing the achievement gap between high and low-achievers. As a conclusion, some recommendations will be given with the aim of promoting the use of cooperative learning in the EFL classrooms as well as fostering teachers’ awareness of the effectiveness of such teaching method in improving students’ performance in oral expression.",TRUE,FALSE,Achievement gap|cooperative learning|effect size|oral skills,2019-07-17T12:20:42.349762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-17T12:20:18.441806,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/citation/,8zwah,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bf14c1c5b4a001aa47c7a/,5d2bf14c1c5b4a001aa47c7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zwah/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8zwah/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.28,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8zwah

For this purpose, 100 students (50 males and 50 females) of the intensive program from colleges of Arts, Business and Community, Saudi Arabia were administered a questionnaire. The data were analyzed quantitatively with SPSS. The findings of the study show that male and female students do not differ in their perceptions about learning to speak English and they are now becoming more aware of the growing importance of learning English. It is also found that lack of environment, interest and motivation are the most important factors that affect students’ speaking skills. In addition, female students’ perception towards English learning is more positive. The analysis also indicates that there is an undisputed agreement among the learners that English language will play an important role in Saudi Arabia.

Research has demonstrated that children’s early exposure to Bloom’s Taxonomy levels in stories has a “remarkable power” on them (Dickinson, et al. 2012) and helps develop their language and critical-thinking skills (Egan, 1997; Curtain &amp; Dahlberg 2004). The aim of this research project is to investigate the role of Bloom’s Taxonomy in the development of the vocabulary and critical-thinking skills of young Moroccan English learners. The study adopts a qualitative approach and addresses two research questions, namely, (i) To what extent does Bloom’s Taxonomy contribute to the development of the children’s vocabulary and critical thinking skills? (ii) How can the children’s vocabulary and critical-thinking skills development be justified? The comparison and analysis of the children’s story reviews at the start and end of a term reveals significant improvement, among the Moroccan young learners, especially the average ones. They are able to use a wider range of more appropriate and accurate vocabulary and to make use of a more extended, analytical and relevant discourse.

Specifically, the research focuses on the attitudes of patients and staff towards communicating in English instead of Arabic, which is the primary official language in Saudi Arabia. First, the study addresses the question of how the dominance of English language in the selected medical context affects service delivery. Second, the study explores the attitude of patients and medical staff towards the dominance of the English language. Third, the study presents a comparison of the attitude of patients and medical staff towards the use of English language. Finally, the study responds to the question of how patients' level of education influences their attitude towards the use of English at the hospital. The study is based on quantitative research, involving 60 participants, where 30 patients and 30 medical staff. The findings reveal that 86.7% of medical staff members find it challenging to communicate with their patients in English. On the same note, 60% of patients interviewed admitted that they find it difficult understanding medical practitioners when they communicate in English. The findings can have significant practical implications since they show a possible communication barrier that can be addressed to improve patient experience at Bisha King Abdullah Hospital. The findings provide statistical evidence to inform evidence-based strategies to improve communication between patients and medical practitioners at the hospital.

Realizing this research gap, this study aims to analyze Gulf Arab, Non-Gulf Arab and English Faculty expectations about their roles in English studies. The objectives of the study were to answer four research questions: Do student-faculty expectations about their classroom roles correspond on nine given items; where do the differentiations lie; what are the classroom implications of these dissimilarities; and how teachers and students can share and meet each other’s expectations. Using a mixed methods research design, quantitative data were collected from students and faculty through an online bilingual survey followed by individual interviews for further exploration. The data analysis revealed that mismatches exist in teacher-student expectations and these dissimilar beliefs can influence student-teacher relationship. Five out of nine given items were found statistically significant between English faculty and Gulf and Non-Gulf Arab students where students had higher expectations about their responsibilities; however, Gulf Arab and Non-Gulf Arab student expectations differed only on three items.

The main aim of the study is to explore the issues related to teaching reading, both from teachers as well as learners’ perspectives, so that the best teaching strategies can be adopted to achieve the desired outcomes. It assesses the ongoing prevalent scenario of learning to read in English as foreign language and observes that the learners’ difficulties are not addressed properly because the teachers/instructors are not trained well or pay less attention to reading skill. A descriptive approach has been used on a sample of instructors from various non-native English-speaking nationalities (n=60) and Saudi learners (n=146). Responses revealed that teachers’ poor awareness of teaching strategies cause poor learning outcomes. Their responses also reveals that their strategies do not take into account learners’ difficulties which somewhere cause learners’ helplessness in getting desired outcome. The results of the study elaborate how the culture and contextual knowledge play significant roles.

The role of memorization and repetition of English language structures has always been a dominant teaching attitude. This attitude has revealed unsuccessful results in promoting speaking proficiency among English language learners when communicating in real-world situations beyond the classroom context. Therefore, it is essential to address such practices and shed light on some of the issues that hinder English Language Learners (ELLs) from effectively using English in real-world communicative situations. This review paper focuses on ELT practices that have been unsuccessful in promoting English language learners’ speaking proficiency. Additionally, it provides implications for classroom teaching instructions that integrate authentic tasks and materials. Implementing meaningful tasks that represent real-world situations could be a promising solution for enhancing ELLs’ language competencies to enable them to transfer the language they learn to real-life situations beyond school settings.

Readability is a practical consideration when making decisions on materials to match a text with target readers’ proficiency.  However, few studies have compared the readability levels of teaching and testing materials in terms of the difficulty of passages.  The present study, therefore, aims to explore the readability levels and the linguistic characteristics of reading passages in English textbooks and the Thai National Education English Test based on three readability formulas and eight aspects of linguistic characteristics as provided by the Coh-Metrix computational tool.  Two sets of corpora were generated and analyzed by using Coh-Metrix as the main instrument.  The obtained data from the reading passages compiled in the English textbooks and the Thai national education English test were compared to explore the significant differences.  The results revealed a mismatch in the readability levels and linguistic characteristics.  Passages from the English textbooks are easier than those used in the English test.  It is recommended that all stakeholders in both teaching and testing administration be aware of the different levels of readability between reading passages.  More considerations should be made when preparing the teaching and testing materials because a suitable difficulty level will ensure that students receive the most benefit from the materials.  Moreover, an incongruity could affect students’ learning and testing performance.",TRUE,FALSE,Coh-Metrix|English tests|English textbooks|readability|reading passages,2019-07-21T21:26:22.088936,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:25:55.283979,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/citation/,bkp54,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2be6721c5b4a001da2028b/,5d2be6721c5b4a001da2028b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkp54/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bkp54/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.20,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bkp54

General weakness among learners opting for English majors and undergraduate learners of the English language is noted. Different learners are unaware of learning styles most suited to them. This research discussed the necessity for sensitizing university teachers towards the contributing factors in the success or failure of teaching and learning the English Language in Saudi Arabia. Teaching-learning processes would be fruitful if the syllabus designers, teachers, and learners become aware of important factors like teacher’s characteristics, learners’ characteristics, teaching materials, and educational institutions. This study aimed to emphasize the role of the English language teacher in facilitating learning processes, through conducting active research of English language learners at Wadi Ad-Dawasir in Saudi Arabia.
