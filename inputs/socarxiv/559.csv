We argue that multilevel models involving cross-level interactions should always include random slopes on the lower-level components of those interactions. Failure to do so will usually result in severely anti-conservative statistical inference. Monte Carlo simulations and illustrative empirical analyses highlight the practical relevance of the issue. Using European Social Survey data, we examine a total 30 cross-level interactions. Introducing a random slope term on the lower-level variable involved in a cross-level interaction, reduces the absolute t-ratio by 31% or more in three quarters of cases, with an average reduction of 42%. Many practitioners seem to be unaware of these issues. Roughly half of the cross-level interaction estimates published in the European Sociological Review between 2011 and 2016 are based on models that omit the crucial random slope term. Detailed analysis of the associated test statistics suggests that many of the estimates would not meet conventional standards of statistical significance if estimated using the correct specification. This raises the question how much robust evidence of cross-level interactions sociology has actually produced over the past decades.",TRUE,FALSE,Comparative Research|Context Effects|Hierarchical Data|Multi-level and Hierarchichal Models,2018-07-02T13:30:49.070465,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-11T16:55:58.322379,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/citation/,bwqtd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mqu7z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/relationships/node/,mqu7z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a578374bcf403000fd0c635/,5a578374bcf403000fd0c635,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwqtd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bwqtd/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcy053,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bwqtd

Prison privatization is one area in which market rationality is particularly salient. This paper presents a case study of how market rationality was deployed in public discourse on prison privatization. It answers four questions: (1) Who shaped public discourse on prison privatization?, (2) How frequently were market-rational themes invoked in the public discourse?, (3) Who employed (and who avoided) market-rational themes in the discourse?, and (4) Why did rates of market-rational discourse change over time? To answer these questions, the paper analyzes public discourse in four major American newspapers from 1985 to 2008. It employs a series of descriptive statistics and regression analyses, as well as an underutilized method--formal decomposition analysis. The research contributes to historical knowledge of the development of prison privatization; methodological techniques for analyzing textual data; and theoretical understanding of how public actors engage in discursive struggles over the meaning of criminal justice policies.",TRUE,FALSE,content analysis|criminal justice|framing|media|private prisons,2018-07-02T13:30:47.000631,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-10T21:39:54.002639,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Brett C.

In this research, we use descriptive and survey methods to investigate and describe the general characteristics of respondents and inference that is calculated using sample values of the statistics and then, through estimating or testing the statistical hypothesis, generalizes the statistics to the parameters of society. The statistical population of this study was all real and legal members of the Chamber of Commerce in Kashan city (500 subjects) from among which the sample size is calculated to 220 using the Morgan table. Validity of the questionnaire was assessed through face validity and based on the opinion of some university professors and Cronbach's alpha test was used for the reliability of the questions in the questionnaire where the obtained coefficient is equal to 0.941 which indicates a very good relationship between the questionnaire's questions.
Three hypotheses were also suggested in this research, that there is a meaningful relationship between the activities of the Chamber of Commerce, the participation of the real and legal members of this organization and the satisfaction of its members with the activities of the Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development of the city. The obtained results indicated that all three factors affect the economic development of the city and have a meaningful relationship with each other. At first, the activities of the chamber of commerce, then the satisfaction of the real and legal members of the Chamber of Commerce of Kashan, and finally the participation of the real and legal members of the chamber of commerce, respectively, have the highest impact on the city economic development variable.

However, little is known about whether consumers will switch to a TOU tariff or what might increase uptake if switching rates are lower than required. This paper presents the results of a systematized review and meta-analysis combining the results of 66 measures of uptake to a variety of TOU tariffs across 27 studies conducted in six countries. It provides the first robust estimate of consumer demand and correlates of demand for TOU tariffs that is not based on the results from just a single study or tariff. Four main conclusions emerge. First, if consumers are left to opt-in to TOU tariffs, uptake could be as low as 1% unless efforts are made to close the intention-action gap, otherwise enrolment could reach 43%. Second, if enrolment is opt-out, uptake could approach 100%. Third, whilst national surveys indicate the potential appetite for TOU tariffs in a population, they are insufficient for predicting future TOU tariff adoption rates; the median proportion of domestic energy bill payers who say they would be willing to switch to a TOU tariff in national surveys is five times higher than the median enrolment rate to commercially available TOU tariffs. Fourth, real-time pricing tariffs, in which the price of electricity varies freely throughout the day, are less popular than static TOU tariffs which have fixed peak and off-peak rates. This paper discusses the limitations of opt-out enrolment for TOU tariffs and presents results suggesting that small upfront financial payments, bill protection and automation are promising alternative methods of increasing opt-in enrolment.

Historians have been slow to examine the powerful and deeply troubling implications of Carmi’s work, which invites exploration of how a once extensive population of Jews in the Roman Empire could have been almost completely extinguished during the Medieval era.  This paper examines several possible historical hypotheses that have been put forth to explain Carmi’s so-far uncontested scientific finding, and concludes that the most powerful contributor to the decimation of the root population in the Roman Empire was likely to have been religious-inspired violence taking place during the lengthy period of the Crusades and immediately after the Black Plague epidemic.",TRUE,FALSE,Crusades|Genetics|Genocide|Jewish History|Medieval History,2018-07-02T11:33:33.910490,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-05T17:09:11.562387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce3|Arts and Humanities|History|European History,James M.

Primarily, we need to address the problem of potential unequal access to and the monopolization of the rejuvenation technology.",TRUE,FALSE,death|human enhancement|life extension|rejuvenation,2018-07-02T11:33:32.138656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-04T18:24:33.742503,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/citation/,zsru4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t2r6m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/relationships/node/,t2r6m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a4decdca92acf001057a4d6/,5a4decdca92acf001057a4d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsru4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zsru4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zsru4

Our data are based on locations of megalithic graves from Funnel Beaker societies (3700-2800 BCE) in the area of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Using these locations, we apply methods of point pattern analysis in order to reconstruct the spatial processes that created the sample: We use density based measures to show the influence of first order effects on the dataset. While first order effects are related to the underlying areal characteristics of the point locations and hence are determinant of their intensity, second-order effects are the result of interactions between points. We conduct distance related approaches, e.g.\ focusing on nearest neighbor characteristics, in order to investigate the interaction between the points. The point pattern analyses is complemented by integrating geomorphometric measures that are indirectly indicative for some general environmental conditions, even in prehistoric times. This helps (a) to relate first-order effects to societal or environmental features and (b) to understand the specific pattern of interactions between the points. The necessary raw data in form of digital elevation models are freely available for large parts of the globe. All analyses are conducted using free and open source software in order to provide their limitless application.",TRUE,FALSE,funnel beaker|geomorphometry|gis|neolithic|point pattern|R,2018-07-02T11:33:32.100556,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-04T18:23:36.397614,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/citation/,vh5g2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q7jbc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/relationships/node/,q7jbc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a4ddef5f853370011edf214/,5a4ddef5f853370011edf214,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh5g2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vh5g2/,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25316-9_4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vh5g2
