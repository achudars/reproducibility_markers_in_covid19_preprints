This process of collective centering works as an effective “exclusionary practice” that I argue hinders both the scholarly and political potential of this field. This article examines the transformation of the status of the subfield alongside an examination of women’s contributions to feminist scholarship on masculinities, and an emergent politics of citation that works to reproduce inequality within this subfield. In addition to identifying the processes by which a small group of white men have accumulated a disproportionate amount of power and status within “masculinities studies” as problematic, I also question the lack of critical dialogue and debate between various subfields examining systems of power and structured advantage. Here, I put masculinities studies into conversation with whiteness studies, critical heterosexualities studies, research on elites, and more to argue that there should be more dialogue between scholars doing research in these areas. Disrupting exclusionary practices in masculinities studies with both political and practical intent will better situate feminist scholars of masculinities to adapt their scholarship to transformations in the character and form of durable systems of inequality as well as identifying emergent processes and mechanisms of social reproduction.",TRUE,FALSE,hegemonic masculinity|masculinities|masculinities studies|politics of citation,2018-08-04T19:03:01.486198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T19:02:38.317910,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Sage,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/citation/,kvxsj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d69tn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/relationships/node/,d69tn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6543407e433e001803c7d7/,5b6543407e433e001803c7d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kvxsj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kvxsj,https://doi.org/10.1177/1097184X18805547

Greetings such as-‘Assalamualeikum’ (‘peace be with you’), ‘God bless’, ‘Shalom’ (‘peace’) are used by people to identify oneself with a particular faith (Muslim, Christian and Jewish respectively). Thus, language use serves here as a means of constructing religious identity. Region and tribe specific dialects, accents and sociolects are also used to construct regional, social class, ethnic or tribal identities. This process of identity construction occurs both in the real world as well as in a virtual reality on-line, where people can either take their real identity with them or construct an on-line identity that can be as divergent as they wish. As on-line communication gains significance in everyone’s life, research on the nature of this communication is required to uncover various underlying issues governing this type of communication. In this respect, the present study aimed to explore the strategies and ways in which language and other means were used by Saudi Arabian youths to construct and enact their various identities such as gender, social class, tribal, regional, religious etc. To this end, a social networking website was designed and Saudi youths (aged between 18 to 30 years) were invited to participate by posting and chatting online on the website. Of such posts, around 300 comments were selected for the content analysis. The analysis of these comments posted by 71 Saudi females and 85 males over two months revealed that Saudi youths used their language on-line to construct and enact their gender, tribal, regional, religious identities.

The research aimed to explore university students’ use of social media applications and their role in language learning, with a focus on how mobile devices can best be utilised. It analysed the attitudes of 102 learners towards the use of social media to improve language learning both inside and outside the classroom setting. Students of both genders completed a questionnaire, and five students engaged in semi-structured interviews. The aim was to discover whether the students are currently using social media applications to enhance their language skills, and what the students’ attitudes are towards the use of social media via mobile devices inside and outside the classroom. Prior to designing the research instruments, the literature was reviewed, including examining the attitudes of learners in different countries towards mobile technologies, and to decide on the best approach to take in examining attitudes towards new forms of learning. Based on the findings from the literature, appropriate questions were devised, and these reveal an overall positive response towards from the student participants towards using social media and mobile technologies to facilitate learning English.

The design used is a quasi-experimental with purposive sampling technique. Sixty students of Junior High School 13 Banjarmasin were used as the samples. 8-E was chosen as the experimental group and was taught by using computer-based reading in three meetings, while 8-F was chosen as the control group and was taught without using computer-based reading in three meetings. Three instruments were used to gather the data, they are documentation, observation, and tests. The results showed that both groups gained change in their achievements. From the calculation result, the experimental group got the average score of 53.33 in pre-test and 63.33 in post-test. The control group got average score 47 in pre-test and 49.5 in post-test. After conducting a t-test, it was revealed that the calculated t-value was greater than t-table (3.597 &gt; 2.00) at the significance level 0.05. Thus, there are different achievement between the experimental group and the control group. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proper use of computer-based reading can upgrade students’ reading comprehension ability. It is suggested to teachers to consider the use computer-based reading as the method of teaching reading comprehension.",TRUE,FALSE,computer-based reading|ICT|Indonesian students|reading comprehension|teaching reading,2018-08-04T02:14:05.459581,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T02:13:46.169131,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/citation/,nse6p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6pdz4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/relationships/node/,6pdz4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6502647e433e001703ac56/,5b6502647e433e001703ac56,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nse6p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nse6p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nse6p,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.16

The sample of the study is 45 students of English Department who took Tourism and Guiding II in the sixth semester 2016/2017 as the elective subject. The researchers adopted exploratory study by distributing questionnaires on the communication effectiveness, learning effectiveness and You–tube Live Streaming implementation. The instrument had 15 items in which each point had five items with a three –point Likert scale. The findings show that the communication effectiveness of YTL was considered good in spite of the absence of the teacher and the noise disturbance, the learning effectiveness was increasing due to the students’ own learning style, comfortable feeling and the repetition of video display. To implement YTL teachers’ digital literacy is highly needed. On the implementation of YouTube –live streaming for teaching it is the responsibility of the school or campus management. The researchers recommends conducting further study on teachers’ digital literacy, and teachers’ made YouTube-live streaming materials.",TRUE,FALSE,communication|teaching and learning|You Tube Live Streaming,2018-08-04T01:33:24.510456,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:32:51.684104,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/citation/,kuvj5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cdy5g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/relationships/node/,cdy5g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b65013b2ce07600192d8cc4/,5b65013b2ce07600192d8cc4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kuvj5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kuvj5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kuvj5,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.15
