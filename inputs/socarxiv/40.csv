Simultaneously, less attention has been paid to the variation in academic pathologies between research fields, as most empirical studies focus on one particular discipline. We propose that academic discipline is one of several systematic factors that might contribute to academic misbehavior. Drawing on a neo-institutional approach, we argue that on the academic periphery, the norm of textual originality has not drawn equal support across different research fields depending on its level of internationalization. Using plagiarism detection software, we analyzed 2,405 doctoral dissertations randomly selected from all dissertations defended in Russia between 2006 and 2016. We measured the globalization of each academic discipline by calculating the share of publications indexed in the global citation database in relation to overall output. Our results showed that, with an average share of detected borrowings of over 19%, the incidence of plagiarism on the academic periphery is remarkably higher than in Western countries. Overall, disciplines closely follow the pattern of higher globalization associated with a lower percentage of borrowed text. We also found that unauthorized borrowing is less prevalent at research-oriented institutions supporting global ethical standards. Our findings suggest that it might be misleading to measure the prevalence of academic misconduct on the academic periphery without paying attention to variations at the disciplinary level.",TRUE,FALSE,academic culture|academic misconduct|Academic plagiarism,2021-04-08T12:09:24.876998,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-08T12:07:26.476786,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",Katerina Guba,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/citation/,u8qwz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606ef031f2ad330362a739f8/,606ef031f2ad330362a739f8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8qwz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u8qwz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u8qwz,NA

Although the validity of SCAN is contested in literature, various (law enforcement) agencies across the globe are trained in using the technique.

Based on a scoping review and an open- and closed-ended survey, we identified practitioners’ and scholars’ prevailing perceptions on the use(fulness) of SCAN.

Such litigation remains largely untested in most biodiversity hotspots and in response to leading drivers of  biodiversity loss, including illegal wildlife trade. Yet, liability litigation is a potentially ground-breaking conservation strategy to remedy biodiversity harm by seeking legal remedies such as species rehabilitation, public apologies, habitat conservation and education, with the goal to make the injured parties “whole”.  However, most countries face a lack of precedent cases, limited expert guidance and the gap between legal practitioners and scientists.  We propose a simplified framework for developing conservation lawsuits across countries and conservation contexts. We explain liability litigation in terms of three dimensions: 1) defining the harm that occurred, 2) identifying appropriate remedies to that harm, and 3) understanding what remedies the law and courts will allow. We illustrate the framework via a hypothetical lawsuit against an illegal orangutan trader in Indonesia. We highlight that conservationists’ expertise is essential to characterizing harm and identifying remedies, and could more actively contribute to strategic, science-based litigation.  This would identify priority contexts, target defendants responsible for egregious harm, propose novel and meaningful remedies, and build new transdisciplinary collaborations.",TRUE,FALSE,civil law|conservation|environmental justice|environmental law|justice|lawsuit|litigation|natural resources,2021-04-08T12:13:26.323387,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-08T12:10:02.985203,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/citation/,s4x8c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606ed833f2ad330346a7c864/,606ed833f2ad330346a7c864,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4x8c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s4x8c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s4x8c,NA

Researchers of cultural evolution have studied the many biases that enable solutions and behaviours to spread socially from one human to the next, selecting from whom we copy and what we copy. In a digital society, algorithmic and human agents both contribute to transmission of knowledge. One hypothesis is that machines may influence the patterns of social transmission not only by providing a means for spreading human behavior but also by providing novel behaviors themselves. We propose that certain algorithms might show (either by learning or by design) different behaviors, biases and problem-solving abilities than their human counterparts. This may in turn foster better decisions in environments where diversity in problem-solving strategies is beneficial. In this study, we ask whether machines with complementary biases to humans could boost cultural evolution in a lab-based planning task, where humans show suboptimal biases. We conducted a large behavioral study and an agent-based simulation to test the performance of transmission chains with human and machine players. In half of the chains, an algorithmic bot replaced a human participant. We show that the bot boosts the performance of immediately following participants in the chain, but this gain is lost for participants further down the transmission chain. Our findings suggest that machines can potentially improve performance, but human bias can hinder machine solutions from being preserved, especially under conditions of uncertainty or high cognitive load. Our results suggest that the conditions for hybrid social learning and cultural evolution may be limited by task environment and human biases.",TRUE,FALSE,collective intelligence|cultural evolution|hybrid intelligence|machine behavior|machine culture|reinforcement learning|social learning,2021-04-08T12:14:43.873667,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-08T12:10:55.961692,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/5j6es/,available,NA,https://osf.io/bvkwp/,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/citation/,pfdcv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5j6es/,5j6es,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606ed6c0f6585f0336617326/,606ed6c0f6585f0336617326,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfdcv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pfdcv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pfdcv,NA

The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented closures of this critical resource in spring 2020. In the fall of 2020, school districts across the country reopened under varied instructional modes. Some school districts returned to in-person instruction; some operated remotely. Others reopened under hybrid models, wherein students alternated times, days, or weeks of in-person instruction. To capture this variation, we developed the Elementary School Operating Status (ESOS) database. ESOS provides data on elementary school districts’ primary operating status in the first grading period of the 2020-2021 school year, covering 25 million students in over 9,000 school districts in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In this research note, we introduce these data and show extensive variation in school operating status at the state and school district levels. We show that school districts with greater representation of Black and Hispanic students were less likely to offer in-person instruction. We also show that fewer in-person elementary school instruction days was associated with reductions in maternal employment.

The existing studies mainly focus on investigating the sources of difficulties during the translation process. Although the studies employ different analytical approaches, the conclusion in almost all investigations is that the decisive objective during the translation process is the transfer or production of the appellative effect. This study investigates which strategies are employed during translation into Croatian and German and why, as well as possible diachronic changes in the choice of translation strategies.

In practice, a large majority are still deprived of maternity benefits. A recent survey, conducted in six states of north India, brings out that pregnant women’s basic needs for nutritious food, proper rest and health care are rarely satisfied. Among women who had delivered a child during the 6 months preceding the survey, about half said that they had been eating less rather than more during pregnancy, and nearly 40 per cent complained of a lack of rest at that time. The figures are much worse in states like Uttar Pradesh, where, for instance, one third of the same women had not had a single ante-natal checkup. Average weight gain during pregnancy was just 7 kg over nine months in this sample, down to 4 kg in Uttar Pradesh. Aside from poor nutrition, lack of rest appears to be a major factor of low weight gain during pregnancy. There is an urgent need for better recognition of the special needs of pregnancy, provision of maternity benefits in accordance with the law, and better support for pregnant women including quality health care.",TRUE,FALSE,childbirth|India|maternal and child health|maternity entitlements|pregnancy,2021-04-07T13:51:41.449619,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-07T13:50:20.471980,FALSE,NA,no,"Data used in the paper comes from a primary survey conducted by us in mid-2019.

In such an atmosphere, introducing Imam Ali (A.S.) as a model of asceticism, science, justice, anti-oppression, bravery, and Islamic kindness can bring hope and liberation for today's human beings. For this, it is essential to demonstrate the kind of attitudes and views of Islamic religions towards Imam Ali (A.S.) and introduce his virtues and characters from their words. Depicting the image of Imam Ali (A.S.) in Kutub al-Sittah of the Sunni hadith, which is a well-known Sunni hadith collection, enables us to reach our objectives. The authors of Kutub al-Sittah have confirmed the great moral and scientific characteristics and endeavors of Imam Ali (A.S.) and the interest of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to him by narrating a part of virtues and characters of Molaye Mottaghian.
About Imamah and Wilaya (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist), there are few but succeeding narrations in Kutub al-Sittah, which can be a valuable way to prove his proficiency for the Wilaya and leadership of the ummah after Muhammad (PBUH). Though the authors of Kutub al-Sitta have worked to justify the process of the Caliphate after the death of Muhammad (PBUH) by narrations to deny his administratorship, especially from Aisha Bint Abi Baker, it is plausible to realize his preponderance in leading the religious and materialistic affairs of the people, after the Prophet (PBUH) by reviewing Kutub al-Sittah of the Sunni hadith and according to the narrations on virtues and characters of Imam Ali (A.S.).",TRUE,FALSE,Ali Ibn Abi Talib|Al-Sihah Al-Sittah|Hadith|Kutub al-Sittah of the Sunni hadith|Tradition,2021-04-07T13:52:20.951986,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-07T13:50:58.201142,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cae|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Islamic Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/citation/,7cz4d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606d940ef2ad3302b5a79eff/,606d940ef2ad3302b5a79eff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cz4d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7cz4d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7cz4d,NA
