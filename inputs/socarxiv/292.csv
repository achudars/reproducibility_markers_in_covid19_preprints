The first report established a causal association between smoking and lung cancer, and subsequent reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable causes of death to include other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and respiratory diseases. For a second level of causes of death, the current evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship with smoking. This study draws on 1980–2004 U.S. vital statistics data and applies a cause-specific version of the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth indirect method, which uses the association between lung cancer death rates and death rates for other causes of death to estimate the fraction and number of deaths attributable to smoking overall and by cause. Nearly all of the established and additional causes of death are positively associated with lung cancer mortality, suggesting that the additional causes are in fact attributable to smoking. I find 420,284 annual smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ for years 2000–2004, 14% of which are due to the additional causes. Results corroborate recent estimates of cause-specific smoking-attributable mortality using prospective cohort data that directly measure smoking status. The U.S. Surgeon General should reevaluate the evidence for the additional causes and consider reclassifying them as causally attributable to smoking.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-11-09T16:39:22.536314,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-09T16:38:58.445529,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/citation/,wf2b6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc6e6ac7f37e3000dcb5759/,5dc6e6ac7f37e3000dcb5759,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wf2b6/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100349,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wf2b6

However, the consequences of this large- scale institutional change for the educational inequality between children from different social class backgrounds in East Germany continue to be poorly understood. This article seeks to shed new light on this question by using a quasi-experimental approach to examine the difference in educational inequality between East and West Germany before and after German unification. We compare changes in the class gradient in educational attainment in East and West Germany across six birth cohorts, including three cohorts of individuals who completed their schooling after unification. Contrasting with past findings, our results show that before unification, educational inequality at the mid-secondary, upper-secondary and tertiary level was substantially lower in East Germany than in West Germany and that unification led to a substantial and sustained convergence of the level of educational inequality in East Germany towards that of West Germany.",TRUE,FALSE,Central and Eastern Europe|Difference-in-difference design|Educational inequality|Education policy|Equality of opportunity|German unification|Intergenerational social mobility|Market transition|Post-socialist transition|State socialism,2019-11-09T16:37:21.613396,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-09T16:37:06.374171,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4f|Education|Vocational Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5f|Education|International and Comparative Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d64|Education|Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/citation/,bythr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc6a93d8f0e5e000bd02cb5/,5dc6a93d8f0e5e000bd02cb5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bythr/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcz012,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bythr

This paper draws on data from 2,926 adults interviewed in the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health to examine how marital status, categorized as never, formerly, monogamously, and polygynous married, and number of children is associated with psychological well-being. With respect to marital status, we find that women in polygynous unions fare worse than monogamously married women and this detrimental effect is stronger for women than for men. Formerly married men and women of reproductive age experience the worst psychological outcomes, although this association wanes with age. In contrast, the benefits of having children is only evident among older Malawians, especially women.

These types of tools often define transitional industries including those at the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition, suggesting a variety of behavioral interpretations for the supposed evolution of Middle Paleolithic toolkits to Upper Paleolithic toolkits. Here we test an alternative hypothesis that transitional assemblages formed via secondary recycling of stone artifacts produced by two technologically divergent populations. Results from the application of an agent-based model indicate how ordered sets of assemblages resembling archaeological transitional sequences can result from the combination of simple recycling behaviors and periods of sediment deposition and erosion. This implies that some transitional assemblages could have formed without the interaction of different populations and/or without technological evolution.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|lithic recycling|lithic scavenging|transitional industries,2019-11-08T19:51:02.126644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-08T19:50:43.553428,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/citation/,fg3zt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mn2kc/,mn2kc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc48592ee9bb9000c498b48/,5dc48592ee9bb9000c498b48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fg3zt/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41982-020-00055-4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fg3zt

The question we ask is how financialized capitalism shapes and formats the politics of the future. Our central tenet is that, far from providing an engine ’imagining’ futures that substantively guide (collective) actions, finance ‘consumes’ forecasts, plans, or visions in its present coordination process. While the “oscillation” between present futures and future presents has been identified as a defining feature of modern conceptions of contingency, freedom, and choice (Luhmann; Esposito), these two temporal modalities are collapsed in contemporary financial markets in an ongoing ‘pricing in’ of various possible future states. Projected futures do not substantively shape collective paths towards them or instruct social learning, but are calculatively assimilated to improve coordination between present prices.  Fatally, central banks have been at the forefront of “synchronist” (Langenohl) finance, believing that as long as numeric calibration of their own and the markets’ expectations as expressed in prices align, they have rendered capitalism governable. Under this regime, central banks really do not govern inflation, but inflation expectations as expressed in the “yield curve” and built into interest rate derivatives. We argue that financial techniques built on the efficient market hypothesis and the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, as two theoretical articulations of this modern “synchronist” (Langenohl) temporality of finance, allow central banks to ignore possible “random” fluctuations in actual inflation and concentrate on the internal calibration of present futures as the sole criterion for monetary policy success. We show that the resultant “assault” on “future presents” was an important factor in the run-up to the crisis of 2007-9. Central banks deliberately attempted to eliminate uncertainties in markets about the future course of monetary policies. For that purpose, shared fictions about the underlying logics of Western economies (real interest rates, NAIRU etc.) were rigidly built into the structures of asset prices. Moreover, since central banks and market actors aligned their expectations over real interest rates, market actors could act as if their uncertainties about future liquidity needs could be neglected, since current money market and official lending rates were supposed to already define the price of liquidity tomorrow. In the last part of the contribution, we will extend this argument to contemporary quantitative easing, to show how it reinforces the pitfalls of generating expectations of economic prosperity and stability via the contemporary financial system.",TRUE,FALSE,central banks|derivatives|expectation|finance|financial markets|financial system|future|futurity|monetary policy|temporality,2019-11-08T19:44:42.164984,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-08T19:44:14.020307,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/citation/,8dyq2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc456a9bb21c7000d8a193f/,5dc456a9bb21c7000d8a193f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8dyq2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8dyq2

For models with statistical significance levels determined via randomization models of inference and for which there is no standard error or confidence intervals for the estimate itself, these plots appear less useful. In this paper, I illustrate a variant of the coefficient plot for regression models with p-values constructed using permutation tests. These visualizations plot each estimate's p-value and its associated confidence interval in relation to a specified alpha-level. These plots can help the analyst interpret and report both the statistical and substantive significance of their models.

By combining this data with on-the-ground observations of visitation to water recreation areas in New England, we fit a model to estimate daily visitation for four months to over 500 sites. The results show the potential for this new big data source of human mobility to overcome limitations in traditional methods of estimating visitation and to provide consistent information at policy-relevant scales. The high-resolution information in both space and time provided by cell phone location derived data creates opportunities for developing next-generation models of human interactions with the natural environment. However, the opaque and rapidly developing methods for processing locational information by the data providers required a calibration and validation against data collected by traditional means to confidently reproduce the desired estimates of visitation.",TRUE,FALSE,Ecosystem Services|Environmental Economics|Human Mobility Data|Social Sciences,2019-11-08T19:47:41.841286,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-08T19:47:27.867276,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/citation/,3nx2v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k54tz/,k54tz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc439fc96af97000e1b626c/,5dc439fc96af97000e1b626c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nx2v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3nx2v/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3nx2v

Adopting children out of the household can, however, also be seen as a strategy for dealing with excess children. This topic is the focus of our article, which investigates who was given away for adoption and why in Taiwan during the period 1906-1940. The Taiwan Historical Household Register Database (THHRD), which can take changing household composition over time into account, is analysed using univariate and Cox proportional-hazard analyses. Results demonstrate that gender, birth position among siblings of the same sex, and variation across place and time are the most important factors explaining the likelihood of being adopted for all children. Socio-economic position also played an important role and the presence of a grandfather and grandmother lowered the likelihood of being adopted especially for boys, while only the presence of a grandmother had the same effect for girls. Moreover, when looking more specifically at adoption risks for girls, the age, gender and adoption status of siblings in the household seem to matter as well, as similarly aged young siblings of either sex increased the likelihood of being adopted for girls. These findings underscore that household decision making regarding adoption is more complex than simply giving away later-born children and that it is important to also pay more attention to the reasons and motivation of households in giving away children for adoption. It provides a broader perspective on adoption practices and how children were circulated from households with too many to those with too few and how this benefitted both kinds.",TRUE,FALSE,Adoption|Birth Order|Chinese Family|little daughter-in-law|simpua|Taiwan,2019-11-08T19:33:44.296839,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-08T19:33:20.340297,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/citation/,4jb3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc3d370bb21c7000c883464/,5dc3d370bb21c7000c883464,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4jb3u/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4jb3u
