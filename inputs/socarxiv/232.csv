have contributed to the improvement of skills in developed societies in recent decades. We expect
that the growing openness of the educational system is associated with higher gains in cognitive
skills, but that there are several multiplicative and compensatory processes related to both family
background and the educational institutions involved that can alter these trends, depending on
family background. We test the assumptions with the first wave (2013) of the Program for the
International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data, linked with birth-cohort-specific,
macro-level information on the changes in educational institutions in each country. The results
suggest that the growing proportion of those with a tertiary education as well as the prolonging of
education are associated with the improvement of skills, partially because these changes are also
associated with the increased effectiveness of education in the improvement of skills. However, the
growing number of reforms in general tend to harm the skill development especially of those with
poorly educated parents, even if the reforms were intended to remove educational dead-ends.",TRUE,FALSE,competencies|education|educational expansion|institutions|INVEST Flagship Working Papers|PIAAC|reforms|skills|social change,2020-03-31T17:21:25.756896,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:20:44.981247,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,Jani Erola,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/citation/,g6a3c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e832c5f1ab2430143e03747/,5e832c5f1ab2430143e03747,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6a3c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6a3c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6a3c,NA

We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late April 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 13.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 13.0% between March 9 and April 22, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.",TRUE,FALSE,Age structure|Case fatality rate|COVID-19|Decomposition,2020-04-01T14:02:02.537149,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-01T14:01:18.705159,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/citation/,j4a3d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vdgwt/,vdgwt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e82fe468140b40118429cac/,5e82fe468140b40118429cac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j4a3d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j4a3d,NA

The $650 million dollars raised from these medical campaigns appear to have filled a sizable hole in the American social safety net. Yet crowdfunding is at heart a network process, and a large body of research shows that social networks can reproduce inequality. In this paper I show that medical crowdfunding indeed replicates patterns of racial, ethnic, and geographic income stratification as predicted by network theory. Using 2,618 GoFundMe campaigns hand-coded for perceived race and ethnicity of the recipient, I show that Black and Hispanic beneficiaries receive substantially less money via their networks than White and Asian beneficiaries. Hierarchical linear models show that social network access via online sharing does not vary by race and ethnicity. Instead I find that unequal mobilization in terms of the number and size of donations accounts for unequal returns. Variations in the number of donations can largely be explained by differences in expected network financial capital, but variations in donation size are not fully accounted for even in models including proxies for network income. In a preliminary analysis, probabilistic estimates of donor race and ethnicity indicate that donors of all races and ethnicities tend to give White recipients the largest donations and Black recipients the smallest. Overall, I demonstrate the use of “crowd insurance” in place of sufficient medical insurance reproduces existing patterns of inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,Crowdfunding|GoFundMe|Inequality|Networks,2020-03-31T17:17:22.351206,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:17:04.521773,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Mark Igra,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/citation/,g7y69,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e82d97bd0e354010eb4ca5e/,5e82d97bd0e354010eb4ca5e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g7y69/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g7y69,NA

Using the 2017-18 American Time Use Survey Leave Module, the authors investigated the association between time spent working from home – a workplace benefit known as “flexplace” – among fathers in different-sex partnerships (n = 1,956) and their time spent in housework and childcare. The authors also considered whether these associations vary by their partners’ employment status. Findings show fathers’ use of flexplace was associated with increases in fathers’ time spent in routine housework, conditional that their partners worked full-time. Concomitantly, fathers’ use of flexplace was also associated with increases in their time spent providing childcare, particularly routine care, regardless of their partners’ labor force participation.

We build on the sociological literature of fleeting encounters in bar settings to show how patrons’ use of these technologies augments the bar experience and shapes the social networks that may develop through interaction. Using seven gay, lesbian, and heterosexual bars located in Southern California as research sites, we describe how patrons invoke digital technologies as props to aid the impression management strategies used to facilitate new connections. Second, we demonstrate how these encounters are subject to greater relationship persistence as a result of the way these technologies are used to quickly create a shared history. We conclude by arguing that fleeting encounters are no longer connections that either persist or completely fade away after face-to-face interaction. Rather, they often persist through technology-mediated communications in ways that result in, at minimum, the development of weak ties. This greater relationship persistence can permit more opportunity to get to know a potential partner in digitally mediated settings like Facebook or via texting, but it could also require new strategies to evade interested others given this new lack of ephemerality and the influx of weak ties.",TRUE,FALSE,Bar Settings|Dating|Digital Technology|Relationship Persistence|Social Networks,2020-03-31T17:12:23.306744,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:11:48.038518,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/citation/,pj2kt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e821e931ab24300f1e04000/,5e821e931ab24300f1e04000,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pj2kt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pj2kt,https://doi.org/10.1002/symb.268

Research shows that heterosexuals reproduce gendered racial hierarchies through partner preferences, yet little work examines the preferences of sexual minorities, especially lesbians. Moreover, few studies examine racial heterophily (a preference for racial groups other than one’s own), which may influence interracial pairings. Using data from 4,266 Match.com dating profiles, we find that Asian, Latino, and Black lesbians and gays exhibit higher rates of racial heterophily than do Whites. Lesbians of color are less likely to self-exclude or to prefer Whites, and are more likely to not state a race preference than are minority gays. Self-exclusionary minority daters often discuss ideal masculinities and femininities in their profiles, suggesting that such exclusions are motivated by both racialized and gendered ideals for partners. Drawing on theories of homonormativity, we conclude that gays conform more to racialized, gendered ideals than do lesbians.",TRUE,FALSE,Dating|Femininity|Gender|Masculinity|Race-Ethnicity|Sexuality|Sexual Racism,2020-03-31T17:11:05.320594,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:10:48.291622,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/citation/,jk5ac,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e82193a8140b400dd4230b7/,5e82193a8140b400dd4230b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jk5ac/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jk5ac/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jk5ac,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496516686621

In this study, we draw on a sample of 1,923 lesbians on Match.com to quantitatively test whether there are racial differences in dating preferences for women with children, underscoring implications for family inequality through racial differences in who has children when looking for a partner. We find that Blacks, Latinas, and Asians are more likely than Whites to not only have children but also be open to dating other women with children, as well. This suggests race differentially structures lesbians’ openness to partners with children, and such preferences may be a possible mechanism for racial stratification.",TRUE,FALSE,Children|Dating|Lesbians|Motherhood|Race-Ethnicity|Sexuality|Social Inequality,2020-03-31T17:10:00.749181,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:09:34.386427,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/citation/,j9kfd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8215b01ab24300ede02f82/,5e8215b01ab24300ede02f82,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9kfd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9kfd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9kfd,https://doi.org/10.1080/10894160.2018.1383801

A town hall is, after all, just a building; its walls take on meaning when people breathe social life through its doors, establish a shared purpose, and form relationships with one another. But so far scholars have not well evaluated existing theories of how digital technologies do, or do not, aid in the development of community. What’s missing is a reconciliation of contemporary manifestations of social interaction with classic sociological theories of community. Taylor Dotson tackles this challenge head-on, bolstered by a staunch critique of Barry Wellman’s theory of networked individualism, or the idea that digital technologies have transformed community life to sets of relationships are less local, more global, and centered on interests rather than local necessity. “Try getting a Facebook status update to help move a couch or stay for dinner,” Dotson huffs, in an early hook. Technically Together assembles a wealth of “technology” cases – not just digital devices or internet environs, but woodstoves, bars, cooperative business, and zoning structures – and applies a framework for evaluating whether each abets, or depresses, core tenets of community. Dotson denaturalizes assumptions of not only what counts as technologies (any structure, really) but also injects a perspective as to which are technologies of community.",TRUE,FALSE,Communication and Information Technologies|Community and Urban Sociology,2020-03-31T17:28:01.159421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:27:07.618695,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/citation/,6vfd4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e82108b1ab24300eee02cd2/,5e82108b1ab24300eee02cd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vfd4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vfd4,https://doi.org/10.1177/0094306119828696g
