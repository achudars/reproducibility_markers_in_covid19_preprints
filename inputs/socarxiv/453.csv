However, political parties do not often endorse their demands. Even the centre-left, which is known for its redistributive policies, does not necessarily ally itself with the student opposition to fees. In this article, I focus on the impact of social movement- organised labour alliances on the opposition of political parties to government policy. I argue that such alliances have a unique impact on centre-left parties, especially in relation to non-labour issues. I present two examples of this alliance, emerging from the quite different political contexts of Germany and Turkey. In Germany, student movements failed to block the introduction of tuition fees in 2006. However, in 2008-2011, after students established a deeper alliance with organised labour, tuition fees were scrapped. In Turkey, student movements had been protesting tuition fees for a quarter of a century before an alliance with labour gained the support of social democrats in 2011. These case studies suggest that labour-movement alliances are effective in shifting social democratic politics in higher education policy because of the labour's experience and know-how in alliance building with centre-left parties and the student mobilization's potential to make tuition fees an electoral issue cross-cutting party allegiances. This finding suggest that scholars need to take the degree of engagement in opposition alliances into account, in addition to union density, in order to more accurately measure the political power of the organised labour. This point has implications for analysing a variety of policy outcomes in policy areas exposed to permanent austerity measures.",TRUE,FALSE,Germany|Social Movements|Student Protest|Trade Unions|Tuition Fees|Turkey,2019-04-19T20:50:12.837516,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T20:49:36.391747,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/citation/,vnbf3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cba27b7f2be3c0019074130/,5cba27b7f2be3c0019074130,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vnbf3/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0011392119865768,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vnbf3

We also elucidate how this cross-fertlization was mediated by the institutional structure of the university. We outline the role of key scholars such as Kenneth Arrow and Robert Wilson, as well as engineers turned administrators like Frederick Terman. We show that engineers largely drew upon successive economic theories of decision and allocation with a view to improving practical industrial management decisions. Reciprocally, economists found in engineering the tools (from linear programming to optimal control theory) they needed to rethink production and growth theory, an epistemology of “application” that emphasized awareness to institutional details, trials and errors and experiments to improve the design of processes and machines, and all sorts of industrial settings to operationalize their theories of decision, strategic interaction and bargaining. By the 2000s, they had turned into economic engineers designing markets and other allocation mechanisms. These cross-disciplinary exchanges were mediated by Stanford’s own institutional culture, notably its use of joint appointments, the development of multidisciplinary “programs” for students, the ability to attract a variety of visitors every year, the entrepreneurial and contract-oriented vision of its administrators, and the close ties with the industrial milieu that came to be called the Silicon Valley.",TRUE,FALSE,Arrow|economics|Engineering|History of Economics|History of Economic Thought|SocArXiv|Stanford,2019-04-19T00:10:41.476008,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T00:10:32.948961,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/citation/,adtbj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb8f615a3bc970018f5ada1/,5cb8f615a3bc970018f5ada1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adtbj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/adtbj

Local adaptation measures, such as early warning systems for floods (EWSFs), are urgently needed to reduce the risk and impact of flood events. The aim of this study was to assess community perceptions and self-reported actions in response to flooding in a tropical coastal city to inform flood risk reduction policies and programs.
Methods: This qualitative case study was conducted in flood-prone areas in Machala, Ecuador, a coastal city exposed to seasonal floods and extreme floods during El Niño events. Adult community members from three periurban sites were invited to participate. Focus groups discussions (11 focus groups in total) were held with community members (n=65 people) from September to November 2014 to assess perceptions of flood exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and current alert systems. Focus groups discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by topic; participatory maps were field validated, georeferenced, and digitized using GIS software. 
Results: Community members identified the presence of annual flooding during the rainy season, as well as greater than normal flood events (depths ranging from 0.5 to 3 meters), which recurred every 3-4 years in some communities. The deepest floods occurred during the 1982 and 1997/1998 El Niño events. Community members perceived that exposure to flooding depended on the rainfall coinciding with high ocean tides, and geographic proximity to blocked drainage areas, canals, and low local elevation. Participants reported that children were the most sensitive group due to increased susceptibility to skin infections and mosquito borne diseases (i.e., dengue fever). Other sensitive groups included the elderly, physically handicapped people, low-income families, and recent migrants. They identified persistent social-ecological vulnerabilities that increased flood risk and exposure in the urban periphery, such as inadequate access to garbage collection, homes settled in precarious low-lying geographies, economic barriers, lack of political access, and lack of social mobilization. In addition, communities expressed a lack of social capital (e.g. political voice), despite the existence of formalized community councils. Key neighborhood resources with respect to flooding included green areas, schools, nurseries, fire stations, health clinics, police stations, a retention wall (berm), and an emergency meeting place. Challenges for adaptive capacity existed primarily in actions related to the preparation and recovery stages of flooding. Despite the presence of an official flood warning system, community member relied on informal communication channels via social media. 
Conclusions: The flood vulnerability assessment framework and participatory research process utilized here can potentially inform studies in other flood-prone regions to guide the development of EWSFs and other climate change adaptation policies and actions.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|climate|community-based|early warning systems|Ecuador|El Niño|flooding|focus groups|Latin America|livelihoods|natural disasters|participatory GIS|urban|vulnerability,2019-04-19T00:13:32.116584,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T00:13:00.731145,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Latin American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/citation/,ygh92,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kzm3e/,kzm3e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb8bc4ea3bc970019f31cc2/,5cb8bc4ea3bc970019f31cc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ygh92/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ygh92

This provides a test of the accuracy of typical address based geocoding methods used in crime analysis, as well as provides evidence for how much accuracy one gains when using sensors. Examining over 1,000 shooting incidents in Wilmington, North Carolina, we find that the majority of address-based incidents are quite accurate, on average within 60 feet of the actual location (using a street centerline geocoder), or within 90 feet (using Google rooftop geocoding). However, based on the incident narrative we identify a subset of transcription errors in over 10% of the cases that increases the distance between the true shooting location and that geocoded using address data. This suggests mechanisms to prevent human errors may be more frugal than those relying on sensors in geocoding shooting incidents.

In 2016, Funk and Owen-Smith proposed novel indexes to evaluate the degree of a patent consolidating or destabilizing the technology streams (doi:10.1287/mnsc.2015.2366). Based on their methods, Wu et al.

Our research finds that the effect of NR on the disruption equation is contradictory as the sign of the disruption changes, and this problem may cause more trouble in any further work based on their indexes.

In this paper, I clarify these terms in a positive critique of the current state of the field. I then consider the ways in which the proposed framework can help analysts to bridge the divide between economics and sociology. Armed with techniques derived from formal network analysis, the new economic sociology offered the first sustained foray into economic territory, but sociological skeptics remain unsatisfied. Two broad rejoinders to this network-analytic approach emerged in the last two decades, but both correctives, nevertheless, leave the divide intact. In the last decade, however, a new paradigm is coalescing under the rubric of “relational economic sociology. While showing promise, it furthers the confusion surrounding the key concepts of “relations” and “relationships.” The proposed framework provides a foundation for constructive dialogue among the different traditions which constitute this new paradigm.",TRUE,FALSE,economic sociology|relational sociology|relational work,2019-04-17T23:01:47.086861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T23:01:15.064400,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/citation/,rfeqs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb75a0039926900181661ac/,5cb75a0039926900181661ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rfeqs/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12108-017-9336-2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rfeqs

The article maps out the terrain of diversity discourses, both as a specific type of discourse and as an example of ethical, moral and pragmatic modes of argumentation. The author examines Swedish ""diversity discourses"" in the periods of 1968-1975 and 1991-1995 in an effort to tease out the pragmatic, moral and ethical aspects of these discourses. Diversity discourses are defined as discourses regarding how much and what kind of diversity is acceptable or desirable in a society, as well as how such diversity should be handled. I find that values, both contextually-dependent ethical values and universal moral values, rather than being ""prior"" to politics, arise out of the intersection of pragmatic, ethical and moral discourses. What is moral and ethical, then is colored by the particular nexus of moral, ethical and pragmatic concerns such that what is acceptable at one particular time and location, may be unacceptable in another, even coming from the same actors with the same ideological commitments. Shifts in the ethical/moral modes of justification, then, lead to shifts in who is included in a democratic community.",TRUE,FALSE,Civil Repair|Habermas|Immigration|Morality|Politics|Sweden|Values,2019-04-17T13:43:10.440844,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:41:58.842475,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Carly Schall,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/citation/,qnwaz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb7176da3bc970017f1567d/,5cb7176da3bc970017f1567d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qnwaz/,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41290-020-00105-y,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qnwaz

The scholarship on radicalism largely portrays radical discourse as opposition to powerful ideas and enemies, but radicals often evince great interest in personal and local concerns. To shed light on how radicals use and adopt rhetoric, we analyze an original corpus of more than 23,000 pages produced by Afghan radical groups between 1979 and 2001 using a novel computational abductive approach. We first identify how radicalism not only attacks dominant ideas, actors, and institutions using a rhetoric of subversion, but also how it can use a rhetoric of reversion to urge intimate transformations in morals and behavior. Next, we find evidence that radicals’ networks of support affect the rhetorical mixture they espouse, due to social ties drawing radicals into encounters with backers’ social domains. Our study advances a relational understanding of radical discourse, while also showing how a combination of computational and abductive methods can help theorize and analyze discourses of contention.",TRUE,FALSE,Afghanistan|computational adductive analysis|radicalism|sociology of the future|text analysis,2019-04-17T13:41:44.055366,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:41:03.230135,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/citation/,yfzsh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jx756/,jx756,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb6e4dd3992690017126cbc/,5cb6e4dd3992690017126cbc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yfzsh/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122419859519,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yfzsh
