Employing the literary approach of agential realism with its new material turn, this paper investigates the ways in which Yellow-Yellow (2006) re-imagines the concept of agency through the struggling of female human protagonist, named Zilayefa, and nonhuman actors against the forces of oil exploitation.

Global or world literature then entails a literature that does not abide by the rigidity of the borders, which imprison texts within the local confinements of national identity traits. It is rather a process which allows the circulation of texts across national borders for the purpose of forming one huge hybrid culture that mixes various literary flavors. In an era of globalization and while the very notion of Western canon seems obsolete and out dated, there still exists some sort of discrimination among the texts allowed to enter the global literary canon.  Some literary texts are considered not exotic enough or too exotic to meet the expectations of a wide and translational readership. For that reason, a great number of texts is deliberately marginalized and dropped from the canon confirming then the Western monopole operating upon the marketing and publishing houses. In this view of things, the present paper addresses the particular status of the Algerian literature in French within the global literary canon. It, also, aims to analyze its resistance to translation as major obstacle to its circulation and, thus, invisibility.",TRUE,FALSE,Algerian literature written in French|in (visibility)|literary canon|translation,2019-07-25T18:42:42.122510,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:42:31.198124,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/citation/,3g59h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/meyht/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/relationships/node/,meyht,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbca28a28e68001ba4500a/,5bdbca28a28e68001ba4500a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g59h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3g59h/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3g59h

In the light of this statement this research article investigates following main questions. 1-What are those signs and practices which constitute colonial discourse? 2- How do they signify according to semiotic theory? This article is a philosophical endeavour to develop conclusive argument to determine the psycho-semiotic nature of those meaning making practices which form the very basis of the colonial discourse. The aim of this study is to establish a triangular link of the sign theory, psychological conditioning and colonial discourse. Fairclough’s (1995) triadic model of Critical Discourse Analysis has been used to analyse various linguistic practices of colonisers at Description—Interpretation—Explanation levels.  After exemplifying from various texts, the study concludes that colonial signs are psychologically conditioned, discursively conventionalised and socially upheld linguistic practices which disseminate ideas they stand for. Hence, colonialism is not only a historical fact but also a linguistically and semiotically crafted phenomenon.

The results obtained reveal that the set of conceptual metaphors underlying the political expressions are almost similar in both languages in terms of the source domains used as well as their collocation patterns.

In all of her works, Kincaid focuses greatly on the influence of the colonial project from which her nation suffered greatly in the past. This paper offers a postcolonial reading of the novel Lucy (1999).  The novel details the life of a girl who left her homeland, Antigua, and went to the United States to work as an au pair for a white family. The paper focuses on the author’s as well as the main character Lucy's anger at everything that reminded them of the colonizers, their homeland and family. This anger is seen as a form of hate traced in Lucy's reaction towards the educational system created by the colonizers, her homeland, and any authoritative figure. Lucy suggests that the educational system, which follows the British teachings, in Antigua asserts the domination of the colonizers and the humiliation of her nation. She hates her homeland because she considers it as a production made by the colonizers. Fleeing to the United States is a way to escape her past.

The research questions are: 1) How can the use of a monolingual corpus be introduced to translation students and incorporated into the translation process? 2) How does the use of a monolingual English textual corpus affect the quality of students’ translations from Arabic into English regarding collocations and phrasal verbs? The research design used is an action research where an action plan was carried out with year 1 translation students and the instruments used are pre and posttests as well as formative assessment sheets. The group of students were introduced to corpora and their applications in translation, and taught how to use the online Corpus of Contemporary American English to solve translational problems of collocations and phrasal verbs. The analysis of results revealed the extent to which the use of such corpus helped students in improving the quality of their translations. The study highlighted the importance of adopting a corpus-based approach in the translation classroom and the benefits it offers as compared to the traditional approach.",TRUE,FALSE,collocations|corpus-based approach|Corpus of Contemporary American English|phrasal verbs|traditional translation teaching,2019-07-25T18:37:22.060105,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:37:03.004130,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/citation/,vfnhx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ecyw5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/relationships/node/,ecyw5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbc13ea28e680019a3087c/,5bdbc13ea28e680019a3087c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfnhx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vfnhx/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vfnhx

In these classes teachers inculcate knowledge through spoon feeding practices rather than innovative ones that may challenge students' thoughts and abilities by facing them with non-traditional events, activities or scenes. In spite of the fact that Muslim teachers recite many verses from the Holy Quran daily, they are unaware of the pedagogical and psychological implements in the verses they have been reciting.  Hence, this study aims at identifying the pedagogical and the psychological implements in the holly Quran, specifically Surah Alkhaf. To collect data, content analysis method was used to elicit the pedagogical and the psychological implements. To identify the context in which these implements appear, the Key Word In Context (KWIC) was used depending on Al Islam website. These implements are hoped to reshape the way of teaching and learning practiced by many teachers and learners at educational institutions. In most cases, EFL learners don't actively use their minds or the critical skills that may trigger solutions to problems they encounter continuously. This study emphasizes the disastrous consequences of jumping to conclusions before one analyzes and interprets any ambiguous phenomenon. Results of the study showed many pedagogical and psychological implements such as motivation for learning, learning contracts, contradicted practices, stimulus-response model, accommodation and equilibration. The study implicates that any process of learning should be fueled by internal motivation that sparks the learner's power. Learners shouldn't be hasty and jump to conclusions, instead they should do their best to critically analyze events so that they can solve dilemmas they face daily. Another significant implication is the use of learning contracts to enhance fruitful learning. Finally, some recommendations were stated at the end of the study.",TRUE,FALSE,Accommodation|assimilation|equilibration|learning contracts|motivation|stimulus-response model,2019-07-25T18:36:43.312056,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:36:23.193935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/citation/,h79rj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kjgu7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/relationships/node/,kjgu7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbc093a28e680019a307ea/,5bdbc093a28e680019a307ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h79rj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h79rj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h79rj
