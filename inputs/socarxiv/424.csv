First, they occurred between two democratic NATO allies, members of a Western security community. Second, Iceland came close to withdrawing its NATO membership and closing the US base on Icelandic soil, which would have adversely affected the balance of power in the North Atlantic and jeopardized Iceland’s core security interests. Third, Iceland, a microstate, won each of these disputes. Historians and political scientists have consequently found it problematic to account for these puzzling disputes. This study proposes a Neoclassical Realist account for the occurrence and outcomes of the Cod Wars. I argue that the disputes occurred due to (i) powerful domestic pressures on statesmen to escalate and (ii) elite miscalculation. As the disputes escalated and Iceland’s Western alignment was put at greater risk, statesmen in both countries, mindful of the dangers of re-alignment, were able to resolve the conflicts in the end. The outcomes of the disputes reflect how British statesmen were able to make greater concessions due to weaker domestic constraints than those faced by Icelandic leaders. Iceland therefore reached a highly favorable agreement in all Cod Wars.",TRUE,FALSE,cod wars|foreign policy|iceland|international relations|militarized interstate dispute|neoclassical realism|small states|uk|united kingdom|war,2019-01-18T19:04:01.116301,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-18T19:03:50.150087,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/citation/,26ubp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4206d837763200192a0ca4/,5c4206d837763200192a0ca4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/26ubp/,https://doi.org/10.1093/fpa/orw062,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/26ubp

Just as biologists seek to explain population-level trends in genetic evolution in terms of micro-evolutionary processes such as selection, drift and migration, cultural evolutionists have sought to explain population-level cultural phenomena in terms of underlying social, psychological and demographic factors. Primary amongst these factors are learning biases, describing how cultural items are socially transmitted from person to person. As big datasets become more openly available and workable, and statistical modelling techniques become more powerful, efficient and user-friendly, describing population-level dynamics in terms of simple, individual-level learning biases is becoming more feasible. Here we test for the presence of learning biases in two large datasets of popular song lyrics dating from 1965-2015. We find some evidence of content bias, prestige bias and success bias in the proliferation of negative lyrics, and suggest that negative expression of emotions in music, and perhaps art generally, provides an avenue for people to not only process and express their own negative emotions, but also benefit from the knowledge that prestigious others experience similarly negative emotions as they do.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|content bias|cultural evolution|emotions|prestige bias|song lyrics|success bias,2019-01-17T21:53:21.583548,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-17T21:53:02.066123,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/citation/,3j6wx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c40b3687cf3f5001bb8d78c/,5c40b3687cf3f5001bb8d78c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3j6wx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3j6wx

Despite what scholars and journalists consider a worrying trend, there is no evidence of growing popular concern about inequality. In fact, research suggests that citizens in unequal societies are less concerned than those in more egalitarian societies. How to make sense of this paradox? I argue that citizens’ consent to inequality is explained by their growing conviction that societal success is reflective of a meritocratic process. Drawing on 25-years of International Social Survey Programme data, I show that rising inequality is legitimated by the popular belief that the income gap is meritocratically deserved: the more unequal a society, the more likely its citizens are to explain success in meritocratic terms, and the less important they deem non-meritocratic factors such as a person’s family wealth and connections.",TRUE,FALSE,beliefs|income|inequality|ISSP|longitudinal|meritocracy|political attitudes|theory|trend,2019-01-17T14:32:21.635756,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-17T14:31:56.404756,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Theory and Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/citation/,dcr9b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n6p3w/,n6p3w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c405f3fe8da0e0019599fc8/,5c405f3fe8da0e0019599fc8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dcr9b/,https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwy051,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dcr9b

To achieve this ultimate aim in teacher education, as argued by moral philosophers, psychologists, and educators, teachers should be able to well understand the mechanisms of moral functioning and how to effectively promote moral development based on evidence. Recent findings in the fields of social sciences that have examined how morality is functioning among human beings, moral psychology in particular, provide us with the evidence through experiments and observations. Furthermore, thanks to the development of scientific research methods that enable researchers to investigate the neural-level nature of human behavior, the researchers now can examine neural correlates of moral functioning that constitutes the basis of moral behavior and development.

Social inequities experienced by women and girls, compounded by norms characterized by male dominance increase risk of IPV. To address this problem, the Change Starts at Home Project employs a social behavior change communication strategy (SBCC) to shift behavior and norms related to IPV in 36 Village Development Committees in three districts (Chitwan, Kapilvastu, Nawalparasi) in Nepal. The project is being evaluated with a cluster randomized trial (NCT02942433). Data for the manuscript come from baseline surveys of reproductive-aged women randomly selected from the intervention and control communities (N=1440) and female intervention enrollees (N=360). Descriptive statistics were used to identify differences across and within intervention arms and among intervention enrollees and randomly selected participants from the same communities. A total of 1982 individuals were assessed for eligibility resulting in a response rate of 72.65%. The cooperation rate was 84.16%. Results indicate broad sociodemographic similarities on most variables, although a higher percentage of intervention participants were unemployed and a lower percentage had love marriages compared to both study conditions.  A smaller percentage of women in the intervention communities reported physical and / or sexual IPV in the prior 12 months (23.89%) than control communities (31.81%) or intervention participants (15.00%). Participants reported favorably to questions inquiring about whether their rights as participants were upheld, however, a minority felt they could discontinue at any time suggesting the need for greater consideration of this aspect of participation in subsequent data collection.",TRUE,FALSE,Couples|Intimate Partner Violence|Nepal|Participant Reaction|Prevention|Social and Behavior Change Communication,2019-01-15T20:23:01.193660,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-15T20:22:44.709698,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/citation/,7kzec,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3d4a3a8047080018005a3c/,5c3d4a3a8047080018005a3c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7kzec/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7kzec

Para esto, usamos como caso de estudio a Chile entre 2009 y 2015. Para facilitar la exposición del tema, dividimos el capítulo en tres apartados. En el primero, abordamos de forma resumida diversos asuntos teóricos relacionados con el avance de las tecnologías de información y su influencia en fenómenos democráticos y electorales, con especial énfasis en la masificación del uso de redes sociales con fines electorales. En el segundo, abordaremos exploratoriamente el uso de redes sociales en las campañas electorales recientes, específicamente durante las últimas dos elecciones presidenciales (2009-2010 y 2013) y en otros hitos políticos como cuentas públicas o shocks sobre el sistema político, como escándalos de corrupción.

There is a dearth of systematic information about the Black movement and Black protests between 1995 and its reemergence in Black Lives Matter in 2012. Using a new automated system, we identified 1017 events in 1049 news wire stories relevant to Black protest between 1994 and 2010 from the Annotated English Gigaword file. These data provide insight into Black activism in the between 1994 and 2010 and identify themes that are salient for both the resurgence of the Black Lives Movement after 2012 and the rise of White supremacist movements. Over a third of all protest events are about policing, generally about police violence. Other major themes include direct struggles over White vs. Black symbolic representations and access to resources, including protests over Confederate symbols, abolition of affirmative action programs, and White supremacists. The 1995 Million Man March shows up as having a significant connection to subsequent mobilization, a relationship that is confirmed by historical accounts. A third of the protests are around a wide variety of other specific issues that will require more detailed classification. Time trends show active and rising Black mobilization in the 1990s through 2001 that was interrupted by the 9/11 terror attacks and not significantly resumed until 2006-7. Overall, most protests in this era appear to have been reacting against attacks on existing benefits rather than proactively seeking new benefits. Methodologically, we show the importance of maintaining information about both events and coverage of events and of identifying the relations between events using the concepts of campaign, master event, and subevent.

It does so by discovering generative points of contact between two sets of methods that are also typically viewed as antithetical: data science and critique. Cultural analytics is an emerging field wherein humanist scholars leverage the increasing availability of large digital corpora and the affordances of new computational tools. This allows them to study, for example, semantic and narratological patterns in the English-language novel at the scale of centuries and across tens-of-thousands of texts. Cultural analytics is a fast-growing field, with scholars taking on an expanding array of topics, including genre and cultural prestige. Yet there is one topic that remains relatively understudied: race and racial difference. The reasons for this elision are not hard to grasp. Computational methods demand the quantification of one's objects of study. It's likely easier to accept measuring a novel's popularity by sales figures or classifying its genre by diction than labeling it according to discrete racial identifiers. Such labeling is an affront to critical race studies, which has taken as its very mission the deconstruction of racial categories.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-14T01:53:08.105706,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-14T01:52:37.169019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/citation/,gd2t4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3b87067cf3f50018ba80f8/,5c3b87067cf3f50018ba80f8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gd2t4/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.031,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gd2t4
