For example, prior studies have used machine learning models to calculate and perform predictions. Artificial neural networks are the most frequently used machine learning model with support vector machine, and genetic algorithm and decision trees are sometimes used in several related studies. Furthermore, most machine learning algorithms used in prior studies generally assume that inputs and outputs are independent of each other, which suggests that a project's success is expected to be independent of other projects. As the datasets used to train in prior studies often contain projects from different clients across industries, this theoretical assumption remains tenable. However, in practice projects are often interrelated across several different dimensions, for example through distributed overlapping teams. An ongoing ethnographic study at a leading project management artificial intelligence consultancy, referred to in this research as Company Alpha, suggests that projects within the same portfolio frequently share overlapping characteristics. To capture the emergent inter-project relationships, this study aims to compare two specific types of artificial neural network prediction performances; (i) multilayer perceptron and; (ii) recurrent neural networks. The multilayer perceptron has been found to be one of the most widely used artificial neural networks in the project management literature, and recurrent networks are distinguished by the memory they take from prior inputs to influence input and output. Through this comparison, this research will examine whether recurrent neural networks can capture the potential inter-project relationship towards achieving improved performance in contrast to multilayer perceptron. Our empirical investigation using ethnographic practice-based exploration at Company Alpha will contribute to project management knowledge and support developing an intelligent project prediction AI framework with future applications for project practice.",TRUE,FALSE,AI|Artificial Intelligence|Intelligent Project Prediction|Project Management|Project Success,2021-05-14T20:41:22.019757,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-14T20:41:13.342051,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/citation/,6hfje,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609e2cfd58d9d900bd13cb06/,609e2cfd58d9d900bd13cb06,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hfje/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6hfje/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6hfje,NA

Key organisations, businesses, sectors and industries vital for delivering crucial projects have been affected by the relatively fast onset of Covid-19 on a global scale. As a result, organisational routines and project management processes that would have focused on established methods and practices have incurred dramatic changes leading to a greater emphasis on agility as part of a more exhaustive strategic Covid-19 world, where new routines and processes become embedded as the new normal. This research focuses on the increased demand in Homeworking Project Management (HPM) and more significant agility requirements across dispersed virtual project management teams. Initial insights from semi-structured interviews with a cross-section of 12 high-level project professionals suggest that; (i) Transitional homeworking project management processes have a direct impact on collaborative and operational routines; (ii) There is a greater level of demand on agility with HPM teams which do not necessarily have the organisational infrastructure to support these, (iii) Technological resources are becoming a primary concern with inequality of information across HPM teams, and (iv) Increasing critical bottlenecks across dispersed HPM teams is adversely affecting tenable project outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,Agility|Covid-19|Homeworking|HPM|Project Management,2021-05-14T20:45:20.654589,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-14T20:44:48.334119,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/citation/,5atf2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609e294eca8a5f00b76798b4/,609e294eca8a5f00b76798b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5atf2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5atf2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5atf2,NA

Several studies have analysed periods of steady mortality decline, highlighting a strong inverse relationship between lifespan variation and life expectancy. Recent research has found that this association weakens, and even reverses, when mortality does not improve equally over age. However, to date no study has comprehensively explored the behaviour of lifespan variation when mortality increases significantly. Analysing three epidemics and two famines in Europe from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries, we find that, during these events, relative lifespan variation increases, while absolute variation declines, and that subsequently both quickly revert to pre-crisis levels. Using decomposition techniques, we show that mortality at older ages leads to a temporary increase in absolute – but not relative – variation. Moreover, female lifespan variation is less affected by the crises than that of males, because of the higher impact of infant and child mortality on male lifespan variation. By underlining different trends of lifespan variation by sex and indicator, we offer new insight into the consequences of mortality crises. Contrary to what is often asserted, we also show that the choice of lifespan variation indicator is not always inconsequential.",TRUE,FALSE,Historical demography|Lifespan variation|Mortality|Mortality crises,2021-05-14T19:28:03.670619,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-14T19:27:47.484963,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.mortality.org/,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/citation/,ze57r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9x3jf/,9x3jf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609d3cb4ca8a5f006e67bdef/,609d3cb4ca8a5f006e67bdef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze57r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ze57r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ze57r,NA

Some researchers have expressed concerns that ending the commercial farming of bears while demand for bear bile persists could lead to increased hunting pressure on wild bear populations. In this article, we use mixed methods of questionnaires, discrete choice experiments (DCEs), and interviews to investigate current consumer demand for bear bile in Vietnam, with a specific aim of understanding the potential for consumers to seek out wild bear bile. We sampled at seven areas across the country of Vietnam (total respondents = 2,463). We found that when directly estimated, the use of farmed bear bile in the past twelve months was over 20% in only one site; in all other study areas the use of farmed bear bile was lower than 5%. The same site had the highest level of wild bear bile use, at 5%; all other sites were lower. Despite widespread beliefs in farmed and wild bear bile’s efficacy, we found through qualitative interviews with bear bile consumers that there was general apathy about the continued use of bear bile, with respondents saying that they would use another product once bear bile farms were fully gone. Coupled with a strong preference for using synthetic bear bile over wild and farmed bear bile found in the DCEs, we posit that bear bile consumers in Vietnam will be willing to use non-animal-based products, including bear bile plant and Western medicine, to treat future ailments.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-05-13T12:12:02.918945,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-13T12:11:39.251579,FALSE,NA,no,Sensitive data about illegal activities,,no,Not common in biological sciences,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/citation/,quyf2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/73jhp/,73jhp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609c869295729d002f4a8fc2/,609c869295729d002f4a8fc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quyf2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/quyf2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/quyf2,NA

Where quantitative data are collected this presents challenges to the selection of an appropriate statistical model. This depends on subtle details of the design and allocation of vignettes to participants. A key distinction is between factorial survey experiments where each participant receives a different allocation of vignettes from the full universe of possible vignettes and experimental vignette studies where this restriction is relaxed. The former leads to nested designs with a single random factor and the latter to designs with two crossed random factors. In addition, the allocation of vignettes to participants may lead to fractional or unbalanced designs and a consequent loss of efficiency or aliasing of the effects of interest. Many vignette studies (including some factorial survey experiments) include unmodeled heterogeneity between vignettes leading to potentially serious problems if traditional regression approaches are adopted.

Much previous research has focused on academic preparation. Equally important, however, are the psychological–social barriers and lack of institutional support encountered by many minority students. We present a case study of a university-sponsored intervention program for minority science majors that addresses not only academics, but also socialization into the academic community, networking, and the ability to practice newfound skills and dispositions through undergraduate research. In examining this case, we suggest that concerted, formal efforts toward expanding habitus and thereby augmenting cultural and social capital may have positive effects for underrepresented minority (URM) college students’ academic and career prospects. Moreover, we argue that these differences complement the gains program participants make in academic preparedness, showing that attention to academics alone may be insufficient for addressing longstanding inequities in science career attainment among URM students.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Capital|Higher Education|Inequality|Race/ethnicity|STEM|Undergraduate Research,2021-05-14T20:34:23.479343,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-14T20:34:10.247306,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/citation/,9urpn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609c50b1ca8a5f001f679547/,609c50b1ca8a5f001f679547,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9urpn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9urpn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9urpn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11162-010-9198-8

Two groups received information cues mentioning different public opinions. Two additional groups received information on pre-existing blame or the absence of such blame. One control group did not receive any information. The empirical analysis reveals that public opinion in favor of blame leads to increased blame attribution, while a contrary public opinion decreases citizens’ blame. Likewise, the expected increase in citizens’ blame resulting from pre-existing blame is supported. However, the absence of blame has no effect. Overall, the experiment supports the impact of conformity on citizens' blame. In addition, the literature on citizens’ blame is extended by utilizing a citizen-centered perspective and taking social psychological theory into account.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral public administration|citizens’ blame|conformity|experiment|public service failure,2021-05-13T12:22:01.978502,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-13T12:21:40.236815,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dominikvogel.github.io/blame-attribution-compendium/codebook.html,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/citation/,qbjsh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609c2843ca8a5f000d6796de/,609c2843ca8a5f000d6796de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qbjsh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qbjsh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qbjsh,https://doi.org/10.1080/15309576.2019.1660189
