A great number of workers thrive at online platforms and embrace these tools to find customers for their businesses, to counterbalance market fluctuations, and earn wages above the local average. However, online labour market workers are also known to suffer numerous drawbacks, such as precarious working conditions, unpaid work, and severe fragmentation of jobs into tasks that limit skill use and development. Yet, our understanding of what causes this divergence in experiences is limited. Adopting propositions from the labour market segmentation literature, I show that, similarly to offline markets, online labour markets are composed of structurally delimited segments with different social processes governing the allocation of work. Using unsupervised clustering techniques from network science, I show that the clustered skill topology constrains mobility between segments in online platforms. I also show that this segmentation explains large differences in the earnings potential of individual workers. Together, these results provide a new explanation for the persistence of diversified experiences in online labour markets and inform strategies for future research of online platforms as highly segmented labour markets.",TRUE,FALSE,clustering|finite mixture models|labour market segmentation|network analysis|online labour markets,2021-02-19T08:55:45.489661,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T08:54:34.657913,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,Martin Lukac,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/citation/,m7ah4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602ed67d4ad52e01156e243b/,602ed67d4ad52e01156e243b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m7ah4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m7ah4,NA

The thesis of the multiplicativity of meaning, its polymorphism is substantiated, and numerous examples from world history are provided.

The aim of this study was therefore to explore the impact of the pandemic on the working lives and mental health and wellbeing of non-healthcare keyworkers in the UK.

Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants employed in a range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail, education, postal services and the police force. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a reflexive thematic approach. 

Results: Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient PPE and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment. 

Conclusion: In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for other infections (e.g. seasonal influenza) in the future. This includes the provision of psychological and workplace measures attending to the intersections of personal vulnerability and work conditions that cause unique risks and challenges among those in frontline keyworker occupations.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|frontline services|keyworkers|psychological wellbeing|qualitative,2021-02-19T08:54:03.195316,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T08:53:10.036611,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/citation/,dn43c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602e85f64ad52e00ea6e91ee/,602e85f64ad52e00ea6e91ee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dn43c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dn43c,NA

Using original national online survey data collected in June 2020 (N=1,027), we investigate how members of this group view the government's overall response. Although survey results show broad support for the federal government's pandemic response, findings also indicate fractures based on disability type and specific health condition, political partisanship, region, and experiences with COVID-19. Among these, identification with the Liberal party and receipt of CERB stand out as associated with more positive views. Further examination of qualitative responses shows that these views are also linked to differing perspectives surrounding government benefits and spending, partisan divisions, as well as other social and cultural cleavages.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|disability|employment|federal government|federalism|finances|health|political partisanship|public opinion|public policy|welfare state,2021-02-19T08:53:24.879728,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T08:52:04.427607,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jE-NSjEkYbeK0o3sukU9YlPLx_vvWMXm/view,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|School Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",David Pettinicchio,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/citation/,2a9qc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602e6cee34d30400d9e3a0ba/,602e6cee34d30400d9e3a0ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2a9qc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2a9qc,https://doi.org/10.3138/cpp.2021-012

Recursive partitioning as an alternative to parametric regression models in social sciences,"Parametric regression models became the dominant tool of quantitative sociology. This dominance is not without its challenges and many criticisms have been expressed, both statistically and epistemologically. Still, the development of data mining, and then of machine learning, has led to the emergence of methodological approaches that make it possible to overcome most of the limitations of parametric regression models, for the various types of use that are of interest to the social sciences. We argue that recursive partitioning in particular may be highly vauable for social sciences. Indeed, this approach has a number of technical advantages over parametric regression and, above all, it is consistent with a conception of social determinations in terms of configurations of interdependent factors (and not of additions of independent factors). In a second step, we review a range of tools for interpreting the results obtained from recursive partitioning algorithms. Together, they form a very complete toolbox for the social sciences and show that recursive partitioning is no longer a black box as soon as the appropriate interpretative tools are mobilized. Finally, we illustrate the methods presented using sociological examples from the world of cinema. In doing so, we will show that these methods make it possible to deal with the different types of problems that arise in the social sciences when parametric regressions are usually used, in this case the study of structure effects and the ranking of explanatory factors.",TRUE,FALSE,cinema|decision tree|random forest|recursive partitioning|regression models|supervised learning,2021-02-18T12:28:22.496650,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-18T12:27:53.864037,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Nicolas Robette,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/citation/,z496a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602e5a5934d30400bce3a774/,602e5a5934d30400bce3a774,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z496a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z496a,NA

The critical features of GVCs are therefore the international dimension of the production process and the ""contractualisation"" of buyer and seller relationships, often across international borders (Antras 2016). As a result, these international production networks are highly complex regarding geography, technology, and the different types of firms involved (from large retailers and highly large-scale mechanised manufacturers to small home-based production). Sometimes it may be impossible even to identify all the countries that are involved or the extent of their involvement (Gereffi and FernandezStark 2016). However, the recent development of OECD-WTO’s Trade-in Value Added (TiVA) data represents a fundamental step forward in understanding GVC trade. Grossman &amp; RossiHansberg (2008, 2012) rightly point out that the different tasks, rather than sectors, define the specialisation of countries in the value chains.",TRUE,FALSE,Global Production Network|Global Value Chains|International Trade,2021-02-19T05:10:02.632901,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T05:09:48.362510,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/citation/,kgryp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602e043f4ad52e00526e2088/,602e043f4ad52e00526e2088,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgryp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kgryp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kgryp,NA

Methodology/approach - Regression models are fitted to data from an original sample of 589 employed U.S. parents.
Findings –Partnered (married and cohabiting) fathers who work partially in the evening or night experience less work-to-family conflict if they report personal motives, but schedule motivation does not affect work-to-family conflict among partnered or single mothers.  Partnered mothers who work primarily in the evening or at night report higher life satisfaction if they do so for personal reasons, but this effect is not found for single mothers or partnered fathers.  Specifically seeing their schedules as facilitating family care matters for partnered mothers, but not fathers.  
Originality/value – Although nonstandard employment schedules have been linked to poor well-being among working parents, this is the first quantitative study to assess the role of worker motivation to the author’s knowledge. 
Research limitations/implications – The results are suggestive because they are based on a non-probability sample of modest size.  However, they demonstrate the need for future studies of employment scheduling to collect information on worker motivations.
Social implications – Most night workers in the U.S. do not select their shifts for personal reasons, putting them at risk for work-to-family conflict and reduced life satisfaction.  They deserve extra support in exchange for laboring while others sleep or spend time with family.",TRUE,FALSE,employed fathers|; employed mothers|life satisfaction|nonstandard work schedules|work family conflict,2021-02-19T05:12:44.484312,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T05:12:28.210649,FALSE,NA,no,The data have not been prepared for public access (yet).
