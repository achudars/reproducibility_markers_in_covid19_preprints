We tested this hypothesis in a pre-registered experiment where 1,670 Republicans and Democrats in the United States were asked to complete a collaborative online task with an automated agent or “bot” that was labelled as a member of the opposing party. Prior to this task, we exposed respondents to primes about a) a common enemy (involving threats from Iran, China, and Russia); b) a patriotic event; or c) a neutral, apolitical prime. Though we observed no significant differences in the behavior of Democrats as a result of these primes, we found that Republicans—and particularly those with very strong conservative views—were significantly less likely to cooperate with Democrats when primed about a common enemy. We also observed lower rates of cooperation among Republicans who participated in our study during the 2020 Iran crisis, which occurred in the middle of our fieldwork. These findings indicate common enemies may not reduce inter-group conflict in highly polarized societies, and contribute to a growing number of studies that find evidence of asymmetric political polarization.

We agree with critical race theorists, but elaborate further, that othering in some form or another, has existed since the Stone Age, and evolves with the uneven expansion of social complexity and the emergence of hierarchies. Othering, has always been important for reproducing differences and inequalities within society. We highlight the socially “distant other” to instruct the ways we discern modern racism, and how it has evolved from its past iterations. The argument we hope to convey is that at its core, distant othering involves the fear of a perceived threat to the existing social order and with the emergence of global capitalism, the racialized version of othering is violent, a violence that that becomes particularly intense when rates of profit collapse (i.e. economic crises) and/or when group-statuses are threatened. The theoretical perspective we use is institutional materialism and we take a historical, long-term sociocultural evolution approach. We detail othering in the Stone Age, which centers around kinship distance, the transition from small scale societies to the Bronze Age, as well as othering in the Axial Age and the modern era.

Despite the importance of power analysis for experimental techniques, current literature has largely disregarded statistical power considerations when designing conjoint experiments. The main goal of this article is to provide researchers and practitioners with a practical tool to calculate the statistical power of conjoint experiments. To this end, we first conducted an extensive literature review to understand how conjoint experiments are designed and gauge the plausible effect sizes discovered in the literature. Second, we formulate a data generating model that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate a wide range of conjoint designs and hypothesized effects. Third, we present the results of an extensive series of simulation experiments based on the previously formulated data generation process. Our results show that---even with relatively large sample size and the number of trials---conjoint experiments are not suited to draw inferences for experiments with large numbers of experimental conditions and relatively small effect sizes. Specifically, Type S and Type M errors are especially pronounced for experimental designs with relatively small effective sample sizes (&lt; 3000) or a high number of levels (&gt; 15) that find small but statistically significant effects (&lt; 0.03).

In this paper, we explore the effects of digitization and streaming on the globalization of popular music. While some argue that digitization has led to more diverse cultural markets, others consider that the increasing accessibility to international music would result in a globalized market where a few artists garner all the attention. We tackle this debate by looking at how cross-country diversity in music charts has evolved over 7 years in 51 countries. We analyze two large-scale datasets from Spotify, the most popular streaming platform at the moment, and Itunes, one of the pioneers in digital music distribution. Our analysis reveals an upward trend in music consumption diversity that started in 2017 and spans across platforms. There are now significantly more songs, artists, and record labels populating the top charts than just a few years ago, making national charts increasingly different from one another. Furthermore, this process started at the peaks of countries' charts, where diversity increased at a faster pace than at their bases.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-18T22:43:01.719293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-18T17:28:01.421476,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/PabloBelloDelpon/Spotify_paper,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/citation/,7azc5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fb5330077aa65022494b3ff/,5fb5330077aa65022494b3ff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7azc5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7azc5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7azc5,NA

In media coverage and reporting, AI is predominantly described in contrasted terms, either as the ultimate solution to all human problems or the ultimate threat to all human existence. In academe, the focus of computer scientists is on developing systems that function, whereas philosophy scholars theorize about the implications of this functionality for human life. In the interface between technology and philosophy there is, however, one imperative aspect of AI yet to be articulated: How do intelligent systems make inferences? We use the overarching concept “Artificial Intelligent Behaviour” which would include both cognition/processing and judgment/behaviour. We argue that due to the complexity and opacity of Artificial Inference, one needs to initiate systematic empirical studies of artificial intelligent behavior similar to what has previously been done to study human cognition, judgment and decision making. This will provide valid knowledge, outside of what current computer science methods can offer, about the judgments and decisions made by intelligent systems. Moreover, outside academe – in the public as well as the private sector – expertise in epistemology, critical thinking and reasoning are crucial to ensure human oversight of the artificial intelligent judgments and decisions that are made, because only competent human insight into AI-inference processes will ensure accountability. Such insights require systematic studies of AI-behaviour founded on the natural sciences and philosophy, as well as the employment of methodologies from the cognitive and behavioral sciences.",TRUE,FALSE,Accountability|Artificial Inference|Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligent Behaviour|Behavioural Artificial Intelligence|Bias|Ethics|Philosophy|Psychology|Transparency,2020-11-18T22:43:22.787805,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-18T17:28:22.107987,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,AI &amp; Society,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/citation/,mrqf4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fb4d43a5502ac022f8cac68/,5fb4d43a5502ac022f8cac68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrqf4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrqf4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrqf4,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-019-00928-5

Class and the Cultural Styles Applicants Present to Gatekeepers,"Cultural matching theory holds that class reproduction occurs when individuals from different class origins present different cultural styles to gatekeepers, who in turn select advantaged individuals based upon their styles. This theory also suggests that class reproduction will be disrupted if individuals from different origins present gatekeepers with the same styles. We investigate whether this is possible by examining a case in which similarities are particularly likely to occur: a situation in which public instructions give applicants from each class common information about what styles gatekeepers reward, gatekeepers select among applicants from each class who share access to similar styles, and applicants are likely to use the same styles as they are given time to strategize and need only present each style superficially. Drawing upon a content analysis of over 1,000 randomly selected applications that were written under these conditions, we find that individuals from different class origins present several similar styles but that differences remain. We conclude that the simultaneous presence of these conditions is unlikely to block class reproduction by erasing cultural differences.",TRUE,FALSE,class|culture|job search,2020-11-19T13:14:41.779925,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-19T13:11:35.773242,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Poetics,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/citation/,4uz6w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fb403b477aa65019d94fb48/,5fb403b477aa65019d94fb48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uz6w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4uz6w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4uz6w,NA
