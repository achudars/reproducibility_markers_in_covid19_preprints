We use interviews and ethnographic observations to examine the vibrant market of research shops selling academic work to students around two of Uganda’s top universities. We identify three groups of researchers— Knowledge Producers, Entrepreneurs, and Educators—who construct different professional identities and moral justifications of their trade, and orient their market action accordingly. We demonstrate that these identities and moral frameworks reflect an interplay between the institutional contexts and the social class positions that researchers occupy within this illicit market. While Knowledge Producers and Entrepreneurs both experienced a sense of “fit” with their respective institutional cultures, the former now see their work as compromising ideals of research, whereas the latter capitalize on what they view as a broken system. Educators, disadvantaged at both institutions, articulate a framework countering the dominant institutional cultures and sympathetic to underperforming students. This approach illuminates how institutional contexts and individual class positions within them influence producers’ moral frameworks, leading to differentiation of the market.

However, there is a wide range of developed fashions to detect fake contents, either those human-based approaches or machine-based approaches; both have shown inadequacy and limitations, especially those fully automatic approaches. The purpose of this analytic study of media news language is to investigate and identify the linguistic features and their contribution in analyzing data to detect, filter, and differentiate between fake and authentic news texts. This study outlines promising uses of linguistic indicators and adds a rather unconventional outlook to prior literature. It utilizes qualitative and quantitative data analysis as an analytic method to identify systematic nuances between fake and factual news in terms of detecting and comparing 16 attributes under three main linguistic features categories (lexical, grammatical, and syntactic features) assigned manually to news texts. The obtained datasets consist of publicly available right documents on the Politi-fact website and the raw (test) data set collected randomly from news posts on Facebook pages.

The Roman triclinia mosaics of Antioch are among the most interesting discoveries due to their premium Roman designs. These mosaics show significant Hellenistic artistic heritage in the representation of the classical and mythological topics (e.g. Iphigenia, Narcissus etc.) The main aim in this study was to classify the triclinia mosaics in Antioch according to their designs and to record them in a complex database including their topics, date, dimensions, exposures in order to determine possible connections between design elements and building types.
Doro Levi in his book of 1947 “Antioch mosaic pavements” established the classical typology of Antiochian mosaics (T, U and Horseshoe shapes). However, I managed to identify a new design unnoticed by Levi, which I named H-shape design. This is composed of two large separated panels along the room, one with geometric motifs close to the rear wall and the second with figural representation close to the entrance and facing the rear wall.",TRUE,FALSE,Antioch|Banquet|Dionysus|Greek|Mosaic|Roman|Syria|triclinium,2021-03-06T23:39:05.431351,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-06T23:38:32.741847,FALSE,NA,no,moutazeus-91-syria@outlook.com,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d29|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d2a|Arts and Humanities|Classics|Classical Archaeology and Art History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d29|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d30|Arts and Humanities|Classics|Ancient History, Greek and Roman through Late Antiquity",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/citation/,kge79,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/euh4c/,euh4c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60427f5a035cf704d6c80722/,60427f5a035cf704d6c80722,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kge79/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kge79/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kge79,NA

Scientific experts in German news coverage on Covid-19 compared to other pandemics,"At the time of the corona pandemic, the population has a great need for information. (Mass) Media try to provide the concerned citizens with answers to their pressing questions with the help of scientific actors and their expert knowledge. Scientific experts serve as an important source of information for journalists and for society. Therefore, it is of particular relevance to examine, which scientific actors are discussing scientific issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic publicly via media coverage. Of particular interest is a look at the scientific expertise of the so-called experts, because the quality of the available information stands and falls with it. Our study describes the journalistic selection of scientific experts in German news coverage on Covid-19 compared to other pandemics. We analyze, which experts get a chance to speak in media coverage, how diverse the spectrum of selected experts is and how their scientific expertise is to be assessed. Our findings show that the Covid-19 coverage is dominated by actors from the political executive and less than in previous pandemics by scientific experts. Further, the Corona debate is characterised by a greater diversity of expert voices than the previous pandemic debates and therefore less concentrated on a few individual scientists only. Further, the journalistic selection of scientific experts is biased in favour of those who have a high scientific expertise.

There is, however, no systematic approach or research available that analyses the repeated failures with regard to an adequate response to an epidemic. For a better understanding of failing societal responses, we propose a framework called the ‘Epidemic Failure Cycle’ (EFC). The EFC consists of four phases: Negligence, Arrogance/Denial, Panic and Analysis/Self-criticism. These phases fit largely with the current World Health Organization pandemic influenza phases: Interpandemic, Alert, Pandemic, Transition. By utilizing the Ebola epidemic and the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic as case studies, we show striking similarities in the response to these outbreaks during both crises. Finally, we suggest three major areas to be of utmost importance for triggering and maintaining the EFC. In terms of ecology, zoonoses, supposed to be the main biological origin for virus epidemics, have been largely neglected by politicians, the media and the scientific community. Socioeconomic and cultural conditions such as harsh living and working conditions as well as conspiracy theories hinder effective preventive and counter measures against epidemics. Lastly, in terms of epistemology, the reliance on knowledge about previous outbreaks has led to slow and inadequate decisions.",TRUE,FALSE,Ebola|Epidemics|Health policy|SARS-Cov-2,2021-03-05T14:10:21.454009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-05T14:10:10.520350,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/citation/,pbwhx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6042296b035cf704a6c80822/,6042296b035cf704a6c80822,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pbwhx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pbwhx,NA

Restrictions on service provision may reduce access to family planning services and increase fertility in the short term. By contrast, the economic uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and its impact on mental health and well-being may reduce fertility. These various pathways have been explored in the context of high income countries such as the United States and Western Europe, but little is known about middle income countries. In this paper we asses the impact of the COVID pandemic on fertility intentions and behaviour in the Republic of Moldova, a middle income country in Eastern Europe, using the Generations and Gender Survey. This survey was conducted partially before and partially after the pandemic, allowing for detailed analysis of individual circumstances. The results indicate that the pandemic reduced contraceptive use by 40%. Conversely couples were also 41% less likely to be trying to conceive after the onset of the pandemic, although medium term fertility intentions were unchanged. Indicators therefore suggest that in the medium term fertility intentions may not be affected by the pandemic but access to family planning services and deferring attempts to conceive may change which individuals have children and when.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Fertility|Fertility Intentions|GGP|Moldova|Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health,2021-03-05T14:11:01.492215,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-05T14:10:49.161564,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon registration at www.ggp-i.org,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/citation/,fcqd9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6042115a67386c047161aa6f/,6042115a67386c047161aa6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fcqd9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fcqd9,NA

Yet even when voters agree on the facts, they tend to attribute responsibility in a group-serving manner, disproportionately crediting their party for positive developments and blaming opponents for negative developments. Using original time series data, we show that partisan disagreement over U.S. President Donald Trump's responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic quickly emerged alongside the pandemic's onset in March 2020. Three original survey experiments show that the valence of information about the country's performance against the virus contributes causally to such gaps. A Bayesian model of information processing anticipates our findings more closely than do theories of partisan-motivated reasoning. These findings shed new light on the foundations of partisan loyalty, especially among citizens who do not think of themselves as partisans.",TRUE,FALSE,blame attribution|covid|pandemic|partisan differences|survey experiment|time series|United States,2021-03-05T01:32:22.627865,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-05T01:31:52.121835,FALSE,NA,no,"Replication files, including raw datasets, will be made public when the paper is published.",,available,NA,https://osf.io/eyg4p,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/citation/,t8xar,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604158b3441575044a580e73/,604158b3441575044a580e73,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8xar/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t8xar/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t8xar,NA
