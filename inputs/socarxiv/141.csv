The law lies in the fact that the methods used in teaching foreign languages should be considered from their most significant effect to achieve educational goals. The research work aims at analyzing the technological support of the process of teaching foreign languages for specific purposes. We consider this support as an essential component of professional training. While working on the paper, we used the following methods of pedagogical research: theoretical analysis and generalization of literature on the research problem; theoretical forecasting methods; a sociological survey (questionnaire, interviews) of students and teachers; testing; mathematical processing of the results of questionnaires and interviews. We developed and used several cases for students of different specialties in our teaching practice. Our development of cases and our teaching experience in the research field proved the effect of the use of the case-study method and its main advantages.

In the backdrop of linguistic differences between English and Chinese, this action research was conducted to investigate the components of the reading skills, which are to be developed within the Bachelor programs. The primary purpose of the article is to analyze the methodological background for teaching Ukrainian students to perceive information from authentic texts. The methods of induction and deduction enabled us to analyze and generalize the theoretical bases for the investigated topic, to systemize the results of the study (the reading tactics and strategies, classification of reading activities). The study was based on focused observation using the register as a tool for data collecting for two semesters each in three groups of third-year students at Ushynsky University. The total sample size was 54. The article presents an analysis of difficulties in reading English and Chinese texts: 1) phonological level – differences in sound pronunciation (English: /T/, /D/ /w/, /N/, /x/, etc.; Chinese: the alveolo-palatal consonants j, q, x; affricates zh, z; consonant r, etc.), the phonetic phenomena (English: nasal plosion, lateral plosion, loss of plosion, assimilation, reduction/elision, etc.; Chinese: tone, erization); 2) lexical level – conversion (in English) and transposition (in Chinese), homonymy, polysemy; 3) grammatical level – the division of lexicon into parts of speech, different word order in English and Chinese sentences, (non)segmentation of English and Chinese syntagms/clauses/compound sentences, use of tenses, etc. The article contains some recommendations for English and Chinese reading classrooms.",TRUE,FALSE,Chinese|English|reading skills|reading tactics and strategies|teaching tools,2020-11-30T05:34:20.837543,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:34:05.547717,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/citation/,vahzd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdd38da72563011d833e7d/,5fbdd38da72563011d833e7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahzd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vahzd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vahzd

The article studies the mechanism of double encoding a message (verbally and pictographically) to optimize the perception, processing, and storage of information by the user of the dictionary. The aim of the given research is to determine the features of an English poly code dictionary entry as a communicative phenomenon of educational lexicography. The study is based on five lexicographic sources, traditionally called the big five. The research material includes 1640 poly code entries. The article suggests a new interpretation of a poly code entry as a threefold unity of a lemma (the headword), a verbal definition, and a picture. These three constituents jointly name, interpret, and visualize the meaning of a dictionary entry. The article also analyzes the configuration of a poly code entry informational potential in terms of increasing/decreasing of the information presented by the iconic constituent in comparison with the verbal one. The research proves that the whole set of poly code dictionary entries reflects a particular view of the world characterized by absolute anthropocentricity and specific Anglo-Saxon bias. The results of the performed research are significant for English language teaching and learning as they prove that pictographic illustrations that accompany verbal explanations are not purely ornamental.

The purpose of the article is to prove that the individual author’s style can be reconstructed due to different stylistic devices that help the reader to understand the message of a literary work more profoundly and take into account in the process of film adaptations. An author’s style is characterized by numerous factors including spelling, word choices, sentence structures, punctuation, use of literary stylistic devices (irony, metaphors, rhyme, etc.) and organization of ideas, narration structure, and overall tone of the narration. The main analytic procedures used in the research are keyness, collocation, and cluster. The authors also define that the novel under analysis is a parody of Gothic fiction. The author ruined the conventions of eighteenth-century novels by making her heroine fall in love with the character before he has a serious thought of her and exposing the heroine’s romantic fears and curiosities as groundless. The article deals with adaptation as an integral part of the concept of intersemiotic translation. It is possible to say that adaptation is an attempt to translate the content of the adapted material into its screening; intersemiotic translation focuses on the analysis and interpretation of semiotic codes in the scope of adapted material.

The semantic and contextual analysis provided in lexicographical sources and fiction texts helps sort out the data collected. All examples divided into blocks: to betray- to scam, to deceive, to betray – to reveal the secret, to betray relations, to betray yourself. The analysis showed that betrayal actualized with the verbs, which contain semes to send a beep, to move in space, to remove, to leave, to put something over something, to leave; nouns – somatics; fauna; geographical objects; artifacts; adjectives with the semantic imperfect; adverbs – out, away.

The relevance of the research is due to the high interest of young people, and first-year students as well, in learning English using modern songs, and the lack of sophistication of the technologies used to teach English to them. The analysis of the psychological and pedagogical features of the first-year students made it possible to conclude that this is an aging period of sharp contradictions in the structure of the personality, that is being formed.

The main aim of the study is to review the relevant NLP techniques aimed at optimizing the teacher’s professional skills, and hence the effectiveness of the learning process as a whole. Such techniques include predicate, meta- and Milton-model personal identification, as well as spelling. The significance of the study is determined by the fact that this set of neurolinguistic techniques will be extremely useful both in creating comfortable communicative learning conditions as the basis of its effectiveness and inactivating the students’ psychocognitive abilities and increasing their professional competence level. The main question of the research paper is how to generally contribute to educational process optimization, mainly, in teaching foreign languages in the Ukrainian-speaking environment. In the study, both general scientific research tools (descriptive method, analysis, synthesis, observation) and special experimental methods (recording and comparing the results of applied NLP techniques, surveys, evaluations) are utilized. The main findings of the research allowed to determine the students’ individual neurophysiological mechanisms (representative priorities) in the process of educational data perception; to identify cases of the students’ deviant behavior through the reconstruction of their verbal and nonverbal behavior and adjust the communicative background to create a comfortable learning environment; to apply the elements of correct suggestibility to strengthen the students’ cognitive activity, and the naturalization of teaching data; to enhance the processes of memorization, effective assimilation and competent reproduction of new data through the directed activation of representative systems (visual, audible, kinesthetic) and the corresponding submodalities.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-30T05:36:21.031790,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:36:13.865936,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/citation/,hfqbk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdcc38ab65180118b1218d/,5fbdcc38ab65180118b1218d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hfqbk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hfqbk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hfqbk

They encourage students/parishioners to engage in the learning process fully. The following tasks were formulated: to categorize imperative utterances in the view of characteristic features of the mentioned discourses; to characterize the lexical-syntactic peculiarities of each type of imperative phrases. The object of the research is an oral English-language institutional discourse of two kinds – academic (lecture) and religious (sermon). The subject of the study is the lexical and syntactic arrangement of imperative utterances in the lecture and sermon discourses. To achieve the aim, both general scientific and unique linguistic research methods found application. Conclusions of the study are as follows: the functioning of imperative utterances in the sermon and lecture discourse is determined by such linguistic and extralinguistic factors as the expressiveness/implicitness of the imperative constructions, the syntactic structure of the imperative constructions, the communicative-pragmatic orientation, and the targeted nature of the order/ localization of the imperative construction in the compositional text structure. In our work, direct and indirect explicit constructions, aimed at an immediate action, are viewed as operational imperative statements. According to the communicative-pragmatic orientation and considering the temporal signs, we distinguish two main types of motivation: simultaneous and post-communicative. The communicative-pragmatic orientation criterion also makes it possible to single out constructions intended to induce physical/mental impact (in lectures) and spiritual/mental impact (in sermons). The prospect of further investigation is studying non-verbal features of lecture and sermon discourses.",TRUE,FALSE,imperatives|learning process|lecture/sermon discourse|linguistic means,2020-11-30T05:36:41.024012,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:36:33.091828,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/citation/,zfgwv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdcb09ab65180118b11f5b/,5fbdcb09ab65180118b11f5b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfgwv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zfgwv/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zfgwv

Since it is a review article, the paper intends to address the theoretical issue and the practical implementation of the interdisciplinary approach at Ukrainian university. In the authors’ opinion, interdisciplinary aspect is important for raising the quality of language. It helps achieve the goal of Ukrainian pedagogy to bring up an all-round creative personality with the capacity and skills to establish an intercultural dialogue. English language proficiency is a facilitator for accomplishing these tasks. Thus, the authors believe that the purposes of pedagogical and language education research are interconnected and lie in the modernization of educational content. The study underscores the significance of the interdisciplinary aspect of English language specialists’ training.  It encourages gaining and sustains knowledge through multiple teaching and learning styles and the integration of different disciplines. The findings of the study highlight the necessity to meet the requirements of Ukrainian society. They demonstrate the issue is worth addressing since it improves the educational practices and raises the prestige of Ukrainian education.",TRUE,FALSE,English language education|integration of knowledge|interdisciplinary aspect|Ukrainian university,2020-11-30T05:37:01.142112,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:36:49.457994,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/citation/,grhwx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdc9f1ab65180118b11bd2/,5fbdc9f1ab65180118b11bd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/grhwx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/grhwx/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/grhwx
