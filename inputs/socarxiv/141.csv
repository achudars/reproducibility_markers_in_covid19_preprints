The impact of the conflict thesis can be observed in church leaders’ hesitancy in talking about science and religion in the public domain. It was this finding that led Revd Professor David Wilkinson (cosmologist and theologian) and Professor Tom McLeish (physicist and Anglican lay reader) to form the project ‘Equipping Christian Leadership in an Age of Science’ funded by The Templeton World Charity Foundation. The data presented in this article (collected during 2015-2018) is derived from two discreet pieces of research. The first consisting of a survey of over 1,000 church leaders and interviews with 20 senior church leaders and, the second, with a strategic focus on ministerial training comprised of 12 interviews with church educationalists. This paper reflects on the findings from both pieces of research – covering topics such as church leaders’ enthusiasm towards science, how church leaders view the relationship between science and religion and the role of compartmentalisation in ministerial training.

Relative to paper records, websites enable governments to shape public understanding in quick, scalable, and permissible ways. During the Trump administration, website changes indicative of climate denial prompted civil society organizations to develop tools for tracking online government information sources. We in the Environmental Data &amp; Governance Initiative (EDGI) illustrate how five data visualization techniques can be used to document and analyze changes to government websites. We examine a large sample of websites of US federal environmental agencies and show that between 2016 and 2020: 1) the use of the term “climate change” decreased by an estimated 38%; 2) access to as much as 20% of the Environmental Protection Agency’s website was removed; 3) changes were made more to Cabinet agencies’ websites and to highly visible pages. In formulating ways to visualize and assess the alteration of websites, our study lays important groundwork for both systematically tracking changes and holding officials more accountable for their web practices.

Entrepreneurial finance discipline is, therefore, born to explore the connection between finance and entrepreneurship. Despite the global presence of entrepreneurship, the literature of entrepreneurial finance is suspected to be Western ideologically homogenous. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the existence of Western ideological homogeneity in entrepreneurial finance literature. Employing the mindsponge mechanism and bibliometric analyses (Y-index and social structure), we analyze 412 highly cited publications extracted from Web of Science database and find Western ideological dominance as well as weak tolerance towards heterogeneity in the set of core ideologies of entrepreneurial finance. These results are consistent across author-, institution-, and country-levels, which reveals strong evidence for the existence of Western ideological homogeneity in the field. We recommend editors, reviewers, and authors to have proactive actions to diversify research topics and enhancing knowledge exchange to avoid the shortfalls of ideological homogeneity.

In recent years, there has been an increased usage of machine learning methods in quantitative political science research. This article advocates for the implementation of machine learning duration models to assist in a sound model selection process. We provide a brief introduction to the random survival forest (RSF) algorithm and contrast it to a popular predecessor, the Cox proportional hazards model. We implement both methods for simulated time-to-event data and the Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED) to assist researchers in evaluating the merits of machine learning duration models. We provide evidence of significantly higher survival probabilities for peace agreements with 3rd party mediated design and implementation. We also detect increased survival probabilities for peace agreements that incorporate territorial power-sharing and avoid multiple rebel party signatories. Further, the RSF provides a novel approach for ranking of peace agreement criteria importance in predicting peace agreement duration.

How do groups emerge within society? What are the effects of emotions and memory on our everyday actions? George Homans, like us, had a perspective on what society is, except that he was a sociologist. Homans theory, which is an exchange theory, is based on a few propositions about the fundamental actions of individuals, and how values, memory, and expectations affect their behavior. In this paper, our main interest and purpose are to find out whether these propositions can satisfy our conception of society and generate essential properties of it computationally. To do so, Based on Homans' prepositions, we provide the opportunity for each agent to exchange with other agents. That is, each agent transacts with familiar agents based on his previous history with them and transacts with newly found agents through exploration. One novelty of our work is the investigation of implications of the base theory while covering its flaws with minimal intervention; flaws which are inevitable in a non-mathematical theory. The importance of our work is that we have scrutinized the consequences of an actual sociological theory. At the end of our investigation, we propose another proposition to Homans theory, which makes the theory more appealing, and we discuss other possible directions for further research.",TRUE,FALSE,Complex Networks|Computational Sociology|Group Formation|Local Decision-Making|Social Exchange Theory|Social Structures|Social Structures Emergence,2020-07-31T20:46:24.238397,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-31T20:46:07.055066,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/mmehrani/homans_project,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/citation/,j7n26,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2449d05f705a0102619807/,5f2449d05f705a0102619807,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7n26/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j7n26/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j7n26

Ten different WhatsApp groups were selected covering demographic and socio-economic profile and ten most important health-related fake news were studied. Different fake news circulation paths like forward, react, multi-forward, reference etc. were analyzed for different groups. It was observed that older generations (boomers) were more susceptible towards fake news and they tended to distribute the fake news in different groups. Male boomers actively circulate pseudo-science information whereas female boomers distribute faith-based information in the WhatsApp group. It was found that the Gen X as well as Millennials played a role as the first recipients or first responders but primarily most of the forwards were attributed to the Boomers of both genders. Levels of education, social media influence or ignorance, technology access, age, gender and understanding played a major role in the distribution and propagation of fake information during times of COVID. It can be also inferred that easy availability of data and devices, lack of understanding of the game of social media and unscientific baggage of age old beliefs were some factors for over -dependence and reliance on fake news.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Fake News|Misinformation|WhatsApp Group,2020-07-31T20:42:44.077984,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-31T20:42:14.719597,FALSE,NA,no,Available on request to the corresponding author at arindam.safe@gmail.com,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Other Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/citation/,kgs42,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f23c5599c909400aa485251/,5f23c5599c909400aa485251,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgs42/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kgs42/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kgs42
