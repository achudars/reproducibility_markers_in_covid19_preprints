Many scholars have emphasized the economic roots of radical right support. Other scholarship highlights the role of the urban-rural divide, contending that the radical right finds support in low population density locations due to distinctive social values and strong place-based social identities found in rural areas. To date, however, we do not have a full grasp of the sources of these latter factors nor an understanding of the historical roots that explain their emergence. We argue that what is frequently classified as the ``rural'' bases of radical right support in previous research is in part a proxy for something entirely different: communities that were in the historical ""periphery"" in the center-periphery conflicts that shaped modern nation-state formation. Inspired by a classic state-building literature that emphasizes the prevalence of a ``wealth of tongues'' (Weber 1976)---or nonstandard linguistic dialects in a region---as a definition of the periphery, we use data from more than 725,000 geo-coded responses in a linguistic survey in Germany to show that voters from historically peripheral geographic communities are more likely to vote for the radical right today.",TRUE,FALSE,AfD|dialect|locality|nationalism|parochialism|place-based identity|radical right|voting,2020-04-25T00:42:41.964388,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:42:27.512874,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/citation/,syr84,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea1f29cc74184001df3e545/,5ea1f29cc74184001df3e545,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/syr84/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/syr84,NA

Popular Resistance against Children’s Rights and Juvenile Justice in Contemporary Russia,"Since the mid-2000s, Russia has increased its efforts to strengthen the legal rights of children and to improve the systems of social assistance to vulnerable families in in line with the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child. The reform drive has met fierce resistance by a grassroots mobilization in defence of ‘traditional Russian family values’. Child rights are conceived of as weapons in a Western moral war against Russia, but simultaneously, the popular appeal of the campaign stems from a profound distrust in Russian state administrators, who purportedly use the CRC for personal gain. This paper suggests that this disbelief makes the protesters locate notions of citizenship primarily to the intimate social sphere, prioritizing ‘parental rights’ rather than ‘civil rights’ defined by the state-citizen relationship. It is also suggested that the confidence of citizens in their own state administration must be considered if the Convention is to be successfully implemented.",TRUE,FALSE,Child rights|corporal punishment|family values|juvenile justice|nationalism|Russia|social policy|UNCRC,2020-04-25T00:44:17.654041,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:43:36.128603,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/citation/,5md7u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea16137fe323800d8c3853e/,5ea16137fe323800d8c3853e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5md7u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5md7u,https://doi.org/10.1163/15718182-02404007

The Impact of International Cooperation on Capital Taxation,"The downward trend in capital taxes since the 1980s has recently reversed for personal capital income. At the same time, it continued for corporate profits. Why have these tax rates di-verged after a long period of parallel decline? We argue that the answer lies in different levels of change in the fights against tax evasion and tax avoidance. The fight against evasion by households progressed significantly since 2009, culminating in the multilateral adoption of automatic exchange of information (AEI). In contrast, international efforts against base ero-sion and profit shifting (BEPS) failed to curb tax avoidance by corporations. We theorize that international cooperation is an intervening variable, countering the negative impact of tax competition on capital taxation by reducing the risk of capital flight. Under such conditions, domestic political pressures in favor of higher capital taxes can unfold. We confirm our argu-ment in a difference-in-difference analysis and through additional tests with data for up to 35 OECD countries from 2000-2017. Our central estimate suggests that the average tax rate on dividends in 2017 is 4.5 percentage points higher than it would have been absent international tax cooperation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-04-25T00:41:41.455605,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:41:21.620888,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/citation/,tvneu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea0b35635f4bf00a91f8f51/,5ea0b35635f4bf00a91f8f51,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tvneu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tvneu,https://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2020.1752769

Although some prior studies have investigated race differences in parental college savings, none have taken an intersectional approach, and most of these studies were conducted with cohorts of students who pre-date key demographic changes among U.S. college-goers (such as the reversal of the gender gap in college completion). Drawing on theories of parental investment and data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), we show that both race and gender are associated with whether parents save for college, as well as how much they save. Both Black boys and Black girls experience savings disadvantages relative to their White peers. However, particularly striking disparities face Black girls: Black girls with the strongest academic credentials receive savings equivalent to those with the weakest academic credentials. Results suggest that this in due, at least in part, to the fact that high-achieving Black girls tend to come from families that are much less well-off than high achievers in other race-gender groups. As a result, parents of Black girls frequently rely on funding sources other than their own earnings or savings to pay for their children’s college. These include private loans that may pose financial challenges for Black girls and their families across generations, thus deepening inequalities along the lines of gender, race, and class.

Governors have issued stay-at-home orders, and prosecutors have filed criminal charges against individuals for defying those orders. And yet, many Americans have still refused to keep their distance from their fellow citizens, even if they had symptoms of infection. This study explores the underlying causes for those who intend to defy these norms.
Methods: Using national-level data from a March 2020 survey of 989 Americans, we explore intentions to defy social distancing norms by testing an interactionist theory of foundation-based moral behavior in combination with faith in President Trump.  The analysis controls for a range of variables, including measures of low self-control and deterrence. 
Results: Low self-control is the strongest predictor of defiance intentions. Consistent with interactionist theory, defiance intentions are significantly higher for those holding a specific faith in Trump and those endorsing binding foundation.  Furthermore, the interaction of these two variables is significant and in the predicted direction. The results hold for two different measures of faith in Trump. 
Conclusions: Even with a strong effect for low self-control, faith in President Trump is a strong predictor of refusal to social distance, and its effect is largest among individuals high in binding foundations.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|moral foundations|pandemic|President Trump|social distancing,2020-04-25T00:39:43.730539,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:39:19.325460,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/citation/,fudzq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea059579fd598007956f12e/,5ea059579fd598007956f12e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fudzq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fudzq,NA

A Case Study on the Regulation of Uber in New York,"Platform companies like Uber not only disrupt existing markets but also contest existing regulatory regimes. This raises the question of how, when, and why such companies are regulated. This paper develops, tests and defends a theoretical framework that explains the politics of regulatory response to the rise of platform capitalism. Using discourse network analysis and a case study on the regulation of Uber in New York, it shows that the success or failure of regulations depends on the ability of actors to mobilize broad coalition; that narratives affect the composition of these coalitions; and that platform companies have both unique political strengths and vulnerabilities. The paper makes substantive contributions to our understanding of the politics of platform capitalism, and it makes theoretical contributions to the literatures on coalitional politics, ideational institutionalism, and business power.",TRUE,FALSE,Business Power|Coalitional Politics|Discourse Network Analysis|Framing|Narratives|Platform Capitalism|Sentiment Analysis,2020-04-23T05:03:00.809908,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-22T12:14:41.842149,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dec|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Transportation",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/citation/,up9qz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9f63359fd598004f568973/,5e9f63359fd598004f568973,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/up9qz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/up9qz,NA

The rapid uptake of the label, the article concludes, was the result of the Ford Foundation’s 1951 decision to name its social science unit the “Behavioral Sciences Program” (BSP). With Ford’s en- couragement, the term was widely adopted by quantitative social scientists eager to tap the founda- tion’s social science funds.

This paper is the first national study of scams targeting noncitizens seeking immigration legal services. Although the universe of all scams remains unknown, we can examine whether FTC scam reports more common in welcoming counties, even after accounting for restrictionist immigration contexts. I construct a county-year database (N = 3,135 over a four-year time period, 2011-2014) across secondary data sources to analyze the correlates of immigration scam complaints submitted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The data capture instances where individuals were willing to report scams. Results indicate welcoming contexts of reception are over-represented among counties where individuals willingly reported scams. I also find fewer-than-expected reports are filed where immigration restrictionist policies are most common, but restrictionism does not offset the role of welcoming contexts. A robust safety net proved the most reliable predictor of immigration scams reported to the FTC. Immigration attorneys, legal aid services, and language access were also positively associated with the number of FTC scam reports. In this national study, welcoming contexts of reception are also more closely related to the number of immigration scam reports than immigration restrictionism.",TRUE,FALSE,consumer crime|deportations|fraud|Hispanics|immigration|immigration enforcement|noncitizen|rights,2020-04-22T05:03:02.727682,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-21T20:44:12.853905,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/citation/,hsd4a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9f393135f4bf00341f88b5/,5e9f393135f4bf00341f88b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hsd4a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hsd4a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hsd4a,NA
