Rather than picking stocks, index funds replicate stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500. But where do these indices actually come from? This paper analyzes the politico-economic role of index providers, a small group of highly profitable firms including MSCI, S&amp;P DJI, and FTSE Russell, and develops a research agenda from an IPE perspective. We argue that these index providers have become actors that exercise growing private authority as they steer investments through the indices they create and maintain. While technical expertise is a precondition, their brand is the primary source of index provider authority, which is entrenched through network externalities. Rather than a purely technical exercise, constructing indices is inherently political. Which companies or countries are included into an index or excluded (i.e. receive investment in- or outflows) is based on criteria defined by index providers, thereby setting standards for corporate governance and investor access. Hence, in this new age of passive asset management index providers are becoming gatekeepers that exert de facto regulatory power and thus may have important effects on corporate governance and the economic policies of countries.",TRUE,FALSE,capital flows|index funds|index providers|passive asset management|private authority|stock market indices,2019-11-20T12:25:03.872419,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-20T12:24:40.298845,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/citation/,whb75,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd3ae461d56d2000cde5a66/,5dd3ae461d56d2000cde5a66,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/whb75/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/whb75,NA

Progress has been limited by the availability of quantitative data to test competing theories, by divergent ideas regarding both predictor and outcomes variables, and by differences of opinion over methodology. To address all these problems, we utilize Seshat: Global History Databank, a vast storehouse of information designed to test theories concerning the drivers of social complexity in world history. In addition to the Big Gods hypothesis, which proposes that moralizing religion contributed to the success of increasingly large-scale complex societies, we consider the role of warfare, animal husbandry, and affluence in the rise of moralizing religions. Using a broad range of nuanced measures of moralizing religion, we find strong support for previous research showing that institutions endorsing beliefs in supernatural enforcement arise after, not before, the sharpest rises in social complexity in world history. In addition, our analyses suggest that intergroup warfare, supported by resource availability, played a significant role in driving the rise of both social complexity and moralizing religions.

While the influence of electoral systems on accountability and representation has been widely studied, the link between electoral systems and corruption remains sparse. This paper develops a model for the interplay between corruption and electoral rules, considering the incentives for challengers to expose the corruption undertaken by the incumbents. I identify two major components: first, rules that increase competition create incentives for freeriding, as challengers would prefer that other challengers pay the cost of exposure. Second, larger district sizes create coordination problems, as the same incumbent may be overexposed, while others were not exposed at all. These characteristics make a mix of high competitiveness and PR the worst system regarding incentives for corruption.

In this paper, we study how investment capacity, defined as the resources remaining after the municipality perform the mandatory expenditures, influences elections in Brazil. We theorize that when a politician wins the election, this generates commitment problems in low investment capacity municipalities, as new mayors are unable to reward the firms that contributed to their campaigns. We test these claims by considering a close-elections regression discontinuity design coupled with heterogeneous quantile effects for Brazilian municipalities between 2000 and 2012. We find that incumbent mayors in towns with low investment capacity receive less campaign donation afterward and are more disadvantaged in their reelection contests. The results are robust to design variations and changes in party labels or mayoral characteristics.

Archaeological data and concepts in the dispute between Jean-Claude Gardin and Jean-Claude Passeron,"The issue of the definition and position of archaeology as a discipline is examined in relation to the dispute which took place from 1980 to 2009 between the archaeologist Jean-Claude Gardin and the sociologist Jean-Claude Passeron. This case study enables us to explore the actual conceptual relationships between archaeology and the other sciences (as opposed to those wished for or prescribed). The contrasts between the positions declared by the two researchers and the rooting of their arguments in their disciplines are examined: where the sociologist makes use of his philosophical training, the archaeologist relies mainly on his work on semiology and informatics. Archaeology ultimately plays a minor role in the arguments proposed. This dispute therefore cannot be considered as evidence for the movement of concepts between archaeology and the social sciences. A blind spot in the debate, relating to the ontological specificities of archaeological objects, nevertheless presents itself as a possible way of implementing this movement.",TRUE,FALSE,Epistemology of archaeology|Epistemology of the social sciences|Jean-Claude Gardin|Jean-Claude Passeron|Theory of archaeology,2019-11-16T22:00:41.746834,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-16T22:00:31.197367,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/citation/,hjknp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd00b11453fe6000d91f337/,5dd00b11453fe6000d91f337,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjknp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hjknp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hjknp,https://doi.org/10.4000/palethnologie.327

Some Preliminary Evidence from a Most Likely Case,"While universities play a key role in questions of free speech and political viewpoint diversity, they are often associated with the opposite of a free exchange of ideas: a proliferation of restrictive campus speech codes, violent protests against controversial speakers, and even the firing of inconvenient professors. For some observers these trends on university campuses are a clear indicator of the dire future for freedom of speech. Others view these incidents as scandalized singular events and regard the campus intolerance as a mere myth. We take an empirical look at some of the claims in the debate and present original survey evidence from a most likely case: the leftist social science studentship at Goethe University Frankfurt. Our results show that taking offense is a common experience and that a sizable share of students is in favor of restricting speech on campus. We also find evidence for conformity pressures on campus and that both, the desire to restrict speech and the reluctance to speak openly, differ significantly across political ideology. Students on the left are less likely to tolerate controversial viewpoints and students on the right are more likely to self-censor on politically sensitive issues such as gender, immigration or sexual and ethnic minorities. These findings have important implications for the social sciences and academia more broadly.",TRUE,FALSE,Freedom of Expression|Free Speech|Higher Education|Political Ideology|Tolerance|University|Viewpoint Diversity,2019-11-16T14:10:44.065876,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-16T14:10:13.915450,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e12|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Interpersonal and Small Group Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Matthias Revers|Richard Traunmüller,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/citation/,b537k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dced84d453fe6000d906702/,5dced84d453fe6000d906702,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b537k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b537k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b537k,NA
