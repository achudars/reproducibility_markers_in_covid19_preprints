Students are apathetic towards Physical Science  and question, as to,” How this course  is related to their majors?” More than sixty percent of the students come from institutions where English is not the medium of instruction, which makes student learning and academic achievement challenging as they are less proficient in English language.  After observing the uasge of incorrect scientific formulas in assessment test  and the number of failures,for two consecutive semesters, the instructor was keen to find an effective strategy to enable students understand concepts and to transformed  surface learning  to deep learning through developing advanced techniques  in writing assignment. The main purpose of this research is to roll the situation and let the students partake in the process of trasformation from diffident failures to confident achievers.This study is participatory action research, in which  instructor designs effective written  task to engage students in their learning . The study is conducted through two semesters with a total of 32 students. The effectiveness of this approach is studied using questionnaire at the end of each semester,students evaluation and teacher observation.Major outcomes of this study were overall improvement in students uasge of scientific formulas in tests,problem solving,language proficiency, performance in summative assessment and also  fortifying   confidence. This process transformed instructor into   engaging and reflecting practitioner.Also,  these strategy was implemented by other instructors teaching the course and proved effective  in  opening  a path  to changes in related areas of the course curriculum.

However, this is not the case in Algerian Secondary school English classes. Regular observation indicated almost no continuous teacher-learner conversation while lessons. This paper intends to observe language use between the teachers and students; what instruction is used and how is it dealt with by learners. The results would aim at revealing the shortage learners show in the speaking skill and confirm the effectiveness of observation for classroom evaluation. Adopting a systematic observation, six classes at secondary school level in two different cities in Algeria were observed and audio-taped through a quantitative and qualitative method. Data is analysed from the amount of teacher’s talk, types of classroom discourse structure and questioning. Based on data analysis, the findings showed that most of the talk is approximately initiated by the teacher; learners act only when asked display questions and keep silent when are challenged by influential questions. It also showed display questions dominate the classroom for they maximize learners’ participation. Yet, this learner’ short output would limit the learners’ critical reflection and lessen the classroom interaction among participants. Therefore, this paper urges teachers to adopt a student-centred approach to FL learning that enables students’ to talk more and participate in conversations negotiating meaning with their teacher and peers.

The study involved 23 third-year economics undergraduates at a public university in Thailand who were explicitly taught 13 learning and communication strategies in class. The impacts of the LACS instruction on oral communication ability were assessed by the participants’ pre- and post- oral presentation tests, and the perceptions of the participants as well as their strategy use were obtained from students’ reflective journals (SRJ), semi-structured focus group interviews, and the teacher’s observation notes. The findings reveal that all students’ oral presentation test scores significantly improved and confirm that teaching a combination of different LACS could enhance oral communication ability. The qualitative results indicate that all 23 students had positive perceptions of the strategies instruction. Furthermore, it is revealed that strong students used a combination of all three types (cognitive, metacognitive, and affective) of learning strategies (LS) and a communication strategy (CS) of self-repair, while moderate and weak students employed a combination of two types (cognitive and affective) of LS and self-repair. Nonetheless, this study would argue that strong, moderate, and weak students did apply metacognitive strategies, as evidenced by their reflections on their strategy use in the journals and the self-assessment form, but some students were not aware of it. Consequently, future studies should emphasize raising students’ awareness of their metacognitive strategy use.",TRUE,FALSE,communication strategies|economics students|learning strategies|oral communication ability|strategy instruction,2018-07-02T11:57:41.930230,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:37:32.870300,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/citation/,jd5by,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8p5dz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/relationships/node/,8p5dz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2ddc40daf8210012d54052/,5b2ddc40daf8210012d54052,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jd5by/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jd5by/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jd5by

The research questions are threefold: a) What are the types of anxiety experienced by the students, b) What is the anxiety level of them, and c) What is the correlation between foreign language anxiety (FLA) and the willingness to communicate (WTC) of the students. Quantitative descriptive approach was employed and the data were collected from 98 participants in an English Department by making use of the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) and Likert-type WTC Scale. Pearson Correlation test was run to provide answers of the research questions. The results of this study indicated a strong positive correlation between learners’ foreign language classroom anxiety and their willingness to communicate. Fear of negative evaluation, test anxiety, and communication apprehension were the students’ types of anxiety. In addition, students had high level of anxiety, which in turn, made them difficult in dealing with language learning process and tend to have low desire to speak. Therefore, this study tries to highlight whether anxiety is a significant barrier to WTC, to determine the types and level of FLA, as well as to provide suggestions to help minimize the anxiety.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL learners|Indonesian context|language anxiety|willingness to communicate,2018-07-02T11:57:41.892512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:37:51.978781,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/citation/,x8t2v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w6dfu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/relationships/node/,w6dfu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2ddb60d65eaa000fda60a6/,5b2ddb60d65eaa000fda60a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8t2v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x8t2v/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x8t2v

The study specifically seeks to investigate the perspectives of non-native Arab and non-Arab EFL teachers as they, working in the native Arab setting, often resort to Arabic (Al-Nofaie, 2010; Machaal, 2012). However, there are glaring research gaps about non-native EFL teachers’ and adult learners’ beliefs on the use of first language (L1) in the classroom. For this purpose, the study used quantitative research design, and administered two questionnaires, one for the teachers and the other for the students. Students’ questionnaire complemented that of the teachers. Forty teachers and sixty students were selected based on stratified random sampling. The findings of the study revealed that all camps of teachers, Arab, non-Arab, male, female, and students were in favour of judicious bilingual approach. The study finds statistically significant difference between the beliefs of Arab and non-Arab EFL teachers about the use of L1. The findings suggest that Arab EFL teachers’ use of Arabic is extensive, while non-Arab EFL teachers’ use of Arabic is well-timed. The study suggested practical implications for the improvement of English Language Teaching (ELT) in Saudi Arabia by recommending planned, occasional and judicious use of L1 while teaching EFL adult learners.",TRUE,FALSE,adult learners|bilingual approach|L1 in classroom|non-native EFL teachers,2018-07-02T11:57:41.848697,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:38:14.056097,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/citation/,38nfa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8pyds/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/relationships/node/,8pyds,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dda02daf8210012d53e1d/,5b2dda02daf8210012d53e1d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38nfa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/38nfa/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/38nfa
