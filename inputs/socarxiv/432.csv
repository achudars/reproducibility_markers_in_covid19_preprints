Several studies have discussed the transfer issues in language learning, yet a few of them focus on the transfer relationships between Arabic and English language writing skills. Regardless of the huge linguistic distinction between the English language and Arabic language, it is presumed that Arabic and English writing skills positively, negatively, and neutrally transferred in a dynamic relationship. The researcher has conducted observations and interviews with Fatimah, the participant of this study, and analyzed her texts in both languages to illustrate how dynamic relationships between L1 and L2 in the composition skills is and what the effects of language transfer in the composition skills between L1 and L2 are. The data were collected and analyzed in January 2018. The results demonstrate effects of L2 on L1 as the following; first, a reverse or backward transfer implemented in three ways; positive, negative, and neutral transfer. Second, they indicate that there is a dynamic relationship between second language performance and first language proficiency in composition particularly. It is hoped that this knowledge will assist students in being aware of the effects of L2 on L1 specifically in composition and taking the advantages to accelerate the rate of language learning. It is recommended for future research to conduct studies in bilingual writings to investigate how L1 could be a resource and advocate of language development.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic as a first Language proficiency (L1)|dynamic transfer|English as a second language (L2) writing,2019-01-05T04:51:46.812310,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:51:06.148137,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/citation/,2t6cf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c25f9a7c0a7001b3cd4ef/,5c2c25f9a7c0a7001b3cd4ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2t6cf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2t6cf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.24,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2t6cf

It aims to identify gender-based perceptions of English language teachers from a Saudi university regarding the role of the textbooks, study material, support of English language teachers, the students’ learning strategies, students’ motivation and self-evaluation in enhancing learner autonomy. This empirical survey has involved 30 male and 30 female (n=60) English language teachers from English language center of Taif University, Saudi Arabia to record their insights and views about their perceptions and prospects of these pedagogical constructs in their teaching practices. The participants of the study responded to a 35-point Likert-scale modified questionnaire to generate data. Independent-samples T-test has been run to calculate percentages of their responses as well as to identify any statistically significant gender-based differences. The results revealed that only six items out of the total 35 have shown significant gender-based differences in the perceptions of the participants of the survey. The findings have revealed that the participants of this study bear extremely positive attitudes towards the pedagogical significance of learner autonomy and have exhibited encouraging trends about the implementation of this construct in the classrooms.

It also aims at highlighting the way these topic shifts are observed by participants. This paper is a case study that tries to understand the performance of topic shifts in a recorded conversation with emphasis on the construction, markers and sequences of topics, adding empirical evidence to the overall knowledge related to this issue. It also studies perceptions of Saudi women on topic shifting. Two instruments were used: data recording and analysis, and a four-axis questionnaire. Gathered data was analyzed using interactional sociolinguistics analysis and statistics to arrive at results. The findings of the study indicate that the most frequent shifts of topics occurred after a pause where speakers introduced a new topic. These shifts were performed by using discourse markers such as asking questions, seeking explanations, or telling personal stories. Topic shifts might be violated in informal settings based on relations between participants. Questionnaire results conclude that topic shifts are performed in relation to interest, and motivated by closeness and need.

The main goals of the study are examining what kinds of corrective feedback that Saudi EFL students provide when they edit their peers’ texts in Google Docs, how they can improve their texts based on the collaborative online peer review, and what their attitudes are toward using Google Docs as an online peer review tool.  The study utilizes Google Docs, an online questionnaire, and an interview as research tools; after thematic analysis, the results show that Saudi EFL students focus on local and global writing issues and provide different types of corrective feedback that aid them to improve their writing. They have positive attitudes toward using Google Docs in peer review. This tool allows them to engage in an online social environment outside the classroom, feel as critical editors, adjust their writing, and avoid embarrassment.

Yet throughout the developing world, authoritarian, ethnosectarian, and clientelist political parties often intervene in university politics, particularly through competition in student elections. We argue this intervention limits the liberalizing effect of participation in university associational life. To test this argument, we measure the effect of political party intervention in university life using a panel survey experiment conducted at the American University of Beirut (AUB) during the university's annual student elections. Using a choice-based conjoint experiment embedded in a difference-in-differences design--the first of its kind--we estimate the causal effect of participation on non-partisan students.

This paper aims to contribute to our knowledge about reading in this region by studying the motivation and habits of recreational reading of university educated youth in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It specifically aims to answer the questions: what are the recreational reading frequency, and the type and language of the reading material? Which personal characteristics correlate with recreational reading habits? And which factors impact the motivation to read? The findings are based on a survey of 775 undergraduate students at UAE University. The survey questionnaire included an adult reading motivation scale developed by Schutte and Malouff (2007) which was modified after assessing its goodness-of-fit to the UAE context using confirmatory factor analysis. Pearson’s chi-square test, Poisson regression and ANOVA were used to identify the correlates of reading habits and compare motivation scores across demographic groups. Seventy-one percent of the students read at least one book for pleasure in the last six months and they read, on average, for 2.3 hours per week. Reading frequency depends on gender, the student’s secondary education, and the parents’ education. Gender, parents’ education have significant effects on the motivation scores and the preferred language of reading (p-value &lt; 0.01).

Case Study: Licence 2 English Students, Mostaganem University","last decade has witnessed the rapid popularity of social networking sites like Facebook and College students constitute a large population of Facebook users. Advancement in telecommunication and information technology has resulted in a tremendous impact on teaching and learning. Accordingly, university education has started to benefit from online learning platforms. The revolutionary progress that the internet has known is giving a modern dimension to the teaching process, thus, facilitating university students' learning. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which Facebook can be an effective means to distribute academic content to university students. Department of English of Mostaganem University is involved in this study. The Study combines quantitative with qualitative types of research. Quantitate research involves distributing a survey in the form of a questionnaire among License 2 students department of English as well as teachers to examine to what extent Facebook can be used for academic purposes. Qualitative research is dedicated to the analysis and observation of studens’ Facebook group page. The results showed that Students confirm that Facebook is a useful tool to distribute and share academic knowledge yet there are still many obstacles that hinder its use at the university context. On another hand, the present research suggests some helping solutions to enhance Facebook educational use among university students and their teachers.

More specifically yet, it is concerned with examining the intricate correlation between Moroccan English Language Teachers’ (ELT) attitudes and practices with respect to the way they understand and apply FA by means of WCF on students’ written productions. To that end, the study seeks to investigate this issue in the light of the following guiding questions: What beliefs do Moroccan ELT teachers hold about FA and WCF? How do these teachers provide WCF to their students during the writing lesson? To address these questions, we have opted for a mixed method approach that includes questionnaires for 110 teachers, document analysis of 30 writing productions and a follow- up semi-structured interviews with teachers. Date has been interpreted through an Explanatory Sequential Design. Inspired by Lee‘s (2009) analytical model and Perumanathan (2014) study, major findings have been presented regarding mismatches. These findings have revealed strong mismatches between teachers espoused beliefs concerning WCF, as a formative assessment tool, and their actual classroom practices. Finally, the study sets some implications for teachers, supervisors underlining the implementation of WCF in classroom practices.",TRUE,FALSE,Beliefs|feedback|formative assessment|mismatch|writing,2019-01-05T04:49:46.501181,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:48:10.083227,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/citation/,6j5n7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2bf0800e8efd0017d09853/,5c2bf0800e8efd0017d09853,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6j5n7/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6j5n7

With the recent increase in the influx of foreign students gaining admission into Thai universities yearly, the result is that such universities will be a coexistence of cultures. This study therefore aims to investigate the situational face-threat contexts where Thai students use silence as a politeness strategy. This aim is guided by the main research question of what different situational face-threat contexts could lead to the use of silence by Thai students in their foreign-peer interactions in a Thai multicultural university context. Twenty students’ interactions were sampled using micro-socio-ethnographic technique, with data from observation, interview, and questionnaire. The main findings revealed that: uncertainty of language proficiency, expected hurting words from interlocutor, and unexpected negative change in hearer’s mood, amongst others, were the main circumstances where Thai students use silence as a face-saving politeness strategy. The findings imply better intercultural awareness in multicultural university contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Foreign-peer interaction|multicultural context|silence|Thai university students,2019-01-05T04:49:00.946680,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:47:57.100332,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/citation/,ak6qm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2bef94a7c0a700184024ec/,5c2bef94a7c0a700184024ec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak6qm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ak6qm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ak6qm
