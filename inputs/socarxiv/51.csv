Recent efforts have begun to explore mental health consequences of these contexts, with an emphasis on national surveys. To date few Colombian studies explore mental health and wellbeing from a lived experience perspective. Those that do, overlook processes that enable survival. In response to this gap, we conducted a life history study of seven internally displaced Colombian women in the Cundinamarca department, analysing 18 interview sessions and 36 hours of transcripts. A thematic network analysis informed by Latin-American perspectives on gender and frameworks on resilience from the global south, explored women’s coping strategies in response to conflict driven hardships related to mental wellbeing. Analysis illuminated that: 1) the gendered impacts of the armed conflict on women´s emotional wellbeing works through exacerbating historical gendered violence and inequality, often intensifying existing emotional health challenges, and 2) coping strategies reflect women's ability to mobilise cognitive, bodied, social, material, and symbolic power.  Our findings highlight that the socio-political contexts of women’s lives are inseparable from efforts to achieve mental wellbeing, and the value of deep narrative and historical work to capturing the complexity of women’s experiences within conflict settings. We suggest the importance of social interventions to supporting the mental health of women in conflict settings, to centre the social and political contexts faced by marginalised groups within efforts to improve mental health.",TRUE,FALSE,Armed conflict|Colombia|coping strategies|internal-displacement|life history interviews|mental health|resilience|women;,2021-03-25T09:47:41.719901,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-25T09:47:32.638551,FALSE,NA,no,"Given the sensitive nature of the data, we will not be making data publicly available.

Like many intellectuals, revolutionary leftists did not get along with each other very often. Since the inception of Marxism, which is the doctrine of communism—an extreme and distinctive flavor of socialism—the far Left has portrayed adherents of less revolutionary ideologies as enemies of the working people. The followers of evolutionary socialism—the Social Democrats—were accused by the communists of betraying the proletariat. Non-Marxist currents of socialism, such as Fascism and National Socialism, were excluded from the socialist camp and put on the right wing by Marxist-Leninist propaganda. Stalinist political science became a benchmark that set markers to distinguish between the genuine Left and the Right.

Evidence from Sweden on the assumptions of risk-aversion models,"Relative risk aversion (RRA) models explain class inequalities in education with reference to risk avoidance, i.e., the risky choice assumption (RCA). Whether education entails any risks has been subject to minimal scrutiny. In this paper, we test whether or not vocational education is a safety net that protects from marginalization but at the cost of limited access to tertiary education and service class positions. We present an empirical assessment for upper-secondary track choices in Sweden, contrasting the vocational and the academic tracks for those that do not pursue higher educational degrees. The only evidence in favor of the RCA is that when taking selection into account, graduates of the academic track without a tertiary degree initially face higher risks of not being stably employed in their early 20s than their counterparts from vocational education. Differences between secondary tracks in registered unemployment risks are small throughout the life course and, if anything, they favor the academic track for both genders and cohorts. Moreover, the academic track significantly protects men of both cohorts from the risk of entering unskilled routine occupations.

A robust literature has identified a number of individual-level determinants of climate change attitudes and behaviors.  In particular, political orientations and self-transcendent values are amongst the most consistent and substantive predictors.  But, political orientations and individual values do not operate in isolation of each other, and rather are deeply related constructs.  Accordingly, this analysis focuses on identifying the direct and interactive effects of political orientations and human values on climate change attitudes and behaviors.  Adopting cross-national data from 16 Western European states (2016 ESS), we find that when in alignment, the effect of human values on climate change concern and policy support is amplified by political orientations.

The current study uses the legislative removal of a cap on the maximum number of charters in North Carolina as a natural experiment to assess the impacts of charter school growth on teacher quality and student composition in traditional public schools (TPS) at different levels of local market penetration. Using an instrumental variable difference-in-differences approach to account for endogenous charter demand, we find that intensive local charter entry reduces the inflow of new teachers at nearby TPS, leading to a more experienced and credentialed teaching workforce on average. However, we find that the entry of charters serving predominantly White students leads to reductions in average teacher experience, effectiveness, and credentials at nearby TPS. Overall these findings suggest that the composition of the teacher workforce in TPS will continue to change as charter schools further expand, and that the spillover effects of future charter expansion will vary by the types of students served by charters.",TRUE,FALSE,Charter schools|School choice|Teacher labor market|Teacher quality,2021-03-24T21:40:41.704616,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24T21:40:32.942813,FALSE,NA,no,Data is restricted use administrative data.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics,Stephen B.

We present international comparisons of publication, citation and internationalization trends for conference papers for 50 countries to show anomalous growth for Russia in recent years. We proceed to sectoral analysis to show that the universities are mostly affected, not the Russian academy of sciences, and hypothesize that such behavior stems from increased government evaluation pressure and simplistic bibliometrics usage, which conforms to the trend observed in other countries.

This chapter outlines the theoretical arguments for why and how transport, specifically rail transit, is expected to impact the socioeconomic composition of neighborhoods and reviews the relevant empirical literature on the subject. Neighborhood socioeconomic change, including gentrification, can be viewed as the product of shifts in residential sorting of residents reacting to the placement of a new (transit) amenity which may place increased demand for living in a particular area. This demand may place an upward pressure on nearby housing values and rents, affecting the socioeconomic composition of those willing and able to afford these price premiums, thus spurring or accelerating gentrification. Rising land values may also lead to the disproportionate exit of lower-income residents unable to keep up with elevated rents or property taxes. To date, the empirical evidence on the link between transport investments and gentrification has mixed findings, very often underscoring the importance of local context in directing a neighborhood’s path. Research has overwhelmingly centered on aggregate neighborhood changes, but several studies have recently emerged that center on individual movements that give rise to these neighborhood-scale outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,gentrification|neighborhood change|Transit,2021-03-24T21:41:02.534192,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24T21:40:48.666932,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Elizabeth Delmelle,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/citation/,5ka2g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605b4312818bde00e23add50/,605b4312818bde00e23add50,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ka2g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ka2g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ka2g,NA

Engaging with the electorate through social media is an integral part of political communications, informing voters on politicians’ voting intentions. Here, we examine whether environmental messaging on Twitter by UK politicians can be used to predict the likelihood of them voting for pro-environmental measures. Using historical Twitter data and voting records, we determine that environmental messaging has increased over the last decade, but the probability of voting environmentally has not. Instead, voting trends are highly heterogenous over time, varying by political party. However, after accounting for party effects, politicians with higher levels of environmental messaging are more likely to vote against party lines in favour of environmental measures. This work suggests that environmental messaging can be used to inform voting intentions, but is a poor predictor compared to political party association.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-24T21:41:22.109578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24T21:41:08.989086,TRUE,"Between 2017 and 2020, TFJ was a member of the Labour party.
