Achieving sustainable agricultural production, generating employment, reducing imports and minimising post-harvest crops losses are the major objectives of the Algerian government. However, based on the evaluation of existing policies, this study found that poor governance is hampering the agriculture sector, particularly in terms of management of financial resources, where most financial investments are made only for short-term gains. The lack of awareness about the importance of post-harvest practices and lack of using modern technology threaten the growth of this sector.

Recently, private sectors have undergone substantial changes by focusing on good governance as a tool to enhance value, reputation, and image. The primary features of firms with good governance include greater emphasis on accountability practices, proper implementation of a corporate integrity system, and sound internal controls in place to avoid risk and to ensure policy and procedures that are complied. Government Linked Companies (GLCs) as the backbone of the Malaysian government have been harshly criticised for not being able to create value(s) despite receiving high priority in the process of getting government projects. Therefore, this study aims to examine the role of good governance systems, which are reflected through accountability systems, corporate integrity systems, and internal control systems towards value creation of Malaysian GLCs. This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey among 100 GLCs in Malaysia. Based on the regression analysis, this study found that corporate integrity systems and internal control systems were vital elements in ensuring value creation in GLCs.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|GLC|government linked companies|integrity systems|internal control|Malaysia|value creation,2021-06-20T20:54:03.163097,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-20T20:53:47.380746,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/citation/,ucna6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bt7rv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/relationships/node/,bt7rv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ce9f0a6bd0d100a726c55b/,60ce9f0a6bd0d100a726c55b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucna6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ucna6/,https://doi.org/10.1504/IJBGE.2020.106350,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ucna6

Therefore, this study aims to examine the impacts of climate change, especially El Nino and flood, on the financial performance of Malaysian agro and plantation firms. The study used a panel data set on 33 Malaysian agro and plantation firms listed in Bursa Malaysia for the period of 2003 to 2016. A panel of regression models including GMM, Pooled OLS, Random Effect and Fixed Effect were used to analyze the data. The results show that both the El Nino and flood have significant negative impact on the firms’ financial performance as measured by ROA and ROE. The findings indicate that climate change results in reduction of agricultural production which reduces revenue and consequently the profit of the agro and plantation firms. The study findings might help the firm managers as well as policy makers to take into consideration the environmental factors that affect the overall financial health of the firms and take appropriate adaptation and mitigation policies to climate change at firm level and macro level in the country.",TRUE,FALSE,Agro firm|Climate change|El Nino|Financial performance|Flood|Malaysia|Panel regression|Plantation firm,2021-06-20T20:53:28.043675,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-20T20:53:12.503620,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/citation/,m9ugw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vwfjq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/relationships/node/,vwfjq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ce9d683972e400ba392330/,60ce9d683972e400ba392330,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9ugw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m9ugw/,https://doi.org/10.1504/IJPTI.2020.108741,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m9ugw

Based on a panel data set of 25 OECD countries for 43 years, we used the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach and the related intermediate estimators, including pooled mean group (PMG), mean group (MG) and dynamic fixed effect (DFE) to achieve the objective. The estimated ARDL model has also been checked for robustness using the two substitute single equation estimators, these being the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). Empirical results reveal that economic growth, trade openness and technological progress significantly influence renewable energy use over the long-term in OECD countries. While the long-term nature of dynamics of the variables is found to be similar across 25 OECD countries, their short-term dynamics are found to be mixed in nature. This is attributed to varying levels of trade openness and technological progress in OECD countries.

It opens a new narrative on how the geographic concept of place is conceptualized in smallholder farmers and climate change adaptation literature in Sub-Saharan Africa. The review suggested that place is not only the 'where' of a location but a location geographically connected and interdependent to illustrate how smallholder farmers' experiences in adapting to climate shocks interact with global efforts such as improving food security, eliminating poverty and building sustainable rural livelihood. Through the various climate change adaptation strategies exhibited by different farmer groups, the paper demonstrated that people in places have the agency to make choices that control their destinies irrespective of whatever global force overwhelms them. The paper argues sense of place expressed through ecological place meaning shapes people's intuition, beliefs, actions and experiences as illustrated by smallholders' perception of the determinant and barriers to effective adaptation strategies. The ecological place meaning also influences the 'glocalization' of climate impact on agroecological-based livelihoods at different locations and how maladaptive outcomes are perceived. Place gives people identity by (re)shaping actions and experiences and vice versa. There is an undeviating relationship between power, place and people's experience. Further exploration of the relationship between lifeworld experiences, people, and power is central in understanding the meaning of place to smallholder farmers and climate change interaction",TRUE,FALSE,climate change adaptation|locale|location|sense of place|smallholder farmers|Sub-Saharan Africa,2021-06-19T22:23:22.414128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-19T22:23:09.330600,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/citation/,6tvm9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cd6653d6bcbc007d091ab7/,60cd6653d6bcbc007d091ab7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6tvm9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6tvm9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6tvm9

Unlike popular explanations relying on political or cultural differences, we examine the role that experts and expertise play in shaping the initial responses to COVID-19. We ask three specific questions: (1) Who were the COVID-19 experts, (2) How was expertise mobilized to understand the emerging threat of COVID-19, and (3) How did these expert statements resonate with policymakers and publics in different political contexts? Through our three-case comparison of Mainland China, Hong Kong, and the United States, we show how past experiences with disease outbreaks shaped how experts deployed their expertise to make sense of the emerging crisis. Furthermore, past experiences with disease outbreaks also shape how these forms of expertise become resonant with policymakers and publics, as the past itself becomes a cultural object that is mobilized, contested, and seen as potentially useful to solve the problem of COVID-19. We argue that the process of resonant expertise played a key role in coming up with effective policies to tackle COVID-19.",TRUE,FALSE,China|COVID-19|Expertise|Global Health|Hong Kong|United States,2021-06-19T22:21:49.120993,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-19T22:21:25.327791,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/citation/,43ag8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cd60443972e4007e3950ee/,60cd60443972e4007e3950ee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43ag8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/43ag8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/43ag8
