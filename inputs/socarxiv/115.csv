Although there is much research on the functioning of such citizens’ assemblies, there are only few about how the population perceives them. We explore the sources of citizens’ attitudes towards this institution using a unique representative survey from 15 European countries. We find that those who are less educated, as well as those with a low sense of political competence and an anti-elite sentiment, are more supportive of it.

While there now exist plenty of safeguards addressing the consequences of pollution on natural resources, little attention has been given to those on the knowledge commons. To understand how pollution occurs and is tackled in the knowledge commons, I take the case of a subset of the life science knowledge commons – the Gene Regulation Knowledge Commons (GRKC). Members from the gene regulation community have come together to work towards a knowledge commons under the Gene Regulation Ensemble Effort for the Knowledge Commons (“GREEKC”). Their efforts have been directed at coordinating and aligning the various practices of data management that prevail across different databases pertaining to gene regulation knowledge. The end goal is to establish a standard framework for knowledge management for GRKC. By examining the polluting practices that arise in the GRKC and how this pollution is alleviated, I claim that here, manually curated databases discern between knowledge that is pure or polluted. However, being a part of the same commons do these databases draw the same distinctions between what is pure and what is polluted? Or do different databases arrive at different conclusions?

This study uses novel data from 989 partnered, US parents to empirically examine whether the loss of childcare and new homeschooling demands are associated with employment outcomes early in the pandemic. We also consider whether the division of childcare prior to the pandemic is associated with parents’ employment. For parents with young children, the loss of full-time childcare was associated with an increased risk of unemployment for mothers but not fathers. Yet, father involvement in childcare substantially buffered against negative employment outcomes for mothers of young children. For parents with school-age children, participation in homeschooling was associated with adverse employment outcomes for mothers but not fathers.

The present study aims to investigate explicitation in subtitling from English into Arabic by examining three cohesive devices i.e., reference, substitution, and ellipsis. For the purpose of this study, a parallel corpus was elaborated, consisting of fifteen TED-Ed lessons. The research material is one hour and four minutes, and the total word count of the parallel corpus is 17,491 words. The data collection and analysis were conducted manually. Instances of explicitation of cohesive devices were detected and categorized according to their nature i.e., reference, substitution, or ellipsis based on the model of cohesion proposed by Halliday and Hasan (1976). The findings of the study indicate that instances of explicitation of the three cohesive devices were observed in the corpus under investigation. The findings also show a high percentage of reference-based explicitation (75.86%) followed by substitution-based explicitation (13.79%) and ellipsis-based explicitation (10.34%).

However, students believe that translation is tiring and boring, which makes the students' ability in translation low.

The results showed that there are seven kinds of expressive utterances translation techniques used in Disney’s Aladdin (2019), such as linguistics compression, established equivalence, literal translation, reduction, amplification, modulation, and calque. Implementing translation techniques in teaching translation can increase sensitivity into language, gain more extensive insights about cultures, and enable in producing better translation quality.

The national identity described as a factor forming Nationalism is one of the fields of Nationalism and de-nationalism that always appears in American dystopian novels. A mutually beneficial two-way relationship between the state and the people is essential to build state nationalism. The fading of Nationalism as a result from government’s opressions was revealed by Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, Westerfeld’s Uglies, Collins’s The Hunger Games, and Roth’s Divergent. The main problem of this article is to find out how the national identity becomes the arena of constellations between Nationalism and de-nationalism. The significance of this study is to reveal the Nationalism and de-nationalism through the constellations of national identity through American dystopian novels. Using Derrida’s deconstruction theory, the constellations appear in binary opposition as follows: country versus people; ruler versus society; regulation or oppression versus freedom; power versus weakness; independence versus dependence; intelligence versus stupidity; manipulative party versus receptive party; and global versus local. The main finding of this analysis in that the oppression and totalitarianism of the Government have eroded people’s identity, which turns the sense of Nationalism to de-Nationalism.",TRUE,FALSE,American dystopian novel|deconstruction|de-nationalism|national identity|Nationalism,2020-09-12T16:30:46.213345,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:30:22.286324,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/citation/,sqyvz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5af6052c73550092e9eb9e/,5f5af6052c73550092e9eb9e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sqyvz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sqyvz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sqyvz,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.13

The dialectic relations between voice and power, structure, and function are critically investigated to identify the ideologies involved in the subjugation of the Orient and sustainment of the racial superiority of the Occident. The noise narrative structure and ethnic conflict add to voice disrupts the effective reception of the message conveyed. The Lagoon encapsulates a story-within-a-story with two storytellers relating different narratives and addressing different characters and audiences from different viewpoints. Their narratives elicit responses ranging from trust to distrust depending on the identity of the storyteller and hierarchy of the narrative structure within the story. The study evaluates the impact of structure and ethnic identity on the reception of voice, and shows how structural and cultural noises disrupt the voice of the Orient. It finds that the Occident's perception of the Orient is based on certain stereotypes and misconceptions. The voice of Arsat, a protagonist and storyteller, is accordingly subordinated to the framing voice of the third-person narrator, and his tale structurally functions as a flashback.",TRUE,FALSE,Joseph Conrad|noise|postcolonialism|structuralism|the Lagoon|voice,2020-09-12T16:30:02.249456,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:29:39.970844,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/citation/,ac9hq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5af5262c73550092e9e988/,5f5af5262c73550092e9e988,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac9hq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ac9hq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ac9hq,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.12

The main focus of this paper is on Saudi EFL instructors' attitudes towards the use of translation as a teaching aid and explores to what extent do Saudi teachers tend to use translation in the teaching process. This research paper concludes that teachers use translation as a technique to help the student to understand better and assess the students' overall language learning experience.
