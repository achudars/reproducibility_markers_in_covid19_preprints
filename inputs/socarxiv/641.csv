Despite policy efforts to reduce poverty and economic recovery in the early 2000s, poverty affects many households and certain households are at risk of staying in poverty once they are in it. Using longitudinal panel data from 2005 to 2014, this study defines three indicators of poverty based on asset holdings, rather than income. It then examines the dynamics of asset poverty in Korea across the study period. The study’s primary goal is to reveal differences across the three indicators and identify which groups of poor people in Korea have been structurally trapped in poverty. We applied a dynamic panel model of discrete choice to the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) from the 1st to 10th waves and show that, despite the indicator, the asset poor who experienced asset poverty in the previous surveyed year or at wave 1 are likely to fall into structural and persistent poverty over time. In addition, the probability of incurring asset poverty decreased with home ownership, higher disposable income, and greater diversification of the household portfolio. Future research should study the duration of asset poverty to complete a comprehensive picture of the asset poverty condition.",TRUE,FALSE,Asset poverty dynamics|dynamic panel model of discrete choice|poverty|South Korea|welfare policy,2018-07-02T11:29:45.957336,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-14T16:54:25.808435,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,Soyoon Weon,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/citation/,78yhf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/et9uh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/relationships/node/,et9uh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a323294015865000ea7c6cd/,5a323294015865000ea7c6cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78yhf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/78yhf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/78yhf,NA

This growth in empirical research has run ahead of theories about the nature of local space: to a large extent, contemporary sociology employs the same conceptions of space developed in works of the Chicago School produced between 1918 and the early 1930’s. This article describes three major notions of locality developed by the Chicago School, respectively defined by ecology, institutions, and subjective perceptions. These accounts of locality are not theoretically consistent, and make reference to partially distinct empirical phenomena. A brief survey of contemporary neighborhood research reveals the persistence of these spatial accounts, as well as uncertainty about the goals of neighborhood research. Revisiting the accounts of urban place developed by the Chicago School suggests five distinct ends for research on locality: research programs focusing specifically on ecology, institutions, or perceptions; methodological and theoretical pluralism in pursuit of maximally rich description; and empirical integration seeking to describe the role of multiple processes in the production of local space.

The article shows that public positions on the proposal inverted the typical relationship between partisanship and environmental attitudes, prompting both supporters and opponents to ignore scientific evidence and the central matter of water safety. In successive rounds of state and regional administrative review, these political stances induced administrators to engage in increasingly legalistic forms of assessment. Although Waukesha’s application was approved in 2016, these administrative dynamics may limit the ability of the recently-enacted Great Lakes Compact to address current and prospective water safety problems in the region. The case typifies an emerging pattern in water governance in the United States: contentious administrative politics drive cooperative agreements to resemble adversarial proceedings, in turn limiting their ability to adapt to new environmental problems.

Recent theory has particularly emphasized social interaction and cognition as key sites for understanding judgment, and a number of studies examine gatekeeping practices as a means of understanding the interactive and perceptual determinants of judgment. This article builds upon previous work by presenting the results of an eighteen-month ethnography at a long-running little magazine based in a large American city. In addition to providing an empirical description of an important but understudied domain of cultural production, this article has two findings of theoretical interest. First, without strong external constraints on processes of group evaluation, editors’ judgments became markedly negative, and their deliberations were often inconclusive. Second, negative and positive evaluations were not symmetric, but were produced by two differing sets of evaluative practices. These findings are broadly consistent with developing field theoretic descriptions of social life, but also raise many empirical and theoretical questions.

The formal system of aristocratic honor culture was gradually supplanted by a bourgeois concept of reputation rooted in the public perception of individual merits. During this period, dueling was a practice of dispute resolution commonly used in honor groups, and also diffused to bourgeois groups in domains such as politics and journalism. This article explores this cultural transformation by examining duels in 20 European novels and comparing these duels with theoretical and historical work on duels as a social practice. The novels present a significantly distorted representation of dueling. This distortion demonstrates the limited ability of the novel, a bourgeois form, to describe group-oriented values such as honor. This is, in turn, sociologically significant: the novels point to major differences in the social psychologies underpinning honor and reputation, and also anticipate the obsolescence of honor culture well before this occurred historically.

Asking whether tax incentives undermine or facilitate development, this paper investigates tax rates and tax holidays in terms of both economic and social impacts in developing countries 1985-2014 in the largest panel data set ever deployed for this purpose. The collection of new data results in three major contributions to the existing literature. First, the analysis shows that the use of tax holidays has increased over the last decade throughout all four regions surveyed: Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. Second, the analysis finds that the effect of tax holidays on FDI is negligible and decreasing, and importantly, that it does not translate into neither real capital accumulation nor economic growth. Third, the paper then investigates how the revenue losses from tax incentives can mean real differences for human development by analyzing the effect on tax revenues, spending, health  and education outcomes.

Yet the implementation of these laws has been inconsistent at best. This article analyzes the case of Nicaragua, which passed a comprehensive law on gender-based violence (Law 779) in 2012. While celebrated by local women’s organizations, Law 779 was subsequently weakened through a series of legislative reforms and executive decrees. This article seeks to explain why state actors in Nicaragua initially supported Law 779 and later sought to undermine it. I argue that in contexts characterized by a high concentration of political power like Nicaragua, transnational governance structures are insufficient to ensure the success of gender violence legislation. Through an analysis of Law 779, this article contributes to broader debates about the nature of state legitimacy and the potential of legal advocacy to address violence against women.",TRUE,FALSE,gender violence|law|Nicaragua|politics,2018-07-02T11:29:45.256662,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-13T20:49:54.882501,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Latin American Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/citation/,xbh3t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/exs5p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/relationships/node/,exs5p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3161fbfdec39000c61d8b4/,5a3161fbfdec39000c61d8b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbh3t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xbh3t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xbh3t,NA

The ensuing deindustrialization was greatest c1750-c1860. We ask how much of India’s deindustrialization was due to local supply-side forces -- such as political fragmentation and a rising incidence of drought, and how much to world price shocks. An open, three-sector neo-Ricardian model organizes our thinking and new relative price database implements the empirical analysis. We find local supply side forces were important from as early as 1700.

When communication among workers increases productivity, there are economic incentives to learn a second language.  I study how the growth of industrial employment increased bilingualism in India between 1931 and 1961. Indian factories were linguistically mixed.  I exploit industrial clustering and sectoral demand growth for identification.  The effect on bilingualism was strongest in import-competing districts and among local linguistic minorities.  Industrialization also increased literacy.  Bilingualism was mainly the result of learning, rather than than migration or assimilation.  It was not a byproduct of becoming literate.
