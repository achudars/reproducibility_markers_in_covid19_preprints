We offer an alternative, relational perspective highlighting the critical role of authenticity in shaping an SMO’s perceived value. Unlike frames and intentional displays, calculated efforts to proclaim authenticity often backfire. We distill two orthogonal types: grassroots (in)authenticity, based on idealized notions of civil society, and institutional (in)authenticity, rooted in cultural-cognitive schemas used to judge fit with established SMO categories. Grassroots authenticity benefits an SMO’s fundamental legitimacy, while lacking it entirely (i.e. “astroturfing”) severely harms public support. Institutional authenticity increases resources and survival chances, intelligibility to elite observers, and clarity of collective identities; still, lacking this (via hybridity) may assist in recruitment and outreach. We build propositions that elaborate these expectations and argue that authenticity should become a more central concept in social movement research.",TRUE,FALSE,Astroturfing|Authenticity|Categories|Fields|Grassroots|Hybridity|Institutional theory|Organizations|Social Movement Organizations|Social Movements,2018-12-06T04:22:47.279586,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-06T04:22:25.367758,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/citation/,wmz7k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d4ec5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/relationships/node/,d4ec5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0803f022ebef001991f8ef/,5c0803f022ebef001991f8ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wmz7k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wmz7k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wmz7k,NA

RNA interference (RNAi), for example, utilises a mechanism that evolved in eukaryotes to destroy foreign nucleic acid. Other examples include restriction enzymes, the polymerase chain reaction, fluorescent proteins and CRISPR-Cas9. I propose that natural molecular mechanisms are exploited by biologists for their effectors’ (protein or nucleic acid) activity and biological specificity (protein or nucleic acid can cause precise reactions). I also show that the developmental trajectory of novel techniques in molecular biology, such as RNAi, is four characteristic phases. The first phase is discovery of a biological phenomenon. The second is identification of the mechanism’s trigger(s), the effector and biological specificity. The third is the application of the technique. The final phase is the maturation and refinement of the molecular biology technique.

Investigating the effect of group faultlines on turnover and organizational performance,"There is strong empirical evidence that workforce diversity is beneficial for organizations.

This is the case when the sub-groups differ not just with regard to one characteristic but with regard to several characteristics simultaneously. This paper is the first to examine the negative consequences of faultlines with large-scale data on organizations in the public and private sector. Fixed-effects regressions are used to investigate the impact of functional (working time, tenure, qualification) and demographic (age, gender, nationality) faultlines on turnover and organizational performance. We also consider the interaction between firm size and faultlines. Regarding turnover, we do not find the expected negative effects of demographic and only limited evidence for functional faultlines.

The Persistence and Convergence of Premigration Socioeconomic Status During the Age of Mass Migration,"A long-standing debate is concerned over how long premigration socioeconomic differences persisted for immigrants and their descendants who entered at the turn-of-the-twentieth century. Some researchers argue that differences exist today, over 100 years after first arrival, while others argue that most differences disappeared after the third generation. However, none of this research has directly measured pre-migration socioeconomic status nor has it directly linked immigrants to their children. I create a new panel dataset that follows immigrants and their children from the sending country through settlement. Specifically, I link ship manifest records to census records to track how long premigration socioeconomic differences persist across generations. Passenger records provide a wealth of information of individuals including the occupation before arrival. I analyze how long premigration differences persist within and between groups. Whereas premigration socioeconomic status is associated with the first generation’s economic outcomes after settlement, many of these differences disappear by the second generation. These results suggest that background is not destiny for immigrant descendants. As scholars and politicians debate about whether countries should admit primarily high-skilled or low-skilled immigrants, the results from this article tell us whether such selection policies are necessary to ensure strong migrants’ performance in a period of open borders.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-04T14:06:41.243453,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-04T14:06:18.200980,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Peter Catron,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/citation/,gcx3a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/962xw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/relationships/node/,962xw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c05d9c165e965001addb50b/,5c05d9c165e965001addb50b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gcx3a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gcx3a,NA

I address this theoretical issue through an analysis in contemporary Malawi.

These claims have greatly influenced debates regarding social policy, work, family, and gender inequality. Motivated by limitations of prior research, we analyze the relationship between the two most prominent work-family reconciliation policies (paid parental leave and public childcare coverage) and seven labor market outcomes (employment, full-time employment, earnings, full-time earnings, being a manager, being a lucrative manager, and occupation percent female). We estimate multi-level models of individuals nested in a cross-section of 21 rich democracies near 2005, and two-way fixed effects models of individuals nested in a panel of 12 rich democracies over time. The vast majority of coefficients for work-family policies fail to reject the null hypothesis of no effects. The pattern of insignificance occurs regardless of which set of models or coefficients one compares. Moreover, there is as much evidence that significantly contradicts the “tradeoff hypothesis” as is consistent with the hypothesis. Altogether, the analyses undermine claims that work-family reconciliation policies trigger tradeoffs and paradoxes in terms of gender equality with adverse labor market consequences for women.",TRUE,FALSE,family|inequality|labor markets|social policy|welfare state|work,2018-12-03T19:14:25.652944,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-03T19:13:54.664019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy",Brady|Blome &amp; Kmec,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/citation/,sbyz9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hgjny/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/relationships/node/,hgjny,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c05728225c61300175c0cf4/,5c05728225c61300175c0cf4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sbyz9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sbyz9,NA

An analysis accounting for reverse causality,"The unemployed are often in poorer health than their employed counterparts. This cross-sectional correlation is often attributed to a causal effect of unemployment on health. Resent research analyzing longitudinal data, however, often supports alternative explanations, such as spurious correlation and/or selection of unhealthy workers into unemployment (i.e., reverse causality). In this paper, we apply a dynamic panel data estimator (system GMM) to account for both unobserved confounders and reverse causality. Despite some evidence for health selection, we still find strong support for the causality thesis. Furthermore, we show that the adverse health effect is partially explained by the loss of self-perceived social status due to unemployment but not by the loss of household income or social contacts.",TRUE,FALSE,|Dynamic panel estimator|Health|Income|Reverse causality|Social capital|Social status|Unemployment,2018-12-03T14:55:01.072024,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-03T14:54:53.898946,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/citation/,n6hdb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u6r7c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/relationships/node/,u6r7c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c04de602ee3370016af64f3/,5c04de602ee3370016af64f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hdb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n6hdb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n6hdb,NA
