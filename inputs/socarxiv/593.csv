In the context of the US South, this paper examines the legacy of cotton on economic development focusing on a novel channel of structural change. Exploiting variation in cotton production along with agro-climatic conditions, I show that the legacy of cotton has impeded local economic development exclusively as of the mid-twentieth century. The structural break is found to be a consequence of cotton mechanization. Evidence from exogenous variation in the boll weevil infestation shows that cotton farming was strongly dependent on tenant farmers with little human capital. Following cotton mechanization, cotton tenants were largely displaced and absorbed by the manufacturing sector. I then find that the inflow of cotton tenants has reduced labor productivity in the manufacturing sector. Beyond the composition effect, the negative impact on manufacturing productivity has persisted in the long-run through demand-side. Employing an index of state-level policy environment, I exploit within-state variation to show that the legacy of cotton has induced unskill-biased technical change in manufacturing.",TRUE,FALSE,Cotton|Human Capital|Labor Push|Mechanization|Productivity|Structural Change,2018-07-02T11:51:28.090120,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-11T20:23:34.851977,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/citation/,trjfz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af5f50a7bf0b90011e3e0e5/,5af5f50a7bf0b90011e3e0e5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trjfz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/trjfz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/trjfz,NA

Exploring the Impact of Poverty Reduction Strategies on Poverty Rates among the Canadian Provinces,"Poverty reduction strategies (PRS) have become a popular instrument for addressing poverty globally. In Canada, all ten provinces have committed to adopting PRS. The province’s commonalities and differences provide an ideal testing ground for studying their effects. Do PRS actually reduce poverty? According to their detractors, governments use PRS as ‘window dressing’ to gloss over unsuccessful poverty reduction efforts. In this study, I identify the timing of the introduction of PRS action plans and explore whether they have coincided with changes in provincial poverty rates. I find that more often than not rates have dropped before rather than after the introduction of PRS.

In: The Scandinavian Invasion: The Nordic Noir Phenomenon and Beyond. eds. Richard McCulloch; William Proctor. Peter Lang, (forthcoming).  -------------------------------------------------------  
Nordic Noir has, since the early-2000s, evolved into a globally-popular genre that now easily transcends media-specific boundaries. Television has always been at the forefront of that development: Scandinavian TV productions either turned literary successes such as the Henning Mankell novel universe of Wallander into distinct and easily-recognizable television scripts, or developed independent shows such as Forbrydelsen (DR, 2007-12), which, with foreign adaptations such as The Killing (US) (AMC/Netflix, 2011-14) – themselves grew into international format successes. 
The most recent wave of Nordic Noirs – including blockbuster shows like Bron/Broen [The Bridge] (DK/SWE, 2011-), Dicte (DK, 2012-), Blå ögon [Blue Eyes] (SWE, 2014), Arvingerne [The Legacy] (DK, 2014-), Frikjent [Acquitted] (NOR, 2015-), Herrens veje [Rides upon the Storm] (DK, in development) or Kongen af Danmark [The King] (DK, in development, 2017-) – continues to employ a particular Nordic Noir template. But while doing so, many of these shows also simultaneously transform Nordic Noir through processes of remaking and adaptation that become evident in examples such as Gomorrah (ITA, 2014-) and Les Témoins [Witnesses] (FR, 2015-), within correspondingly-changing generic, narrative, and locational contexts such as ‘Italian’ or ‘French Noir’. This most recent wave thus both affirms and dissolves the specificity of Nordic Noir as a genre.
This chapter is particularly interested in the status that Nordic Noir as a genre has as a source for formatting within television, and the specific (re)negotiations that take place when Nordic Noir is transferred to different cultural settings. Following a brief introductory framing of Nordic Noir and its role in larger processes of the global format trade, I will use the analytic perspective of Performance Studies which, as I argue, allows for a more nuanced view on the workings behind the circulation of Nordic Noir formats in the global television business. In particular, I will employ Navarro’s understanding of format adaptation as processual ‘space between cultures’ (2012), and try to identify the onsets of this liminal space in the specific setting of the pilot. It is exactly here, I argue, where adaptation processes first become visible – processes that take a known template and rework it via narrative modulation into transcultural TV remakes.
Subsequently, I will illustrate this perspective via the example of Bron/Broen, one of the recent Nordic Noir television series that has itself become a format – travelling on a global scale and thus renegotiating the meaning of Nordic Noir in a variety of cultural settings. This will be done via a comparative analysis of Bron/Broen’s pilot and two of its international iterations – The Bridge (US), and The Tunnel (FR/UK).",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|Bron/Broen|genre|glocalisation|nordic noir|scandinavian television|space between cultures|television|television format|The Bridge|The Tunnel|transcultural remake|transformation,2018-07-02T11:51:25.928900,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-11T00:08:06.954471,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c90|Arts and Humanities|Television|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d24|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Visual Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d26|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Other Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/citation/,9dbw2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ug9x7/,ug9x7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af47f5cd6e6eb0010231085/,5af47f5cd6e6eb0010231085,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dbw2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9dbw2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9dbw2,NA

Technology law scholars have recently started to consider the theories of affordance and technological mediation, imported from the fields of psychology, HCI, and STS. These theories have been used both as a means of explaining how the law has developed, and more recently in attempts to cast the law per se as an affordance. This exploratory paper summarises the two theories, before considering these applications from a critical perspective, noting certain deficiencies with respect to potential normative application and definitional clarity, respectively. It then posits that in applying them in the legal context, we should seek to retain the relational user-artefact structure around which they were originally conceived, with the law cast as the user of the artefact, from which it seeks certain features or outcomes. This approach is effective for three reasons. Firstly, it acknowledges the power imbalance between law and architecture, where the former is manifestly subject to the decisions made by designers which mediate and transform the substance of the legal norms they instantiate in technological artefacts. Secondly, from an analytical perspective, it can help avoid some of the conceptual and definitional problems evident in the nascent legal literature on affordance. Lastly, approaching designers on their own terms can foster better critical evaluation of their activities during the design process, potentially leading to more effective ‘compliance by design’ where the course of the law’s mediation by technological artefacts can be better anticipated and guided by legislators, regulators, and legal practitioners.",TRUE,FALSE,affordance|compliance by design|legal design|legal theory|postphenomenology|technological mediation,2018-07-02T11:51:25.504637,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-10T15:12:55.045627,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0f|Law|Public Law and Legal Theory|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c31|Law|Rule of Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c62|Law|Jurisprudence|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d37|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|Industrial and Product Design|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dba|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Legal Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/citation/,xntyr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5enas/,5enas,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af44409d6e6eb0011225c49/,5af44409d6e6eb0011225c49,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xntyr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xntyr,https://doi.org/10.2966/scrip.150118.4

In so doing, this article advances the “charismatic counter-role” as an umbrella term that captures the performative bearing of a variety of actors on processes of charismatic interaction. Speciﬁcally, in addition to devoted followers (already much discussed in the literature), this typology contains unworthy challengers (competitors who fall short when judged by the new terms of legitimacy that the charismatic leader creatively establishes); and colossal players (interlocutors that are appropriately “to scale” for highlighting the extraordinary missions to which the charismatic leader aspires). Together, these charismatic counter-roles interact in ways that comprise a charismatic social system that gives a better account than has heretofore been available for the unstoppable momentum of charismatic challenges. Using the “Trump phenomenon” of 2015–2016 as its empirical source, and employing analytical tools from symbolic interactionist and performative approaches to social theory, this article has implications for future studies of how charisma destabilizes traditional and/or rational-legal social orders.",TRUE,FALSE,American politics|charisma|charismatic authority|Donald Trump|Elections|Max Weber|Politics|Sociological theory|Sociology,2018-07-02T11:51:12.701958,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-10T15:12:34.604517,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c9a|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c9f|Arts and Humanities|American Studies|Other American Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76ca0|5a8c80f3c698300375c76ca3|Arts and Humanities|Theatre and Performance Studies|Performance Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cc6|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cc8|Arts and Humanities|Rhetoric and Composition|Rhetoric|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Author,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/citation/,awbx5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9uh3z/,9uh3z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af3d5f7a5bbbc0011c54f31/,5af3d5f7a5bbbc0011c54f31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awbx5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/awbx5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/awbx5,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soy036

However, these same platforms enable institutional and organized actors to engineer fabricated social movements to advance their agenda. These “astroturfing” or “false amplification” phenomenons leverage a variety of of tools and techniques, ranging from fully automated bot activity to accounts manned by extrinsically motivated (e.g. compensated) human operators. These campaigns also range from simple spam operations to sophisticated efforts involving numerous orchestrated accounts, sometimes coordinated across linguistic and cultural clusters. While the former category is straightforward to analyze via data mining methods, sophisticated fabricated campaigns in the latter category are engineered to mask their true nature from the public.

Working from the proposition that a large number of accounts controlled by a small number of coordinated entities will lack the behavioral diversity of a similar number of accounts controlled by uncoordinated individual actors, we propose a framework of signals (metrics) along three dimensions: 

Network: how accounts are connected to one another, and the clusters they form within the online conversation,   
Temporal: patterns of messaging across time in the online conversation, 
Semantic: an observation of the diversity of topics and meaning throughout the online conversation.

We test this framework on three case studies: the online conversation on #ColumbianChemicals in the U.S., the international discussion of the #DopingLeaks event, and an analysis of political discussions in Venezuela. In all three cases, we find what we assess to be anomalous, fabricated behavior on at least one dimension.",TRUE,FALSE,media manipulation|propaganda|social media|social movements,2018-07-02T11:51:12.230425,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-09T19:41:19.700505,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,Camille Francois|Vladimir Barash|John Kelly,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/citation/,ba8t6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/aj9yz/,aj9yz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af342d0d6e6eb001121d1b5/,5af342d0d6e6eb001121d1b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ba8t6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ba8t6,NA

Caste is conceptualized as a system of ethnic categories that map onto positions within the social structure of each village. Despite being a salient category across India, the caste structure is not uniform across villages, caste groups or network contexts. Using social network and demographic data collected by Banerjee et al. (2013) I investigate how caste homophily varies within villages across social contexts and between villages. Overall I find strong evidence of caste homophily across the majority of contexts; people tend to exchange resources and socialize with other people occupying a similar position in the caste order. However this varies across villages, relations, and groups. It appears to be strongest among higher caste groups, although it weakens with regards to the lending and borrowing of money, a vertical relationship between high and low castes. The lending of rice and kerosene and social relationships involving advice giving and important decisions are also particularly homophilous for both groups. This demonstrates how the strength of ethnic boundaries can vary based on the relational and spatial context.",TRUE,FALSE,caste|ethnicity|homophily|india|microcredit|social networks|social structure|village,2018-07-02T11:51:12.054660,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-09T19:27:35.791059,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/citation/,j367u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m8qfx/,m8qfx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af33307a5bbbc0012c4e19c/,5af33307a5bbbc0012c4e19c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j367u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j367u,NA

It helps in solving problems of the entire nation with reference to the needs of the citizens. It is crucial to understand political participation of the aged citizens in the sociological context, within the more political sociological framework, and look at the internal operation of a political system to determine the extent to which participation of older adults occurs. Aims: The study proposes a research protocol in order to understand the participation of elderly Iranian Kurdish in the political process. The study will make an attempt to understand the fundamental political rights, healthy aging, ageism, independent associations and role of political parties, student struggle, freedom of expression, whether free elections exists. These will reflect participation of Kurdish older people in political activities in the entire cities of Kurdish inhabited region of Iran. Methods: According to the census conducted in 2017, the population of Kurdistan of Iran was 7500 million dwellers and the aged people were estimated to be 1125 million citizens which are 15% of population. The Study will focus at the aged in the age group between 60 years of age and above, staying in the region. Data will be collected from 525 samples which chosen randomly and data analysis will be done according to analysis of variance (ANOVA), GLM, multiple regression, and path analysis using SPSS® v. 25 and LISREL® v. 8.8.
