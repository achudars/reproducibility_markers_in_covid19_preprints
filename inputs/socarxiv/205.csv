We used data on female and male adolescents aged 15-19 from the 2006-2010 (N=4,662), 2011-2015 (N=4,134), and 2015-2017 (N=1,810) National Survey of Family Growth. Logistic regression was used to identify differences between periods by gender, and for some measures by age, in sexual behaviors (penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI), oral or anal sex with an opposite-sex partner, sexual experience with a same-sex partner), contraceptive use and condom consistency. We estimated probabilities of age at first PVI with Kaplan-Meier failure analysis and tested for changes over time and differences by gender. 

Over half of all adolescents have engaged in at least one of the sexual behaviors measured. Between 2011-2015 and 2015-2017, males age 15-17 reported significant declines in all but same-sex partners, while the prevalence of sexual behaviors among older males and adolescent females overall remained generally stable. In each period, females were more likely than males to report a same-sex partner. Age of first PVI increased, but by age 17 the difference between time periods is minimal.  Adolescent females report increases in the use at last sex of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (3% to 18%) and multiple methods (27% to 41%).  The condom use measures did not change over time.  
These findings identify components of both stability and change in adolescent sexual and contraceptive behavior in the last decade.

This article analyses the historical and structural reasons behind the relative success of Germany and the problems experienced in Britain and the US during the first wave of the pandemic. It also asks why recent international surveys overestimated Anglo-American preparedness. The article argues that the answer lies in the different evolution of public health systems as well as varying public health capacities at the local level. In Germany, post-1994 reforms of the decentralised public health system managed to overcome decades of political neglect and underinvestment and strengthen federal integration without compromising public health capacity at the state and communal level. This joint strengthening of the centre and hinterland allowed the Robert Koch Institute to function as an effective coordinating hub for locally tailored COVID-19 responses. By contrast, the decades after 1970 saw world-renowned Anglo-American public health systems face increasing challenges posed by funding cuts, privatisation, overambitious reforms, and increasing loss of political autonomy. Both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Public Health England retained significant prestige, which resulted in an overestimation of capacity by international reviews.

Social networks, however, reach far beyond this small number of social ties. We know little about individual variation in the size of such extended social networks. In this study, we move beyond core networks and explain individual variation in the extended social network size among youth. We use survey data of Dutch adolescents (N = 5,921) and use two state-of-the-art measurements to compute extended network sizes: the network scale-up methods through Bayesian modelling and the observed number of contacts on Facebook. Among both measurements, we find that extended networks are larger among ethnic majority members, girls, and those who often engage in social foci. This highlights a crucial role for preferences and opportunity in the genesis of extended networks. Additionally, we find that differences between both network sizes (scale-up and Facebook) are smaller for girls and higher educated.

Yet there is scant quantitative evidence on the prevalence and geographic distribution of ISPs in the United States. To fill this gap, we construct a comprehensive, nationwide database of 2,138 geocoded ISP offices that offer low- or no-cost legal services to low-income immigrants. We use spatial optimization methods to analyze the geographic network of ISPs and measure ISPs’ proximity to the low-income immigrant population. Because both ISPs and immigrants are highly concentrated in major urban areas, most low-income immigrants live close to an ISP. However, we also find a sizable fraction of low-income immigrants in underserved areas, which are primarily in midsize cities in the South. This reflects both a general skew in non-governmental organization service provision and the more recent arrival of immigrants in these largely Southern destinations. Finally, our opti- mization analysis suggests significant gains from placing new ISPs in underserved areas to maximize the number of low-income immigrants who live near an ISP.

NRDC has stood for more than 35 years as the central case on judicial review of administrative agencies’ interpretations of statutes. Its contours have long been debated, but more recently it has come under increasing scrutiny, with some—including two sitting Supreme Court justices—calling for the case to be overturned. Others praise Chevron, calling deference necessary or even inevitable. All seem to agree the doctrine is powerful and important. 
This standard account is wrong, however. Chevron is not the influential doctrine it once was and has not been for a long time. It has been eroded from the outside as a series of exclusions have narrowed its scope, and has been hollowed out from the inside as Justices have become ever more willing to find clear meaning in statutes, thereby denying deference to agencies. In recent years, agencies have won only a handful of statutory interpretation cases, and none in more than four years. Only once since 2015 has deference been outcome-determinative. At the Supreme Court level (though not, for now, in the circuit courts), deference is dead. The once-crystal Chevron has turned to mud. As a result, however, it is less likely to be formally overturned than widely believed—critics of deference and of administrative power on the Court would gain little. Instead, Chevron’s future is likely to be one of further decline, at least in the short term.

There is little research comparing how these two types of laws affect drug consumption of the general US population.

In contrast, medical laws increase adult use by only 5% and have a negligible effect on adolescent use. We also find that recreational marijuana dispensaries are an important driver of the increase in marijuana use for adults 26 and over. Taken together, our results suggest that medical laws are not de facto recreational laws in that they succeed in mitigating recreational use, that recreational laws have broad effects on overall levels of marijuana use, and that underage marijuana use may be an important problem with existing implementations of recreational marijuana laws.",TRUE,FALSE,adolescent drug use|marijuana legalization|medical marijuana|recreational marijuana|substance abuse,2020-08-19T10:16:10.619965,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-19T10:15:46.289144,TRUE,"The authors report no relevant conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, surrounding this work",no,all data and programs used for this paper will be made available once it is accepted for publication,,no,This is not a preregistration.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/citation/,drx9f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3c0e5a3bf25201dca1efff/,5f3c0e5a3bf25201dca1efff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/drx9f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/drx9f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/drx9f,NA

Taking an affective-materialist approach and applying concepts from play theory, it describes the visual erotic culture that emerges in the 100 simultaneous videos of drug-using people, mostly men. It details the scene’s modulation of temporality, how drug use is performed in relationship to numerous screens and the way ceremonializa- tion counters the platformed deintensification. Finally, it discusses how digital chemsex encounters might overflow categories of gender and sexuality, and how the article may enrich the study of drugged sexual play.",TRUE,FALSE,ceremony|chemsex|play|video conferencing|zoom,2020-08-19T10:53:35.115230,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-19T10:52:49.502556,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/citation/,fn4rd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3bdea33bf25201c5a1e1a9/,5f3bdea33bf25201c5a1e1a9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn4rd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fn4rd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fn4rd,https://doi.org/10.1177/1363460720964100

To illustrate our proposed approach, we analyse police recorded free-text narrative descriptions of residential burglaries occurring over a two-year period in a major metropolitan area of the UK. Results of our analyses demonstrate that topic modelling algorithms are capable of clustering substantively different burglary problems without prior knowledge of such groupings. Subsequently, we describe a prototype dashboard that allows replication of our analytical workflow and could be applied to support operational decision making in the identification of specific crime problems. This approach to grouping distinct types of offences within existing offence categories, we argue, has the potential to support crime analysts in proactively analysing large volumes of modus operandi free-text data – with the ultimate aims of developing a greater understanding of crime problems and supporting the design of tailored crime reduction interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,Burglary|Crime|Machine Learning|Policing|Text Mining|Unstructured Data,2020-08-19T10:53:57.175762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-19T10:53:20.318929,FALSE,NA,no,Source code for the project can be found at https://github.com/QuantCrim-Leeds/Police-Free-Text-LDA-Dashboard,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Daniel Birks|Alex Coleman|David Jackson,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/citation/,8w73n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3bd0fdd42ad401a2cdee8a/,5f3bd0fdd42ad401a2cdee8a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w73n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8w73n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8w73n,NA
