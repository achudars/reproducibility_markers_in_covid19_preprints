This study leverages this exogenous event to test key theoretical explanations of couples’ divisions of domestic labor. Using novel data from 1,025 partnered, different-sex US parents, our analysis shows an overall increase in domestic responsibilities for mothers, who were already doing most of the household labor, as well as an increase in fathers’ contributions. Driven by increases in fathers’ time spent on housework and childcare, we find that both mothers and fathers report a general shift toward more egalitarian divisions of household labor.

We aimed to explore how different stakeholder groups across academic disciplines perceive peer review and what they expect from it. 
Methods: We conducted qualitative focus group workshops with early-, mid- and senior career scholars, reviewers, editors and publishers. We recruited participants following a purposive maximum variation sampling approach and used a semi-structured topic guide to moderate discussions. To identify purposes of peer review, we conducted a thematic analysis. 
Results: Stakeholders expected peer review (i) to assess the contributions of a manuscript, (ii) to conduct quality control, (iii) to improve manuscripts, (iv) to assess the suitability of manuscripts for a journals and its readership, (v) to provide a decision-making tool for editors, (vi) to provide feedback by peers, (vii) to curate a community and (viii) to provide a seal of accreditation for published articles. Stakeholder groups with different roles and tasks in the peer review process differed in their understanding of and the value they attached to different functions of peer review. Some stakeholder expectations are contradictory, revealing a tension between formative functions and summative functions of peer review.

Using text networks as an index, we then analyze a rich collection of antebellum slave narratives (n=128) to investigate such response possibilities. These thematic networks, consistent with a large body of historical research on American slavery, demonstrate central domains of enslavement in the United States and the diverse resistance strategies that the enslaved employed. Moreover, our more qualitative immersion into these thematic patterns and the narratives themselves—narratives that have been largely overlooked by sociologists—uniquely highlight how particular resistance strategies are deployed  in specific everyday contexts and sometimes resolve into what seem, at first glance, to be quiescence.

This method divides the sample into scheme classes by listing respondents based on the linear dependence degree between answers given to a questionnaire, rather than on agreement between respondents. The aim of this tutorial article is to use a scale of organizational values adapted to the Brazilian context in order to map cultural schemes based on a survey conducted with 207 workers from different companies.

Researchers in different fields have been working on finding explanations for the unequal impact of the virus, and deaths from the associated disease (COVID-19), in different geographical areas. Demographers and other social scientists, have hinted at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships. The goal of this article is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19 cases in a critical way. We show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support such a link. In fact, at the country-level higher prevalence of intergenerational co-residence and contacts is broadly positively associated with number of COVID-19 cases (per 100,000 persons), but the opposite is generally true at the sub-national level. While this inconsistent evidence neither demonstrates the existence nor the inexistence of a causal link between intergenerational relationships and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases, we warn against simplistic interpretations of the available data which suffer from many shortcomings. Only retrospective individual level data will provide robust evidence on the role of intergenerational ties. We conclude arguing that intergenerational relationships are not only about physical contacts between family members. From a theoretical point of view, different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects of opposite sign on the diffusion of COVID-19. Policies devoted at fighting the spread of COVID-19 should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and “phase-2” restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health.",TRUE,FALSE,contacts|coresidence|coronavirus|covid|COVID_19|grandchild care|Intergenerational relationships|intergenerational ties|SARS-CoV-2,2020-05-06T18:33:17.086609,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-06T18:32:27.714495,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/citation/,y8hpr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb298b5a2199500305d184e/,5eb298b5a2199500305d184e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y8hpr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y8hpr,NA

In this paper, we argue that those conducting social research in the energy domain should give special consideration to the internal and external validity of their work conducted during this pandemic period. We set out a number of principles that researchers can consider to give themselves and research users greater confidence that findings and recommendations will still be applicable in years to come. Largely grounded in existing good practice guidance, our recommendations include collecting and reporting additional supporting contextual data, reviewing aspects of research design for vulnerability to validity challenges, and building in longitudinal elements where feasible. We suggest that these approaches also bring a number of opportunities to generate new insights.

The uptake of facemasks, however, remains far from universal in countries where this practice lacks cultural roots. In this paper, we aim to identify the barriers to mask-wearing in Spain, a country with no mask-wearing culture. We conduct one of the first nationally representative surveys (n = 4,000) about this unprecedented public health emergency and identify the profile of citizens who are more resistant to face-masking: young, educated, unconcerned with being infected, and with an introverted personality. Our results further indicate a positive correlation between a social norm of mask-wearing and mask uptake and demonstrate that uptake of facemasks is especially high among the elderly living in localities where mask-wearing behavior is popular. These results are robust when controlling for respondents' demographics, time spent at home, and occupation fixed effects. Our findings can be useful for policymakers to devise effective programs for improving public compliance.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Health behavior|Health communication|Personality|social distancing,2020-05-06T18:25:00.712441,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-06T18:24:32.870983,FALSE,NA,available,TBD upon publication.,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DBJS9M,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/citation/,6m85q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bwyun/,bwyun,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb263ec877c5e002a3a1b8d/,5eb263ec877c5e002a3a1b8d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m85q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6m85q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6m85q,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242764

After the Gödel incompleteness theorems (1931) or the insolvability of the so-called halting problem (Turing 1936; Church 1936) as to a classical machine of Turing, one of the simplest hypotheses is completeness to be suggested for two ones. That is consistent with the provability of completeness by means of two independent Peano arithmetics discussed in Section I.
Many modifications of Turing machines cum quantum ones are researched in Section II for the Halting problem and completeness, and the model of two independent Turing machines seems to generalize them.
Then, that pair can be postulated as the formal definition of reality therefore being complete unlike any of them standalone, remaining incomplete without its complementary counterpart. Representation is formal defined as a one-to-one mapping between the two Turing machines, and the set of all those mappings can be considered as “language” therefore including metaphors as mappings different than representation. Section III investigates that formal relation of “reality”, “representation”, and “language” modeled by (at least two) Turing machines.
The independence of (two) Turing machines is interpreted by means of game theory and especially of the Nash equilibrium in Section IV.
Choice and information as the quantity of choices are involved. That approach seems to be equivalent to that based on set theory and the concept of actual infinity in mathematics and allowing of practical implementations.",TRUE,FALSE,bit and qubit|classical and quantum information|Peano arithmetic|quantum computer|set theory|Turing machine,2020-05-06T18:23:46.805819,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-06T18:23:19.739458,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfa|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Logic and Foundations of Mathematics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/citation/,v7ha9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb25d7c877c5e002b3a14f9/,5eb25d7c877c5e002b3a14f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7ha9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v7ha9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v7ha9,NA
