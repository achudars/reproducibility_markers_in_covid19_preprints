The Chinese Communist Party has also classified this area as a key direction of the future development, hoping that in this new wave of military affairs innovation, under the absolute superiority of economic and military affairs, China could surpass the United States in one fell swoop, changing the world situation in which the United States is the only military superpower since the end of the Cold War. In the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, President Xi Jinping clearly stated that it should accelerate the development of military intelligence and strengthen the joint combat capability of the network information system, including the R&amp;D of the innovative weapons and equipment. As Xi Jinping took over the presidency of China in 2013, he initiated the ""dream of strong army"". In the future, artificial intelligence is bound to be an important part of the CCP's military modernization, and it is also a foresighted preparation for winning the next war. At present, most of the CCP’s research on military development in terms of artificial intelligence tends to be on hardware devices, such as automated combat vehicles, autonomous drones and remote-controlled submarines. These related technologies rely heavily on the mechanical engineering and traditional R&amp;D. The CCP intends to combine the development of military science and technology with the advanced weapons as a means of ""killer"" conception for future regional wars against the United States and other major powers. In this concept, the Communist Army will carry out paralytic asymmetrical attacks to its potential enemies. In the past, the ""killer"" weapons may be the attack missiles that attack large ships, but now they may include a new generation of artificial intelligence weapons that use the big data, the Internet of Things, or the cloud computing. In the face of the development of the CCP’s artificial intelligence militarization, not only we must concern about its current major developments, but also have to analyze the motives behind it, so that we can make correct judgments in the future operations to block the CCP’s media campaign and arms deterrent.

In ever faster-paced societies and, recently, in times of pandemic lockdowns, such online survey infrastructures are invaluable to social research. In absence of email sampling frames, one way of recruiting such a panel is via postal mail. However, few studies have examined how to best approach and then transition sample members from the initial postal mail contact to the online panel registration. To fill this gap, we implemented a large-scale experiment in the recruitment of the 2018 sample of the German Internet Panel (GIP) varying panel recruitment designs in four experimental conditions: online-only, concurrent mode, push-to-web, and paper-first. Our results show that the online-only design delivers higher online panel registration rates than the other recruitment designs.

It contrasts critical psychology with mainstream psychology in general terms, before introducing a critical psychological perspective on climate change. Central to this perspective is a critique of the framing of individual behaviour change as the problem and solution to climate change in mainstream psychology, and a related emphasis on identifying ‘barriers’ to pro-environmental behaviour. This framework is argued to be reductive, obscuring or downplaying the influence of a range of factors in shaping predominant responses to climate change to date, including social context, discourse, power and affect. Currently, critical psychologies set out to study the relative contribution of these factors to (in)action on climate change. A related concern is how the psychological and emotional impacts of climate change impact unevenly on communities and individuals, depending on place-based, economic, geographic and cultural differences, and giving rises to experiences of injustice, inequality and disempowerment. Critical psychology does not assume these to be overriding or inevitable psychological and social responses, however. Critical psychologies also undertake research and inform interventions that highlight the role of collective understanding, activism, empowerment and resistance as the necessary foundations of a genuine shift towards sustainable societies.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|climate crisis|community psychology|critical psychology|eco-anxiety|emotion|environmental justice|liberation psychology|psychology|resistance,2021-02-10T18:24:23.298069,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:23:45.658510,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,Elsevier,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/citation/,sbvpd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6023e87f73c9fe00f9076a36/,6023e87f73c9fe00f9076a36,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbvpd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sbvpd/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2021.01.007,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sbvpd

There is a widely held view that governmental bureaucracy with its laws, regulations, institutions, and `red tape' is unable to keep up with a rapidly changing and digitizing society. It is now often claimed that the solution is for governments to become agile. Along these lines, the resulting discourse on `agile government' posits that government is not agile now, but it could be, and if it were agile then government would be more e?ective, adaptive, and, thus, normatively better.

While declines in affordability from 1990-2016 were universal between rural and urban counties, population growth is associated with decreases in affordability in rural counties but increased affordability in large metros counties due to estimated decreases in housing costs. Population aging is estimated to improve affordability in large and small metro counties, despite the associated decrease in income and housing costs across all county types.

We forecast the impact of a gain-sharing cost-reflective tariff on waste management sustainability. The cost-reflective tariff generates an economic surplus for society, while meeting environmental goals. Based on empirical data we developed two scenarios. The baseline scenario formalizes the current Italian tariff scheme, while the intervention scenario includes users' response to a gainsharing policy. By optimizing the tariff structure, society would benefit from a surplus that could be reached setting an asymmetric regulation based on current waste management efficiency level.

Mobility measures were found to be strongly associated with regional socio-economic indicators during the first wave of the pandemic. Here, we use network mobility data from an ~3.5 million person sample of individuals in Ontario, Canada to study the association between three different individual-mobility measures and four socio-economic indicators throughout the first and second wave of Covid-19 (January to December 2020). We demonstrate that understanding how mobility behaviours have changed in response to Covid-19 varies considerably depending on how mobility is measured. We find a strong positive association between different mobility levels and the economic deprivation index, which demonstrates that inequities in the changes to mobility across economic gradients observed during the initial lockdown have persisted into the later stages of the pandemic. However, the associations between mobility and other socio-economic indicators vary over time. We capture a strong day-of-week pattern of association between socio-economic indicators and mobility levels. Our findings have important implications for understanding if and how mobility data should be used to study the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the socio-economic conditions across geographical space, and over time.

We focus on the allocation aspect of this choice in an iterated game played on bipartite networks of agents and common-pool resources (CPRs) that degrade linearly in quality as extraction increases. When CPR users attempt to reallocate their extraction efforts among resources to maximize
their own payoffs in the very next round (that is, myopically), collective wealth is increased. Using a heterogeneous mean-field approach, we estimate how these reallocations affect the payoffs of CPR users of different degrees within networks having different levels of degree heterogeneity. Focusing specifically on Nash equilibrium initial conditions, which represent the patterns of over-exploitation that result from rational extraction, we find that networks with greater heterogeneity among CPR
degrees show greater improvements over equilibrium due to reallocation. When the marginal utility of extraction diminishes, these reallocations also reduce wealth inequality. These findings emphasize that CPR users’ adaptive reallocations of effort—a behavior that previously-studied network evolutionary game models typically disallow by construction—can serve to direct individuals’ self interest toward the collective good.",TRUE,FALSE,common-pool resources|evolutionary games|networks|resource allocation,2021-02-10T18:33:21.975008,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:32:20.413354,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,Andrew Schauf and Poong Oh,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/citation/,w2cxp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2sbz8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/relationships/node/,2sbz8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6022b3f4232383007b9d7503/,6022b3f4232383007b9d7503,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2cxp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w2cxp/,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79514-5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w2cxp

U.S. households and trace the importance of household wealth in helping families experiencing these events avoid entering a spell of material hardship. Using longitudinal data from two panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we draw on direct measures of material hardship, disruptive events, and household assets. Regression and decomposition analyses reveal that the relationship between disruptive events and the likelihood of experiencing a new spell of material hardship strongly varies across the wealth distribution, suggesting that high household wealth provides an effective private safety net. By distinguishing different types of disruptive events, we also demonstrate that divorce, disability, and income instability entail the risk of falling into material hardship but also that this risk is effectively buffered by substantial wealth. Different types of hardship – namely, financial, food, and medical hardship – respond in similar ways.
Like public insurance schemes, wealth insurance helps buffer the effects of disruptive events on material hardship, but unlike public insurance schemes, reliance on private wealth further stratifies the economic well-being of households. Policy options for addressing this highly stratified private insurance scheme includes disposing of the need for it by funding a more robust public insurance, for instance through wealth taxation.",TRUE,FALSE,hardship|inequality|wealth,2021-02-10T18:19:03.765871,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:18:39.080201,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp.html,no,"Please direct correspondence to Richard Rodems, University of Michigan, 426 Thompson Street, Institute for Social Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104, rodems@umich.edu.
