Survey Says: Yes!,"Agrivoltaic systems allow for the simultaneous production of solar-generated electricity and agriculture. As the climate change related impacts of conventional energy and food production intensify, finding strategies to increase the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems, preserve agricultural land, and minimize competing land uses is urgent. Given the proven technical, economic, and environmental advantages provided by agrivoltaic systems, increased proliferation is anticipated, which necessitates accounting for the nuances of community resistance to solar development on farmland. Minimizing siting conflict and addressing agricultural communities’ concerns will be key in promoting public support for agrivoltaics, as localized acceptance of solar is a critical determinant of project success. This survey study assessed if public support for solar development increases when energy and agricultural production are combined in an agrivoltaic system. Results show that 81.8% of respondents would be more likely to support solar development in their community if it combined the production of both energy and agriculture. This increase in support for solar given the agrivoltaic approach highlights a development strategy that can improve local social acceptance and the deployment rate of solar photovoltaics. Survey respondents prefer agrivoltaic projects that a) are designed to provide economic opportunities for farmers and the local community b) are located on private property or existing agricultural land c) do not threaten local interests and d) ensure fair distribution of economic benefits.

Disentangling Heterogeneity and Non-White Share at Macro and Micro Levels,"Scholarship on the consequences of racial/ethnic diversity often claims that diversity undermines trust, participation and cooperation. This work has been criticized for its inability to discern the causal effects of diversity. We draw attention to a more elementary issue: most studies are unable to interpret associations between their outcomes of interest and diversity, as these may be due to associations with non-White or immigrant shares. We make the practical and theoretical case for preserving the distinction between diversity—i.e., mixture—and non-White or immigrant shares—e.g., percentage Black or percentage foreign-born—, and we warn scholars about the dangers of using language and measures associated with diversity, especially in contexts, like North America and Europe, where diversity strongly overlaps with non-White or immigrant shares. On a practical front, the policy recommendations that follow from the claim “greater diversity is associated with less prosociality” are different from those that follow from the claim “greater non-White share is associated with less prosociality among Whites.” On a theoretical front, most studies of diversity rely on theories that are predicated on ingroup/outgroup shares—most commonly intergroup conflict/threat theory—rather than on diversity; the predictions implied by popular theories, however, contradict those implied by claims about diversity. Importantly, two empirical obstacles undermine our capacity to disentangle associations with diversity from associations with non-White or immigrant shares. The first stems from the underrepresentation of predominately non-White (or predominately immigrant) communities in the real world. The second concerns our ability to infer that individual attitudes and behavior are correlated with diversity from correlations between macro-level outcomes and diversity. Finally, we spell out the kinds of data required to draw empirically sound conclusions about associations between diversity and social outcomes.

As the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread rapidly throughout the world, steps are being taken to limit the impact on public health. In the realm of infectious diseases like COVID-19, social distancing is effective to avoid exposure to the virus and reduce its spread. However, current studies about public transit did not consider social distancing which plays a fundamental role in the current outbreak. Therefore, it is vital to study how to optimally manage public transit systems in order to minimize risks related to COVID-19. 
Methods
In this study we present a novel web-based application, T-Ridership based on a hybrid optimized dynamic programming inspired by neural networks algorithm to optimize public transit for safety with respect to COVID-19. Two main steps are taken in the analysis through Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA): the first is detecting high-density stations by input data normalization, and then, using these results, the T-Ridership tool automatically determines optimal station order planning. 
Results
We evaluated the performance of our web tool by comparing the results with real data extracted from MTA. The number of passengers in a route dropped significantly after normalization by T-Ridership. These results can be used in expanding on and improving policy in public transit, to better plan the scheduled time of trains in a way that prevents high-volume human contact, increasing social distance and reducing the possibility of disease transmission (available at: http://t-ridership.com).",TRUE,FALSE,High-density|Human contact|Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)|Public transit|Social distancing,2021-05-06T03:11:04.910126,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-05T23:10:24.977479,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/citation/,casb7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/njt83/,njt83,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609189e619183d036755028f/,609189e619183d036755028f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/casb7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/casb7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/casb7

This question is explored by examining knowledge networks among pastoralists and others in northern Kenya, emerging in response to a highly variable animal disease setting. Using quantitative and qualitative social network analysis, intersecting locally-embedded, development project and political networks are identified. Drawing on high-reliability theory, as applied to critical infrastructures, the paper explores the key characteristics of the knowledge networks in relation to systems, knowledges, relationships, technologies, professionals and politics. Reliability – the ability to provide stable services and respond variability in real-time – is shown to be related to the networked capacity to mobilise knowledge to confront uncertainty and avoid ignorance, with certain high-reliability professionals central.

Using machine learning-based measures of candidates’ economic policy positions and text-based measures of value framing, we find that candidates with economically progressive policies appeal less to conservative values than candidates with economically conservative policies. Next, we test if economically progressive candidates gain electoral support by reconciling their policies with conservative values. We found in two experiments (total n=4,138), including a pre-registered experiment using a national probability sample, that a presidential candidate who framed a progressive economic platform in terms of conservative values (as opposed to liberal values or a neutral framing), was supported significantly more by conservatives and, unexpectedly, by moderates as well.

This study investigates life expectancy differentials along lines of caste, religion, and indigenous identity in India, home to some of the largest populations of marginalized social groups in the world. Using a large, high-quality survey that measured mortality, social group, and economic status, we are the first to estimate and decompose life expectancy differences between higher-caste Hindus and three of India's most disadvantaged social groups: Adivasis, Dalits, and Muslims. Relative to higher-caste Hindus, Adivasi life expectancy is more than four years lower, Dalit life expectancy is more than three years lower, and Muslim life expectancy is about one year lower. Economic status explains less than half of these gaps. The differences between the life expectancy of higher-caste Hindus and the life expectancies of Adivasis and Dalits are comparable to the Black-White gap in the US in absolute magnitude. The differences are larger in relative terms because overall life expectancy in India is lower. Our findings extend the literature on fundamental causes of global health disparities.

We found a significant reduction in hospitalizations among patients who received the ivermectin-based medical kit; the range of the effect is 52%- 76% depending on model specification.
Conclusions
The study supports ivermectin-based interventions to assuage the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid19|Hospitalization|Ivermectin|Mexico|Public intervention,2021-05-04T18:11:35.804370,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-04T07:41:01.654581,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VtXKW1IuCm4qRowlotXnTWZlhLoQYYmEsZp7ERUIeAQ,no,We used for the study administrative data from a public policy program provided to general population that met the selection criteria.

Recent research linking social media activity to political attitudes, participation in large, isolated demonstrations, and the occurrence of hate crimes suggests a relationship between right-wing social media activity and subsequent contentious events and violence. However, analyzing this relationship at countrywide scales over many months has not been possible in the absence of reliable georeferenced social media and corresponding contentious politics data. We create a spatial panel dataset measuring 57,505 right-wing social media posts and 1,765 incidents of right-wing unrest in all United States counties from January 2020 through January 2021. Using spatial regression analysis, we find that right-wing social media activity in a given month increased the frequency of right-wing unrest events in the following month. A content analysis of 1.5 million Parler comments reveals that discussions of political events were relatively rare, suggesting that while right-wing social media can be used to coordinate political unrest, this may not fully explain the positive relationship between online and offline activity. Instead, a subsequent analysis of politically moderate and conservative counties indicates that the main effect we observe is driven by shifting perceptions of norms and not changes in individuals’ beliefs or preferences. Our results help explain how social media affect political unrest beyond the conventional coordination mechanism and inform an emerging literature on social media, political attitudes and action, and violence.",TRUE,FALSE,Parler|Protest|Right-wing|Social media|Spatial analysis|Violence,2021-05-06T03:19:45.143778,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-05T23:15:16.952654,FALSE,NA,no,"The source data we use are in the public domain.

Credibility assessment strategies range from expert judgment to aggregating existing evidence to systematic replication efforts. Such assessments can require substantial time and effort. Research progress could be accelerated if there were rapid, scalable, accurate credibility indicators to guide attention and resource allocation for further assessment. The SCORE program is creating and validating algorithms to provide confidence scores for research claims at scale. To investigate the viability of scalable tools, teams are creating: a database of claims from papers in the social and behavioral sciences; expert and machine generated estimates of credibility; and, evidence of reproducibility, robustness, and replicability to validate the estimates. Beyond the primary research objective, the data and artifacts generated from this program will be openly shared and provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine research credibility and evidence.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithms|credibility|Metascience|replicability|reproducibility|social sciences,2021-05-04T18:11:35.645437,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-04T07:40:08.638705,TRUE,"Co-authors with an affiliation to the Center for Open Science acknowledge a conflict of interest as employees of the nonprofit organization with a mission to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research.",not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/citation/,46mnb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60904c0a5533b402f5e1df86/,60904c0a5533b402f5e1df86,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46mnb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/46mnb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/46mnb
