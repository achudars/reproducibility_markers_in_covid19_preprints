number of inventors have complained that the new patent term may reduce
patent protection because some applications spend a number of years in
“prosecution” before the PTO. Under the old law, delay in processing an
application did not hurt the patentee, but under the new rule, each day
spent in prosecuting the patent is a day of protection lost.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a neutral and systematic way
the likely effects of the new law. I conclude that on average, and for most
industries, the new law gives more protection to patentees than the old
law. However, there is some question as to whether the biotechnology
industry will receive less protection under the new law. I conclude that
there is no significant relationship between the length of time a patent
spends in prosecution and whether it will be judged valid in the courts.
Finally, the study produces some interesting data about the problem of
“submarine patents.”",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:34.288862,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:24:08.566000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/citation/,e26dc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/98cwg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/relationships/node/,98cwg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c8643c6c613b01df411254/,57c8643c6c613b01df411254,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e26dc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e26dc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e26dc

property (IP), which they call “intellectual monopoly.” In their view, IP
is not necessary to encourage invention or creation. Quite the contrary,
they argue that we get innovation from competition, not monopoly. Further,
because monopoly imposes well-recognized social costs, we are better off
without it if it doesn’t in fact spur new innovation.

Boldrin and Levine make a plausible case on their own terms. Nonetheless, I
think their terms are misleading. IP rights are rarely if ever
“intellectual monopolies.” Most patents, to say nothing of most copyrights,
create no economic rents. What this means is that we can’t assume that IP
rights generally impose deadweight losses on society. They cause deviation
from atomistic, perfect competition, but they don’t cause monopoly pricing.

than NPEs overall, breaking NPEs into different categories reveals more
complexity. Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) in particular win very few

affects decisionmaking in patent cases. We find that that there is a
strong, statistically significant relationship between a judge’s experience
and case outcome: more experienced judges are less likely to rule for the
patentee. Notably, the relationship exists for rulings finding
noninfringement; judicial experience had no relationship to the likelihood
a judge would find a patent invalid. The relationship appears to hold
across judges, rather than to be driven by the rulings of particular
judges. Beyond individual judges, some technologies (biotechnology,
mechanics) are associated with more patentee wins, while patentees are less
likely to win computer hardware and software cases. Some district courts
(Delaware, New Jersey) are more likely to find patents infringed. By
contrast, perhaps surprisingly, we find no significant relationship between
litigation in the Eastern District of Texas and a judge’s ruling for or
against the patentee. Finally, we find that suing on multiple patents is
associated with an increased likelihood that at least one patent will be
found to be infringed.

Our results challenge what has been an implicit assumption in the
literature and discussion that particular districts are biased in a
particular direction, driving forum shopping. And they test for the first
time the implicit assumption in the literature, in calls for specialized
patent trial courts, and in the Patent Pilot Program, that experience with
patent cases at the trial level will lead to different — usually assumed to
be “better” — outcomes from what we see from generalist courts. Our results
suggest that there is a difference, but that “better” may be in the eye of
the beholder. They suggest some sort of learning effect among district
court judges across the country, and that patentees benefit from litigating
before inexperienced judges, at least on issues of infringement. Depending
on the reason for this effect, adoption of a specialized patent trial court
might help accused infringers but not patentees, raising broader questions
about patent reform and how to measure the value of an expert court.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:30.453905,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:14:26.473000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/citation/,8nkya,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d4x4b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/relationships/node/,d4x4b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c861f4594d9001e488f89d/,57c861f4594d9001e488f89d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nkya/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8nkya/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8nkya
