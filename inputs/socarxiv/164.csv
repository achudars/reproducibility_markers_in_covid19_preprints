Looking across high- and low-income countries, we find that some supply chains, market segments, companies, small-scale actors and civil society have shown initial signs of greater resilience than others. For example, frozen Ecuadorian shrimp and Chinese tilapia exports were diverted to alternative markets, while live-fresh supply chains were more impacted.

I present a deep Bayesian model for this management of uncertainty in intelligent systems, and I argue for its applicability to cultural sociology. As social systems grow more heterogeneous, management of uncertainty in any participating agent becomes computationally difficult, and I propose that combinations of a small number of layers of reasoning in a deep Bayesian model are sufficient to account for some of the salient ways by which humans manage this uncertainty. Three forces come into play when considering such a model, and each is connected to a particular form of uncertainty. A denotative layer in the model represents uncertainty in the world or environment (ambiguity and risk about outcomes), a connotative layer manages the uncertainty about relationships with other social agents, and the connection between denotative and connotative handles uncertainty about identities of the self and others. Behaviours taken by agent and by others are handled in both layers simultaneously. I show how the tradeoff between these three factors maps to different social structures, and I use use the model to make predictions across a range of domains, and show its relationship to cultural sociological, social psychological, economic and sociological theorizing.

Relationships between humans and Asian elephants have lasted for millenia, based on close interlinks between wild elephants, captive elephants, and the latter’s human masters. Since the beginning of the 19th century, elephants have been used mainly in agroforestry as draught animals.  Interrelations between wild and captive populations persist in few countries, notably through the reproduction of captive females with wild males. 
2.	The ongoing and rapid political, socio-economic and environmental changes occurring in Laos for the last few decades have strongly affected the conditions of this cohabitation. We conducted an ethnological survey to assess how the socio-ecological system has evolved in Laos and its consequences for interactions between humans, wild, and captive elephants, elephant handling practices and human relationships with the species. 
3.	We show that in the 1990s this socio-ecological system was based on the principles of common access to natural resources and social control over nature and spirits, and led to a form of elephant handling with close interactions between captive and wild elephants. Husbandry practices then could be likened to pastoralism as a mode of production associated with a mode of relation close to seasonal freedom. 
4.	Since the turn of the present century, the commodification of nature and of increasingly divided access to natural resources led eventually to the segregation of wild elephants and the intensification of the workload of their captive congeners. Elephant owners switched from an economy based on natural increase of their animal capital to a ranching-like economy, based on the accumulation of monetary capital from the employment of elephants in logging or tourism. Agricultural intensification and restricted access to forest protected areas have led to the disappearance of foraging lands. Elephants being tethered most of their time, this new mode of handling is associated with captivity, where reproduction and feeding are under exclusive human control.

Moreover, being a former member of the communist party or secret police informant increases the risk of dropping off the Polish rich list by 79%.

This paper contributes to both aspects of the discussion by extending recent research on gender, internationalization, and academic gatekeeping to additional subfields of human geography. In particular, we focus on the demographic structure and international diversity of the editorial teams of flagship quantitative geography journals. We find that women are under-represented in our sample, with shares ranging from 23.1 to 43.5 percent—numbers unfortunately comparable to many other geography journals.

We show that, given limited historical data, median incomes are most appropriate for measuring welfare and inequality, while urban unskilled wages can be used to test dualist models of development. We present a new dataset including both series in Mexico from 1800 to 2015 and find that both have historically failed to keep up with aggregate growth: per worker GDP is now over eight times higher than in the nineteenth century, while unskilled urban real wages are only 2.2 times higher, and median incomes only 2.0 times. From the perspective of inequality and social welfare, our findings confirm that there is no automatic positive relationship between economic growth and rising living standards for the majority. From the perspective of development, we argue that these findings are consistent with a dual economy model incorporating Lewis’s assumption of a reserve army of labour, and explain why Kuznets’s predicted decline in inequality has not occurred.

Nevertheless, maps of crimes known to police are affected by selection biases driven by unequal crime reporting rates across social groups. This paper presents a simulation study to analyse the impact of selection biases on crime maps produced at different spatial scales. Based on parameters obtained from the UK Census, we simulate a synthetic population consistent with the characteristics of Manchester. Then, based on parameters derived from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, we simulate crimes suffered by individuals, and their likelihood to be known to police. This allows comparing the relative difference between all crimes and police-recorded incidents at the different spatial scales. While the average relative difference between all crimes and those known to police is 62% across all geographical scales, the measures of dispersion of the relative difference are larger when crimes are aggregated to small geographies. The percentage of crimes unknown to police varies widely across small areas, underestimating the prevalence of crime in certain places while overestimating it in others. Micro-level crime maps are affected by a larger risk of bias than maps produced at larger scales.",TRUE,FALSE,Crime analysis|Manchester|Official Statistics|Simulation Experiment|Survey|Unreliability,2020-06-25T14:15:26.190376,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-25T14:15:02.137540,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/davidbuilgil/crime_simulation2,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",David Buil-Gil|Angelo Moretti and Samuel H.

The onset of these
declines seems linked to the Great Recession of 2008–2009 but their continuation cannot easily
be linked to subsequent economic change. The 1990s, too, brought episodes of economic crises
to the Nordic region that were followed by different degrees of fertility decline. In this study,
we provide an empirical overview of parity-, age- and education-specific fertility developments
in the five Nordic countries in the wake of the economic recessions in 2008 and the early 1990s,
respectively. We demonstrate a high degree of heterogeneity in fertility developments across
countries after 1990, whereas after 2008, the trends are much more similar across the five
countries. Likewise, the educational differences in birth hazards that characterized the
developments after 1990 were much smaller in the initial years after 2008–2009. This reversal
from heterogeneity to homogeneity in the fertility response to recessions calls for an expansion
of theories on the cyclicality of fertility in relation to uncertainty and economic and social
change. In our discussion, we consider the role of a set of factors that also incorporates the state,
crisis management, and perceptions of economic and welfare uncertainty.",TRUE,FALSE,childbearing|economic uncertainty|fertility|Nordic countries|recession|welfare uncertainty,2020-06-24T18:47:24.778912,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-24T18:46:58.535142,FALSE,NA,no,"Licenses to use population-register data are granted by national statistics in Denmark,
