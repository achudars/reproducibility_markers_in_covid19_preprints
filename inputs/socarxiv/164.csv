Review of previous studies reveals that measures of effectiveness and techniques for evaluation vary widely, and often provide cursory reporting of the immediate outputs of involvement efforts, rather than system outcomes related to public participation. Interviews and government documents from three detailed cases in the United States transportation planning suggest that complexity, perceived subjectivity and an extended period of project development creates challenges for performance measurement of public participation. To demonstrate use of the logic model approach for evaluation of public participation, the research team performed three case studies that separate broad phases of projects into context, implementation, and results. This phased approach supports the identification of performance measures that may address immediate outputs of a public participation processes, in addition to intermediate and later outcomes related to public participation. Results from the multiple case studies suggest that performance measures are more likely to be sustained and impactful when devised for simplicity, supported by an agency champion, and resources are in place for institutionalization of the process as part of agency operations. The logic model approach clarifies that performance targets should be tailored by an organization to address a particular phase of the project development process.",TRUE,FALSE,logic modeling|multiple case study|performance measurement|public participation,2020-10-22T01:20:17.694250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-22T01:19:52.799387,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.tn.gov/tdot/long-range-planning-home/25-year-transportation-policy-plan.html|https://www.planbayarea.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Evaluation_Report_PBA_Outreach.pdf,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/citation/,gjr9h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f905ae7b11ee900e45a817c/,5f905ae7b11ee900e45a817c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gjr9h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gjr9h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gjr9h,NA

Why language matters,"Here, we argue that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are different epistemic objects as compared to other biomarkers such as blood pressure or sodium level. While the latter two may be subject to variation, measured inaccurately or interpreted in various ways, blood flow has a pressure and sodium is available in a concentration that can be quantified and visualised. In stark contrast, PRSs are calculated, compiled or constructed through the statistical assemblage of genetic variants. How researchers frame and name PRSs has consequences for how we interpret and value their results. We distinguish between the tangible and inferential understanding of PRS and the corresponding languages of measurement and computation, respectively. The conflation of these frames obscures important questions we need to ask: what PRS seeks to represent, whether current ways of ‘doing PRS’ are optimal and responsible, and upon what we base the credibility of PRS-based knowledge claims.",TRUE,FALSE,computation|framing|measurement|polygenic risk scores|scientific communication,2020-10-22T01:20:41.192622,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-22T01:20:22.224522,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/citation/,5xk9t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f902918b11ee900d05aae2f/,5f902918b11ee900d05aae2f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xk9t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5xk9t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5xk9t,NA

In place since the early 1990s, the Australian approach is a hybrid governance system involving collaborative planning of water resources together with market mechanisms and statutory regulation. However, in implementing the model, successive reforms have yet to completely redress the historical exclusion of Aboriginal peoples from water law frameworks, and have struggled to account for the needs of a healthy and sustainable aquatic environment. In this chapter we examine the trajectory of water law and policy reform in Australia, including two of the most recent developments: the push to intensify water development in the northern Australian White Paper and the collaborative planning approach set in the Water for Victoria policy. Our study of the incremental and evolving Australian water law reforms highlights the difficulty of ensuring fairness in the operation of hybrid governance systems for water regulation, and reveals important lessons for international policy-makers embarking on and implementing water reforms in their own jurisdictions. From its inception, strategic planning for innovative water law reform must be supported by meaningful engagement with Indigenous peoples, and embed Indigenous and environmental values and rights in water planning and governance.

However, as became evident in 2016 with the victory of Donald Trump, most of them consider presidential elections only at the national level, neglecting that these are ultimately decided by the Electoral College. In order to improve accuracy, we believe that forecasts should instead address outcomes at the state-level to determine the eventual Electoral College winner. We develop a political economy model of the incumbent vote share across states based on different short- and long-term predictors, referring up to the end of the second quarter of election years. Testing it against election outcomes since 1980, our model correctly predicts the eventual election winner in 9 out of 10 cases – including 2016 –, with the 2000 election being the exception.

The effects of COVID-19 virus on interpersonal trust,"Does the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic affect interpersonal trust? While most evidence shows that natural threats reinforce trust and cooperation, the COVID-19 virus differs from other calamities since it spreads through contact with people, thus potentially increasing mistrust and suspicion towards human beings. We in-vestigate the link between exposure to COVID-19 and trust in strangers by conducting a survey experiment with a representative sample of adults in Italy, one the countries that has been worst affected by the outbreak of the virus. Contrary to intuitive expectations, we find that those who report COVID-19 symptoms and those who live in the municipalities that have been worst affected by the virus trust strangers substantially more than their rela-tive counterparts. In addition, our experimental findings reveal that the risk that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to our health in the future leads to a substantial increase in trust in strangers. The risk that the pandemic poses to our livelihood, in terms of job loss and economic recession, also leads to a smaller increase in trust in strangers, while solidarity appeals and knowledge of people with COVID-19 symptoms within a close circle of relatives, friends and colleagues have no effects on trust. These findings, we suggest, could be explained by adapting the “emancipation theory of trust” to the context of natural disasters, conjecturing that when caught in catastrophes people become more dependent on other people’s support.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID19|Interpersonal trust|Natural threats|Trust,2020-10-20T16:17:51.269423,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-20T16:14:50.609065,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/citation/,rm4ck,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8f09e68fc43a00bc8dbf62/,5f8f09e68fc43a00bc8dbf62,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rm4ck/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rm4ck,NA

The two most numerous categories of resettled laborers created by these imperial policies were the mitmaqkuna and yanakuna, who together represented at least a third of the total subject population. The Inkas resettled them, often far from their homelands. They were responsible for the daily provisioning of Inka settlements and keeping the peace among conquered populations. Despite their central role in Inka state consolidation and economy, we know little about these populations outside of ethnohistorical interpretations of their privileged status relative to normal tribute-paying communities. Because ethnohistoric documents were written with Inka and Spanish state interests in mind, archaeological evidence is crucial to evaluate their lived experiences. We compare the ethnohistoric and archaeological evidence of the lives of the mitmaqkuna and yanakuna in two regions: the mitmaqkuna site of Yanawilka in the Vilcas Huamán province and the yanakuna site of Cheqoq in the rural Inka heartland of Cuzco.

However, such statistics ignore the fact that two lifespan distributions are generally not mutually exclusive and that not all females outlive all males. Here we use a novel measure of inequality in lifespans: the outsurvival probability, which is interpreted as the probability of males to outlive females. The measure accounts for the similarities in lifespan between populations. It also considers the interaction between the mean and variance of two lifespan distributions and their combined effect on between-populations inequalities. Our results show that the probability of males outliving females varied between 25% and 50%, across 44 countries and regions since the middle of the 18th century. Thus, despite the usually male lower life expectancy and higher death rates at all ages, males have a substantial chance of outliving females.

We summarise a large research literature across a range of academic disciplines. There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne, hence may travel long distances and be inhaled. Infection control policies must therefore go beyond contact and droplet measures (such as hand-washing and cleaning surfaces) and attend more carefully to masking and ventilation. Masks work mainly by source control (protecting others) but give some protection to wearers. Even small reductions in individual transmission with ‘imperfect’ masks and face coverings could lead to large effects on population spread. Randomized controlled trials of the preventive effect of population masking in Covid-19 remain sparse and have not addressed source control. Performance varies widely across different kinds of mask; comfort and fit need to be optimized. Masks may cause discomfort and communication difficulties, which affect some groups (e.g. d/Deaf) disproportionately. The harms of mask-wearing were over-estimated in the early months of the pandemic; there is no evidence that risk compensation occurs in people who wear them or that masks account for significant fomite transmission. Masks do not cause clinically significant physiological decompensation in healthy people. Documented medical exemptions to mask-wearing are few. The psychological impacts of masks are culturally shaped; they may include threats to autonomy, social relatedness and competence. Whilst harms of masks are generally outweighed by benefits when COVID-19 is spreading in a population, mandated masking involves a trade-off with personal freedom, so such policies should be pursued only if the threat is severe and benefits cannot be achieved through less intrusive means.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|face coverings|Masks|public health|SARS-CoV-2,2020-10-20T16:20:35.316256,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-20T16:18:34.061951,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/citation/,wuk6a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8e9a20d265e0006b7dc583/,5f8e9a20d265e0006b7dc583,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wuk6a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wuk6a,NA
