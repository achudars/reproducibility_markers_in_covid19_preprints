A study of eight K12 teachers and 26 K12 secondary students participated in a GenCyber (cybersecurity) camp for a week during July 2018. External evaluations of the camp show its success and how cybersecurity fits into science and mathematics classrooms. This GenCyber camp was a five-day introductory camp for middle school and high school teachers and students. The GenCyber camp offered morning modules of CORE instruction, or cyber-oriented reinforced education, with the afternoon focused on differentiated learning adventures for teachers and students in specialized subject options engaging in hands-on labs. Most instruction utilized Micro:bit technology. Teachers and students made explicit connections to chemistry (battery function chemistry, sensors), physics (frequency, particle vs. wave, movement, acceleration, photon detection, magnetic fields), biology (simulating biological behavior, synchronizing, pattern detection) and mathematics (matrix, functions, modeling, unit conversion).",TRUE,FALSE,computer science education|cross cutting concepts|cybersecurity|disciplinary core ideas|engineering education|science education|STEM integration|technology education,2019-01-04T15:05:01.224222,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T15:04:38.920746,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/citation/,jre5k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q6nvz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/relationships/node/,q6nvz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2ee90300b540001afdf0a2/,5c2ee90300b540001afdf0a2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jre5k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jre5k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jre5k,NA

One of the most profound changes driven by this concern for reproducibility and transparency is from analysing data using tools dependent on pointing-and-clicking with a mouse in commercial software, to a new set of tools based on writing scripts in free and open source programming languages. We present bibliometric evidence for this change in the sciences generally and in archaeology in particular to test if the adoption of these new tools may be considered a revolution or some other process.

While previous work has investigated the demographic diversity of museum staffs and visitors, the diversity of artists in their collections has remained unreported. We conduct the first large-scale study of artist diversity in museums. By scraping the public online catalogs of 18 major U.S. museums, deploying a sample of 10,000 artist records comprising over 9,000 unique artists to crowdsourcing, and analyzing 45,000 responses, we infer artist genders, ethnicities, geographic origins, and birth decades. Our results are threefold. First, we provide estimates of gender and ethnic diversity at each museum, and overall, we find that 85% of artists are white and 87% are men. Second, we identify museums that are outliers, having significantly higher or lower representation of certain demographic groups than the rest of the pool. Third, we find that the relationship between museum collection mission and artist diversity is weak, suggesting that a museum wishing to increase diversity might do so without changing its emphases on specific time periods and regions.

Similarly, the effects of weather on the location of crime have barely been explored empirically. We investigated how weather influences the intensity and spatial distribution of crime in Oslo, the capital of Norway. Geocoded locations of criminal offences were combined with data on temperature, wind, and rain. We used negative binomial count models to assess the effect of weather on the intensity of crime and generalized additive models (GAMs) to test for spatial variations. The intensity and spatial distribution of crime were not very sensitive to weather in Oslo. The largest effect was for drug crimes, for which maximum relative to minimum temperature was related to a single incident increase every six days. No effects were found for dislocation in the spatial models. In Oslo, Norway, weather conditions are of little importance for practical policing.

Using Fed publications, interviews with officials, and transcripts of congressional hearings, it argues that systemic risk is a pathology of the monetary government of the economy. As such, systemic risk is at once the effect of the overflow of the financial architecture through which the Fed governs and a discursive object that purifies not only this overflow but also the breaches the Fed’s emergency management strategies cause in the state-economy boundary. By turning regulatory capture theory on its head, the paper shows that the Fed put itself in such a politico-economically precarious position in managing financial emergencies because it is captured not by financial interests, but by systemic risk.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-03T19:41:12.824756,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-03T19:30:44.525521,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",Onur Ozgode,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/citation/,ga5w7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2d170aa7c0a70018412631/,5c2d170aa7c0a70018412631,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ga5w7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ga5w7,NA

Data on 17 aspiring, 46 probable, and 16 successful SHOs were collected. The study results indicate that potential serial killers share more in common with successful SHOs than they do with one-off homicide offenders. While there is overlap among these groups, there is insufficient evidence to suggest discreet transitions among categories or that being a potential SHO is the final step on a pathway towards becoming a successful SHO. Potential SHOs cannot reliably be thought of as prospective SHOs if all things were equal. An as yet identified factor, such as resiliency, still separates potential SHOs from successful SHOs. Early identification and timely intervention is important to interrupt impending murders by potential SHOs and halt them at this pivotal point in their developmental trajectory.",TRUE,FALSE,crime prevention|criminal victimization|critical criminology|sex crimes|violent behavior,2019-01-03T19:40:49.025847,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-03T19:29:15.464927,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2f|Law|Law Enforcement and Corrections|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/citation/,5b6w9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2d0d67a7c0a70018411c3b/,5c2d0d67a7c0a70018411c3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b6w9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5b6w9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5b6w9,NA

To do so, the development of linguistic, communicative and socio-pragmatic competences enriched with socio-cultural inputs in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) or Second Language (L2) teaching and learning contexts have a significant impact on language learners both to develop their perception as native speakers of English and to facilitate the progress of cognitive skills and capabilities. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a case study to show some of the difficulties in teaching English modal auxiliaries to Turkish students in EFL/L2 contexts which arise not only from structural characteristics, but also from insufficiently developed linguistic, communicative and socio-pragmatic competencies. It is also asserted that only teaching the lexical properties of modal auxiliaries in isolation from their socio-pragmatic and semiotic contexts alone cannot help learners to become successful communicators in the target language as it ends in communication failures, hesitation, a slower L2 progress, fear and misunderstandings. Therefore, role-play activities, cloze tests, research assignments, writing tasks and songs can also be integrated into the teaching-learning process to assist learners to become more aware of their actual authentic usages in a wide range of contexts through different activities. On the whole, this would also free language learners to refer to their First Language (L1) input and shape a broader understanding of the Foreign Language (FL) framed with its actual authentic usage.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive linguistics|competence|curriculum|language learning-teaching|modal auxiliaries,2019-01-03T19:39:22.448815,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-03T19:33:56.035751,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/citation/,kxe9j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c390ea7c0a7001b3cdafd/,5c2c390ea7c0a7001b3cdafd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kxe9j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kxe9j,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.4

Among the university level students, WhatsApp at present is  getting into the frontline as one of the most widespread online social networking platforms concerning  to language learning. The research work undertaken tries to understand if university level students consider WhatsApp as a significant learning platform that can develop and support their language learning skills.  Moreover, , the research work focuses   on the routine practices or use of WhatsApp by students. The outcome of the survey data reveals that students consider that WhatsApp may be utilized as a teaching cum learning online platform to assist them in the process of language learning. They also highlighted the necessity of imitating language courses associated with WhatsApp, integration of technology through WhatsApp for the access of class materials with a set of objectives and outcomes explicitly focused on learning language to create meaningful experiences for students.
