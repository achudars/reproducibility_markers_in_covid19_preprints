There is a law to promote whistleblowing practices, but the negative subsequent effect of whistleblowing demotivates the reporting of unethical behaviours. Thus, it is important to identify the factors that motivate an employee to exercise whistleblowing in an organization. Therefore, this study aims to examine whether the personal factor of job satisfaction and organizational factors such as fair treatment as well as cooperativeness contribute to the whistleblowing practice in an organization.
Design/methodology/approach: This study collected primary data based on a questionnaire survey from 73 respondents of the seven top most GLCs in Malaysia. The data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional regression.
Findings: The findings of the study reveal that only fair treatment is statistically significant and positively related to the whistleblowing practice. The findings imply that if employees perceive that the organization provides fair treatment in terms of career advancement, awards, training, performance appraisal, job assignment, and pay increases, they would tend to report wrongdoing activities to protect the image of the organization.
Practical implications: The findings of the study will help the policy makers to ensure better working environment and accountability in the public sector of Malaysia and other similar countries.

The government obligations in PPP projects are often limited to feasibility study, transaction support and implementing linked government or public sector projects which subsequently raise the question regarding how the required funds should be mobilized by the government for these services as upfront development cost. Generally, any government agency driving a PPP project has to secure budgetary allocation from the central authority for performing the government-side obligations, which is often a complicated and time consuming process due to other priorities of the central treasury.

The perspectives of executives were collected based on ten factors of innovation practices utilizing the five-point Likert scales. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the data while the reliability and validity were tested using the Cronbach’s alpha test and the Skewness and Kurtosis test, respectively. Factor analysis was used to test the data consistency. The findings revealed the 82.8% of the respondents were agreeable to their firms’ emphasis on the factors of innovation. However, it was found that GLCs that were owned by the federal government placed more focus on innovation compared to the GLCs that were state-owned. This study reveals that overall the Malaysian GLCs should enhance their innovation practices by placing more focus on being engaged in the adoption of innovative designs at work, the reengineering of business processes, innovative pricing, market distribution and promotional methods, enhancing customer satisfaction by importing innovative warranty and maintenance systems, as well as by importing innovative claim clearing processes and methods, and the adoption of innovative order management and follow-up systems.",TRUE,FALSE,innovation; government-linked companies; sustainable competitive advantage; Malaysia,2019-06-14T09:59:07.358978,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T09:58:40.382794,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/citation/,u7yth,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jbyxc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/relationships/node/,jbyxc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d020fd6760f11001bfbc329/,5d020fd6760f11001bfbc329,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u7yth/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u7yth

Despite efforts to improve service delivery, criticisms and complains toward public services remain evident. This study aims to assess the status of good governance practices in the public sector of Malaysia. Primary data were collected from the responses of 109 department heads under 24 federal ministries to a survey questionnaire. Respondent perception of good governance practices was measured using a seven-point Likert scale and analyzed by descriptive statistics and path measurement modeling. Standard diagnostic tests were also conducted to check the reliability of the data and model. Results indicated that nine factors were significant in the measurement of good governance practices. However, very few people in the public sector of Malaysia practice fraud control, which is at the lowest intensity. Among the service groups, the engineer group practiced good governance at the highest level, whereas the health service group practiced good governance at the lowest level. Therefore, still there are scopes available to improve good governance systems to become more reliable and efficient public sector in Malaysia. Findings of the study will help policy makers improve the efficiency of the public sector of Malaysia and other countries.",TRUE,FALSE,Public Sector; Good Governance; Path Measurement Model; Factor Analysis; Malaysia,2019-06-14T09:56:47.424818,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T09:56:21.819734,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/citation/,84ewh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3sbgt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/relationships/node/,3sbgt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d020f257b8c4d001b9adfac/,5d020f257b8c4d001b9adfac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ewh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/84ewh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/84ewh

This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey among 134 executives and managers of GLCs in Malaysia. The data were collected based on opinions of the ten factors of market orientation practices by using the five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. On an average, 86.6% of the respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of market orientation. The federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on market orientation than the state owned GLCs. This study suggests improving the practices of market orientation of GLCs in Malaysia by emphasizing on providing close attention to after-sales service, responding rapidly to the threats of competitive actions, regularly discussing the competitors’ strengths and strategies by top management, and freely communicating successful and unsuccessful customer experiences across all business functions. It is suggested that Malaysian GLCs should serious invest in market orientation to deliver higher accountability outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|government-linked companies|Malaysia|market orientation|sustainable competitive advantage,2019-06-14T09:54:42.837940,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T09:54:15.046571,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/citation/,uxfqa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v8yjk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/relationships/node/,v8yjk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d020dc0760f110018fbd68b/,5d020dc0760f110018fbd68b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxfqa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uxfqa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uxfqa
