Both cohorts reported increased efficiency in use of food, families spending more time cooking and eating together, and more prudent use of food with less waste. Food purchasing patterns shifted from frequent trips to the store to dramatic increases in online ordering. A small proportion (11% Chinese, 2% U.S. respondents) reported clinically significant weight gains of &gt;4.5 kg. Household food insecurity worsened, with large increases in people worrying about or experiencing food shortage. Collective grocery-shopping experience by survey respondents indicated that the functional stability of food supply systems remained steady. All food types were somewhat available, except for noticeably higher prices widely reported by the Chinese cohort.

It is interpreted as that generalization of classical information, which includes both finite and transfinite ordinal numbers. On the other hand, any wave function and thus any state of any quantum system is just one value of quantum information. Information and its generalization as quantum information are considered as quantities of elementary choices. Their units are correspondingly a bit and a qubit. The course of time is what generates choices by itself, thus quantum information and any item in the world in final analysis. The course of time generates necessarily choices so: The future is absolutely unorderable in principle while the past is always well-ordered and thus unchangeable. The present as the mediation between them needs the well-ordered theorem equivalent to the axiom of choice. The latter guarantees the choice even among the elements of an infinite set, which is the case of quantum information. The concrete and abstract objects share information as their common base, which is quantum as to the formers and classical as to the latters. The general quantities of matter in physics, mass and energy can be considered as particular cases of quantum information. The link between choice and abstraction in set theory allows of “Hume’s principle” to be interpreted in terms of quantum mechanics as equivalence of “many” and “much” underlying quantum information. Quantum information as the universal substance of the world calls for the unity of physics and mathematics rather than that of the concrete and abstract objects and thus for a form of quantum neo-Pythagoreanism in final analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,axiom of choice|choice|energy|God|information|logic|mass|matter|quantum information,2020-05-24T20:31:20.878234,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-24T20:31:01.271979,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfa|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Logic and Foundations of Mathematics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/citation/,g6yw3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec8cd8417ac9e00f5622c38/,5ec8cd8417ac9e00f5622c38,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6yw3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6yw3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6yw3

Preliminary results,"Around 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide celebrate in some extent the holy month of Ramadan during COVID-19 pandemic. Some increase their attendance worship sites and traditional dining in extended families, so infectious contact rates could increase. Moreover, fasting could increase the probability of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are mitigation measures (e.g. Healthy Ramadan by WHO) applied to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 spread, however their real impact is still unknown. Multiple studies assessed observed effects of contact rates increase during holidays as Chinese New Year in January and Passover and Easter in April and their short-time effects on COVID-19 transmission dynamics. However, there are any quantitative attempts considering epidemiological consequences of the holy Ramadan (at least up to our knowledge and keywords search in various databases until the submission day). We analyze the fractions of Muslims and time series of COVID-19 daily incidence and cases numbers for 197 countries and territories. We found statistically significant positive link with proportion of Islam adherents with increase in normalized new cases of COVID-19 during 1-18 May 2020.

We propose a model-based approach to calculate cumulative infection rates from data on observed and expected deaths from Covid-19. Our analysis of mortality data shows that between 5 and 6% of people in Great Britain were infected by Covid-19 by the last third of April 2020. It is unlikely that the infection rate was lower than 3% or higher than 12%. Secondly, England had higher infection rates than Scotland and Wales, although the differences between countries were not large. Thirdly, we observed a substantial variation in virus infection rates in Great Britain by geographical units. Estimated infection rates were highest in the capital city of London where more than 10% of the population might have been infected and also in other major urban regions, while the lowest were in small towns and rural areas. Finally, spatial regression analysis showed that the virus infection rates increased with the increasing population density of the area and the level of deprivation. The results suggest that people from lower socioeconomic groups in urban areas (including those with minority backgrounds) were most affected by the spread of coronavirus in March and April.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|infection rates|infectious diseases|mortality|spatial analysis|statistical modelling,2020-05-22T18:00:29.088866,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-22T18:00:13.281101,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/citation/,84f3e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec7f294c7568600bd2d177a/,5ec7f294c7568600bd2d177a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84f3e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/84f3e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/84f3e

This article, however, tried to look at the effects of coronavirus from the lens of social science.  In this article, coronavirus is considered as a devastating natural disaster and intended to know the socio- psychological effects of lockdown and social distancing on the lives of Bangladeshi women. To do this mostly qualitative approach is used. However, quantitative data is also used to supplement the validity of qualitative data. A survey was conducted for quantitative data and a few case studies are for the qualitative data. The findings shows that around 87% respondents believe that people of Bangladesh should not disregard the decision of the government to stop the spread of Coronavirus and 95% of the respondents believe, everyone should follow the instructions of experts in maintaining social distancing to avoid Coronavirus. This research also shows that 87.2% of the respondents are worried of coronavirus due to public health concerns; however, around 60% of respondents also claimed that the lockdown itself made their lives less meaningful, due to negative effects on their economic and social welfare. Finally it is suggested to recruit more psychiatrics and increase the level of social support for depressed women so that they can have more of an equal contribution in society.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-05-23T16:23:40.835089,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-23T16:23:19.086302,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,n/a,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/citation/,4e63c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec7a032aeeb6d007d08499d/,5ec7a032aeeb6d007d08499d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4e63c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4e63c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4e63c
