To do so, this study uses the Comparative Welfare Data Set and the piecewise regression method to produce two linear models that best fit to the data for different ranges of the share of seats in parliament held by women. The analysis fails to find consistent support for a threshold below which women legislators have little-to-no impact upon policy outcomes. By adjudicating seven hypothetical thresholds, the analysis also shows that when there is a critical mass effect, the 10 percent level is more a consequential threshold than 15, 20, or 30 percent levels. Findings suggest that we reject the idea of a critical threshold for women’s legislative representation.

Protocol of an interdisciplinary study of a school-based nutritional health intervention in France,"Background: Governments across Europe have attempted to address the obesogenic environment through a variety of policy measures over the last two decades. A growing literature advocates for complex population interventions in public health. Such approaches embrace the need for interventions that can operate within the complexity of real-life situations as well as capturing and tracking interactions between an intervention and its context. Aim: This paper describes the original interdisciplinary methodological approach of a research project. The study was designed to ascertain whether complex public health interventions can be transferred from one local context to another while remaining loyal to their initial objectives. Method: An integrated interdisciplinary qualitative design was established to elaborate and answer the research questions. Three disciplinary strands were involved: Political Science, Public Health and Sociology. The three strands worked together while applying their specific methodological approaches. Results: The Political Science strand analysed the public health nutrition intervention taking a socio-historic policy studies top-down perspective. The Public Health Strand developed a method of analysing the three interventions through a co-construction process with the participants. This allows for the key functions, forms and context of each intervention to be identified and compared. The Sociology strand performed ethnographic methods to observe and analyse the deployment and activities linked with each intervention across sites. Together the three strands provide an interdisciplinary analysis of the length and breadth of the interventional scope with which to answer the research questions.

Both Hawtrey and Keynes considered the central bank’s ability to influence short-term rates of interest. However, they do not put the same emphasis on the study of the long-term rates of interest. According to Keynes, long-term rates are influenced by future expected short-term rates (1930, 1936), whereas for Hawtrey (1932, 1937, 1938), long-term rates are more dependent on the business cycle. Short-term rates do not have much effect on long-term rates according to Hawtrey. In 1939, Hicks enters the controversy, giving credit to both Hawtrey’s and Keynes’s theories, and also introducing limits to the operations of arbitrage.

We examine the relationship between individual attributes, aggregate female labor force participation, child care enrollment, family leave, and individual fertility in twenty developed countries using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our results indicate that women's full-time employment and country-level employment rates decrease expected fertility in contrast to recent research which shows a reversal in the negative association between total fertility rates and female labor force participation during the 1980s. However, the positive association between child care enrollment and fertility indicates that child care services might mitigate some of the decline in fertility, possibly by reducing labor force exit among women with young children.",TRUE,FALSE,child care|family leave|fertility|women's employment,2018-07-02T11:48:11.501505,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-11T21:58:20.674655,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/citation/,ye6gu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/92ury/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/relationships/node/,92ury,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5acd684ec7a6c0000fcf529c/,5acd684ec7a6c0000fcf529c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ye6gu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ye6gu/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2008.08.005,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ye6gu

Women in professional occupations have greater access to workplace benefits which help reconcile work-family responsibilities and reduce non-employment spells. However, because of their higher earnings, women in professional occupations who re-enter after a break may experience significant earnings penalties. One strategy women employ to mitigate the earnings penalty is to delay childbearing. Here, I examine whether delayed fertility is positively associated with a reduced motherhood wage gap across 20 occupations. Using multilevel models and 2011-2015 American Community Survey data, I show that mothers in professional occupations experienced the largest earnings penalty with early motherhood, but also the largest premium with delayed childbearing. While delaying a first birth mitigates the earnings penalty in high-wage occupations requiring extensive career preparation, women in low-wage occupations experienced little economic benefit from older motherhood.",TRUE,FALSE,fertility|motherhood|occupations|wage gap,2018-07-02T11:48:11.465766,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-11T11:02:25.855411,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/citation/,vn7zt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bk2x4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/relationships/node/,bk2x4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5acd675cc7a6c0000ccf8454/,5acd675cc7a6c0000ccf8454,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vn7zt/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vn7zt

We test how asymmetric accumulation of wealth and debt between partners influences marital and cohabitation stability based on gender norms, economic independence, and financial strain perspectives. Using data from the 1996-2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we find support for the economic independence perspective as both female- and male wealth-dominant couples are at an increased risk of dissolution over wealth-homophilous couples. However, for married couples, female wealth-dominant couples are significantly less stable than male-dominant couples. For cohabiting couples, heterophily is less consequential and there is little difference between male and female-dominant couples. Asymmetric holdings in debt relate differently to stability than asymmetry in wealth.",TRUE,FALSE,cohabitation|dissolution|family economics,2018-07-02T11:48:11.387633,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-11T10:59:53.406422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/citation/,bc3h2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7zpv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/relationships/node/,c7zpv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5acd57b7c7a6c0000dcf57e5/,5acd57b7c7a6c0000dcf57e5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bc3h2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bc3h2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bc3h2
