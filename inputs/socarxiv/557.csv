Sex workers are disproportionately affected by HIV compared with the general population. Most studies of HIV risk among sex workers have focused on individual-level risk factors, with few studies assessing potential structural determinants of HIV risk. In this Article, we examine whether criminal laws around sex work are associated with HIV prevalence among female sex workers.
Method
We estimate cross-sectional, ecological regression models with data from 27 European countries on HIV prevalence among sex workers from the European Centre for Disease Control; sex-work legislation from the US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and country-specific legal documents; the rule of law and gross-domestic product per capita, adjusted for purchasing power, from the World Bank; and the prevalence of injecting drug use among sex workers. Although data from two countries include male sex workers, the numbers are so small that the findings here essentially pertain to prevalence in female sex workers.
Findings
Countries that have legalised some aspects of sex work (n=17) have significantly lower HIV prevalence among sex workers than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work (n=10; β=–2·09, 95% CI −0·80 to −3·37; p=0·003), even after controlling for the level of economic development (β=–1·86; p=0·038) and the proportion of sex workers who are injecting drug users (−1·93; p=0·026). We found that the relation between sex work policy and HIV among sex workers might be partly moderated by the effectiveness and fairness of enforcement, suggesting legalisation of some aspects of sex work could reduce HIV among sex workers to the greatest extent in countries where enforcement is fair and effective.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that the legalisation of some aspects of sex work might help reduce HIV prevalence in this high-risk group, particularly in countries where the judiciary is effective and fair.",TRUE,FALSE,HIV|legalization|sex work,2018-08-10T14:34:21.863551,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-10T14:34:06.408034,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/citation/,5twqv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9uz7s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/relationships/node/,9uz7s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6d8dbabb82f50019be9b48/,5b6d8dbabb82f50019be9b48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5twqv/,https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-3018(16)30217-X,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5twqv

Drawing on data from the World Health Organization for 62 countries, covering the period 2000–2014, we explore whether economic (risk of expropriation) and health (complete cause of death registries) institutions explain mortality rates and access to healthcare. To identify this relationship, we use settler mortality and the distance of the capital from the nearest major port – factors associated with institutional arrangements – to explain cross-national variation in health outcomes and the universality of health systems. We find that inclusive institutions arrangements – that protect and acknowledge the rights of citizens – are associated with better health outcomes (e.g. lower infant mortality and lower maternal mortality) as well as with better health systems (e.g. more skilled birth attendance and greater immunization).

This article offers the Sociology of the Symbolic Landscape (SSL) as the theoretical solution to the challenge of studying meaning and applying the concept of race within and across contexts. SSL focuses on the relationships between symbolic categories within a context and their positions in the core/periphery distinction. Incorporating insights from Durkheim, Interpretive Sociology, the study of Symbolic Boundaries, Civil Sphere Theory, and Postcolonial Theory, SSL makes it possible to identify and categorize positions, thereby identifying the way meaning acts as a source of constraint and of creative possibilities, and enabling cross-contextual comparison of culture-structures and forms. Through application of SSL to data on categorizations in Sweden, we demonstrate the analytical traction SSL provides. SSL offers a portable understanding of the racial other as “outsider within,” a distinct position of enduring alterity and persistent difference within the symbolic landscape.

The results are predicted by cognitive psychological theories and findings from educational psychology. However, many “bootcamp” (short and intense preparation) type training opportunities – especially train the trainer - have some anecdotal evidence of their success and impact. Data and Software Carpentries (“The Carpentries”) is an organization that offers short/intensive training workshops around the world similar to some of those discussed in the 2017 paper. They train “users” of data and software, and they also train trainers of these users. In their response to this 2017 paper, The Carpentries acknowledge that one point raised in that paper, that training spaced over time is more successful than shorter/more intense training, cannot be circumvented. However, short and intense training is popular, and is sometimes all that is feasible; both their train the user and train the trainer sessions are short and intense. In their response, The Carpentries described their own strategies for achieving more positive outcomes for short and intense training than were described in this 2017 PNAS article. Two of these strategies are: “meet learners where they are” and “explicitly address motivation and self efficacy”. These strategies may not be functioning as well as they could be. To clarify what might be impeding these strategies, this white paper compares and contrasts features of training those who will train others (“train the trainer”) with training for “new users”. These types of programs are short and intense, but differ in fundamental ways. Understanding these differences can be leveraged to improve the outcomes of train the user training; recommendations for doing so is presented. The recommendations are embedded in descriptions of those features of training opportunities that can be leveraged purposefully to promote sustainable learning, even when training is short and intense. It is hoped that the model can support the success of the two Carpentries strategies to promote the achievement of Carpentries goals –and those of all who offer short/intensive training opportunities.",TRUE,FALSE,bootcamps|cognitive psychology|The Carpentries|training|train the trainer|train the user,2018-08-10T09:50:05.174101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-10T09:49:42.356401,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/citation/,jsfe9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xb2ym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/relationships/node/,xb2ym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6cb20752fa4200185bc0fa/,5b6cb20752fa4200185bc0fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jsfe9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jsfe9

This conceptualization is at odds with how ‘revolutionary’ protest often unfolds—protest does not begin life as democratic or revolutionary but grows in a process of positive feedback, incorporating new constituencies and generating new demands. Using an original protest event catalogue for the twenty-nine days of the Tunisian Revolution, alongside survey data, I show that the correlates of protest occurrence and participation change significantly during the uprising. The effect of economic development on protest diffusion reverses sign, while a commitment to democracy is a substantive predictor of protest participation only at its close.

Does common threat unite ethnic groups behind the nation? What explains subethnic heterogeneity in identity responses? Experimental scholarship on conflict and intergroup identity relies on laboratory settings; identifying real-world variation is hindered by the difficulties of conducting social inquiry in wartime. I address this gap by exploiting a unique source of exogenous variation—the fall of Mosul to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham—during the fieldwork for a nationally representative survey in Iraq. I find systematic differences in the identity responses of Sunni and Shi'i Iraqis. While Shi'is cleave to the nation, Sunnis mobilize behind an Arab identity. In tribal areas, however, Sunnis rally behind the nation. Findings are explained with reference to prior attachment and achieved cooperation. Excluded groups are less likely to identify with the nation; but where organization enables interethnic cooperation, wartime mobilization generates national loyalty.",TRUE,FALSE,Conflict|Experiments|Identity|Iraq,2018-08-08T23:49:25.474857,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-08T23:49:10.812203,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/citation/,g247r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6b5aebfed49e001a779c27/,5b6b5aebfed49e001a779c27,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g247r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g247r/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g247r

Implications for Cultural Analysis in Sociology,"In this paper we introduce the idea of the dual process framework (DPF), an interdisciplinary approach to the study of learning, memory, thinking, and action. Departing from the successful reception of Vaisey (2009), we suggest that intradisciplinary debates in sociology regarding the merits of “dual process” formulations can benefit from a better understanding of the theoretical foundations of these models in cognitive and social psychology. We argue that the key is to distinguish the general DPF from more specific applications to particular domains, which we refer to as dual process models (DPMs). We show how different DPMs can be applied to a variety of analytically distinct issues of interest to cultural sociologists beyond specific issues related to morality, such as culture in learning, culture in memory, culture in thinking, and culture in acting processes. We close by outlining the implications of our argument for relevant work in cultural sociology.",TRUE,FALSE,action|cognition|culture|dual process models|learning,2018-08-08T23:49:44.140807,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-08T23:49:23.630316,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/citation/,sx8b6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ma2t4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/relationships/node/,ma2t4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6b2eaefed49e0018778619/,5b6b2eaefed49e0018778619,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx8b6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sx8b6/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0735275116675900,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sx8b6
