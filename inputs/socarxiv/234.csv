Studying South Africa's Marikana massacre, we document how a new opposition party formed as a direct result of violence, quantify significant electoral losses for the incumbent, and show that those losses were driven by voters switching from the incumbent to the new party. Three lessons emerge. First, incumbents who preside over state violence may be held electorally accountable by voters. Second, such accountability seemingly depends on the existence of credible opposition parties that can serve as a vector for disaffected voters. Where such parties do not exist, violence may create political cleavages that facilitate the formalization of opposition movements.

An exception is the evolutionary theory of Heerwagen and Orians, who suggest that humans emotionally respond to flowers because they signal food availability. However, fruits are stronger and more direct signals of food availability than flowers, therefore fruits should elicit stronger emotional responses than flowers. To test the theory, we performed two online studies in Czechia. The participants (n = 3354 and 744 respectively) indicated on a six-point scale their preferences for the photographs of 14 edible Czech plant species (study A) and 20 edible plant species from African savannas (study B), varying in their growth stage (flowering, fruiting). Paired t-tests found no preference for Czech fruiting plants and a strong preference for African flowering plants (p&lt;0.0001, Cohen’s d = 1.24).

To inform that initiative, USAID asked the International Food Policy Research Institute and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service to estimate the impacts of faster productivity growth for 20 food crops on income and other indicators in 106 countries in developing regions in 2030. We first estimated the value of production in 2015 for each crop using data from FAO. We then used the IMPACT and GLOBE economic models to estimate changes in the value of production and changes in economy-wide income under scenarios of faster crop productivity growth, assuming that increased investment will raise annual rates of yield growth by 25% above baseline growth rates over the period 2015-2030. We found that faster productivity growth in rice, wheat and maize increased economy-wide income in the selected countries in 2030 by 59 billion USD, 27 billion USD and 21 billion USD respectively, followed by banana and yams with increases of 9 billion USD each. While these amounts represent small shares of total GDP, they are 2-15 times current public R&amp;D spending on food crops in developing countries. Income increased most in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Faster productivity growth in rice and wheat reduced the population at risk of hunger by 11 million people and 6 million people respectively, followed by plantain and cassava with reductions of about 2 million people each. Changes in adequacy ratios were relatively large for carbohydrates (already in surplus) and relatively small for micronutrients. In general, we found that impacts of faster productivity growth vary widely across crops, regions and outcome indicators, highlighting the importance of identifying the potentially diverse objectives of different decision makers and recognizing possible tradeoffs between objectives.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|developing countries|food security|hunger|income|nutrition|productivity,2020-04-01T14:05:42.725188,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-01T14:05:30.474095,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/citation/,h2g6r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7e6424ec7801002b9cfe7b/,5e7e6424ec7801002b9cfe7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2g6r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h2g6r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h2g6r

We argue that past work has not fully considered the role of racial steering in maintaining segregation. To explore patterns of steering, we use the 2012 Housing Discrimination Study along with Census data on the neighborhood racial and socioeconomic composition of housing units shown to testers. We leverage the experimental design of the audits to examine how neighborhoods of homes shown to auditors change dynamically throughout the search process and to assess the conditions under which steering is most likely. As with past research, we find no evidence of steering in Asian-White or Hispanic-White audits. However, we find consistent evidence that Black testers are steered away from White neighborhoods and toward Blacker ones, particularly for female homeseekers and those with children. We also find that steering occurs relatively early in the search process and is heightened when searches begin in racially-homogenous neighborhoods. These findings support arguments that the steering of Black homeseekers serves as a modest but stubborn mechanism by which segregation is maintained, and highlight the intersectionality of race and gender in determining outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|housing|neighborhoods|race/ethnicity|segregation|urban,2020-03-28T12:33:44.175140,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-28T12:33:17.676449,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/citation/,62q5m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7e372f7190ce013093ba3c/,5e7e372f7190ce013093ba3c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62q5m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/62q5m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/62q5m

While the long-run self (LR) of the decision maker pursues the long-term optimality, the short-run selves (SRs) of the decision maker at different time instants bow to short-term temptations. While the literature began to recognize the importance to strike a balance between LR's and SRs' interests, the existing results are not applicable to situations where the decision maker's preferences involve non-expectation operators. We propose an operable unified two-tier dual-self game model with commitment by punishment, which can cope with general time inconsistent stochastic decision problems with both expectation and non-expectation operators in the objective function. By attaching punishment terms to both the preferences of LR and SRs which quantitatively evaluate the internal conflict among different selves, our game model aligns the interests of the LR and SRs to a certain degree. The equilibrium strategy, termed strategy of self-coordination,  achieves some degree of internal harmony among various selves. We successfully apply the model to the investment and consumption problem with quasi-hyperbolic discounting and the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem.",TRUE,FALSE,commitment by punishment|dual-self game model|strategy of self-coordination|time inconsistency,2020-03-27T12:35:47.296960,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-27T12:35:06.493913,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/citation/,8m5w2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vdzcu/,vdzcu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7dd185c3f8d300e7fa1655/,5e7dd185c3f8d300e7fa1655,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m5w2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8m5w2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8m5w2

In this paper, we propose two econometric models, which integrate three information sources. In GARCH-It\^{o}-OI model, we assume that the option-implied volatility can influence the security's future volatility, and the option-implied volatility is treated as an observable  exogenous variable. In GARCH-It\^{o}-IV model, we assume that the option-implied volatility can not influence the security's volatility directly, and the relationship between the option-implied volatility and the security's volatility is constructed to extract useful information of the underlying security. After providing the quasi-maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters and establishing their asymptotic properties, we also conduct a series of simulation analysis and empirical analysis to compare the proposed models with other popular models in the literature. We find that when the sampling interval of the high-frequency data is 5 minutes, the GARCH-It\^{o}-OI model and GARCH-It\^{o}-IV model has better forecasting performance than other models.",TRUE,FALSE,High-frequency historical data|Low-frequency historical data|Option-implied volatility|Quasi-maximum likelihood estimators,2020-03-27T12:35:03.711861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-27T12:34:45.105235,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/citation/,vdsqf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c6m8e/,c6m8e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7dcd27c3f8d300e7fa069a/,5e7dcd27c3f8d300e7fa069a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdsqf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vdsqf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vdsqf
