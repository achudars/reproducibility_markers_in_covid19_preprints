We need more than new knowledge or policies; we need to consider how our different efforts combine, take on life of their own, and nurture new configurations in a dynamic system. This reframing of Development discourse invites a rethink using design theory and approaches to complexity.

This study asks how properties of the ethnic neighborhood environment in adolescence predict future criminal behavior and educational careers among immigrant youth using rich administrative data from Norway. I find that immigrant youth’s adolescent exposure to better-educated coethnic immigrant neighbors from the same origin country is related to lower risks of criminal engagement, higher likelihoods of completing upper-secondary education, and better academic achievements while growing up in areas with less-educated coethnics is associated with adverse outcomes. These associations are robust to adjustment for a broad set of background characteristics and fixed effects at the level of neighborhoods and national-origin groups. By contrast, the educational characteristics of other immigrant and native majority neighbors during adolescence seems to matter less.

Consequently, there is growing understanding that regional models are needed to support climate and environmental policy making. Such models need to take into account the dynamics of geographical space as well as historic and expected future land use change patterns. One relevant geographical modelling approach is based on cellular automata (CA) which has a prominent track record of successful application to a diverse range of geographical problems. Traditionally, CA models are calibrated to reproduce the footprint of actor decision-making manifested in historical land use dynamics, and then projected forward to explore the effect of the observed dynamics on future periods. However, this is a poor representation of the way the world actually works, since policy decisions reflect current needs and priorities, not historic ones. Such a model cannot help us understand how decision-making actors might respond spontaneously to emerging land use outcomes. For these reasons, we believe there is considerable scope for existing CA-based geographical models to be improved by introducing realistic representations of the dynamic behaviour of decision-making actors. We present a modelling approach which retains the well-attested benefits of CA land use models, but which allows greater flexibility in modelling the dynamic behaviour of actors for particular “policy driven” land uses. To implement our approach, we integrate the APoLUS model (APoLUS stands for Actor, Policy and Land Use Simulator) – an open-source, multi-platform model based on geographical CA – with a system dynamics (SD) model describing the actor dynamics. The SD model is tailored to reproduce the dynamics of interaction (and possible conflicting interests) of a number of aggregate actors that might influence regional development in general and might affect (either in positive or in negative way) the implementation of policy under study in particular. In the present paper, we describe new developments in the actor dynamics model family, progressing beyond earlier work in three key ways: (i) incorporating the 2 possible ‘regime shifts’ that might be related, in particular, to election cycles; (ii) describing in more detail the economic drivers of actor dynamics; (iii) introducing the stochasticity in a SD model.",TRUE,FALSE,actor dynamics|APOLUS|cellular automata|climate adaptation|climate mitigation|climate policy|land-use change|landuse modelling|policy implementation|regime shifts|regional environmental change|system dynamics,2020-07-01T19:37:44.216358,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-01T19:37:17.948260,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/citation/,5wsng,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5efcb700af1156005d3b1e21/,5efcb700af1156005d3b1e21,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wsng/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5wsng/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5wsng

A large literature has documented a positive correlation between divorce and separation among parents and their children. Parental union dissolution is one out of several aspects of social origin that is associated with union dissolution. It is difficult to contrast the relative impact of parental union dissolution to other aspects of social origin because many apects of social origin are unobservable. Swedish administrative data for the 1960 to 1965 birth cohorts that cover the individuals’ life events until 2018 is used to estimate sibling correlations in divorce and childbearing union dissolution, adjusting for parental union dissolution. The variance in union dissolution attributable to factors shared by siblings ranged from 6% to 13%. Parental union dissolution and factors associated with parental union dissolution explained between 15% and 28% of this variance. Sister correlations are greater than brother correlations, and sibling correlations of childbearing union dissolution are higher than sibling correlations of divorce. It is pertinent to estimate the total effect of all social background factors on offspring union dissolution. It is likewise of interest to specify the share of all social background effects that are constituted by factors caused by or correlated specifically with parental union dissolution.

That theory is presupposed to be a consistent text, which can be exhaustedly represented by a certain mathematical structure constructively. In thus used, the term “theory” includes all hypotheses as yet unconfirmed as already rejected. The investigation of the sketch of a possible proof of the principle demonstrates that it should be accepted rather a metamathematical axiom about the relation of mathematics and reality.
Its investigation needs philosophical means. Husserl’s phenomenology is what is used, and then the conception of “bracketing reality” is modelled to generalize Peano arithmetic in its relation to set theory in the foundation of mathematics. The obtained model is equivalent to the generalization of Peano arithmetic by means of replacing the axiom of induction with that of transfinite induction.
A comparison to Mach’s doctrine is used to be revealed the fundamental and philosophical reductionism of Husserl’s phenomenology leading to a kind of Pythagoreanism in the final analysis.
Accepting or rejecting the principle, two kinds of mathematics appear differing from each other by its relation to reality. Accepting the principle, mathematics has to include reality within itself in a kind of Pythagoreanism. These two kinds are called in paper correspondingly Hilbert mathematics and Gödel mathematics. The sketch of the proof of the principle demonstrates that the generalization of Peano arithmetic as above can be interpreted as a model of Hilbert mathematics into Gödel mathematics therefore showing that the former is not less consistent than the latter, and the principle is an independent axiom.
An information interpretation of Hilbert mathematics is involved. It is a kind of ontology of information. Thus the problem which of the two mathematics is more relevant to our being (rather than reality for reality is external only to Gödel mathematics) is discussed.

How does this politicization occur? We consider two pathways. In one, political elites introduce new considerations into an apolitical setting. In the other, public reactions to a formerly non-political entity produce politicization without elite guidance. We use these perspectives to study the origins of politicized attitudes towards ESPN, a major sports media outlet involved in recent controversies where politics and sports intersect. We find evidence politicization is a top-down process driven by political elites. In survey-linked web browsing data and a survey experiment, exposure to political media leads the public to evaluate ESPN in political terms. In contrast, ESPN’s typical sports coverage fails to produce politicization.

We argue that contemporary university policing is shaped by three types of “creep:” the tendency for policing to move into previously unpoliced contexts, take on more expansive roles, and adopt an increasingly aggressive stance—or, carceral creep, mission creep, and conflict creep. We draw on qualitative data from case studies of two schools in the University of California system to ask: How do campus police activities produce risk, both physical and psychological, for racially marginalized individuals? We detail the mechanisms producing risk for racially marginalized individuals in four contemporary campus police activities: routine policing, protecting the conservative provocateur, managing the large student protest, and responding to the active attacker. We show that even when university police and leadership purport best intentions, these activities can create harm for racially marginalized populations on campus.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-07-01T19:41:40.761059,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-01T19:41:17.293767,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",Kelly Nielsen,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/citation/,pe8my,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5efbe133af1156000d3b59c8/,5efbe133af1156000d3b59c8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe8my/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pe8my/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pe8my

The World Health Organization considered vaccine hesitation as one of the greatest threats to global health in 2019. Researchers associated this hesitation to a strengthening of the anti-vaccination movements, suggesting that social media is currently the main spreader of this position. YouTube increasingly becomes a matter of concern, since its recommendation system is identified as a promoter of misinformation and extreme content. Despite YouTube’s statements, misinformation and disinformation (M&amp;D) about vaccines continue to be disseminated in videos in Portuguese, reaching a large audience. We found 52 videos containing M&amp;D about vaccines. The main M&amp;D were the claim of dangerous ingredients in vaccines, the defense of self-direction — freedom of choice, independent research —, the promotion of alternative health services, the myth that vaccines cause diseases, conspiracy theories, and the allegation of vaccine’s severe collateral effects. We identified 39 brands advertising on 13 videos of our M&amp;D sample. Although the YouTube Partner Program is an important source of income, the channels use different economic strategies, such as the selling of courses, and therapies and the use of fundraising platforms. We also found that alternative health channels spread distrust about traditional institutions to promote themselves as trusted sources for the audience and thereby profit with alternative health services.",TRUE,FALSE,Alternative Health|Disinformation|Misinformation|Vaccines|YouTube,2020-07-01T19:42:42.360334,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-01T19:42:26.018800,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://git.io/JJfVK,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/citation/,vtf5r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5efb6997761b2c01ff5c7f07/,5efb6997761b2c01ff5c7f07,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vtf5r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vtf5r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vtf5r

These factors contribute greatly to the intensity of hurricanes and floods they provoke. Projections estimate there will be an increase of 45% to 87% in the frequency of Category &gt;4 hurricanes originating in the Atlantic Basin, which typically impact the Caribbean and Continental United States of America. During the 2019 Hurricane Season, there were 20 depressions, 18 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. Through this work, we explored the response on Social Media to these natural phenomena as a function of their trajectory, intensity, and previous exposure of the population to intense natural disasters. Data was collected through the Twitter API. The influences of hurricane proximity and intensity on volume of Social Media production was explored. Hurricane Dorian, with its trajectory strongly threatening the previously exposed Puerto Rico, and eventually causing widespread damage in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas, presented the strongest case for the evaluation of the dichotomy of responses between populations with differences in previous history of exposure. The landscape of historic hurricane exposure Caribbean has radically changed in recent years.
