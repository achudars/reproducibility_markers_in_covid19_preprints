Audiences lump similar producer into categories in order to facilitate their search process, so that producers who do not fit into one specific category -- or who span multiple categories -- are penalized relative to their single category peers. I present an alternative model of the world in which producers in a market segregate into categories but without any reliance on an audience process: instead categorical boundaries reflect producers' best efforts to explore a complicated marketplace given their limited information about what audiences demand. Categories emerge as a cross-sectional consequence of a dynamic exploration process: At any given time, the world features a mix of high-performing producers within categorical clusters and low-performing producers outside or between them. But spanning positions are more likely to be occupied by entrepreneurial producers, and future categorical clusters emerge from their efforts to explore the terrain. As such any apparent category spanning discount is nothing more than the consequence of bad luck in the process of taking risk.

This concern has two forms. The first arises if the binary model is treated as an estimate of a model for an unobserved continuous response, and the second when models are compared between groups which have different distributions of other causes of the binary response. We argue that these concerns are usually  misplaced. The first of them is only relevant if the  unobserved continuous response is really the subject of substantive interest. If it is, the problem should be addressed through better measurement of this response. The second concern refers to a situation which is  unavoidable but unproblematic, in that causal effects and descriptive associations are inherently group-dependent and can be compared as long as they are correctly estimated.",TRUE,FALSE,Average treatment effects|Latent variables|Logit models|Probit models|Regression modeling,2018-07-02T10:55:47.527142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-07T12:29:07.765832,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/citation/,gwck3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/95zym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/relationships/node/,95zym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e783f2b83f69024f4ff3a7/,58e783f2b83f69024f4ff3a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gwck3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gwck3,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124117747306

While some scholars have documented Congress’ racist past, less is known about the present significance of race in the federal legislature. Throughout the day, African Americans routinely nod to one another in the halls of the Capitol, and consider the Black nod as a common cultural gesture.  However, data from over sixty in-depth interviews suggest there is an additional layer of meaning to the Black nod in Congress. From the microlevel encounters, I observed and examined, I interpret the nod as more than a gesture that occurs in a matter of seconds between colleagues or even among perfect strangers in the halls of Congress. The Black nod encompasses and is shaped by labor organized along racial lines, a history of racial subordination, and powerful perceptions of race in the post-Civil-Rights era on the meso-, and macrolevels. Using this interpretive foundation, this article will show how the nod is an adaptive strategy of Black staffers that renders them visible in an environment where they feel socially invisible. The nod becomes an external expression of their racialized professional identity. I argue that the congressional workplace is a raced political institution and that the microlevel encounters I observed delineate and reproduce its racial boundaries.

Yet, the integration of the four language skills should be always emphasized when  learning any foreign language since this reinforces each other and represents the natural acquisition of the language. The current study aims to examine the effect of an instructional program based on integrating the four language skills on Jordanian undergraduate EFL students' listening comprehension skills and to find out their attitudes regarding the effectiveness of this program on improving their listening skills. In order to collect the data , the researchers used two instruments: pre-post test and an interview. The study is a quasi-experimental one, and the subjects of the study were 61 students from Al Al Bayt University in Jordan. The subjects were divided into two groups: the control one  had 24 students while the experimental one had 37. The findings of the study reveal that there is a significant difference at ( α= 0.05) between the means of the two groups at the listening post-test due to the program.

The researcher claims that multiple intelligences strategies have the potential to provide a suitable resource to empower the quality of TEFL in Jordan.  The study follows a quasi- experimental design in which an experimental group and a control group were purposefully chosen from AzZarqa First Directorate of Education (Jordan). In the experimental group, 30 students were taught by multiple intelligences strategies and 29 students of control group were taught by the conventional teaching method as outlined in the teacher’s book. A pre-post achievement test was utilized. The findings reveal statistically significant differences at (α ≤ 0.05) between the two mean scores of experimental and control groups in the post- test in favor of experimental group. The study recommends to examine the effect of using multiple intelligences on EFL students’ achievement in other language skills and sub skills. A number of implications are put forth to enhance the students’ critical reading ability.",TRUE,FALSE,critical reading|EFL students|multiple intelligences,2018-07-02T10:55:09.783223,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T06:09:20.055040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/citation/,2jkv4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dp3mr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/relationships/node/,dp3mr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5db119ad5a100476bd652/,58e5db119ad5a100476bd652,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jkv4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2jkv4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2jkv4,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.22

Certain folklores deliver narrative to respect and protect nature, either presented literally or symbolically. This study is aimed at identifying and describing Indonesian folklores which contain environmental messages, and investigating the English teachers ' perception of Secondary Schools about the use of Indonesian folklores for their teaching language skills. The study uses qualitative approach focused on content analysis by using mainly documentation instrument. To deepen the analysis, the interview was used to find out whether these folklores are applicable and appropriate for foreign language classes. The result shows that there are 17 Indonesian folklores that present environmental messages either implicitly or explicitly. The messages found in the folklores are firstly, catastrophe happens because of human's greed and misconducts to nature, and secondly it is human himself who can prevent the disaster to happen. Used in foreign language classes, folklore can help the teacher to train the students ' language and communication skills in reading, speaking and writing, at the same time it helps them to build awareness to the protection for the environment, enrich the cultural literacy, cultivate respectful behavior, and train their critical thinking ability.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL Teachers’ perceptions|Environmental messages|Foreign language   teaching|Indonesian folklore,2018-07-02T10:55:09.749963,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T06:06:10.966608,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/citation/,knr69,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/usgj5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/relationships/node/,usgj5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5da3f9ad5a100476bd633/,58e5da3f9ad5a100476bd633,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knr69/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/knr69/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/knr69,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.21

Writing news stories is a problematic process because it is not a process of merely putting words together to form a text or report, but it involves the choice of the words and markers that conditioned by the purpose, place, and the readers. The study aims at proposing a theoretical framework for the macro- level analysis of news discourse. It covers the macro level analysis of the chosen hard news. The data of the study is an English news story taken from Washington Times newspaper published on 20th of August 2016. The results of the study display that English hard news stories show certain complexity in their structure. The writer of this hard news story aims at not only conveying information but arising the voice of protest against the government and the court of justice.
