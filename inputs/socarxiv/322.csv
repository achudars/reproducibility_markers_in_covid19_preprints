Typically, unavoidable suffering is the supreme touchstone in life and literature. Poets used its presence incessantly. They are always conscious of its inevitability. Investigation of this theme gives the reader a panoramic view of vital issues that are unusually linked to some extent with suffering; such as religion, God, nature, love and immortality. In the poems discussed in this study, unavoidable suffering reflects the effect of modern psychology has had upon both literature and literary criticism. The main reflection of suffering which is implied in the characters presented reveal the very contradictions, absurdities and complexities of our life. The poets and novelists chosen in this paper portray suffering, as “an abstract force, in an attempt to come to terms with it as well as to fathom it.” (Gurra, 2019, p.5) In the inexorable quest to comprehend it, poets do not offer a final view of suffering because it remains for them the great unknown mystery. This paper, however, is an attempt to meticulously examine and critically analyze the images of suffering in minor characters presented in selected poems. The selected poems are of Robinson Jeffers, Allen Ginsberg, and Maya Angelou. The characters selected from different novels are minor ones. Characters like: Roger Chiilingworth from The Scarlet Letter (1850), Walter Morel from Sons and Lovers (1913), Zeena Frome from Ethan Frome (1911), and Rezia Warren Smith from Mrs. Dalloway (1925).

These difficulties are especially notable in translations between languages as disparate as Arabic and English, as they come from different language families. The present study aims to understand the strategies required for translating colloquial Egyptian humor into English and highlights the issues involved in the process of this translation. For this purpose, the study selected the book Taxi by Khaled Al Khamissi, as it is composed of 58 fictional monologues of taxi drivers in Cairo. The study highlights the challenges faced in translating colloquial Egyptian humor, along with the cultural differences that hinder its translation. The results show that translation is a major hurdle for culture-based and word-based humor because of cultural and linguistic differences; miscommunication and failure to translate humorous intent are due to lack of knowledge of the source culture. The impact of the humor is not transferred to the target text because a literal translation of word-based humour is not possible. A combination of procedures is used to transfer a humorous effect when translating culture-based humor. The study concludes that universal humour is easier to translate than culture-based humour, as the translator is familiar with the concepts involved.",TRUE,FALSE,colloquial language|Egyptian humor|Khaled Al Khamissi’s Taxi|translation strategies,2019-09-04T02:35:23.773335,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:34:59.520646,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/citation/,quh7t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ee7a8536cf5001a8d10aa/,5d6ee7a8536cf5001a8d10aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/quh7t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/quh7t

The first practitioners of this technique and mode of narrative reportedness are Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, and James Joyce, all of whom are modernist fictional writers who engaged with what previous novelists of the nineteenth century failed to engage with. Woolf observed - in a lecture given to the Cambridge Heretics Society in May 1924 - that: “no generation since the world began has known quite so much about character as our generation”. Woolf’s fiction tends to be psychological, for she experiments with the working of the psyche of her characters and the permanence of the past in the present beyond the reach of realism. Her fiction treats the complex networks of emotions and memories of which the character is the center of the narrative. This paper accordingly, addresses the philosophical background of the Stream of Consciousness and its use within fictional exertion and how the latter is deployed in Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway (1925) to show and uncover the anxieties vis-à-vis her thanatophobia, not only this, but also to express the anxieties of the Great War and the disillusionment towards the modern enterprise.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-04T02:35:44.287166,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:35:24.599529,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/citation/,k23m4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ee6d66f41fc001b35c5b4/,5d6ee6d66f41fc001b35c5b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k23m4/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k23m4

The results obtained are used to argue that these patterns have cohesive, coherent, and aesthetic functions in the target text. To produce a translation that can read as much fluently and naturally as possible, professional translators work painstakingly to domesticate the source text as the magazine, in its Arabic version, is targeting different readership and culture.

For children and young adults, a story is a discursive space where they find answers, solutions, and ideas. Contrastingly, to adult writers, it is a space dedicated to promoting ideological beliefs and values to young readers. Thus, this study attempts to investigate the problematic representation of Arab city and village families found in two children stories written by American author Elsa Marston (1933-2017). She classifies families into two opposing extremes; the civilized city families and the poor, conservative village families. Using Edward Said’s Orientalist discourse analysis, alongside David Spurr’s rhetorical trope of Classification, the researcher explores how and why Jordanian and Egyptian families are classified with disregard to cultural differences. The analysis reveals that Arab families, both Jordanian and Egyptian, are equally classified based on education, social class, and culture. City families are viewed as developed due to their interaction with the west, whereas village families are portrayed as ignorant and uncivilized for their lack of communication with the west. The analysis also detects the author’s negative attitude towards village families.",TRUE,FALSE,children’s literature|colonial enterprise|Egyptian families|Elsa Marston|Jordanian families|orientalism|representation,2019-09-04T02:36:45.689130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:36:28.551575,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/citation/,yqw6v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ee4887215100019a1a3b8/,5d6ee4887215100019a1a3b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yqw6v/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yqw6v

In both short stories, the central characters Louise Mallard and Jane, undergo an essential journey of self-realization, which leads them to finally freeing themselves from patriarchal authority and oppression. Moreover, the paper stresses the impact of the authors as females on their characters’ development throughout that journey. Following the analytical approach within the feminist theory, the article is influenced by two major feminist critiques; Virginia Woolf and Simone De Beauvoir, who believed that women should incorporate their voices into their writings to depict more realistic female characters.

Thus, the colonized country becomes torn between former traditions and newly modern perspectives. In this respect, the focus of this research paper will fall over as it witnessed Western imposition over its society that tried, in its turn, to maintain a traditional lifestyle, while there were attempts for change. Hence, the researcher attempts to shed light on Jordan-as it sways between traditions and imposed reforms- through the literary work of Fadia Ahmed Faqir, whose main motivation resides in the strong messages she conveys in her novel The Cry of the Dove. Thus, the concern of this paper is how far carrying a double identity affects people’s sense of belonging? In this respect, the article introduces a hint of the author’s life embodied in the protagonist Salma, who carries a swaying identity torn between tradition and modernity through her adventures.  Salma moves forward and backward through time, then she- the protagonist-wins a voice in a foreign country and adopts a new standard of living, releasing herself from the cultural boundaries of Jordan. Salma is naïve but loses her original identity while she had an opportunity to be a wife, with her husband who travels to provide for his family. But she flies to Britain rejecting the double life she leads between her traditional and modern habits. As this paper submits, the addressees should depict the impact of living a double identity adopted by a traditional character living in an imposed body and culture.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural boundaries|double identity|social change|tradition vs. modernity|Western reforms|women’s oppression,2019-09-04T02:38:02.877880,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:37:48.953435,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/citation/,bucgx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ee18e6f41fc001b35c108/,5d6ee18e6f41fc001b35c108,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bucgx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bucgx/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bucgx

The tools are on an increasing demand. Translators need to equip themselves with the knowledge and the mastering of these tools. This study explores two machine translation tools involved in website localization. These tools are Alchemy Catalyst and Trados Tageditor. The study adopts an evaluative methodology to shed light on the intricacies and technicalities of these two localization tools. It discusses some of the cultural issues that localizers come across in the process of localization. In addition, it delves into the technical issues, mainly focusing on localizing into Arabic with a special focus on string, text, lexis, and orthography. The study concludes that the process of localization requires teamwork and involvement of computer engineers, and both localization tools are valuable in achieving a localization task.",TRUE,FALSE,Alchemy Catalyst|Arabic|localization|machine translation|Trados,2019-09-04T02:38:44.235807,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:38:26.304144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/citation/,ez35r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ee0b87215100019a1a103/,5d6ee0b87215100019a1a103,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez35r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ez35r/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ez35r
