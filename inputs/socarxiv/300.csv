The Case of Convertible Bonds,"This paper argues that the reduced-form jump diffusion model may not be appropriate for credit risk modeling. To correctly value hybrid defaultable financial instruments, e.g., convertible bonds, we present a new framework that relies on the probability distribution of a default jump rather than the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement in the underlying stock price.",TRUE,FALSE,asset pricing|convertible arbitrage|convertible bond|convertible underpricing|credit risk modeling|default probability approach|default time approach|jump diffusion,2019-10-14T22:11:42.196388,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-14T22:11:33.239369,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/citation/,zr7hp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da499f7f6b03e001020852f/,5da499f7f6b03e001020852f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zr7hp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zr7hp,NA

Informed by both life course and biographical perspectives, our research design comprised two interviews incorporating recursive co-construction of the participantâ€™s lifeline. We aimed to meet three objectives with this method: (1) to collect accurate retrospective data about the timing of lives; (2) to garner biographical data that allowed us to explore lives as wholes; and (3) to elicit participant reflexivity on turning points associated with resilience.  Our approach was distinctive in its explicit use of the lifeline both as a means to bring life stories into dialogue with life histories, and as a dynamic prompt to engage participants in the reflexive co-construction of turning points as fateful moments. We illustrate our approach through a case presentation and analysis of the reflexive lifelines co-constructed with two men who participated in our study.

We show that adding a legislator improves education and health care. However, the results prove true for the services that are believed to be highly salient to voters, are easiest to claim credit for, and are easy to provide. In this sense, education quality and preventive health care remain unaffected while infant mortality and primary school enrollment significantly improve.

A matter of lacking social integration or pressure from significant others?,"In most European countries, the choice of college majors is highly segregated by gender. Only a small amount of students enrolls in a gender atypical major. Previous studies indicated that these students may have a higher attrition rate than their counterparts in gender typical majors. In this paper, I investigated whether this higher attrition rate is caused by lower levels of social integration and pressure from significant others. I built a synthesis of Tintoâ€™s model of student drop out and Kanterâ€™s theory of tokenism and drew on theories of comparative reference groups to test these hypotheses. Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study, which follows undergraduate students who enrolled in 2010, I conducted discrete time survival analysis. I found that men and women in gender atypical majors have a higher risk to switch to a more gender balanced major and â€“ only for women - to drop out than students in gender typical majors. Low levels of social integration and disapproval of the major by significant others increase the attrition risk. However, these two aspects do not contribute to the explanation of the higher attrition risk of students in gender atypical majors.

How the system ought to be changed, however, remains unclear. This paper briefly reviews candidate models for electoral reform from other nations, before putting forward the parsimonious mixed-member (PMM) model. This model was inspired by the mixed-member (MM) proportional representation system, as currently used in, for example, Germany. It is 'parsimonious', however, in the sense that the number of additional MPs brought into parliament to reach proportionality is minimized. Like traditional MM, PMM preserves the individual relationship between every voter and an MP, and it eliminates under-representation of parties. Unlike traditional MM, however, it also preserves the incentive for parties to win local races, it avoids unnecessary dilution of constituency representatives, and it avoids misattributing spoiled ballots to major parties. As such, it can be thought of as an optimization of MM. A key feature of this model is conservatism -it modifies our existing system with the minimal set of changes necessary to resolve the most obvious problems in the current system, without creating new ones.

It is meant for those who are less familiar with SEM but interested in panel data analysis as well as those familiar with SEM but new to fixed-effects regression. It demonstrates the decomposition of observed variables into within- and between-unit variance components using latent variables and gives an intuitive least squares-based explanation of latent variable estimation. The estimation of the substantive effect coefficients is shown analytically. The procedure is demonstrated on simulated as well as real-world data using the German Family Panel Survey (pairfam). The example analyses show the SEM results are identical to the conventional methods of pooled ordinary least squares on demeaned data. The supplementary materials provide the model code for use in replication and further study.,TRUE,FALSE,fixed effects regression|panel data analysis|structural equation modeling|unobserved heterogeneity,2019-10-11T14:27:21.910137,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T14:26:33.604444,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/citation/,nfqp4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vy763/,vy763,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da03cb5f6b03e00101d2a9d/,5da03cb5f6b03e00101d2a9d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfqp4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nfqp4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nfqp4,NA
