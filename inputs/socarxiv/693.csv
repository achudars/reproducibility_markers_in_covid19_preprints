eBay should apply to trademark cases. But it must be applied with
sensitivity to the very different contexts of patent and trademark. Doing
so will make it more likely that trademark owners will obtain injunctions

intense debate within modern financial markets. An activity entailing the
fraudulent creation of orders to buy and sell securities with the purpose
of manipulating the market, spoofing highlights the multiple and complex
moral valences of contemporary, automated, finance. In this paper, I study
spoofing as an opportunity to understand markets and their relations of
exchange. In particular, by extending Weberian metaphors of markets as
moral and organizational communities, I examine how the courts and market
participants distinguish the ‘false’ transactions of spoofing from the
‘real’ exchanges of 'normal' market behavior. Combining Marilyn Strathern’s
theoretical discussion of the anthropological relation with recent
literatures on infrastructures and markets, I argue that the perceived
reality of transactions is a product of how novel forms of economic
knowledge are able to make sense of ‘taken for granted’ behavioral patterns
within digital platforms of market action. The intent that constitutes
‘real’ trades is therefore a product of how market participants, economic
experts and the courts interpret the operational underbelly of markets and

public interest in testing the validity of patents, weeding out patents
that should not have been issued. But there is one important group of
people the law systematically prevents from challenging bad patents.
Curiously, it is the very group patent law is supposed to support:
inventors themselves. The century-old doctrine of assignor estoppel
precludes inventors who file patent applications from later challenging the
validity or enforceability of the patents they receive. The stated
rationale for assignor estoppel is that it would be unfair to allow the
inventor to benefit from obtaining a patent and later change her tune and
attack the patent when it benefits her to do so. The Supreme Court has
traditionally disfavored the doctrine, reading it narrowly. But the Federal
Circuit has expanded the doctrine in a variety of dimensions, and applied
it even when the benefit to the inventor is illusory. Further, the doctrine
misunderstands the role of inventor-employees in the modern world.

More important, the expansive modern form of assignor estoppel interferes
substantially with employee mobility. Inventors as a class are put under
burdens that we apply to no other employee. If they start a company, or
even go to work for an existing company in the same field, they will not be
able to defend a patent suit from their old employer. The result is a sort
of partial noncompete clause, one imposed without even the fiction of
agreement and one that binds anyone the inventor comes in contact with
after leaving the job. Abundant evidence suggests that noncompetes in
general retard innovation and economic growth, and several states prohibit
them outright, while all others limit them. But assignor estoppel is a
federal law doctrine that overrides those state choices.

It is time to rethink the doctrine of assignor estoppel. I describe the
doctrine, its rationale, and how it has expanded dramatically in the past
25 years. I argue that the doctrine is out of touch with the realities of
both modern inventing and modern patent law, and that it interferes with
both the invalidation of bad patents and the goal of employee mobility.
Should the Supreme Court take up the doctrine, it is unlikely to survive in
its current form. Rather, it should – and will – return to its much more
limited roots.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:22.869970,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T22:28:00.745000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/citation/,azgkh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pxsp9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/relationships/node/,pxsp9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c8ab726c613b01f411a91a/,57c8ab726c613b01f411a91a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azgkh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/azgkh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/azgkh

copyrights have lined up with the “narrow constructionists,” engaging in
“analytic dissection” of computer programs in order to determine whether
any copyrightable expression has actually been copied. Most commonly, this
analytic dissection has taken the form of the
“abstraction-filtration-comparison” test set forth in Computer Associates
v. Altai. While there are still a few courts in which the “total concept
and feel” approach remains the law, the approach is moribund: since Altai
was decided, no court has endorsed the broader “total concept and feel”
approach.

Rather than ending, the debate over software copyright law appears to be
shifting its focus. Having finally resolved the debate that has been
plaguing software copyright law since its inception, courts are discovering
to their chagrin, that deciding what test to apply actually tells you very
little about how to apply that test. Despite the convergence of courts on
Altai's filtration approach, courts remain fundamentally conflicted in
deciding how broadly to protect software copyright. Further, there remains
a good deal of misunderstanding about what exactly it means to “abstract”
and “filter” a computer program.

I suggest a unified approach to evaluating non-literal infringement in
software copyright cases. This approach focuses on exactly what is alleged
to have been copied. It also acknowledges the increasing role of patent law
in protecting computer software, and the role of other copyright concerns
such as compatibility and fair use. The result of this unified approach is
to provide relatively narrow copyright protection for computer programs in
most cases of non-literal infringement.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:07.838815,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T22:25:34.667000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/citation/,sd7h9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h2xq6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/relationships/node/,h2xq6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c8aae49ad5a101f4f26e16/,57c8aae49ad5a101f4f26e16,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sd7h9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sd7h9

is pretty good evidence that it wasn’t obvious. But the law also says that
if it is obvious to try to make something, and if those who might try would
expect to succeed, making that thing is not patentable. It’s just the
ordinary work we expect of scientists.

These two doctrines can conflict. What if it is obvious to try something,
but actually trying it leads to unexpected results? This actually happens
with some frequency, particularly in the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries, where researchers are motivated to try various standard
modifications of known chemicals but where the unpredictability of the art
means that they can expect to be surprised by what they learn from time to
time.

When these two legal doctrines conflict, the doctrine of unexpected results
must give way. Obviousness is based on the idea that we should not give a
patent if ordinary scientists could have gotten to the result without the
encouragement of that patent. If researchers of ordinary skill were already
motivated to try a new variation, and correctly expected that they would
succeed, actually trying the new variation is normal science, not the
extraordinary skill or insight required for invention. And if scientists
would have created the new variation in the ordinary course of their
duties, they would of necessity have stumbled upon the unexpected results.
Normal science, not the incentive of a patent, led them to that course, so
the invention is not patentable.

This result may alarm patent owners in the pharmaceutical industries, who
have been obtaining patents for this sort of normal experimentation for
years. But I think it is required by the Supreme Court’s decision in KSR,
which held that an invention was not patentable if it was obvious to try.
And while pharmaceutical patent owners may lament the loss of these
patents, the rest of the world may not. Patents likely to be affected by
