The main findings of the report are: (1) Children of similar cognitive ability have very different chances of educational success, depending on their parents’ economic, socio-cultural and educational resources; (2) For children born in the early 1990s, parents’ economic resources are somewhat less important while parents’ socio-cultural and educational resources are more important in affecting their educational attainment than for children born in the late 1950s or the early 1970s; (3) About half of the difference in educational attainment between children from advantaged and disadvantaged parental backgrounds is due to a difference in their cognitive ability, while the other half is due to other factors. (4) Obtaining formal qualifications is only one channel for upward mobility for high- ability individuals of disadvantaged backgrounds; there are other channels that are more directly related to cognitive ability, such as job training programmes, promotions or becoming self-employed in higher-level occupations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-07T23:01:21.881540,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-07T23:01:08.602618,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/citation/,wtxn6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e14651a7545840203fa037d/,5e14651a7545840203fa037d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wtxn6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wtxn6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wtxn6,NA

From our framework, one can derive both a narrow definition of the gig economy as ex ante specified, paid tasks carried out by independent contractors mediated by online platforms, and broader definitions that include offline next to online intermediation, employees next to independent contractors, unpaid tasks next to paid tasks, and asset sharing next to performing gigs. The four dimensions also span four key regulatory questions: how should online platforms be classified and regulated, how should gig workers be classified and regulated, what should count as paid and unpaid work, and should we treat earnings from performing gigs different from earnings from sharing assets. We conclude that the positions taken on these regulatory issues are essentially contingent upon political choices, which will determine how the gig economy will evolve in the future.",TRUE,FALSE,gig economy|labour|pay|platform economy|regulation|sharing economy,2020-01-07T23:00:21.893145,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-07T23:00:03.389245,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Nikos Koutsimpogiorgos|Jaap van Slageren|Andrea Herrmann|Koen Frenken,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/citation/,jmqyt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e13568857341901c3805d19/,5e13568857341901c3805d19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jmqyt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jmqyt,NA

On the one hand, because individuals in similar field positions are also imposed with similar cultural orientations, cultural homophily reproduces ‘objective’ field structure in intersubjective social network ties. On the other hand, fields are operative in practice and to accomplish pragmatic goals individuals who occupy different field positions often join in groups, creatively reinterpret the field-imposed cultural orientations, and produce cultural similarities alternative to the position-specific ones. Drawing on these emergent similarities, the cultural homophily mechanism might stimulate social network ties between members who occupy not the same but different field positions, thus contesting fields. I examine this ambivalent role of cultural homophily in two creative collectives, each embracing members positioned closer to the opposite poles of the field of cultural production. I find different types of cultural similarities to affect different types of social network ties within and between the field positions: Similarity of vocabularies stimulates friendship and collaboration ties within positions, thus reproducing the field, while affiliation with the same cultural structures stimulates collaboration ties between positions, thus contesting the field. The latter effect is visible under statistical analysis of ethnographic data, but easy to oversee in qualitative analysis of texts because informants tend to flag conformity to their positions in their explicit statements.

Unlike typical approaches where sociologists investigate environmental inequality as it exists in the present, climate change hazards are known to compound over time, worsening in the future. Although the current demographic characteristics of the U.S. are known, here we account for the anticipated demographic changes likely to occur this century that could substantially compound climate inequality in the U.S. We use sea-level rise as an example of compounding environmental risk to uncover the magnitude of future inequalities. Specifically, we analyze how climate change may amplify inequalities in the future by disproportionately impacting presently vulnerable groups (e.g., by race, sex, and age). We find that communities of color and the elderly will face intensified impacts of sea-level rise by the end of the century. These processes of environmental inequality formation would go undetected using current, rather than projected, demographic data. Our results suggest climate change will continue to develop as a source of inequality this century and beyond, transmitting inequality across time and saddling future generations with environmental and social disadvantage. Our results, therefore, represent an important new approach to predict inequality formation in the distant future.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|demographic shift|environmental justice|racial inequality|sea level rise|vulnerable populations,2020-01-06T04:18:23.022561,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-06T04:18:06.692126,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/citation/,7jtrn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1232e3573419014b806271/,5e1232e3573419014b806271,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jtrn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jtrn,NA

Studies to date primarily focus on cultural similarities in interpersonal dyads driven by principles such as homophily and contagion. We aim to extend these principles for socio-cultural networks and investigate potentially competing micro-principles that generate these networks, taking into account not only direct dyadic overlap between interpersonal ties and cultural structures, but also the indirect interplay between the social and the cultural. 
Methodology: The empirical analysis utilizes social and semantic network data gathered through ethnographic studies of five creative organizations around Europe. We apply exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for multiplex networks to model the simultaneous operation of several generative principles of socio-cultural structuring yielding multiplex dyads and triads that combine interpersonal ties with meaning sharing links. 
Findings: The results suggest that in addition to the direct overlap of shared meanings and interpersonal ties, socio-cultural structure formation is also affected by extra-dyadic links. Namely, expressive interpersonal ties with common third persons condition meaning sharing between individuals, while meaning sharing with common alters leads to interpersonal collaborations. Beyond dyads, the dual ordering of the social and the cultural thus operates as asymmetrical with regard to different types of interpersonal ties. 
Research implications: The paper shows that in addition to direct dyadic overlap, network ties with third parties play an important role for the co-constitution of the social and the cultural. Moreover, we highlight that the concept of network multiplexity can be extended beyond its application social networks to investigate competing micro-principles guiding the interplay of social and cultural structures.",TRUE,FALSE,creative organization|exponential random graph model|semantic network|social and cultural duality|social network,2020-01-06T20:48:02.538431,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-06T20:46:33.913489,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/citation/,xpf76,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e122c43573419014b805bf0/,5e122c43573419014b805bf0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xpf76/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xpf76,NA

Prominent political institutions crafted principles for the ‘ethical being’ of the AI companies while tech giants were documenting ethics in a series of self-written guidelines. In parallel, a large community started to flourish, focusing on how to technically embed ethical parameters into algorithmic systems. Founded upon the philosophical work of Simone de Beauvoir and JeanPaul Sartre, this paper explores the philosophical antinomies of the ‘AI Ethics’ debate as well as the conceptual disorientation of the ‘fairness discussion’. By bringing the philosophy of existentialism to the dialogue, this paper attempts to challenge the dialectical monopoly of utilitarianism and sheds fresh light on the -already glaring- AI arena. Why is ‘the AI Ethics guidelines’ a futile battle doomed to dangerous abstraction? How this battle can harm our sense of collective freedom? Which is the uncomfortable reality that remains obscured by the smokegas of the ‘AI Ethics’ discussion? And eventually, what’s the alternative? There seems to be a different pathway for discussing and implementing ethics; A pathway that sets the freedom of others at the epicenter of the battle for a sustainable and open to all future.",TRUE,FALSE,artificial intelligence|ethics|philosophy|technology,2020-01-06T04:17:05.420197,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-06T04:16:40.864770,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/citation/,3xzaf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e11bd6c7545840115fa47d6/,5e11bd6c7545840115fa47d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xzaf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3xzaf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3xzaf,https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3373152
