It has been suggested that to do this effectively will require partnerships between Engineering scholars and psychologists, education researchers, including other social scientists. The formation of such partnerships is particularly important when considering the introduction of business-related skills into engineering curriculum designed to prepare 21st Century Engineering Students for workplace challenges. In order to encourage scholars beyond Engineering to engage with EER, it is necessary to provide an introduction to the complexities of EER.

With this aim in mind, this paper provides an outline review of what is considered ‘rigorous’ research from an EER perspective as well as highlighting some of the core methodological traditions of EER.

Developing Agile Digital Skills for Future Practice,"Engineering managers are progressively tasked with leveraging digital technologies and innovations which have yet to be fully developed, to seek out opportunities and challenges in complex project contexts. However, there is a disparity between knowledge gained from engineering development programmes, and the rapidly changing landscape of modern project practice, which requires professionals to effectively engage and deploy relevant agile digital skills in practice. For example, complex engineering projects increasingly employ dynamic digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR / VR), 3D Printing, and Digital Twins, which require managers to quickly adapt to changing constraints through agile digital skills. Therefore, this paper seeks to focus on exploring the role of engineering project management programmes in developing knowledge and agile digital skills relevant for future project practice. Through an outline review of project management development programmes, this research paper suggests that their inherent value for engineering project managers, is largely dependent on a combination of applied research, engagement, and agile digital skills development for future practice.",TRUE,FALSE,3D Printing|Agile|AI|Artificial Intelligence|Augmented Reality|Big Data|Digital|Digital Skills|Digital Twins|Engineering|Engineering Manager|Innovation|Project Management|Project Manager|Technology|Virtual Reality,2021-03-26T16:59:03.184500,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-26T16:58:36.040552,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/citation/,4b2gs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605cf9337ae1960024acde95/,605cf9337ae1960024acde95,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4b2gs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4b2gs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4b2gs

Income Inequality, Concentration, and Socialism in Late 19th Century Germany","We study the dynamics of income inequality, capital concentration, and voting outcomes before 1914. Based on new panel data for Prussian counties and districts we re-evaluate the key economic debate between Marxists and their critics before 1914. We show that the increase in inequality was strongly correlated with a rising capital share, as predicted by Marxists at the time. In contrast, rising capital concentration was not associated with increasing income inequality. Relying on new sector×county data, we show that increasing strike activity worked as an offsetting factor. Similarly, the socialists did not directly benefit from rising inequality at the polls, but from the activity of trade unions. Overall, we find evidence for a rise in the bargaining power of workers, which limited the increase in inequality before 1914.

In this review, we analyze the ways in which social processes have been integrated into Marxan, a spatially explicit reserve design planning tool.  Drawing on 89 peer-reviewed articles published 2005-2020, we analyze the ways in which human activity, values, and processes are spatialized in the environment; something we call socialscape ecology.  To quantify this, we used nine categories including three count categories (social costs, targets, and parameters) and six rank categories (reliance on proxies versus direct observation, integration of temporal change, inclusion of sea tenure, analysis across scale, provisioning analysis, and stakeholder participation).  We show that remarkably little change occurred over time across eight of the nine categories. One exception to this was an increase in number of studies that integrated temporal variation in their analysis.  Ultimately, we argue that greater attention to and integration of social processes and variables into Marxan will improve marine managers’ understanding of not only the ecological but also the social, cultural and political processes that influence the social and ecological success of marine conservation efforts.",TRUE,FALSE,marine protectred area|marine spatial planning|marxan|socio-ecological,2021-03-25T16:26:42.092130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-25T16:26:16.310065,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Baker-Medard_etal_Socialscape_ecology_references_xlsx/14308319,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/citation/,m2kqa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r8as4/,r8as4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605caa29e12b600093aad801/,605caa29e12b600093aad801,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m2kqa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m2kqa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m2kqa

The impact of the ""disk crisis"" on ""ordinary musicians"" income: The case of French speaking Switzerland","The so called ""disk-crisis"" and the rise of music digitization and/or music piracy regularly make the headlines of general and specialized newspapers. The impacts of these metamorphoses on the more visible actors of the national musical industries are relatively well documented. Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of these changes on the musicians’ incomes – especially the ""ordinary"" ones, who are located at the intermediary and the bottom stages of the professional hierarchy. This paper aims to contribute to better understanding the extent to which digitization reshaped the ways these little-known musicians make a living from music. To do so, we use longitudinal data collected from a sample of musicians active in the French-speaking part of Switzerland in the early 2010’s. These data mainly consist of life calendar-data, with retrospective information on income sources for every year of the career – from the first gig played in public to 2013. Crossing sequence analysis and geometrical data analysis tools, we analyze whether or not digitization spurred a career reorientation to one of two major ""poles"" structuring the ""ordinary musicians"" professional space (the ""artist"" pole or the ""craftsman"" one). We show that changes are few. Nevertheless, we point out how social origin and gender impact these potential career re-orientations. More broadly, our paper points to the need to analyze the social conditions of appropriability of technological innovations - especially when it comes to symbolic goods.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-25T12:07:05.403762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-25T12:06:40.046569,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/citation/,cxgh8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4kdvt/,4kdvt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605c6dc7e12b60006eaa9f06/,605c6dc7e12b60006eaa9f06,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxgh8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cxgh8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cxgh8

The use of Momentum in Labour’s 2017 General Election Facebook campaign,"Satellite campaigns have been discussed as core parts of parties online campaigns. However, study is needed to understand the specifics of what satellite campaigns are, where they fit and how they are used as part of parties’ social media election campaigns. This article comparatively examines Facebook pages across the 2017 general election; Momentum, Labour Party page and Labour leader page information and participation content is comparatively investigated to understand what sets satellite campaigning apart. Findings show that Labour had generated a Facebook approach termed ‘Janus-faced campaigning’. Labour was using leader, party and satellite pages with diverse approaches to speak to different audiences, thus presenting different faces of the same party to the public. The party engaged in two core forms of approach. The 'traditional Facebook campaign' via the leader and party page, saw the party using core policy messages, open inclusive rhetoric and a focus on information over participation to campaign to the mass public. This approach was supported by what is termed the 'new methods Facebook campaign'. Here, satellite page Momentum focused equally on participation and information, using novel, partisan and divisive content, large amounts of leadership personalisation and humour, to activate a younger more partisan audience and get them campaigning online and offline. The group treated their online audience as a reservoir of potential offline campaign activism, breaking down the barriers between ‘official’ and ‘virtual members’. This multifaceted approach allowed Labour to engage in different strands of organic communications, campaigning to (and through) different audiences in the most effective manner.",TRUE,FALSE,2017 general election|communications|content analysis|digital campaign|digital campaigning|digital communications|digital politics|e-campaigning|election campaigning|facebook campaigning|facebook leader page|facebook party page|facebook politics|janus-faced campaigning|jeremy corbyn|labour party|momentum|online campaigns|platform campaigning|political campaigns|satellite campaigning|satellite page|social media campaigning|social media content analysis|social media election|social network analysis|social network campaign|traditional facebook campaign|uk politics,2021-03-25T10:14:00.975766,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-25T10:13:40.154640,FALSE,NA,no,The raw coded data is not included as it is being used to generate other works at the moment.

The analysis captured five major themes in the discussion over SOM: illegality, art, promoting pedophilia, increase in offending and general harmfulness. Furthermore, the discussion was underscored by the central question of who is a minor, which feeds the already problematic definitional ambiguity and keeps the perceived discursive boundaries of the illegality of SOM in flux. Current study adds to the existing literature by presenting information that could be useful in designing prevention and awareness efforts addressing SOM and CSAM, particularly to the general public.",TRUE,FALSE,child sexual abuse|child sexual abuse material|child sexual exploitation|CSA|deepfake|deep-fake|hentai|qualitative|reddit|sexualization|sexualization of minors,2021-03-25T10:02:42.396010,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-25T10:02:22.724253,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1f|Law|Juvenile Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c35|Law|Sexuality and the Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/citation/,6wuhj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605becbe1a175b004644ebb1/,605becbe1a175b004644ebb1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wuhj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6wuhj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6wuhj
