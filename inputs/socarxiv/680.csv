However, life expectancy at birth is more easily communicated and understood by the public. By properly situating climate change mortality within the contexts of life expectancy, we better represent the cost of climate change on longevity. In this paper, we convert excess mortality estimates due to increases in extreme weather from climate change into potential reductions in life expectancy at birth in thirty-one European countries. We project climate change extremes to reduce life expectancy at birth by 0.24 years for the average European country with differences in excess of 1.0 years in some countries by the end of the century. We only estimate the impact of mortality directly related to climate extremes, making our estimates conservative. Thus, the cost of inaction on climate change could approach, and likely to exceed, one year of life in some European countries.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|demography|europe|life expectancy|mortality|public health,2018-07-02T11:06:52.422881,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-18T15:21:08.536206,NA,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/mathewhauer/cc-lifeexpectancy-replication,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",Mathew E.

Building on the qualitative findings, we conduct a lab study to examine how racial minority job seekers change their résumés in response to different job postings. Results show that when targeting an employer that presents itself as valuing diversity, minority job applicants engage in relatively little résumé whitening and thus submit more racially transparent résumés. Yet our audit study of how employers respond to whitened and unwhitened résumés shows that organizational diversity statements are not actually associated with reduced discrimination against unwhitened résumés. Taken together, these findings suggest a paradox: minorities may be particularly likely to experience disadvantage when they apply to ostensibly pro-diversity employers. These findings illuminate the role of racial concealment and transparency in modern labor markets and point to an important interplay between the self-presentation of employers and the self-presentation of job seekers in shaping economic inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|diversity|diversity statements|employment|hiring|race|whitening,2018-07-02T11:06:49.243205,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-16T13:13:44.191265,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Sonia Kang|Katherine DeCelles|András Tilcsik|Sora Jun,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/citation/,6p2r4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m9b6a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/relationships/node/,m9b6a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5994426a9ad5a10255569e68/,5994426a9ad5a10255569e68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6p2r4/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839216639577,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6p2r4

While much social network analysis focuses on static relationships between actors, there is also a rich tradition of work extending back to foundational studies in network science focused on the notion that network change is an indelible aspect of social life for human and non-human actors alike (e.g., Bott, 1957; Heider, 1946; Newcomb 1961; Rapoport, 1949; Sampson, 1969).

I argue that the structural analysis method first developed by French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss provides a powerful tool to deconstruct and critique sociological theories. I propose that this method can be used to redefine certain theories not as sets of proposals from which testable hypotheses are to be derived, but rather as different versions of foundational narratives of Western society. Viewed in this way, sociological theorizing contributes to construct the Western cosmology – the body of tales and narratives that explain the creation of the social world, its relationship with nature, and its future direction.
As a case in point, I argue that the narrative of ecological modernization can thus be analyzed and deconstructed using the same tools Lévi-Strauss uses to make sense of native American cosmologies. Doing so, I find that the narrative of ecological modernization developed as a mirror image of older tales of modernization, closely associated with the myth of progress – according to which Western society emerged from a state of nature in which no rational division of labour and no private property existed. This inversion transforms the myth of creation at the heart of the modern Western cosmology into a utopian narrative that finds considerable political traction with a certain part of the business elite and associated organic intellectuals, interested in maintaining existing relations of production and power.",TRUE,FALSE,Ecological modernization|Environmental sociology|Myth|Nature|Sociological theory,2018-07-02T11:06:47.652759,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-14T21:48:22.885636,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/citation/,3pwab,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5qthx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/relationships/node/,5qthx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59921a20b83f6902730ec5cc/,59921a20b83f6902730ec5cc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pwab/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pwab

First, I’ll situate the case in theories on interracial love and marriage. Second, I outline my data and analytic approach. Following this, I focus on my findings. I show how the women talked about the base through the lens of childhood nostalgia. This is important to understand to contextualize their views of US servicemen and provide the backdrop from which these relationships were formed. Next, I show how they draw on love myths to frame their relationships and draw symbolic boundaries around their own relationship and others that may seem similar.  Finally, I discuss how they further embraced their familial roles of wife and mother. Being legally or informally married to a US serviceman shapes a woman’s role in her family. Their childhood memories and current conceptions of motherhood and as a wife are interconnected with how they see their relationships with these men.",TRUE,FALSE,Interracial marriage|Military|Philippines,2018-07-02T11:06:47.543299,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-14T14:59:59.358782,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,Victoria Reyes,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/citation/,nufgj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tkfs2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/relationships/node/,tkfs2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5991ba696c613b0258f46a9b/,5991ba696c613b0258f46a9b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nufgj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nufgj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nufgj

Such analytical strategies, exemplified here by field theoretical approaches, center art objects and their movements in and across markets, where binaristic visions of art worlds do offer significant leverage. But when the analyst moves away from markets for art objects and looks to artistic practices the binaristic lens provides, at best, a blurred image with meaningful blind spots. This article suggests an alternative vision of artistic practice – one based on gravity rather than polarity – that captures the ways individuals and their actions make sense in a specific universe of meaning without forcing them into fundamentally competitive and economistic relationships. It leverages findings enabled by a unique sampling strategy in a four year study of visual artists in the United States to illuminate some limitations of binary theoretical frameworks, and outlines a generative alternative to dualism that promotes new analytical and theoretical directions for sociological analyses of artists and artistic practice. This alternative model provides new leverage on three persistent issues in analyses of artistic work: cultural change in occupational fields; actors’ attempts to manage overlapping but incommensurate forms of recognition, reputation, attention, and success; the persistent hegemony of markets for objects in both vernacular and sociological understandings of artistic practice; and questions of visibility and legitimacy central to understanding boundary formation and boundary work in creative fields. The gravitational metaphor promotes a distict set of strategies for the study of artistic work as well as other nontraditional occupations.",TRUE,FALSE,#socarxiv,2018-07-02T11:06:47.315221,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-13T18:06:42.700061,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cab|Arts and Humanities|Fine Arts|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cca|Arts and Humanities|Art Practice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/citation/,h3esx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5fyas/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/relationships/node/,5fyas,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599093b16c613b025af43a62/,599093b16c613b025af43a62,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h3esx/,https://doi.org/10.3384/cu.2000.1525.191217a,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h3esx

On college campuses, this pressure has been formalized into affirmative consent policies that require all students to actively seek consent from their sexual partners through unambiguous verbal or physical signals. This study uses data from 25 semi-structured interviews to explore how undergraduate men make sense of sexual consent after cultural and organizational pressure to be more proactive in preventing sexual assault. Participants answered questions about their recent sexual experiences and their attitudes toward campus sexual consent policies. Findings indicate that while participants understand and condone key elements of sexual consent, they do not consistently apply reliable strategies to ensure that their sexual interactions are consensual. Instead, they use ambiguous social cues that are common in both consensual and nonconsensual sexual interactions, which reinforce the cultural notion that consent is unclear.",TRUE,FALSE,college|consent|masculinity|sexual assault|sexual scripts|sexual signals|young men,2018-07-02T11:06:47.201466,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-12T16:21:58.410231,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Nicole Bedera,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/citation/,eqfya,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7329k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/relationships/node/,7329k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598f2a5e9ad5a100474fa055/,598f2a5e9ad5a100474fa055,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqfya/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eqfya/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eqfya
