Experiments that randomize populations to treatment and control conditions are the “gold standard” for causal inference. We identify, describe, and analyze the problem posed by *transformative treatments*. Such treatments radically change treated individuals in a way that creates a mismatch in populations, but this mismatch is not empirically detectable at the level of counterfactual dependence. In such cases, the identification of causal pathways is underdetermined in a previously unrecognized way. Moreover, if the treatment is indeed transformative it breaks the inferential structure of the experimental design. Transformative treatments are not curiosities or “corner cases”, but are plausible mechanisms in a large class of events of theoretical interest, particularly ones where deliberate randomization is impractical and quasi-experimental designs are sought instead. They cast long-running debates about treatment and selection effects in a new light, and raise new methodological challenges.",TRUE,FALSE,Causation|Counterfactuals|Experiments|Philosophy|RCT|Social Theory|Transformative|Treatment,2018-07-02T10:47:29.944139,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-13T11:46:57.383000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/citation/,8hjf3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a86zq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/relationships/node/,a86zq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584fdedc9ad5a1004bba0e2f/,584fdedc9ad5a1004bba0e2f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hjf3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8hjf3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8hjf3,https://doi.org/10.1111/nous.12180

Overestimating one’s financial knowledge can lead to risky financial behaviors and economic vulnerability. To date, limited empirical work has examined how the gap between one’s perception of their own financial knowledge and their actual knowledge varies across the life course. We analyze the size and nature of the financial knowledge gap and its variation across the life course. We use nationally representative data from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) and find robust evidence that older adults overestimate their financial knowledge. Social workers can assess the financial knowledge gap and inform and educate their clients to protect from financial fraud, exploitation, and, abuse.

I used textual analysis to examine the presentations of the communist Yugoslavia institutionalized in the Croatian history textbooks and newspapers in 1991-2007, and I compared them to the accounts of the Yugoslav past among the Croatian transitional (born 1978-81) and post-communist generation (born 1989-91). These two generations were distinct in their childhood and formative years’ experiences of Yugoslavia and post-Yugoslav Croatia, but both depended on secondary sources such as parents, school and the media for their evaluations of the Yugoslav period.  
The present study found that the textbook and newspaper presentations, primarily shaped by the 1990s nation-building elites, mainly portrayed Yugoslavia in negative political, economic and ethnic terms. However, findings from 72 in-depth interviews with the two young Croatian generations suggested that the influence of the dominant negative re-evaluations was limited, particularly among the vocationally educated individuals who were least exposed to the institutionalized presentations of the Yugoslav past. In contrast, the young Croats, independently of their differences, generally dominantly evaluated Yugoslavia in positive social terms, which was a perspective obtained from their parents and older people recounting their good lives in Yugoslavia. This perspective was appropriated not only because its sources were emotionally available and credible, but also because the social lens on Yugoslavia helped the young Croats make sense of their lives in the social insecurities of the contemporary Croatian society. 
Therefore, the present study showed how different beliefs on the Yugoslav past, available from different sources, were appropriated and used by the young Croats. I also proposed Interactional Model of Collective Memories Formation, which elaborated how the influences on the beliefs of the past were formed at the macro, micro and the level of social interaction. Finally, this study also illuminated how active actors reinterpreted the presentations of the past, thus demonstrating how individuals can use culture in diverse and adept ways.",TRUE,FALSE,collective memories|Croatia|generations|social change,2018-07-02T10:49:06.110720,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-11T10:46:59.319000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/citation/,f685v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dsy6e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/relationships/node/,dsy6e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584d2de9b83f6901f1ad2997/,584d2de9b83f6901f1ad2997,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f685v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f685v,NA

Fixed effects negative binomial regression models on a panel sample of 117 developing countries reveal that global ties to world society in the form of non-governmental memberships and treaty ratifications are strong determinants of the network centrality of recipient countries in the global foreign aid network. Countries with a higher level of adherence and connection to world society norms and organizations are shown to be the beneficiaries of an increased number of aid relationships with wealthy donor countries.

The Pirate Bay is the world’s most popular public index for tracking and downloading torrents. Using a snapshot of torrents on the site, this study considers the potential for torrent networks to preserve and provide access to cultural materials in the form of digital media content. Metadata from 2.1 million torrents were categorized by media type and the robustness of given torrents was assessed. Trends over time, such as number of uploads and volume, were also investigated.

Exacerbating these concerns, an influential Monte Carlo study by Stegmueller (2013) suggests that frequentist methods yield biased estimates and severely anti-conservative inference with small upper-level samples. Stegmueller recommends Bayesian techniques, which he claims to be superior in terms of both bias and inferential accuracy. In this paper, we reassess and refute these results. First, we formally prove that frequentist maximum likelihood estimators of coefficients are unbiased. The apparent bias found by Stegmueller is simply a manifestation of Monte Carlo Error. Second, we show how inferential problems can be overcome by using restricted maximum likelihood estimators for variance parameters and a t-distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom for statistical inference. Thus, accurate multilevel analysis is possible without turning to Bayesian methods, even if the number of upper-level units is small.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian inference|Bias|Maximum Likelihood|Mixed Effects Models|Multilevel analysis|SocArxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:05.325128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-10T09:48:46.604000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,by the authors,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/citation/,z65s4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fkn3u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/relationships/node/,fkn3u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584bcd15b83f6901f6ad298c/,584bcd15b83f6901f6ad298c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z65s4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z65s4,NA

Next, it is essential to consider regional and taphonomic issues in preservation of human skeletal remains and then summarize the time scale of bioarchaeological work. Past and present research programs in Florida bioarchaeology are then discussed in depth by research topic, including questions asked and methods used. Where possible, we note the location at which skeletal collections are currently stored.
