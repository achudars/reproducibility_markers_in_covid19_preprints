Simultaneously, privately owned vehicles are vastly underused, wasting valuable opportunities for accommodating more people in a livable urban environment by occupying spacious parking areas. Since a data-driven quantification and visualization of such urban mobility space inequality is lacking, here we explore how crowdsourced data can help to advance its understanding. In particular, we describe how the open-source online platform What the Street!? uses massive user-generated data from OpenStreetMap for the interactive exploration of city-wide mobility spaces. Using polygon packing and graph algorithms, the platform rearranges all parking and mobility spaces of cars, rails, and bicycles of a city to be directly comparable, making mobility space inequality accessible to a broad public. This crowdsourced method confirms a prevalent imbalance between modal share and space allocation in 23 cities worldwide, typically discriminating bicycles. Analyzing the guesses of the platform’s visitors about mobility space distributions, we find that this discrimination is consistently underestimated in the public opinion. Finally, we discuss a visualized scenario in which extensive parking areas are regained through fleets of shared, autonomous vehicles. We outline how such accessible visualization platforms can facilitate urban planners and policy makers to reclaim road and parking space for pushing forward sustainable transport solutions.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|bin packing|crowdsourcing|data visualization|mobility|OpenStreetMap|sustainable transport|transport justice|urban space inventory|volunteered geographical information,2018-07-02T13:32:12.998902,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T20:25:47.766292,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/citation/,je5r4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kfv3w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/relationships/node/,kfv3w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abd3dc2a2409b00109ea278/,5abd3dc2a2409b00109ea278,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/je5r4/,https://doi.org/10.17645/up.v3i1.1209,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/je5r4

More specifically, critical discourse analysis may uncover her mental representations about the Tunisian Revolution and the US attitude towards such an important political event in North Africa and the Middle East. Studying factive presupposition and epistemic modality seems to be an effective pragmatic tool to reveal what is presented as factual and ideological knowledge in political discourse. The research instrument used to work out the frequency distribution of these lexical features is the latest version of ‘AntConc’ software. To uncover the epistemic state of Hillary Clinton, van Dijk’s (1995b) socio-cognitive approach, mainly discourse-cognition-society paradigm, is applied to analyze her speeches between January 2011 and December 2012. At the discourse level, research findings reveal that factive presupposition, epistemic modality and evidential verbs unveil the speaker’s strong personal commitment to the truth value of her propositions. At the cognitive level, results show that the speaker’s personal and social values, attitudes, ideologies and knowledge unmask her mental mapping of Tunisia, democracy and human rights. It also uncovers the cognitive mechanisms that govern discourse production and understanding via ICMs, cognitive frames, mental models and context models. At the social level, research demonstrates that Clinton's perceptual and conceptual worlds are based on a dichotomy that involves 'WE', or democracies Vs. 'THEY' or the enemies of democracy, hence a dual vision of the world or polarization. This research bridges the lack of research combining epistemic presupposition, epistemic modality and evidentiality within a socio-cognitive framework",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T13:32:12.033999,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:35:56.438744,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/citation/,78hmj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fg4xk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/relationships/node/,fg4xk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc5e5b266c2a000ec0f91a/,5abc5e5b266c2a000ec0f91a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78hmj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/78hmj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.202,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/78hmj

As such, the current study content analyzed the first and the second stage secondary English as a foreign language (EFL) textbooks taught at public schools in Jordan. This descriptive analytical research design was carried out to explore the means and frequencies of text structure types included in both textbooks and the extent of fairness in presenting these structures within the reading texts of both textbooks. The main aim of the study is to provide insights for both EFL teachers and book designers to expose students to varied types of text structure. A content analysis sheet for coding the material based on the criterion of inclusion was used. The reading passage was the unit of analysis. The analysis of the study revealed that the Jordanian secondary stage textbooks include a variety of text structure types that are not fairly distributed; nevertheless, the descriptive structure was the most frequent structure in both textbooks. Starting from this premise, the current study discussed the pedagogical implications of text structure teaching. Accordingly, the study recommends that book designers should integrate reading texts of varied text structure types without ignoring some structures in favor of others, also it recommends that EFL teachers should be trained to use text structure strategy in EFL reading classes.",TRUE,FALSE,content analysis|EFL|implications|text structure,2018-07-02T13:32:11.804593,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:40:04.059958,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/citation/,dw7x6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qnysm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/relationships/node/,qnysm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc5563a2409b00119dec84/,5abc5563a2409b00119dec84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw7x6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dw7x6/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.26,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dw7x6

EFL learners in Saudi context behave very much differently to the writing tasks as English is introduced at a later stage in school education. Consequently, learners face a lot of challenges in responding positively to the methods and strategies implemented at the college level. The courses are intensive but failed to achieve the desired outcomes at the end of the program.  A sample of work from 20 second year bachelor level students is taken to check the validity STOP and DARE strategy in improving students’ writing skills and also to see how the learners respond to this method. Teaching of argumentative writing is a part of their mother tongue teaching of which they are conceptually aware of but how do they respond in EFL learning is of interest to this present study.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab EFL learners|argumentative|SRSD|writing,2018-07-02T13:32:11.759214,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:40:19.326095,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/citation/,fhvgm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eysut/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/relationships/node/,eysut,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc54a1266c2a000ec0f29d/,5abc54a1266c2a000ec0f29d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fhvgm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fhvgm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.25,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fhvgm

It aims to understand the culture difference between Jordanian and the Asian speech communities that both learners utilize when confronting apology situations. The researcher used an interview technique to gather the data. Data collected using a modified version of the Discourse Completion Test (DCT) developed by Sugimoto (1997). Subjects of the study included six Jordanian undergraduate students and six Asian undergraduate students. There were 10 situations used in the study developed by Sugimoto's (1997). The findings in this study introduced the similarities and differences of the apologizing strategies used by Jordanian undergraduate students and Asian undergraduate students. It found that the most frequently apology strategies used among the Jordanian and the Asian participants were account, and compensation. It shows also gratitude is less used among Asian participants when apologize by equal and lower status person. In regarding to that, the findings of this study are expected to be used in intercultural comparisons studies. This research hopes that tutors should be aware of their own culture and the cultures of their students to make this cultural training more successful. Learners should learn apologizing strategies in such a way to capture their semantics meaning as well as pragmatic use in order to employ them appropriately.",TRUE,FALSE,apologizing strategies|apology|Asian ESL learners and Jordanian EFL learners|discourse completion task|speech act,2018-07-02T13:32:11.716306,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:40:37.980910,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/citation/,3tzsw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6fjgx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/relationships/node/,6fjgx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc53eb266c2a000dc11843/,5abc53eb266c2a000dc11843,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tzsw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3tzsw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.24,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3tzsw
