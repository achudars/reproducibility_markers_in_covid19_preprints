In: Liability in the third millennium : liber amicorum Gert Brüggemeier. Nomos, pp. 49-84","There is an increasing effect of fundamental rights outside of the citizen-state relationship, invading domains such as labour law, contract law, family law, and property law. These rights and principles have often served as much more than mere interpretive aids and have become actual substantive rules of law, independent of whether their invocation resulted in a successful or unsuccessful claim. This debate, commonly referred to as the horizontal effect of fundamental rights, has also undoubtedly affected the law of torts. The development of the debate surrounding the horizontal effect of fundamental rights and the readiness of several courts to permit basic rights to influence the outcome of a case, have led to an increasingly decisive role for constitutional texts in the field of torts. 
The effect of fundamental rights in the field of the law of torts is undoubtedly more often felt in regard to the position of the tort victim, and the entitlement of the victim to damages, rather than in regard to the position of the tortfeasor strictu sensu. By this it is implied that, despite judges sometimes balancing the fundamental rights of both tort victims and tortfeasors, the influence of fundamental rights in the law of torts impacts, most often, directly the position of tort victims, either by strengthening or weakening their position, always concentrating more intensively on their interests. The position of tortfeasors is commonly only affected indirectly, as a consequence of the consideration of the fundamental rights of tort victims. This can be easily illustrated by references to the English, German and Italian jurisdictions, among others.
By drawing from scholarly writings and case-law from several European and non-European jurisdictions, this book chapter contributes to a change from the focus on the position of the tort victim to that of the tortfeasor. In order for the law of torts to fulfil and satisfy all its different functions and interests, while simultaneously respecting and promoting commonly accepted legal values, the position of the tortfeasor should be analysed in se, not as a mere reflection of the position of the tort victim. No other instrument could perform this task better than fundamental rights, dynamic tools that they are. In addition, the thorough fulfilment of all fundamental rights equally requires such change in the legal mindset, as the law of torts has to give respect to the fundamental rights of both the tort victim and the tortfeasor in a balanced and just way. A refocus of the debate surrounding the horizontal effect of fundamental rights on the law of torts is therefore proposed, thus also assessing the impact that fundamental rights and principles may have directly on the position of the tortfeasor strictu sensu.",TRUE,FALSE,|comparative law|constitutional law|fundamental rights|human rights|tortfesors|tort law|tort victims,2018-10-16T21:56:43.528480,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T21:56:33.231561,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts,Nuno Ferreira,2009,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/citation/,96zpj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xds2n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/relationships/node/,xds2n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5eb1453cec4001badeb52/,5bc5eb1453cec4001badeb52,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/96zpj/,https://doi.org/10.5771/9783845213859-49,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/96zpj

The chapter starts by sketching the main lines of the ‘child labour’ debate, the qualitative and quantitative significance of children in the EU labour market, and the relevant EU competences. It will then touch upon a range of EU labour law instruments that affect children, both as direct addressees – especially the Young Workers Directive – and collateral beneficiaries, including a variety of tools that address sex discrimination.

An introduction,"The EU has throughout its history benefited from variable levels of popular support and revealed different levels of capacity to deal with crises. The current circumstances, on account of financial pressures, social instability and present geographical and policy scope of the EU, require serious introspection and ‘soul searching’. What can be done if the EU is not to perish and, hopefully, become more part of the solution than of the problem? May becoming more humane be the answer?
‘Humane’ may be defined in different ways, including compassionate, sympathetic and humanitarian. Non-Western cultures seem to have made a much more sophisticated use of this notion in broader contexts up to the present day. Chinese culture, through the Confucian notion of ‘jen’, places enormous value on humaneness as a way of achieving balance, empathy and the moral standard. In the African context, the notion of ‘ubuntu’ has served as the gateway through which humaneness infiltrates all aspects of society, including law and policy, namely by focussing on participation, co-responsibility, interdependence, respect and equality. 
This introduction presents an analytical framework through which the degree of humaneness of the different fields of EU law and policy can be assessed.",TRUE,FALSE,|ethic of care|European Union|humane|humaneness|humanity|human rights|jen|rights|ubuntu,2018-10-16T17:44:05.395876,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:43:32.179853,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0f|Law|Public Law and Legal Theory|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c58|Law|Law and Philosophy|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/citation/,2mdrw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7f8ur/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/relationships/node/,7f8ur,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5d74d53cec4001aad1468/,5bc5d74d53cec4001aad1468,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2mdrw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2mdrw

This was, however, accompanied by other discriminatory practices and forms of hostility, exclusion and violence against the Roma, such as finger-printing in Italy and educational segregation in the Czech Republic. A comprehensive approach and strong action by the EU against these practices was defended, which led to the Commission communication on the EU Framework on National Roma Integration Strategies (2011), a non-binding Parliament resolution (2013) and the Council recommendation on effective Roma integration measures in the member states (2013). Such comprehensive approach may be in many respects appropriate, but the danger is to neglect the true relevance of concrete, enforceable and ‘hard law’ measures. This chapter thus explores the legal adequacy of EU action with regard to the Roma minority, particularly from free movement and EU citizenship perspectives. The scope for derogations from free movement and from the rights associated with EU citizenship are the centre pieces of this analysis, which critically analyses specific EU Member States’ restrictions on the free movement of the Roma minority and the EU response in this and other relevant aspects.",TRUE,FALSE,|derogations|EU citizenship|European Union|expulsion|free movement|integration|minorities|political participation|Roma,2018-10-16T17:42:01.208457,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:41:23.783282,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5e|Law|Law and Race|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira and Dora Kostakopoulou,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/citation/,da9rw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/67mnu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/relationships/node/,67mnu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5d27d53cec4001aad1059/,5bc5d27d53cec4001aad1059,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/da9rw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/da9rw

And since immemorial times it has been controversial and a source of harsh debates. Throughout the last decades, many changes have been introduced in this field and many practices, until then only taking place without public knowledge, were progressively revealed and regulated.
This paper aims, firstly, at clarifying the terminology and concepts usually used in the euthanasia debate and presenting, in a lucid way, the arguments that civic movements and authors resort to when defending or criticising the liberalisation of euthanasia. Secondly, it describes the legal and social situation regarding euthanasia in several countries, where cases and legislation have demanded greater awareness from society. Thirdly, it attempts to compare the different national situations previously analysed. Finally, it discusses ways of improving the present situation and finding better solutions for the regulation of euthanasia.
In such a debate, where moral, ethic and religious arguments and beliefs are called upon, it is crucial not to lose sight of the foundations of our culture(s) and society(ies). Therefore, this paper, although concentrating on the legal aspects of this debate, tries to take into account of some non-legal aspects which are also relevant and without which it is not possible to thoroughly discuss this issue.

The Europeanization of Media Discourses about Euroscepticism across Six Countries,"This study compares the media discourses about Euroscepticism in 2014 across six countries (United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark). We assess the extent to which the mass media’s reporting of Euroscepticism indicates the Europeanization of public spheres. Using a mixed-methods approach combining LDA topic modeling and qualitative coding, we find that approximately 70 per cent of print articles mentioning ‘Euroscepticism’ or ‘Eurosceptic’ are framed in a non-domestic (i.e. European) context. In five of the six cases studied, articles exhibiting a European context are strikingly similar in content, with the British case as the exception. However, coverage of British Euroscepticism drives Europeanization in other Member States. Bivariate logistic regressions further reveal three macro-level structural variables that significantly correlate with a Europeanized media discourse: newspaper type (tabloid or broadsheet), presence of a strong Eurosceptic party, and relationship to the EU budget (net contributor or receiver of EU funds).",TRUE,FALSE,Comparative Politics|Elections|Europeanization|European Parliament|European Politics|Euroscepticism|Media Studies|Topic Modeling,2018-10-16T17:40:45.447369,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:40:15.293500,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/citation/,7d9bx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7qapj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/relationships/node/,7qapj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5cb188811c100185545d5/,5bc5cb188811c100185545d5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7d9bx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7d9bx

However, because experiments have traditionally been carried out by un-monitored humans, we do not fully understand the role of force in wear formation. Here we compare the amount of wear produced by duration vs. applied force in a controlled experiment and using both the inspection of optical images and quantitative parameters describing surface topography. We used flint flakes attached to a force/ torque controllable robot arm to scrape standardized beech wooden planks under constant force profiles. The force profiles were obtained by previous experiments in scraping described in Pfleging et al. (2015). We varied the force level and use duration among the experiments. Worn pieces were imaged with an Alicona InfiniteFocus G4 microscope and the polished parts of the flakes were analysed using areal field parameters from metrology. The data is publicly available on the internet. Results indicate that use duration contributes more significantly to polish formation than force, confirming assumptions made in human experiments performed in the 1980s. Moreover, simple metrological height parameters appear inadequate for capturing the degree of polish. We conclude that more sophisticated quantitative methods are required to go beyond the subjective human evaluation of optical images to reconstruct past human action.",TRUE,FALSE,controlled experiment|fractal analysis|height parameters|metrology|micro-wear|robot,2018-10-16T11:23:01.302011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T11:22:44.500197,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/citation/,cseb4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/purce/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/relationships/node/,purce,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc50da653cec4001bac6a9e/,5bc50da653cec4001bac6a9e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cseb4/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12520-018-0729-0,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cseb4

However, their application to both criminal and tort liability of children remains inconsistent. Furthermore, rarely has an interdisciplinary approach adequately dealt with these concepts and their impact on legal norms. This text investigates the notion of criminal and tort liability age in connection with the notion of capacity responsibility, in relation to children, and further questions the adequacy of the relevant legal norms. This endeavour to improve the applicable legal norms is supported by an analysis of the pertinent ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of psychology, particularly in respect of the moral development of children. Informed by an excursion through the ideas of Piaget, Kohlberg, and Gilligan, among others, regarding the moral development of children, the text also serves to assess the impact of concepts of moral responsibility and maturity, in relation to the development of the legal norms, which determine the age of liability of children. The text concludes with a proposal for a criminal and tort liability age framework, based upon indicative/presumptive age milestones, and an integrated approach to all relevant circumstances in casu.",TRUE,FALSE,Criminal liability|Gilligan|Kohlberg|Legal responsibility|Liability age|Maturity|Moral development|Moral responsibility|Piaget|Tort liability,2018-10-15T21:09:40.919113,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-15T21:09:24.025790,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2008,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/citation/,ven8c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t8wa3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/relationships/node/,t8wa3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc4f28253cec4001bac3fcd/,5bc4f28253cec4001bac3fcd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ven8c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ven8c/,https://doi.org/10.1163/092755608X267157,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ven8c
