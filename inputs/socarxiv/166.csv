Populism is generally hostile to expertise, yet it has flourished at a moment when expertise has seemed more indispensable than ever. Populism thrives on crisis and indeed often depends on fabricating a sense of crisis, yet it has accused mainstream politicians and media of overblowing and even inventing the Corona crisis. Populism, finally, is ordinarily protectionist, yet it has presented itself as anti-protectionist during the pandemic and challenged the allegedly overprotective restrictions of the nanny-state.

the spread of coronavirus. Government advice at that time was that all older people aged 70
and over should stay at home and avoid any contact with non-household members. This study
uses new data from the Understanding Society COVID 19 survey collected in April 2020,
linked to Understanding Society Wave 9 data collected in 2018/19, in order to examine the
extent of support received by individuals aged 70 and over in the first four weeks of
lockdown from family, neighbours or friends not living in the same household, and how that
support had changed prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The research
distinguishes between different types of households as, given with guidance not to leave
home and not to let others into the household, those older people living alone or living only
with a partner also aged 70 and above are more likely to be particularly vulnerable. The
results highlight both positive news alongside causes for concern. The receipt of assistance
with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), especially shopping, has increased
particularly among those living alone or with an older partner, reflecting the rise of
volunteering and community action during this period. However, not all older people reported
a rise, and the majority reported ‘no change’, in the support received. Moreover, amongst
those older people reporting that they required support with at least one Activity of Daily
Living (ADL) task prior to the pandemic, around one-quarter reported receiving no care from
outside the household and one-in-ten of those with two or more ADL care needs reported
receiving less help than previously. Although formal home care visits have continued during
the pandemic to those who have been assessed by the local government to be in need, it is
important to acknowledge that some older people risk not having the support they need.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-109; pandemic; social care; unmet needs; older people,2020-06-24T18:36:02.910719,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-24T18:35:44.132776,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8644-1,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/citation/,962dy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef26254659828024acf0e08/,5ef26254659828024acf0e08,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/962dy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/962dy,NA

Imbibed by the Marxist view of social change they gave up ‘terrorism’ after coming out of jails/camps. However, a sharp debate developed among them on the perception of the Comintern, its colonial policy in general and the policy with respect to the Indian freedom struggle in particular. Instead of joining any of the existing Marxist political parties, these revolutionaries formed their own parties. The RSP and SUCI are two such parties. RSP was formed in 1940. However, a group of young revolutionaries who were with the RSP dissociated themselves and formed a ‘platform of action’ as SUC in 1946 and then gave birth to yet another political party, SUCI, on the Marxist-Leninist lines in 1948.

We unify disconnected explanations of change that focus either on individuals or on public culture under a theory of cultural evolution. By shifting our analytical lens from actors to public cultural ideas and object, our theory can explain change in cultural forms over large and long frames of analysis using formal evolutionary mechanisms. Complementing this theory, the paper introduces a suite of novel methods to explain change in the historical trajectories of populations of cultural ideas/objects (e.g., music groups, hashtags, laws, technologies, and organizations) through diversification rates. We deploy our theory and methods to study the history of Metal Music over more than three decades, using a complete dataset of all bands active between 1968 and 2000. Over the course of its history, we find strong evidence that the genre has been fundamentally shaped by competition between ideas for the cognitive resources actors can invest in learning about and reproducing this cultural form over time.

This study, however, considers all these factors at once, providing the first comprehensive snapshot of religious belonging, behaving, and believing across and within these axes of inequality in the United States. Leveraging unique data with an exceptionally large sample, I explore religion across 40 unique configurations of intersecting identities (e.g., one is non-Latina Black heterosexual college-educated women). Across all measures considered, Black women are at the top—however, depending on the measure, there are different subsets of Black women at the top. And whereas most sexual minorities are among the least religious Americans, Black sexual minorities—and especially those with a college degree—exhibit high levels of religious belonging, behaving, and believing. In fact, Black sexual minority women with a college degree meditate more frequently than any other group considered. Overall, whereas we see clear divides in how religious people are by factors like gender, education, and sexual orientation among most racial groups, race appears to overpower other factors for Black Americans who are consistently religious regardless of their other characteristics.

In this article, we study organizational social capital effects at the micro level, that is, its impact on important work-related attitudes of employees within organizations. We argue that individual perceptions of organization-wide social capital matter in determining employee attitudes like engagement and commitment. We also point to the critical role of team cognition in shaping individual perceptions of social capital in organizations. Using a representative sample of nearly twelve hundred individuals from two local government organizations in North Carolina, we find support for the indirect effect of team cognition on employee work attitudes. The findings suggest that a promising way to increase the social capital of organizations is through interventions at the team level.",TRUE,FALSE,Commitment|Engagement|organizational behavior|Organizational Social Capital|public sector|Team mental models and cognition,2020-06-23T04:20:05.269422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-23T04:19:36.568848,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/citation/,utrmn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef10a1e65982801c5cf2266/,5ef10a1e65982801c5cf2266,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utrmn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/utrmn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/utrmn,https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074019851894

The agriculture sector has a major role in GDP and also provides more than half of the total workforce their livelihood. Many of the state economies depend on agricultural-based activities. Hence, it is crucial to check the reliability of agricultural statistics and its correct measurement in national accounts for the correct valuation of the economy. The paper discusses the evolution of National Accounts Statistics in India and its embedment with the agriculture sector. The paper further discusses the statistics related to the land use and yield of crops and, - the method and sources used to collect this data.
