The solution offered is dieting, with different experts advocating different diets. However, it has been observed over time that diets may work for losing some weight initially but not in the long term or, they might work for some individuals but not others. This points to the multifactorial influence (genetic, biological, epigenetic) on weight loss and management, and therefore the approach should be individualised – one size does not fit all (Smethers and Rolls, 2018). In this report, an individualised approach is taken for a hypothetical client, Claudia, who is a 38 years old female in good health who wants to lose weight. She will be offered diet plans based on the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and the Vegetarian diet (VEG) according to Eat Well Guide (EWG) so she can choose which diet plan meets best her needs. The diet plans were put through the Nutritics software for further analysis of composition and comparison (see Appendix).

Inequality is usually measured by differences in life expectancy.
Objective: To devise a cogent measure of how much distributions of lifespans differ between two populations.
Results: We propose an outsurvival statistic, φ, that measures the probability that an individual from a population with low life expectancy will live longer than an individual from a population with high life expectancy. This statistic can also be interpreted as an underdog probability—the chance that a random value from a distribution with a low mean will exceed a random value from a distribution with a higher mean.
Contribution: Our outsurvival probability complements life expectancy to provide a more nuanced view of the inequality of lifespans between two populations. Our similar underdog probability provides a perspective on the more general question of how different two distributions are.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-18T21:45:42.749648,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-18T21:45:28.668639,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.mortality.org/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/citation/,gsdkx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8aaeba37b6bb027d30b7e0/,5f8aaeba37b6bb027d30b7e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsdkx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gsdkx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gsdkx,NA

Unfortunately, if this assumption is violated, standard methods in empirical research may mislead. I address this concern with three contributions. First, I give a theoretical analysis of the extent and direction of bias that may result from violations of this assumption. Second, I propose to use respondents’ memories of changes in life satisfaction to estimate and thereby to correct for differentials in scale use. Third, using the proposed approach, I test whether wellbeing reports are intrapersonally comparable across time. Using British panel data, I find that the direction in which explanatory variables affect latent satisfaction is typically the same as the direction in which scale use is affected. Unemployment and widowhood appear to have particularly strong effects on scale use. Although discussed in the context of life satisfaction scales, the proposed approach for anchoring response scales is applicable to a wide range of other subjectively reported constructs.",TRUE,FALSE,BHPS|differential item functioning|life satisfaction|memories|subjective wellbeing|vignettes,2020-10-18T21:45:22.064959,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-18T21:44:58.005604,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/bhps/acquiring-the-data,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/citation/,xpghn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9aqr2/,9aqr2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8a0b480847120297fda134/,5f8a0b480847120297fda134,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpghn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xpghn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xpghn,NA

A potential negative impact of these trends is that low-income populations are concentrating in more automobile oriented areas and thus resulting in increased barriers to daily travel and activity participation, particularly for those who are unable to afford a private vehicle. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to analyze the links between increasing socio-spatial inequalities, transport disadvantage, and adverse travel behaviour outcomes. This is examined first from a theoretical perspective, and second via a spatio-temporal analysis for the Toronto region from 1991 to 2016. Findings show that many suburban areas in Toronto are not only declining in socioeconomic status, but are also suffering from increased barriers to daily travel evidenced by longer commute times and decreasing activity participation rates, relative to central neighborhoods. Because of these adverse effects, this evidence further supports the need for progressive planning and policy aimed at curbing continuing trends of suburbanization of poverty while also improving levels of transport accessibility in the suburbs.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-18T21:44:40.791506,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-18T21:44:20.048604,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/citation/,hkpfj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f89eddf37b6bb023c307656/,5f89eddf37b6bb023c307656,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkpfj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hkpfj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hkpfj,https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2020.1859981

This study (1) provides estimates of pain trends among US adults across major population groups; (2) tests whether sociodemographic disparities in pain have widened or narrowed over time; and (3) examines socioeconomic, behavioral, psychological, and medical correlates of pain trends. Regression and decomposition analyses of joint, low-back, neck, migraine, and jaw/facial pain using the 2002-2018 National Health Interview Survey for adults aged 25-84 (N=441,707) assess the trends and their correlates. We find extensive escalation of pain prevalence in all population subgroups: overall, reports of pain in at least one site increased by 10%, representing an additional 10.5 million adults experiencing pain. Socioeconomic disparities are widening over time, and psychological distress and health behaviors are among the salient correlates of the trends. This study thus comprehensively documents rising pain prevalence among Americans across the adult life span and highlights socioeconomic, behavioral, and psychological factors as important correlates of the trends.

Population counts – the principal denominators for calculating age-specific mortality rates – will be subject to noise infusion in the United States with the 2020 Census via a disclosure avoidance system based on differential privacy. Using COVID-19 mortality curves from the CDC, we show that differential privacy will introduce substantial distortion in COVID-19 mortality rates – sometimes causing mortality rates to exceed 100\% -- hindering our ability to understand the pandemic. This distortion is particularly large for population groupings with fewer than 1000 persons – 40\% of all county-level age-sex groupings and 60\% of race groupings. The US Census Bureau should consider a larger privacy budget and data users should consider pooling data to increase population sizes to minimize differential privacy’s distortion.",TRUE,FALSE,Census 2020|COVID-19|Differential Privacy,2020-10-18T21:28:21.720168,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-18T21:27:58.718453,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/2v7ea/?view_only=443404fc9af041dc876d0617385f9255,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/citation/,mvh5b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2v7ea/,2v7ea,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f89a84bd85b7002576560b2/,5f89a84bd85b7002576560b2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvh5b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mvh5b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mvh5b,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023121994014

Empirical validation has been challenging due to limitations in collecting and systematizing large historical records. Here, we capitalize on the largest online encyclopedia to formulate knowledge as growing networks of articles and their hyperlinked inter-relations. We demonstrate that concept networks grow not by expanding from their core but rather by creating and filling knowledge gaps, a process which produces discoveries that are more frequently awarded Nobel prizes than others. Moreover, we operationalize paradigms as network modules to reveal a temporal signature in structural stability across scientific subjects. In a network formulation of scientific discovery, data-driven conditions underlying breakthroughs depend just as much on identifying uncharted gaps as on advancing solutions within scientific communities.",TRUE,FALSE,network science|philosophy of science,2020-10-18T21:21:40.922647,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-18T21:21:27.905769,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/citation/,tga9c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f89a33137b6bb01ff310b1a/,5f89a33137b6bb01ff310b1a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tga9c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tga9c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tga9c,NA
