This mixed-methods study examines the experiences of students participating in one of the first iterations of this trend: a blended professional master's degree program that admitted students based on performance in MOOC-based online courses. We found that the blended master's program attracted a cohort of highly educated mid-career professionals from developed countries who were looking for more flexible alternatives to traditional graduate programs. Success in the online courses was correlated with higher levels of prior formal education and effective use of learning strategies. Students who enrolled in the blended graduate program reported being academically prepared for their coursework and had higher GPAs (3.86, p&lt;0.01) than students in the residential program (3.75).

I offer a more comprehensive view by considering social exclusion in cultural settings varying in terms of legitimacy and by studying how people differ in their understanding of social exclusion (that is, criteria used to draw social boundaries demarcating certain cultural settings as inappropriate for some people). I scrutinize the centrality of modes of consumption in these understandings of social exclusion. Using survey data representative for the Flemish population (n=3,144), I inductively analyse attitudes towards classical and pop/rock concerts. I uncover four understandings of social exclusion that are present with regard to both types of concerts. These understandings differ (a) in whether they stem from an insiders’ or outsiders’ perspective and (b) in how they use modes of consumption as criteria for social exclusion. Additionally, I find that people’s understanding of social exclusion—i.e., which criteria people consider relevant for social exclusion—drives what cultural contexts they perceive as socially exclusive.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-06T14:30:21.448576,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-06T14:27:49.214748,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/citation/,ux78b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g37tc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/relationships/node/,g37tc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c08d95b9f61b5001927f771/,5c08d95b9f61b5001927f771,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ux78b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ux78b,NA

We provide one of the first quantitative tests of this question in Tunisia, the Arab Spring's only success story. We argue that power-sharing may reduce polarization for a limited time, but at the cost of undermining democratic institutions. To measure polarization, we examine all rollcall votes from Tunisia's first and second post-transition parliaments. We employ a time-varying ideal point model and examine whether power-sharing agreements led to convergence in political parties' ideal points. Our analysis reveals that Tunisia's national unity government in 2015 temporarily moderated political tensions and allowed for parliamentary activity to resume. However, despite a broadening of the coalition in mid-2016, polarization reemerged and crucial legislation stalled. Moreover, longitudinal survey data suggest that the failure of power-sharing in Tunisia contributed to disillusionment with political parties, parliament, and democracy.",TRUE,FALSE,democracy|legislature|Middle East|policy|power-sharing|transitions|Tunisia,2018-12-06T04:27:01.446679,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-06T04:26:42.887435,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/citation/,6z74r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/59qa3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/relationships/node/,59qa3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c083fe798fee70017a70e73/,5c083fe798fee70017a70e73,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6z74r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6z74r,NA

We offer an alternative, relational perspective highlighting the critical role of authenticity in shaping an SMO’s perceived value. Unlike frames and intentional displays, calculated efforts to proclaim authenticity often backfire. We distill two orthogonal types: grassroots (in)authenticity, based on idealized notions of civil society, and institutional (in)authenticity, rooted in cultural-cognitive schemas used to judge fit with established SMO categories. Grassroots authenticity benefits an SMO’s fundamental legitimacy, while lacking it entirely (i.e. “astroturfing”) severely harms public support. Institutional authenticity increases resources and survival chances, intelligibility to elite observers, and clarity of collective identities; still, lacking this (via hybridity) may assist in recruitment and outreach.

RNA interference (RNAi), for example, utilises a mechanism that evolved in eukaryotes to destroy foreign nucleic acid. Other examples include restriction enzymes, the polymerase chain reaction, fluorescent proteins and CRISPR-Cas9. I propose that natural molecular mechanisms are exploited by biologists for their effectors’ (protein or nucleic acid) activity and biological specificity (protein or nucleic acid can cause precise reactions). I also show that the developmental trajectory of novel techniques in molecular biology, such as RNAi, is four characteristic phases. The first phase is discovery of a biological phenomenon. The second is identification of the mechanism’s trigger(s), the effector and biological specificity. The third is the application of the technique. The final phase is the maturation and refinement of the molecular biology technique.

Investigating the effect of group faultlines on turnover and organizational performance,"There is strong empirical evidence that workforce diversity is beneficial for organizations. The theoretical concept of faultlines stresses, however, that diversity can also have negative consequences. This is the case when the sub-groups differ not just with regard to one characteristic but with regard to several characteristics simultaneously. This paper is the first to examine the negative consequences of faultlines with large-scale data on organizations in the public and private sector. Fixed-effects regressions are used to investigate the impact of functional (working time, tenure, qualification) and demographic (age, gender, nationality) faultlines on turnover and organizational performance. We also consider the interaction between firm size and faultlines. Regarding turnover, we do not find the expected negative effects of demographic and only limited evidence for functional faultlines. The effects of demographic faultlines on performance, in turn, are negative for small organizations and become positive for organizations with more than 10 members.",TRUE,FALSE,faultlines|organisations|organizational performance|turnover|workforce diversity,2018-12-04T14:05:27.313334,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-04T14:05:03.475817,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/citation/,j9nc6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/chjuf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/relationships/node/,chjuf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0663819de61900181a7abf/,5c0663819de61900181a7abf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9nc6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9nc6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9nc6,NA

Therefore, we conduct two related experiments. One is a call market experiment in which participants trade assets with each other. The other is a learning-to-forecast experiment in which participants only forecast future prices, while the trade, which is based on these forecasts, is computerized. Each experiment comprises three treatments that vary the amount of information about the fundamental value that participants receive. Each market is repeated three times. In both experiments and in all treatments, we observe sizable bubbles. These bubbles do not disappear with experience. Our findings in the call market experiment stand in contrast to the literature. Our findings in the learning- to-forecast experiment are novel. Interestingly, the shape of the bubbles is different between the two experiments. We observe flat bubbles in the call market experiment and boom-and-bust cycles in the learning-to-forecast experiment.",TRUE,FALSE,asset market experiment|asset pricing|behavioral finance|bubbles|experience|Experimental finance,2018-12-04T14:06:02.585574,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-04T14:05:30.815551,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,Anita Kopanyi-Peuker and Matthias Weber,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/citation/,ecj7q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tmnja/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/relationships/node/,tmnja,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c06416f65e9650018de7994/,5c06416f65e9650018de7994,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecj7q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ecj7q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ecj7q,NA
