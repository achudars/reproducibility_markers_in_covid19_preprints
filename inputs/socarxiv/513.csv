These contested terrains have suffered the ramifications of environmental discrimination, which targets them for toxic strip-mining projects.  Throughout this paper, the researcher essentially applies environmental-justice approaches, but also refers to theories of global capitalism, and deep ecology, as they are all intertwined through their search for alternative forms of eco-resistance.  Hence, I build on critiques by such scholars as Murphy, Buell, Cornell, and Roach, among others, to provide the ideological, hermeneutical, socio-political, and aesthetic filters through which the nonfiction essay can be given fresh and original examinations.

Twelve English translation in the Spring 2015 edition of Pathlight will be analyzed as a way to develop translation resources. The main approaches to translation are: (1) retaining the original passive sentences and/or passive construction, (2) changing to corresponding active sentences, (3) changing into active sentences with the same narrative perspective, and (4) paraphrasing the original passives. Translation of adversative bèi passive sentences is evaluated from the perspectives of semantic equivalence and aesthetic effect in order to investigate whether they effectively and successfully express the original adversative meaning and represent the original aesthetic effect. Reasons for ineffective and unsuccessful semantic equivalence are analyzed, that include translators failing to recognize the adversative expression of bèi passive, and not paying sufficient attention to preserving the original lexical terms which express the adversative connotation and present the literary effect and adversative resultative compounds in bèi passive.",TRUE,FALSE,adversative bèi passive|aesthetic effect|semantic equivalence|translation evaluation,2018-07-02T11:54:44.052913,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-07T20:34:15.849320,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/citation/,nzx67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jxyat/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/relationships/node/,jxyat,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b157375f1f2880010642f5d/,5b157375f1f2880010642f5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nzx67/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nzx67

The story of Umuofia, the fictitious Igbo village, in Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958) can be read intertextually in light of the non-fictional text of Mary Kingsley, Travels in West Africa (1897) to underline the thrust of authenticity and fidelity of Achebe that makes his fiction true to life. This juxtaposition is further staged to question the stereotypical representation of Africa and Africans through the fictional texts of 19thc British writers such as Joseph Conrad, Rider Haggard among many others. Though it is not a purely historical text, Things Fall Apart is spearheaded against the reductive approach applied by 19thc British writers to deny Africa history and culture wholesale, presenting it on a dire need for the enlightenment and mission civilisatrice of the Westerners. Hence, the ostensible aim to enlighten the African heathens living in utter darkness, to free the African minds from the enslavement of superstition, to liberate African women from the sexual laxity endorsed by the barbaric morals of heathenism is counterpointed in Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. Chiefly, Achebe states that the cultural practices of the African people in their particular African environment down through ages have catered them with particular insights into life that are the bedrock of values and outlooks shaping contemporary African life.

Fewer studies focus on how chronic health conditions influence religious service attendance rates and most focus on older Americans. Using three waves of a nationally representative sample of children in the United States, I test whether children with a chronic health condition never attend religious worship services at rates significantly higher than children without a condition. I also investigate variation in attendance rates across a broad range of conditions, something previously overlooked. Children with chronic health conditions are more likely to never attend religious worship services. Specifically, children with chronic health conditions that impede communication and social interaction are most likely to never attend.

This framework – both in the shape of legislative instruments and case law – has inevitably also affected those asylum seekers who claim asylum on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity (SOGI). This has been vividly demonstrated by particular norms in EU asylum instruments and judgments of the Court of Justice of EU (CJEU).

The current CEAS can be said to have several shortcomings in relation to SOGI claims, including in relation to: country of origin information; the notion of ‘safe country of origin’; the burden of proof and the principle of benefit of the doubt; the concept of a ‘particular social group’; and the definition of persecution. A new set of proposals for reform of the CEAS was put forward in 2016 by the European Commission, and these also affect SOGI asylum claims in precise and acute ways.

This policy brief scrutinises these proposals of reform, and assesses the extent to which these proposals and different institutional positions address, ignore or aggravate the issues that currently affect asylum seekers who identify as LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex). The policy brief makes fifteen recommendations for European policymakers in regards to the reform of the CEAS, in order to ensure that the needs of LGBTI asylum seekers and refugees are effectively addressed and their rights are respected. Academics from the University of Sussex working on the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Claims of Asylum (SOGICA) project, funded by the European Research Council, are calling for policymakers to implement these recommendations in order to render the CEAS fairer for SOGI asylum seekers.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum|CEAS|Common European Asylum System|European Union|gender identity|refugees|sexual orientation,2018-07-02T11:54:43.557081,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T14:51:22.423053,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c35|Law|Sexuality and the Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c67|Law|Legislation|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/citation/,pkftr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6ugxk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/relationships/node/,6ugxk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b153fa6f1f288000f646cce/,5b153fa6f1f288000f646cce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pkftr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pkftr

A central assumption of this argument is that processes of implicit cognition, an aspect of how culture is stored at the individual level, depend on the social, physical, and cultural environmental of an individual. The chapter reviews findings and methods from multiple fields that can inform the study of the relationship between individual level implicit cognition and environmental context. I examine this relationship both in terms of how context informs the acquisition and the activation of implicit cognition at the individual level. Drawing on studies of implicit cognition measures in real-world settings, and laboratory and survey experiments, I discuss how these methods can be used to examine outstanding questions in the sociology of culture.",TRUE,FALSE,culture and cognition|implicit associations|methods,2018-07-02T11:53:49.044249,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-01T17:28:36.826940,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Hana Shepherd,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/citation/,xdt2r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sbxcg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/relationships/node/,sbxcg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b116d7064f25a000f74a4a4/,5b116d7064f25a000f74a4a4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xdt2r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xdt2r/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xdt2r

Yet whether core workers indeed benefit from workforce segmentation remains disputed. To scrutinize this question, I study how the wages of core workers with less than college education respond when their employer shifts employment out to subcontractors, using linked employer-employee panel data from Germany. Empirically, I find the effect of subcontracting on average to be either positive or neutral, but not negative. The presence and strength of the positive effect depends, first, on whether the type of subcontracting affords core workers with codetermination rights, second, on whether core workers are represented by a works council to exercise these rights, and, third, on whether these rights are exercised in a context that augments the bargaining position of core workers by rendering conflictual labor relations costly to the employer.",TRUE,FALSE,dualization|economic rents|employment rel|Labor markets|outsourcing|positional inequality,2018-07-02T11:53:48.846916,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-01T14:54:16.302869,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/citation/,ta4r6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/upqxv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/relationships/node/,upqxv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b115a8064f25a0019732555/,5b115a8064f25a0019732555,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ta4r6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ta4r6/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcy013,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ta4r6

couples and families spend together. However, little about this link has been demonstrated empirically. This study investigates how time spent with the partners, children, parents, siblings, friends, and acquaintances is associated with partnership conflicts and partnership satisfaction. A time-use module was set up as part of a longitudinal survey about family relations and conflicts in Switzerland. The results show a robust association between partnership quality, time shared with the partner, and time shared with the partner and children. Results show that the more time couples spend together, the more likely they are to experience high partnership quality and to report being satisfied with their relationships. Partners who are satisfied with their relationships are more prone to talk to each other, to share leisure time, and to go to bed together. In contrast, time spent with friends and kin is not associated with partnership quality.",TRUE,FALSE,couple|dyadic data|family|time use|well-being,2018-07-02T11:53:48.565570,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-01T10:53:13.912465,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/citation/,k7nxm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7vyjz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/relationships/node/,7vyjz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b11177c64f25a000e749567/,5b11177c64f25a000e749567,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7nxm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k7nxm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k7nxm
