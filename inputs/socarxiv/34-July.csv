trying to fulfill basic needs. While qualitative and ethnographic work has found that
income disparities also translate into disparities in time kept waiting for services, little evidence exists to confirm the scale and extent of socioeconomic differences in waiting time. We use time diary data from the nationally representative American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to estimate the difference between high- and low-income people in time spent waiting for basic services. We find that, relative to high-income people, low-income people are 3 percentage-points more likely to spend time waiting on an average day and their waiting spells are 12 minutes longer on average. The income gap in waiting time cannot be explained by differences in family obligations, demographics, education, work time, or travel time. Further, we find that high-income Black people experience the same higher average wait times as low-income people regardless of race.

This allows to compare the intended meanings of various linguistic labels denoting voluntary versus forced character of migration, as well as to distinguish the most salient themes that constitute the Facebook discourse. The study concludes that, although Facebook seems to have the highest potential in the promotion of tolerance and support for migrants, its audience is nevertheless active in the discursive discrimination of those identified as ""refugees"" or ""immigrants"".

This paper reports a process to optimise Accelerated Partner Therapy (APT), a UK partner notification intervention, to reduce chlamydia reinfection.
Method: Varied data sources involved an analysis of behavioural elements of existing contact tracing interventions identified through systematic review, a behavioural analysis of videos of APT, a behaviourally informed analysis of qualitative data from 56 patients/public, 30 healthcare professionals (HCPs) and expert input including the use of the APEASE criteria in specifying content for the intervention manual. This involved the theoretical domains framework (TDF), the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) and the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy (BCTT) to specify potentially useful ways of optimising APT that would enhance engagement
Results: The APT intervention was characterised as interactional; involving HCPs, index patients and sex partners. It involved four main delivery steps and eight behavioural domains. Varied barriers and facilitators to engagement with APT were identified and further analysed to optimise APT content. The APEASE criteria were used to select and prioritise content/intervention functions for inclusion in the intervention manual, training materials and all information material to support the delivery of APT for HCP and index patients (videos, leaflets etc.)

To do so, reviews of the literature depend on a rigorous method for searching specifically for MOS that is to date largely lacking. This article demonstrates a six-step protocol for setting up a rigorous search. Instead of sampling from a limited set of journals, it focuses on databases and uses information in thesauri, key articles, and automated text analysis to construct a search string. It details decision aids on database inclusions and syntax adaptations and discusses additional search techniques, with best practice examples. The six-step process provides practical considerations for authors and develops assessment criteria for journal editors and reviewers to judge the rigor of the search in terms of construct, internal, and external validity and reliability.

We propose a novel metric---the InterModel Vigorish (IMV)---for quantifying the value of change in predictive accuracy between two systems in the case of a binary outcome. The metric is based on an analogy to well-characterized physical systems with tractable probabilities. We first translate a baseline prediction of some binary outcomes into a statement about a canonical system---weighted coins---by equating the entropy of the two systems. We then use the weighted coin for a baseline prediction to establish a fair bet. For a second predictive system that we want to gauge relative to the baseline, we use the notion of expected winnings from a single-blind bet wherein the second weighted coin has replaced the first (the opposing player being blinded to this replacement). The resulting quantity has a scale that is both generally applicable and not dependent on the magnitude of the baseline prediction; moreover, it is always a statement about the change in fit relative to some baseline (which can simply be the prevalence) whereas other metrics (e.g., AUC) are stand-alone measures that need to be further manipulated to yield indices related to differences in fit across models. We illustrate the properties of this metric in simulations, and the value of it in empirical applications related to health, political affiliation, and item responses.

It has previously been determined by periodic agreements between the State and a pharma industry lobby body. A new deal is now due and it is therefore timely to re-examine Ireland’s threshold, how it is set and transparency around adherence to it. Previous research has noted a series of problems with the threshold, including that it is likely too high relative to the opportunity cost of unmet need in Ireland’s health system. This means reimbursement at the threshold may do net harm to population health. The high threshold may also mean the Irish health system is failing to satisfy existing legislation on healthcare resource allocation. Recent COVID-19 related pressures on healthcare capacity and public spending appear to increase the urgency for an evidence-based revision of threshold to better reflect opportunity costs within the Irish healthcare system. Despite these problems, the prospects for reform of the threshold do not appear strong as the political and institutional incentives may favour the status quo. At the very least, the State should provide greater transparency regarding how the threshold is set and adhered to. In the longer run, there may be good arguments for partially abandoning thresholds in favour of an auction process to achieve the lowest cost per QALY from new drug interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,cost-effectiveness analysis|Cost-effectiveness threshold|drug pricing,2021-06-02T19:48:06.832744,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-02T19:45:54.987989,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.lobbying.ie/,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,James,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/citation/,75rjm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b4f2df9096b7016d640ccb/,60b4f2df9096b7016d640ccb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rjm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75rjm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75rjm

In this paper, focusing specifically on class mobility in European nations and the US, we aim, first of all, to identify the main empirical regularities that have emerged from research, making the now standard distinction between absolute and relative mobility. Next, we review existing theories of mobility, which in fact antedate a good deal of this research, and note the main shortcomings that have become evident in these theories, but also elements of them that might still be built upon. We then set out our own theory of intergenerational class mobility and seek to show how it can account for the empirical regularities previously described, while also pointing both to additional evidence that supports it and to ways in which it is open to further empirical test. Finally, we consider some more general implications of the theory and, on this basis, venture some – conditional – predictions on the future of class mobility in more advanced societies. We do not suppose that our theory is in any sense a ‘final’ one but believe that it improves our understanding of research findings in the field as they currently stand and that further research aimed at its critical evaluation would prove profitable.",TRUE,FALSE,Comparative research|Education|Inequality of opportunity|Social class|Social mobility,2021-06-01T09:27:42.557656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-01T07:22:36.676124,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/citation/,tysqa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b4dec33a6df1016cd4da76/,60b4dec33a6df1016cd4da76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tysqa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tysqa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tysqa

Multiple household surveys indicate that the lockdown and the economic recession that followed led to a severe nutrition crisis. Food deprivation was most intense during the national lockdown but continued throughout the year. Relief measures helped, but they compensated for just a fraction of people’s income losses, even among poor households. It is doubtful that employment, income and nutrition among informal-sector workers and their families ever regained their pre-lockdown levels before a second wave of the Covid-19 epidemic hit the country in early 2021. The Indian government’s failure to put in place more effective relief measures is a serious denial of people’s right to food. With relief measures off the table in 2021, at the time of writing, there is a serious danger of another wave of intense food deprivation.

However, we still know little about how prevalent non-standard employment is amongst parents, and whether its negative consequences are further transmitted to their children. Using data from the German Microcensus, we provide a detailed account of the prevalence of fixed-term employment and non-standard work schedules in households with children in Germany. Second, we examine the extent to which variation in this temporal dimension of parents’ employment is associated with their children’s educational attainment. We find that fixed-term contracts and non-standard work schedules have become a prominent feature of households with children in Germany, reflecting the country’s dualized labor market. In about half of all German households with children in lower secondary education, at least one parent has a short fixed-term contract or regularly works on evenings or Saturdays. Moreover, the educational disadvantage of children in these families is alarmingly high. Depending on the concentration of parental non-standard employment in the household, children of parents with fixed-term contracts or non-standard work schedules have a 5 to 16 percent lower probability of entering the academic educational track than children with parents in standard employment, net of parents’ social class, income and education. Based on these results, we argue that the temporal dimension of parental employment is key to understanding how changing labor markets reshape the opportunity structure for children from disadvantaged parental backgrounds and the intergenerational transmission of inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,Atypical employment|Educational inequality|Fixed-term employment|Inequality of opportunity|Intergenerational social mobility|Labor market inequality|Non-standard employment|Precarious work|Social inequality|Sociology of work|Work schedules,2021-05-31T08:41:03.222098,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-31T08:17:58.331177,FALSE,NA,no,"The analyses of this paper rely on the following Scientific Use Files (SUF) of the German Microcensus: DOI: 10.21242/12211.2008.00.00.3.1.0; 10.21242/12211.2009.00.00.3.1.0; 10.21242/12211.2010.00.00.3.1.0; 10.21242/12211.2011.00.00.3.1.0;
