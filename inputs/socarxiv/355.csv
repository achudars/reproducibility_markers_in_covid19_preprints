This is probably one of the most frequently asked questions in the history of human kind. Moral decisions can be very hard in particularly when people are just starting their adventure with an adult life, that is, in their early 20’s. This report shows the moral condition of academic youth from one of the most religious regions in Poland. Therefore, the focus of this study was to show the relationship between religion and morality of young Poles. This article presents the results of a survey study conducted among 139 students of the University of Rzeszow attending the 2006/2007 academic year. The results showed that the morality of surveyed students seems to depend in a high degree on circumstances of situations (i.e., moderate moral relativism) rather than absolute norms. Moreover, the comparison of the results of this study with previous questionnaire research conducted at the same institution in mid-90’s show that religion has smaller impact on moral choices of academic youth from Subcarpathia province. Importantly, this study shows that more students reported overall weaker role of religion in their lives than it was observed previously.",TRUE,FALSE,academic youth|morality|postmodernism|religion|secularization,2019-06-19T14:45:48.192832,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-19T14:45:21.785689,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,Rafal M.

Prior research, from a range of contexts, has also yielded inconsistent results. We contribute to this debate by using harmonized data and methods to examine the effects of exposure to conflict on preferred and observed fertility outcomes across a spatially and temporally extensive population. We use high-resolution georeferenced data from 25 sub-Saharan African countries, combining records of violent events from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset with data on fertility goals and outcomes from the Demographic and Health Surveys (n=368,765 women aged 15-49 years). We estimate a series of linear and logistic regression models to assess the effects of exposure to conflict events on ideal family size and the probability of childbearing within the 12 months prior to the interview. We find that, on average, exposure to armed conflict leads to modest reductions in both respondents’ preferred family size and their probability of recent childbearing. Many of these effects are heterogeneous between demographic groups and across contexts, which suggests systematic differences in women’s vulnerability or preferred responses to armed conflict. Additional analyses suggest that conflict-related fertility declines may be driven by delays or reductions in marriage. These results contribute new evidence about the demographic effects of conflict and their underlying mechanisms, and broadly underline the importance of studying the many second-order effects of organized violence on vulnerable populations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-16T20:48:22.445693,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-16T20:47:54.288586,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",Brian Thiede|Matthew Hancock|Ahmed Kodouda|and James Piazza,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/citation/,4c9b2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d06a4007b8c4d001a9d04d9/,5d06a4007b8c4d001a9d04d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4c9b2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4c9b2,NA

However, the vast majority of research has only evaluated support for one form of natural resource use at a time. The little research that has explored support for a wide variety of uses has found that residents are likely to support many of the suggested forms of development. We assessed rural resident support for seven forms of natural resource development: commercial logging, natural gas, mining, real estate, wind energy, tourism, and outdoor recreation. Using social exchange theory, this study examines the influence of perceived impacts of development, industry trust, and perceived industry power on general support for the seven forms of natural resource-related economic development using a fixed effects generalized linear model among a sample of residents of rural Pennsylvania communities. Additionally, we use mixed logit discreet choice modeling to evaluate the drivers of relative support, meaning a stated preference for one form of development over other possible options.

To date, however, the drivers of these between-country patters in health inequalities remain largely unknown. In this analysis, we draw on data from 17 European countries to explore whether inequalities in political participation, that is, inequalities in voting by educational attainment, are correlated with health inequalities. Over and above a range of relevant confounders, such as GDP, income inequality, health spending, social protection spending, poverty rates, and smoking, greater inequalities in political participation remain correlated with higher health inequalities. If ‘politicians and officials are under no compulsion to pay much heed to classes and groups of citizens that do not vote’ then political inequalities could indirectly affect health through its impact on policy choices that determine who has access to the resources necessary for a healthy life.

Combining insights from hermeneutic theories of the self and pragmatist theories of action, we develop a theoretical position that challenges dichotomous assumptions about whether motive accounts reflect either justifications or motivations for action, instead illustrating how they can migrate from one status to the other over time. We develop this perspective through a comparative

Evidence of the effects of changing temperatures and precipitation on children’s nutritional status nonetheless remains limited. Research addressing this knowledge gap is merited given the short- and long-run consequences of malnutrition. We address this issue by estimating the effects of temperature and precipitation anomalies on the weight and wasting status of children ages 0-59 months across 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Linear regression models show that high temperatures and low precipitation are associated with reductions in child weight, and that high temperatures also lead to increased risk of wasting. We find little evidence of substantively meaningful differences in these effects across sub-populations of interest.

Women may be pushed out of computing in their youth, but they can come back—and they do. Using data from in-depth interviews with women graduates of coding bootcamps (accelerated programs that teach beginners digital skills), this study provides empirical data on how and why women enter computing later in life, often after having non-technical degrees and careers. This study finds that to successfully enter the computing workforce, women must arrive at three end states, which are often achieved via three transitions: “I can’t code” to “I may code;” “I’m on another path” to “I want to code;” and “I can code” to “I do code.” In addition, this study finds surprising evidence of women choosing to enter computing for better pay and work-life balance, in contrast to research that suggests women leave for these reasons.

We present a placebo-controlled field experiment conducted in Soweto, South Africa, that randomly varies exposure to inequality in low socio-economic settings. We find that willingness to sign a petition that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy increases in the presence of a high-status car. To probe the generality of the experimental finding, we combine a representative geo-referenced survey with neighborhood-level census-derived measures of local inequality, a proxy for direct encounters with tangible reminders of economic inequality.

Design/methodology/approach – Bank specific data are taken from the Bank Scope database and macroeconomic data are collected from International Financial Statistics. Using a panel data series of 30 banks for the period of 2005 to 2011, the study shows the evidence of structural break for the crisis year as well as the factors that impact the profitability of Islamic banks.
Findings – The performance of GCC Islamic banks was significantly influenced during the crisis period by capital adequacy, credit risk, financial risk, operational efficiency, liquidity, bank size, gross domestic product, growth rate of money supply, bank sector development and inflation rate. The study also finds that there is a structural change before and after the global financial crisis.
Originality/value – This is an original study that shows that the shariah compliant banks have performed better during the crisis and are not affected based on their internal performance records; rather, they have been affected indirectly from the macro shock due to the overall economic crisis.",TRUE,FALSE,GCC region|Global Financial Crisis|Islamic Banking|ROA|Shariah compliance,2019-06-15T15:50:27.622833,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-15T15:50:07.499655,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/citation/,vahtz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xnw79/,xnw79,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d022f4d760f110018fbf2d5/,5d022f4d760f110018fbf2d5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vahtz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vahtz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vahtz,NA

Design/methodology/approach – This study collected primary data from 109 departments and agencies under 24 federal ministries in Malaysia. The data were analysed under descriptive statistics, ordinal regression, and structural equation modelling (SEM). Several diagnostic tests were conducted to check the validity and reliability of data and models, such as Cronbach alpha test, Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test, Shapiro Wilk test, Internal Consistency Reliability, Indicator Reliability, Convergent Validity, and Discriminant Validity, etc.
Findings - The regression and SEM results show that the practices of integrity system and leadership quality had statistically significant positive relationship, but the practice of internal control system showed mixed relationship with the practices of accountability.
Practical implications - The findings of the study will help the policy makers to ensure better accountability in the public sector in Malaysia and other countries.
