computerization and global interconnectedness, has spawned new forms of
societal self-observations. In the present article I turn to the example of
Open Data web portals—specialized websites that make large amounts of
governmental datasets publicly available—to show how they relate to the
status quo of social research on functional differentiation. For my
analysis of the Chilean Portal de Datos Públicos I developed a method to
link metadata categories from the web portal to a hard-core list of ten
function systems. My results confirm literature, which finds economized or
politicized forms of societal self-description. Moreover the results are in
line with studies that show the vanishing role of religion. Interestingly,
my study finds health to be of high importance—I might even speak of a
“healthized” self-observation—which I argue is at odds with a negligible
representation of the function system “sport” within the self-observation.
For future interfunctional social research in the time of datafication, I
recommend sharpening the empirical approach by exploring emerging text-as-
data methods.

Using the American Community Survey 2009-2011 pooled data, we find that married, first generation Asian immigrant women’s employment rates are higher when they live with parents or parents-in-law. Further, hampered by housework and care work, these women apparently receive some support in particular from female extended adults providing child care assistance – especially in families with young children. On the other hand, we find a negative association between the presence of disabled adults only for Koreans, and employed extended adults’ support varies across nationality groups.

Using administrative data on child protection, criminal justice, and social welfare interventions, I show that children are separated from their families and placed into foster care far more frequently in states with extensive and punitive criminal justice systems than in states with broad and generous welfare programs. However, large welfare bureaucracies interact with welfare program enrollment to create opportunities for the surveillance of families, suggesting that extensive and administratively complex welfare states engage in “soft” social control through the surveillance and regulation of family behavior. The article further shows that  institutionalization, a particularly restrictive form of foster care placement, is least common in states with broad and generous welfare regimes and generally more common under punitive regimes. Taken together, these findings show that policy regimes influence the interaction between families and the state through their proximate effects on family structure and well-being and through institutional effects that delimit the routines and scripts through which policymakers and street-level bureaucrats intervene to protect children.",TRUE,FALSE,Child Welfare|Criminal Justice|Political sociology|Preprint|socarxiv|Social policy|Welfare State,2018-07-02T10:45:15.822598,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-14T02:22:00.406000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/citation/,47u29,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wpvhd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/relationships/node/,wpvhd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786f749594d9001f119db33/,5786f749594d9001f119db33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47u29/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/47u29/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/47u29,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122416638652

Measuring urban residents’  willingness to coexist with animals,"In the context of rapid urbanisation, geographers are calling for embracing non-humans as urban co-inhabitants, but notions of animals and plants ‘out of place’ manifest in wildlife conflicts. To find paths towards more-than-human cities, we need to better understand residents’ willingness to coexist. This study quantitatively compared residents’ preferences toward sharing their neighbourhood and perceptions of belonging across urban green space in two geographically and culturally distinct cities: Brisbane, Australia and Sapporo, Japan. Results suggest factors influencing respondents’ willingness to coexist were geographical and cultural context alongside educational attainment and age, but not sex and income. Mapping respondents’ preferences for animals in their neighbourhood revealed four categories divided by two axes – global-local and wanted-unwanted animals – arising from the way animals contested human notions of control over urban space. Most respondents chose informal green space (e.g., vacant lots, brownfields etc.) as spaces of belonging after forests and bushland. Drawing upon recent theoretical and empirical research on liminal urban spaces, I argue with Nohl (1990) that such informal green space can offer ‘provisional arrangements’, allowing for conciliatory engagements with non-humans. I thus propose informal green space as territories of encounter – a possible path towards more-than-human cities. Finally, I discuss some implications for planning and management of interspecies interactions.",TRUE,FALSE,Australia|belonging|geography|human-nonhuman relations|informal greenspace|Japan|Preprint|socarxiv|urban geography,2018-07-02T10:49:13.479413,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-14T01:10:15.976000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/citation/,hbcmz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5a7ge/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/relationships/node/,5a7ge,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786e6796c613b01fadc53e2/,5786e6796c613b01fadc53e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbcmz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hbcmz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hbcmz,https://doi.org/10.11143/fennia.64182

Social networking sites have been critical for linking potential supporters and distributing information. In addition to Facebook pages on the Wall Street Occupation, more than 400 unique pages have been established in order to spread the movement across the US, including at least one page in each of the 50 states. These Facebook pages facilitate the creation of local encampments and the organization of protests and marches to oppose the existing economic and political system. '

Based on data acquired from Facebook, we find that Occupy groups have recruited over 170,000 active Facebook users and more than 1.4 million “likes” in support of Occupations. By October 22, Facebook pages related to the Wall Street Occupation had accumulated more than 390,000 “likes”, while almost twice that number, more than 770,000, have been expressed for the 324 local sites. Most new Occupation pages were started between September 23th and October 5th. On October 11th, occupy activity on Facebook peaked with 73,812 posts and comments to an occupy page in a day. By October 22nd, there had been 1,170,626 total posts or comments associated with Occupation pages. The density of Facebook activism is highest in college towns and in state capitals.

Why did student loans expand so much in the U.S. in the 1990s and 2000s? And how does organization theory suggest their expansion, and the growth of federal student aid more generally, might affect higher education as a field? In the 1960s and 70s, policy actors worked to solve what was then a central problem around student loans: banks' disinterest in lending to students. They did this so well that by 1990, a new field of financial aid policy emerged, in which all major actors had an interest in expanding loans. This, along with a favorable environment outside the field, set the stage for two decades of rapid growth. Organization theory suggests two likely consequences of this expansion of federal student loans and financial aid more generally. First, while (public) colleges have become less dependent on state governments and more dependent on tuition, the expansion of aid means colleges are simultaneously becoming more dependent on the federal government, which should make them more susceptible to federal demands for accountability. Second, the expansion of federal student aid should encourage the spread of forms and practices grounded in a logic focused on students' financial value to the organization, such as publicly traded for-profit colleges and enrollment management practices.",TRUE,FALSE,financialization|higher education|organizations|Preprint|public policy|socarxiv|student loans,2018-07-02T10:48:28.503505,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-14T00:33:44.971000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/citation/,chaq2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ssj6a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/relationships/node/,ssj6a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786ddeab83f6901e9a299ab/,5786ddeab83f6901e9a299ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chaq2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/chaq2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/chaq2,NA

The analysis was based primarily on ten semi-structured hour-long interviews conducted with MySpace users—all young people between 16 and 19 years of age from two UK schools, supplemented by a questionnaire and examination of the texts they produced. An overview is given of the nature of the profiles created by the interviewees. The process of profile creation and maintenance is then placed in the wider context of the uses of MySpace as described by those interviewed, and some of the influences which appear to have shaped
what was produced are outlined. In the conclusion, the implications of the manner in which these practices are shaped for institutions involved in digital storytelling are explored.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:19.163243,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-13T22:30:23.496000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/citation/,4ucbz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/95bcg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/relationships/node/,95bcg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786c1009ad5a101f2a765da/,5786c1009ad5a101f2a765da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ucbz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ucbz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4ucbz,NA
