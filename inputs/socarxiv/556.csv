Finding Voters That Use Candidate Localness As A Cue For Their Vote Choices,"The literature on candidate selection has found that voters favour local candidates, as they are thought to be more apt to represent their constituents. An important caveat is that it requires for a voter to have knowledge of the candidatesâ€™ characteristics, and to value localism. Previous research concentrates on candidate characteristics, leaving unanswered the question of who considers localism to be important when making their vote choices. This research fills the gap by showing that not all voters care in the same degree and magnitude about localism. We test this argument analysing data from the British Election Survey 2015 using multilevel models. Results show that voters who feel stronger about their distinctive regional identities care significantly more about localism. Additionally, this effect is different when the party system includes a party that explicitly channels these feelings, suggesting that the advantage of local candidates is dependent on the context of party competition.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:36:43.901761,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-24T16:52:37.353343,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/citation/,j5rpy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vytcj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/relationships/node/,vytcj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a67c7ff3623a3000d61f88c/,5a67c7ff3623a3000d61f88c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j5rpy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j5rpy,NA

After presenting a typical Bitcoin transaction workflow, a general blockchain state representation is derived. It is demonstrated that the proper mathematical object defining the state of a blockchain is a topological fiber bundle, because it is not possible to globally `parametrize' blocks (or ledgers of blocks) by time due to their dependence upon cryptographic hash functions. In addition, we specify a general transition function between blockchain states that is agnostic to the consensus mechanism used to write blocks into the ledger, and which is probabilistic in nature, so that blockchain may be regarded as a probabilistic state machine. We then interpret agents (both human and code-based, such as `chaincode', `smart contracts', or other artificial intelligence) as automata interacting with blockchain technology, drawing upon the theory of non-cooperative repeated interaction games. Finally, blockchain as a hierarchy of state machines is defined, and future research directions are presented using this hierarchy as a point of departure for modeling blockchain dynamics.",TRUE,FALSE,Bitcoin|Blockchain|Finite Automata|Game Theory|State Machine|Topology,2018-07-02T11:36:43.258174,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-23T14:30:57.623144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/citation/,eusxg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hbmje/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/relationships/node/,hbmje,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a66ee943623a3000e615e8e/,5a66ee943623a3000e615e8e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eusxg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eusxg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eusxg,NA

While the spatial concentration of the poor is undoubtedly an important aspect of the story around urban inequality, concentrated poverty research suffers from a number of conceptual and methodological shortcomings. Through a case study of concentrated poverty and affluence in Lexington, Kentucky, this paper draws on relational socio-spatial theory and critical GIS in order to offer a constructive critique of conventional concentrated poverty research. The paper demonstrates that while concentrated poverty and affluence are both on the rise in recent years, concentrated affluence actually represents a more widespread problem within the city.

Theoretical models suggest that cultural variation among ethnic groups can be maintained if inter-ethnic interaction is curtailed, or if groups are balanced in size and prestige. However, inter-ethnic interaction often takes place between members of groups that differ in size and prestige, as well as in power. We construct a model to examine the effects of ethnic asymmetries in inter-ethnic coordination benefits on changes in the frequency of cultural norms in a population comprising minority and majority ethnic groups. In the absence of other processes, conditions favourable for the sustainability of minority culture may be broadened through establishment of a territory with a border that is permeable to members of a dis-empowered minority group, but not to members of a powerful majority. We show how model predictions can complement empirical studies of cultural change, and demonstrate the model's relevance to our understanding of norm dynamics in an indigenous Amazonian population.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonia|cultural evolution|ethnicity|minorities|norms|territory,2018-07-02T11:35:35.247378,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-19T14:29:00.596399,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/citation/,bpgt3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8be5z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/relationships/node/,8be5z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a61dd3c94ef6d000f614bf1/,5a61dd3c94ef6d000f614bf1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bpgt3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bpgt3,NA

Using linear probability model and survival analysis, we find that unemployment benefits have a significantly negative effect on switching from unemployment to self-employment and a positive effect on the duration before the switch, especially on the unincorporated self-employment. Moreover, unemployed individuals are less likely to start a business after being laid off, if their spouse does not have a job or most people expect the unemployment rate to go down in the coming 12 months.",TRUE,FALSE,Entrepreneurship|Expectation|Unemployment benefits,2018-07-02T11:35:33.682205,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-19T14:27:08.853421,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,Wenjian Xu,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/citation/,5dahz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zs8a4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/relationships/node/,zs8a4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a615278ec5af0000e09270c/,5a615278ec5af0000e09270c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dahz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5dahz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5dahz,NA

Interviews revealed intervention and risk assessment strategies structured around an outdated, maladaptive concept of domestic abuse as an unambiguous and violent event and frontline services that lacked appreciation of the power dynamics inherent in controlling relationships. The analysis demonstrates how lack of definitional clarity around non-physical domestic abuse can increase the use of discretion by frontline services and, by extension, increase the discounting of coercive control by pressured frontline officers.",TRUE,FALSE,domestic abuse; coercive control; police; social work,2018-07-02T11:35:32.430105,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-18T15:03:31.268464,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/citation/,8cz5a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j32tr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/relationships/node/,j32tr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a6080ab36dfd00011a7cc68/,5a6080ab36dfd00011a7cc68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8cz5a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8cz5a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8cz5a,NA

As part of its regulatory duties, the FDA provides guidance documents on various regulatory topics as mandated by the U.S. code of federal regulations. Since 2015, the FDA has begun to issue many substantial revisions to their guidance documents that directly affects the regulatory framework on biocompatibility, reprocessing, and sterilization.

These regulatory issues are of paramount importance for many companies because of the potential high costs involved in changing their internal design, controls, manufacturing, and quality systems. This masterâ€™s thesis examines the various changes made by the FDA in recent years on the inter-related topics of biocompatibility, reprocessing, and sterilization. Some of the major changes by the FDA involve an increase in the importance of chemical characterization, a reduction in the use of animal testing, a requirement for an independent validation of the user instructions for reusable devices, and increased usability testing.

The principal reasons for these major policy changes by the FDA are shown to be the major device scandals that recently involved duodenoscopes, metal-on-metal hip implants, and vaginal surgical mesh implants. Along with several other regulatory failures that made national news headlines in the United States, the FDA began to revise several of their previous medical device guidances. The information from this masterâ€™s thesis can be used by medical device developers and manufacturers, especially when they are located outside of the United States and lack sufficient regulatory affairs resources to provide independent advice and recommendations on these important FDA changes. A thorough analysis is made of the new FDA guidances to clarify several potentially difficult questions for medical device manufacturers, specifically the following: (1) ""Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, â€˜Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process"", (2) ""Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and Labeling"", and (3) ""Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile"". This masterâ€™s thesis is intended to provide not only an overview of the current FDA requirements, but to function as a guide for both researchers and engineers to improve their medical device design and development process.",TRUE,FALSE,biocompatibility|Fda|regulatory affairs|reprocessing|sterilization,2018-07-02T11:35:31.703569,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-18T04:33:25.220059,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/citation/,stb7e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rbfae/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/relationships/node/,rbfae,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a5fe96ae1dab9000eec2fe2/,5a5fe96ae1dab9000eec2fe2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stb7e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/stb7e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/stb7e,NA
