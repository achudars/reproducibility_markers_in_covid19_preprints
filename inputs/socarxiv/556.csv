However, studying crime and place is often made more difficult by restrictions on access to appropriate crime data. This means understanding of many spatio-temporal crime patterns are limited to data from a single geographic setting, and there are few attempts at replication. This article introduces the Crime Open Database (CODE), a database of 16 million offenses from 10 of the largest United States cities over 11 years and more than 60 offense types. Open crime data were obtained from each city, having been published in multiple incompatible formats. The data were processed to harmonize geographic co-ordinates, dates and times, offense categories and location types, as well as adding census and other geographic identifiers. The resulting database allows the wider study of spatio-temporal patterns of crime across multiple US cities, allowing greater understanding of variations in the relationships between crime and place across different settings, as well as facilitating replication of research.",TRUE,FALSE,crime and place|crime data|geography of crime|open data|police data,2018-08-14T01:32:45.273090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-14T01:32:22.677766,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",NA,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/citation/,9y7qz,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qpc5v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/relationships/node/,qpc5v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7092593e03fb0018d4fdb5/,5b7092593e03fb0018d4fdb5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9y7qz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9y7qz/,https://doi.org/10.1163/24523666-00401007,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9y7qz

While the Alt Right has been around in some form since 2008, over the last year we have seen it grow from a small and insignificant white nationalist movement to a broad and seemingly growing street movement, able to unite and mobilise hundreds of far right protesters, both old and new to the movement.The question is, how has this happened? How have the Alt Right been able to go from insignificance
to such a potent movement so quickly?
In this paper I use a combination of Bourdieu’s field theory, and Hacking’s dynamic nominalism, to work towards a way of answering that question. Beginning with the neoliberal turn of the late 20th Century, I argue that the associated establishment of economic power above all else has opened the door for those with significant economic capital to transfer that into political power; that in doing so a crisis of political legitimacy has been created that throws the established order of political capital into question, and opens for door for new, more extreme, forms to gain power; and that the creation and legitimation of the Alt Right by media and political experts has created a new kind of political actor, that gives space on the far right for those who would not otherwise have been engaged.",NA,NA,Alt-Right|Bourdieu|Charlottesville|Far Right|Hacking|Neoliberalism,NA,2019-08-23T13:08:13.670354,,TRUE,withdrawn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,https://socopen.org/2019/05/26/socarxiv-policy-on-withdrawing-papers/,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/py92t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/py92t/bibliographic_contributors/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/py92t/review_actions/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/py92t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/py92t/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/py92t

We test these claims with a novel dataset that captures the emotive language used in over 400 party manifestos across eight European countries. As predicted, we find that incumbent parties, particularly incumbent prime ministerial parties, use more positive sentiment than opposition parties. We find that ideologically moderate parties employ higher levels of positive sentiment than extremist parties.

Participation in a cult of personality is psychologically costly whenever it involves preference falsification, with the costs varying across individuals. Importantly, low psychological costs of preference falsification are correlated with traits the dictator values, such as unscrupulousness and ruthlessness, which we collectively term disposition-based competence. Under a wide variety of circumstances, this correlation makes participation in cults of personality informative from the dictator's point of view, allowing him to hire loyal and competent subordinates for the most important regime positions.

In this paper we incorporate both processes to shed a new light on a classic concern in the sociology of stratification: how are adolescents’ aspirations, expectations, and school performance shaped by the combined socioeconomic contexts of family, school and neighborhood life? Theoretically, social contexts provide children with cultural resources that may foster their ambitions and bolster their academic performance. Reference group theory instead highlights how seemingly positive settings can depress educational performance as well as aspirations and expectations. We empirically test these competing claims, drawing on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) which describes the school and neighborhood trajectories of 7,934 British children followed from birth to adolescence. We find that, generally, childhood school and neighborhood deprivation is negatively associated with adolescents’ school performance, aspirations and expectations for their future, in line with the cultural resource perspective. However, there are important exceptions to this pattern which point to reference group processes for (1) children of highly-educated parents, whose academic performance especially suffers from growing up in a poor neighborhood, and (2) for children from low-educated parents, whose academic aspirations and expectations are unexpectedly high when they either went to an affluent school or lived in an affluent neighborhood—but not both.

“Egg aging” (卵子の老化) has been the key concept in the campaign. This concept is originally a term of biology for the degeneration of eggs (or female germ cells) owing to a long delay in the process of meiotic division. As it acquired popularity, the concept widened its connotation. “Egg aging” today is not limited to the degeneration of germ cells, but covers a wide range of fertility problems experienced by women of an advanced age. It now serves as a magic phrase to represent many aspects of latent biological mechanisms of declining fertility.

In the course of the media campaign, fake knowledge about human reproduction has become popular in books, magazines, and websites giving an impression that it is based on scientific grounds. These are targeted at youths' perception of their body and thereby have an impact on their sexual behavior and family planning. We can regard this as a violation against reproductive rights because it disrupts the reproductive decision-making process with misinformation. It also damages public trust in the medical profession, which will eventually harm the social health system.

This brochure, Unscientific Visual Representations Used for the Egg Aging Campaign in 2010s Japan, is a product of the research project “Unscientific knowledge and the egg aging panic” funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI #17K02069 for fiscal 2017-2019). This project is run by Tanaka Sigeto, an associate professor at Tohoku University, to explore the courses, contexts, and consequences of the egg aging campaign. According to a literature survey of both academic and popular writings, this brochure introduces some instances of visual representations used in the campaign and explains how they have been widespread in the Japanese society to affect governmental policies and public opinions.",TRUE,FALSE,Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale (CFKS)|education|egg aging|fabrication|falsification|fecundability|fecundity|fertility|gender|government|International Fertility Decision-Making Study (IFDMS)|Japan|life-planning|media|ovarian aging|ovarian reserve|pronatalist policy|reproductive medicine,2018-08-12T11:35:04.331137,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-12T11:34:47.817521,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",NA,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/citation/,xyvsa,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7f9wk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/relationships/node/,7f9wk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6e694590a7e00017867cb4/,5b6e694590a7e00017867cb4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyvsa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xyvsa/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xyvsa

Persons engaged in the sex industry are at greater risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections than the general population. One major factor is exposure to higher levels of risky sexual activity. Expanding condom use is a critical prevention strategy, but this requires negotiation with those buying sex, which takes place in the context of cultural and economic constraints. Impoverished individuals who fear violence are more likely to forego condoms.

Methods
Here we tested the hypotheses that poverty and fear of violence are two structural drivers of HIV infection risk in the sex industry. Using data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Bank for 30 countries, we evaluated poverty, measured using the average income per day per person in the bottom 40% of the income distribution, and gender violence, measured using homicide rates in women and the proportion of women exposed to violence in the last 12 months and/or since age 16 years.

Results
We found that HIV prevalence among those in the sex industry was higher in countries where there were greater female homicide rates (β = 0.86; P = 0.018) and there was some evidence that self‐reported exposure to violence was also associated with higher HIV prevalence (β = 1.37; P = 0.043). Conversely, HIV prevalence was lower in countries where average incomes among the poorest were greater (β = −1.05; P = 0.046).

Conclusions
Our results are consistent with the theory that reducing poverty and exposure to violence may help reduce HIV infection risk among persons engaged in the sex industry.",TRUE,FALSE,gender violence|HIV|poverty,2018-08-10T14:34:41.096085,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-10T14:34:20.791116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,NA,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/citation/,gm8w2,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6y4e8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/relationships/node/,6y4e8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6d8ea152fa4200195c658c/,5b6d8ea152fa4200195c658c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gm8w2/,https://doi.org/10.1111/hiv.12520,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gm8w2
