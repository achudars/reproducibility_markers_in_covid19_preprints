Indeed, news translation is considered to be understudied in the field of translation. The current research aims at identifying the types of category shifts that have occurred and the most employed ones in the selected corpus.This study offers also an understanding of the category shifts that occur concerning translating news reports or stories. Accordingly, the study will explore the translation of a news article from English into Arabic; the news article titled 'North Korea 'preparing rocket launch', images suggest' is published on BBC news website 9 March 2019 together with its translation which was found on the BBC Arabic news website. To attain the research objectives, a comparative investigation of the English source text and the Arabic target text will be needed to look into the use of category shifts following Catford's typology of category shifts. This study adopted a qualitative and quantitative method in identifying what kinds of category shifts occurred and the most frequent ones in the analyzed news text. The findings show that all types of category shifts were employed in the translation with a total of 35 shifts. The most employed type of category shift is structural shifts which are exemplified through 16 cases. These structural shifts are illustrated in word-order, passive-active, or nominal-verbal sentence structures. The least applied category shifts in the process of translation are class shifts which indicate that the translator found target text equivalences that have the same part of speech of the source text items. The study concludes that category shifts were employed in the translation to fill the linguistic gap between the two languages.",TRUE,FALSE,category shifts|Catford's typology|English-Arabic translation|media news translation,2020-06-18T01:40:42.665825,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:40:16.016750,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/citation/,bvg4d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb2b59c67d3000aa1faf0e/,5edb2b59c67d3000aa1faf0e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvg4d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bvg4d/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no2.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bvg4d

Important though, in Algerian English as Foreign Language (EFL) literature classrooms, metaphor plays a peripheral role in education, as it scarcely appears either as part and parcel device in literature analysis or as a means for strengthening the understanding of poetry. However, even in those literary spaces where it visibly manifests itself, learning the metaphoric language does not touch a chord with the learners. The persistent issue is that many Algerian instructors are still employing threadbare, transmissive modes of instruction that fail deceptively to reach satisfying scholarly ends. In this sense, the fulcrum aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of re-positing metaphor inside the poetry curriculum. Correspondingly, it proposes the integrated-model as a state-of-art teaching framework. The primary question that this study seeks to answer is whether teaching poetry via an integrated approach may act as a stimulus for enhancing students’ Metaphoric Competence (MC). The secondary subsidiary endeavour is to diagnose the different intricacies that the learners confront along that process. Guided by these incentives, the researcher has carried an empirical study (pre/posttest) with forty-first year EFL Algerian students from Tlemcen University using four poems as evaluative materials. To analyze the effectiveness of the experiment using SPSS, the inquirer has opted for the Paired-Samples t-Test to check whether the paradigm shift in the same group of participants’ grades is statistically significant or not. Substantially, this study reveals that the implementation of an integrated framework to instruct poetry provides a springboard for remarkable betterments in the area of MC. This progress is evidenced by its ability to revitalize the learners’ cognitive potentials to comprehend, interpret, and evaluate conceptual metaphors embedded in poetry. In an unfavourable note, this study has also dropped the veil on some language difficulties that the students face in the course of metaphor analysis, that stem mainly from the low exposure to the target language (TL), and the poor engagement with the different literary modes of expression. Finally, for the hope of honing (MC) inside the Algerian EFL classes, it is fervently recommended that the teachers assist their learners actively in well-defined figurative-oriented assignments that focus on raising the awareness of the L2 conceptual mapping. Technological aids are also a solicited constructive teaching material that may make poetry draw a new breath of life inside the classroom and beyond.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL literature classroom|metaphor|metaphoric competence|poetry curriculum|the integrated approach,2020-06-18T01:42:11.773791,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:41:33.462309,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/citation/,qfcxj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb276a08aad30091441067/,5edb276a08aad30091441067,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfcxj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qfcxj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no2.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qfcxj

This paper discusses the use and informative significance of such funds in the framework of conflict studies in English fictional discourse. The phenomenon of conflict discourse multimodality, which combines several semiotic systems as particular modes of communication, helps to reveal the communicative and pragmatic value of verbal and nonverbal means of conflict settlement and resolution. The paper aims to determine how the nonverbal means of communication in conflict discourse influence the process of conflict interaction and what implications its interpretation has on conflict development and resolution. To achieve this, the study relies upon the analysis of semantic, formal, and functional peculiarities of nonverbal conflict-management mode in the structural organization of conflict fictional discourse. The analysis of nonverbal mode as a combination of different semiotic resources reveals that nonverbal conflict-management mode is represented by a specific set of patterns in English fictional discourse. Moreover, the process of conflict communication may be regulated nonverbally, governing, completing, strengthening, or resolving the conflict. The obtained results indicate that analysis of the nonverbal means in conflict fiction discourse with a focus on multimodal studies enables to get a true picture of the role of nonverbal conflict-management mode in the actual and potential realization of communicative strategies which in correlation with its pragmatic impact and some sociolinguistic features contribute to the influence on the process of conflict resolution and management.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-06T15:21:52.562322,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-06T15:21:06.040500,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/citation/,besjg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb263608aad30091440e7f/,5edb263608aad30091440e7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/besjg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/besjg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no2.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/besjg

It exposes Blyden’s ideas, a philosophy on Africans physical and intellectual emancipation, and points out the similarities in the thought of both men. Blyden toured different parts of West Africa and spoke with great intensity about the African problem and ways of its remedy.

This study examines the ideas and intellect of J.E.Casely Hayford and revealed that his thoughts were a potency of Edward Wilmot Blyden’s philosophy. An examination of his ideas reveals how Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford took an uncompromising stand against the derogatory and the glaring abuses of European colonialism. He shaped cultural nationalism that disdained the apparent repulsive and despotic colonial hegemony and fashioned a new outlook for fellow Africans to stand up as humans.

As a hypertext, the Quran transcends its function in the Arabic culture, and Qur’anic verses and phrases serve in literary works as pieces of advice and expressions of wisdom. This paper aims to compare the two English translations of Naguib Mahfouz’s Midaq Alley (1947), by Trevor Le Gassick (1966), and Humphery Davies (2011). The paper examines the rendition of allusions to Quran and explores the strategies deployed by the translators. The language used in the source text reflects the culture in which it is born and determines the ideologies of its users. Before Mahfouz won the Noble Prize in 1988, the Westerners were prejudiced “against Arabs and Islam,” and they considered Arabic literature as embargoed (Said, September 17, 1999). The paper hypothesizes that the purpose of the two translations of Midaq Alley is to transfer the Egyptian culture to the target reader (TR). The underpinning approach is skopos theory, whose principles are: skopos, coherence, and loyalty (Nord, 2018).  The paper queries how loyal each translator is to the ST and ST author to achieve functional adequacy. One finding shows that Le Gassick renders the Quranic allusions literally ignoring the SC; however, Davies either uses cultural equivalents or resorts to paraphrasing, reducing the image to its sense.

In this vein, Lefebvre identifies space as a physical entity that has a mental representation. He affirms that the physical space is the outcome of a set of values and experiences that reproduce society. Nevertheless, the mental space results from the power relations embedded within the physical one. The manipulation of these spaces produces a gendered one in which women are considered inferiors. This paper investigates the interplay between gender and space production along with the power relations they entail. It examines how this manipulation stimulates resistance precisely through discourse in Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid Tale (1985) and Oryx and Crake (2003). The research is carried out on Bakhtin’s concept of dialogism as a theoretical frame, relying on a combination of analytical as well as descriptive methods. This article concludes that gendered spaces are being manipulated by religious doctrines as well as corrupt political structures that aim to relegate females to marginal spaces in favor of their male counterparts.",TRUE,FALSE,Bakhtin’s dialogism|gendered space|Margaret Atwood|Oryx and Crake|The Handmaid’s Tale,2020-06-18T01:43:45.359051,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:43:21.750566,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/citation/,tg37v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb210f8b542600988bb2aa/,5edb210f8b542600988bb2aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg37v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tg37v/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no2.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tg37v

It also examines the existing relationship between the patterns of Arabic language in Algeria, since it was considered as a foreign language until 1947, chiefly through, highlighting the relationship between Classical Arabic among Algerian society, and the language policy (Arabization) pursued since wrenching independence and the linguistic repercussions of the colonization period on Algerian Arabic. In this respect, among other findings, a foremost issue raised to highlight such a critical phenomenon; and that later leads to question the different realities between the Algerian National Constitution and daily practices among users. In other words, the new generation speakers face a natural barrier communicating with post-independence schooled generation. In this sense, the former represents the 'Arabization' policy pursued in Algeria; whereas, the latter is 'francophone,' considering the linguistic as well as the sociolinguistic repercussions that might outcome such contact in a country famed by the use of French among its diplomats as a language of instruction and discourse, whether as a formal discourse or informal speech. The research methodology is based on early retrospect works to denote such cross- conflicting status raised as a significant issue. Finally, the study recommended a siné- qua- non question which is, when will Algerians put an end to the different linguistic situations inherited after gaining their political independence in 1962?",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-06T15:21:31.469021,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-06T15:20:47.411193,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/citation/,2ykdf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb201cc67d3000aa1f97bd/,5edb201cc67d3000aa1f97bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ykdf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2ykdf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no2.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2ykdf
