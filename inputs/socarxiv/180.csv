Real populations in these processes, however, are structured with internal classes or stages, and classes are sometimes created based on social differentiation. In this present work, information about the colonization of old Providence Island was used to create an agent-based model of the colonization process in a heterogeneous environment for a population with social differentiation. Agents were socially divided into two classes and modeled with dissimilar spatial clustering preferences. The model and simulations assessed the importance of gregarious behavior for colonization processes conducted in heterogeneous environments by socially-differentiated populations. Results suggest that in these conditions, the colonization process starts with an agent cluster in the largest and most suitable area. The spatial distribution of agents maintained a tendency toward randomness as simulation time increased, even when gregariousness values increased. The most conspicuous effects in agent clustering were produced by the initial conditions and behavioral adaptations that increased the agent capacity to access more resources and the likelihood of gregariousness. The approach presented here could be used to analyze past human colonization events or support long-term conceptual design of future human colonization processes with small social formations into unfamiliar and uninhabited environments.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Caribbean|Gregarious Behavior|Human Colonization|Settlement patterns|Social Differentiation,2020-09-26T19:22:20.933953,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:22:04.135118,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.comses.net/codebases/d5cfd5b6-6cfe-4dbc-ab9c-6fadb3ed688a/releases/1.0.0/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/citation/,7z6xp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6f7e0346080902f21b3d1c/,5f6f7e0346080902f21b3d1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7z6xp/,https://doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4433,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7z6xp

However, how are the algorithms for states’ legibility projects enacted, contested, and reconfigured? Drawing on interviews and media data, this study fills this gap by examining Health Code (jiankangma), the Chinese contact tracing and risk assessment algorithmic system that serves as the COVID-19 health passport. I first explore the intensive and invisible work and infrastructures that enact and stabilize Health Code’s sociotechnical assemblage. I then show how this assemblage is frequently challenged and destabilized by errors, breakdowns, and exclusions. Facing unintended engagements from heterogeneous social actors, local interests, and power hierarchies, Health Code reassembles into multiple and contradictory assemblages at different periods and social localities. Finally, I examine how people game and bypass the algorithm’s surveillance with their agencies. Recognizing this messiness and heterogeneity contributes to a more nuanced and realistic understanding of states’ use of algorithms, including the risks. Doing so also urges us to rethink the politics of citizenship and inequality in the digital age beyond inclusion.",TRUE,FALSE,Algorithms|China|Contact tracing|Covid-19|Risk assessment|Surveillance,2020-09-26T19:21:41.664164,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:21:17.014578,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d0a|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d0b|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies|Chinese Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/citation/,g3reu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s2zyn/,s2zyn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6f6cb846080902da1b496c/,5f6f6cb846080902da1b496c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g3reu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g3reu

Estimating their effect on topic prevalence and polarization in German state legislature,"Between 2008 and 2014, German politics experienced a shake-up by AfD’s move into the state parliaments. While many studies examine the party’s success factor in elections, only a few studies study the effect of the new party on parliamentary work. This thesis tests two hypotheses in this regard: First if the AfD set its primary focus on different policy areas than the other parties in the minor appellations and second if the entrance of the AfD leads to a higher polarization in a state parliament. We use the structural topic model to obtain topics for each appellation. To measure polarization, we rely on the expression of agreement and disagreement during a speech and a text classifier’s ability to distinguish between non-AfD and AfD speeches. As headline findings, we note that the AfD emphasizes policy areas in their appellations that provide the potential for populist statements such as extremism, migration, or law &amp; order. Secondly, polarization generally increases with the party’s entrance into a state parliament, but the influence varies with the measurement chosen.

Using a novel computational framework, where individual agents attempt to solve problems by modifying, combining and transmitting technologies in an open-ended search space, this paper re-evaluates two prominent explanations for the cultural evolution of technology: that humans are equipped with (i) social learning mechanisms for minimizing information loss during transmission, and (ii) creative mechanisms for generating novel technologies via combinatorial innovation. Here, both information loss and combinatorial innovation are introduced as parameters in the model, and then manipulated to approximate situations where technological evolution is either more cumulative or combinatorial. Compared to existing models, which tend to marginalize the role of purposeful problem-solving, this approach allows for indefinite growth in complexity while directly simulating constraints from history and computation. The findings show that minimizing information loss is only required when the dynamics are strongly cumulative and characterised by incremental innovation. Contrary to previous findings, when agents are equipped with a capacity for combinatorial innovation, low levels of information loss are neither necessary nor sufficient for populations to solve increasingly complex problems. Instead, higher levels of information loss are advantageous for unmasking the potential for combinatorial innovation. This points to a parsimonious explanation for the cultural evolution of technology without invoking separate mechanisms of stability and creativity.",TRUE,FALSE,combinatorial innovation|cultural evolution|cumulative culture|information loss|problem-solving|technological evolution,2020-09-26T19:14:01.727202,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:13:36.340176,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/j-winters/cetech,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/citation/,aypnx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q8jdu/,q8jdu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6ee5759e9a3d02e46e3c6e/,5f6ee5759e9a3d02e46e3c6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aypnx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aypnx

The change reflects an increased use of ornaments and an uneven distribution of ornaments in a pericolonial context.

This article supports this claim by combining social media (Study 1) and survey data (Study 2) analysis. Tracing 1.4 million tweets, we find that Trump's rhetoric has popularized racially charged coronavirus-related terms and that exclusionary, anti-Asian attitudes have increased in the U.S. since the pandemic began. Next, by analyzing repeated cross-sectional weekly surveys of Asian Americans from July 2019 to May 2020 (n=12,907), we find that the group has leaned more towards the Democratic Party since Trump first made inflammatory remarks towards Asian Americans. Whites, Blacks, and Latina/os, on the other hand, exhibited little and less consistent change in these democratic-related attitudes. Our findings suggest that experiences with social exclusion that are driven by elite sources further cement Asian Americans as Democrats.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian Americans|Covid-19|Partisanship|Social identity|Social media|Survey,2020-09-26T19:15:01.793293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:14:48.241222,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/citation/,dvm7r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6e91c546080902e01b0ef4/,5f6e91c546080902e01b0ef4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvm7r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dvm7r/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dvm7r

To understand how COVID-19 has influenced the practices of community-led urban agricultural spaces, we suggest future efforts take into consideration three essential areas of focus: uses of community gardening in combating food insecurity during a pandemic, changes in community garden operations as a response to crises, and community gardening's role in nurturing emotional well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-29T07:17:41.949219,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-29T07:17:27.040521,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|Food Security,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/citation/,6587c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6e6ced68d85002a98a0c18/,5f6e6ced68d85002a98a0c18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6587c/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6587c

We applied Specialized Questioning Techniques (SQT) to estimate and compare behavioral prevalence of giraffe meat consumption between direct questioning and two SQTs, Randomized Response Technique (RRT) and Unmatched Count Technique (UCT), from 2017 to 2019. Comparisons between the two samples yielded significant differences across all three methods, with confidence intervals distinctly divergent between years. The significant disparity between the two samples for all three methods suggests that there was a true reduction in giraffe meat usage from 2017 to 2019. A key change in the study area between the two time periods was the introduction of a community-based program for giraffe conservation. Primary program activities, including ecological monitoring, community outreach and education, and collaboration with wildlife security teams, align with other conservation programs that have demonstrated reduced poaching pressures. This study demonstrates an application of SQTs to detect a decline of giraffe meat consumption, providing an alternative to self-reported data for monitoring sensitive behaviors related to direct exploitation and illegal uses of wildlife.",TRUE,FALSE,consumption|giraffe|randomized response technique|unmatched count technique|wild meat,2020-09-26T19:08:52.448522,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:08:27.119229,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,Kirstie A.
