The participants consisted of sixty sophomore Iraqi learners who were studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL) at the Department of English at the University of Kufa, Iraq. They were divided into experimental (n=30) and control(n=30)  groups. The experimental group received explicit, and integrated listening strategies instruction based on Siegel’s model of process-based listening strategy instruction (2015). The control group received the conventional teaching of listening without receiving any training in strategy process-based instruction over a semester (ten weeks). A modified version of the Foreign Language listening Anxiety Scale (FLLAS) developed by Elkhafaifi (2005) was taken by the participants once before and once after the intervention to measure their LA. The listening section of the Preliminary English Test (PET) used to measure the learners’ LC before and after the intervention. Findings showed that listening strategy instruction could decrease learners’ LA. Furthermore, a negative relationship found between LA and LC. The paper concluded with some useful pedagogical implications, and suggestions for further research are discussed based on the findings for researchers, teachers, and educators within the constraints of the Iraqi context.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-02-11T17:50:06.077277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:49:50.808701,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/citation/,h27rg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422dd07610e10032ca4c39/,5e422dd07610e10032ca4c39,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h27rg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h27rg

One domain of particular interest is pragmatics, i.e., the ability to match language to context. This study aims at (a) investigating the pragmatic abilities of Iraqi patients with schizophrenia on both the production and comprehension level; (b) identifying which Grice's (1975) maxims do those patients most frequently violate; and (c) determining which of the demographic variables (gender, education, and age) has an influence on both the production and comprehension performance and violations. To this end, thirty patients were required to orally perform six pragmatic tasks using the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS) (Arcara &amp; Bambini, 2016). Results revealed that first, patients' performance in comprehension is worse than that in production. Secondly, the most frequently violated maxim is that of quality. Thirdly, there were statistically substantial differences among patients on the comprehension level for education and age only, whereas results of violations of Grice's maxims recorded significant differences for all the three variables. The study concluded that people with schizophrenia might suffer from pragmatic deficits, particularly on the comprehension level, and that the degree of the difficulty of the task assigned along with the three variables could play a vital role in the degree of their performance. The findings of this study may be applied to the development of effective treatment strategies in schizophrenia.",TRUE,FALSE,APACS|Grice's maxims|Iraqi patients|pragmatic deficits|schizophrenia,2020-02-11T17:50:40.909545,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:50:12.308925,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/citation/,bjwqf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422cc17610e10034ca4cc9/,5e422cc17610e10034ca4cc9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bjwqf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bjwqf

There is a big emphasis on learning the new words' meaning from the books or inside classrooms. Also, it is a major part of language teaching as well as being fundamental to the learner but there is a big challenge in vocabulary instruction due to the weak confidence by teachers in selecting the suitable practice in teaching vocabulary or they sometimes unable to specify a suitable time for it during the teaching process. The major aim of this study is to investigate the value of posters in vocabulary learning on the 2nd grade students at Halemat Alsaadia High School in Baghdad – Iraq. It hypothesized that there are no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups' scores in the post-test. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups out of four groups. Group A which represents the control group are taught without using posters, and group B which represents the experimental group is taught by using posters. The whole number of participated students is 62 students. The control group is (32) , and the experimental group is (30) students. Students were subjected to pre and posttests. The researcher used the T-test for two independent samples to know the equivalent between the experimental and control groups in the pre-test. The researcher used chi-square to find out statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups' variables of mothers and fathers' academic achievement. The results of the post-test shown that there are differences between the experimental and control groups for the favor of the experimental group. It is concluded that teaching vocabulary by using posters proved to be more useful for the students of Intermediate school than through taught without using posters. This adequacy of using posters is clear on developing both memorizing and written achievement. The present study suggests that English teachers in Iraq need to activate their students' minds and memorization through using posters and recommends that other researchers to research the effectiveness of Facebook and social media in increasing English language vocabulary learning.",TRUE,FALSE,learning|posters|secondary students|visualized teaching|vocabulary,2020-02-11T17:51:02.194826,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:50:31.490858,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/citation/,5a3js,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422bc97610e10034ca4b10/,5e422bc97610e10034ca4b10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5a3js/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5a3js

It aims to reveal the linguistic constructions involved in ironic utterances and to uncover ideologies underpinning such structures. It draws upon the echo and pretense theories to account for utterance representation along with Wodak’s (2007) framework of self and other presentation strategies. The study examines the incongruous construction of an attitude, and the objectives attempted to achieve by taking a cynical stance. The main research questions center on the role played by ironic utterances and how they contribute to preserving the image of the speaker and to the negative representation of the other. The study reveals the way politicians mark their verbal irony, i.e., to classify and categorize the co-textual markers including hyperboles, and repetitive follow-up commentaries. The findings in this study support Bertuccelli (2018) view that irony is not merely saying the opposite of what one means but instead communicating an attitude. It adds to the existing literature that irony involves not a reversal of evaluation, but a reversal of attitudes about social actors to draw a positive self-image.

The medium has evolved to such a degree that evaluation should not rest on whether an individual game can be considered art, but what types of aesthetic engagement the medium affords. A key figure in the study of the visual arts is aesthetic contemplation, in which extended attention reveals aesthetic differences. Although the videogame presents many sites and scenes worthy of such contemplation, this mode of spectatorship requires sufficient time and space to attend to a visual object.

According to the paradox, the tension associated with anticipation and uncertainty persists even though the spectator definitely knows what will happen (Carroll 2001). Many of the articles on the paradox and suspense examine the narrative events shaping spectator or player knowledge (Branigan 1992; Gerrig 1997; Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988; Prieto-Pablos 1998; Smuts 2008; Yanal 1996), however, this paper takes a slightly different approach by addressing factors that contribute to the feeling of suspense irrespective of the awareness of specific narrative events. By examining videogames, we also shift the frame of reference from narration to gameplay and the way players prepare for suspenseful events.

This study sheds light on the extent to which degrees of participation contribute to environmental decision-making in the Puntland State of Somalia using questionnaire surveys. We found that active participation has the highest contribution to environmental decisions. Our findings also indicated that the most pressing forms of environmental degradation in Puntland, as perceived by the respondents, are land degradation, drought related to the scarcity of rainfall, and deforestation. This study recommends “environmental cooperation” built into the peace-building process as a clear-cut concept to tackle both environmental degradation and conflicts. At the core of this concept is active participation and collaboration between civil society and the government as a means of mitigating environmental degradation in post-conflict Somalia. This will result in favorable environmental conditions and sustainable peace.",TRUE,FALSE,civil society|environmental degradation|post-conflict|Puntland|Somalia,2020-02-11T12:41:20.780574,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T12:41:02.009993,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dad|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Applied Behavior Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/citation/,eqn32,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e41496b032a4d02e2e6ef17/,5e41496b032a4d02e2e6ef17,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqn32/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eqn32/,https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2019.1685957,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eqn32

Evidence from Ngā taiohi matihiko o Aotearoa – New Zealand Kids Online,"While children’s experiences of online risks and harm is a growing area of research in New Zealand, public discussion on the matter has largely been informed by mainstream media’s fixation on the dangers of technology. At best, debate on risks online has relied on overseas evidence. However, insights reflecting the New Zealand context and based on representative data are still needed to guide policy discussion, create awareness, and inform the implementation of prevention and support programmes for children. This research report presents findings from a quantitative study regarding different aspects related to risks and online safety. It looks at the online experiences that children find bothersome and upsetting and explores the hurtful behaviours they encounter or engage in, both online and in person. Evidence regarding exposure to different types of potentially harmful online content is also presented. Another relevant contribution is the insights related to excessive internet use.The findings presented in this report are based on data from 2,061 New Zealand children aged 9-17. We hope the findings will contribute to the development of policies, practices and services designed to support New Zealand children to safely take advantage of the opportunities available to them online.",TRUE,FALSE,children|Cyberbullying|harassment|internet|New Zealand|online abuse|online aggression|online harm|online safety|quantitative research|social media|survey|trolling|youths,2020-02-10T00:34:42.275515,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-10T00:34:21.453273,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/citation/,qrhgv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4085ee032a4d02a5e6e91b/,5e4085ee032a4d02a5e6e91b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhgv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qrhgv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qrhgv

Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, a number of technological, economic, political, and social forces began to collectively undermine the societal terms and conditions under which established professions operate to the extent that it is now possible to speculate that the adaptation mechanisms of several of the professions will prove inadequate for the emerging environment and suggesting that those professions may devolve back into occupations and trades. Harold Wilenskey (1964) examined the development of eighteen professions from the 17th through the 20th centuries and offered a five stage model of professional development. Central to Wilenskey’s model is the formation of a “first collective,” ― in his terminology, a professional association. Using Wilenskey’s general model, this paper will suggest that, under certain conditions, a “second collective” may form in response to an external challenge, and that this formation can be a key initiator of devolutionary processes. A complementary speculative model of profession devolution is then proposed. This paper will explore only the processes involved in, and not the social implications of, professional class displacement.",TRUE,FALSE,Professions|Social Change|Social Impact of Technology|Sociology of Work|Wilenskey,2020-02-10T00:33:22.879553,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-10T00:33:03.759798,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/citation/,mcfv9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e407b51f1369e02a58ac12d/,5e407b51f1369e02a58ac12d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcfv9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mcfv9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mcfv9
