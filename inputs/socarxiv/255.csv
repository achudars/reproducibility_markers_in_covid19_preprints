However with the dawn of modernity, many individualistic ideas of work, vocation and calling have risen in the culture that goes against Protestant/Puritan thought in many ways yet the Protestant theology is in many ways blamed for the rise in individualism.

The necessity of such a work arises because a deeper philosophical framework is necessary for clarity to define secularism of whether secularism means pluralism and the tolerance of diversity for a greater end or the absolution of atheistic humanism and its intolerance toward other worldviews. Self-interest theory of human behavior is discussed as the basis for requiring reduction is power concentration and how such reductions in power concentrations is achieved through a democratic mixed economic state is discussed. The self-interest theory of human behavior says that human action is driven by self-interest which is automatic, natural and viscerally compelling while our obligation to others is a more thoughtful process of deliberation over morality. However by the common psychological biases such as confirmation and self-serving biases, our individualism overpowers our morality.  Therefore it is concluded that while a Democratic mixed economic state is not the idealism of all that power can achieve if we did everything right in an ideal world but rather what we need to prevent the worst from happening in the real world by the dangers of power concentrations and self-interest seeking individuals and considering we live in the real world than in the ideal world we should take it as the best possible solution to our political and economic thought",TRUE,FALSE,capitalism|democracy|mixed economy|political philosphy|socialism,2020-06-06T09:14:06.106565,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-06T09:13:48.338950,FALSE,No conflict of interest to disclose,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/citation/,8xt9f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eda587c8b542600608b386d/,5eda587c8b542600608b386d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xt9f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8xt9f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8xt9f,NA

If they support the institution that best serves their self-interest, the outcome inevitably advantages the largest group and disadvantages minorities. In this paper, we challenge this pessimistic view with an original lab experiment in France and Great Britain. In the first phase, experimental subjects experience elections under plurality and approval voting. In the second phase, they decide which rule they want to use for extra elections. The treatment is whether they do or do not have information to determine where their self-interest lies before deciding. We find that self-interest shapes people’s decisions, but so do intrinsic egalitarian values that subjects have outside of the lab. The implications are: (1) people have consistent ‘value-driven preferences’ for electoral rules, and (2) putting them in a situation of uncertainty leads to an outcome that reflects these values.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-05T10:30:22.720061,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-05T10:29:59.756690,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made public when paper is accepted for publication,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/citation/,rm2tq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eda184f08aad3003243cf4d/,5eda184f08aad3003243cf4d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm2tq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rm2tq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rm2tq,NA

This article examines Tibetan language activism in this context, looking at challenges both for and of rights. I argue that the challenge for rights – namely, the state’s increasing hostility – is offset somewhat by the slow growth, transnational nature and ample resourcing of the emerging discourse of language rights among Tibetans. On the other hand, I argue that challenges of rights – namely, the differential distribution of the “right to have rights” – present a more intractable problem. I demonstrate this by showing how current discourses among Tibetans in the PRC claim rights for some languages but not others, effectively erasing the “right to have rights” of certain Tibetan populations.",TRUE,FALSE,China|civil society|human rights|language rights|Tibet,2020-06-18T01:45:43.465881,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:45:13.684058,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/citation/,a3ktz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z92tv/,z92tv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed9eb44c67d3000321f5ea5/,5ed9eb44c67d3000321f5ea5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3ktz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a3ktz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a3ktz,https://doi.org/10.1080/10357823.2020.1758033

The hypothesis that quantum computer can generate such a model designated as quantum, which coincides with the modeled reality, is discussed. Its reasons are the theorems about the absence of “hidden variables” in quantum mechanics. The quantum modeling requires the axiom of choice. The following conclusions are deduced from the hypothesis. A quantum model unlike a classical model can coincide with reality. Reality can be interpreted as a quantum computer. The physical processes represent computations of the quantum computer. Quantum information is the real fundament of the world. The conception of quantum computer unifies physics and mathematics and thus the material and the ideal world. Quantum computer is a non-Turing machine in principle. Any quantum computing can be interpreted as an infinite classical computational process of a Turing machine. Quantum computer introduces the notion of “actually infinite computational process”.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was through social networks that many state leaders have informed the public about their actions. I examine how many leaders used Twitter, in what way, and the impact they had on the public. In the context of Twitter, the impact on the public refers to the growth in followers as it signifies the increased interest of the public about information. In this article, I collected 50,872 tweets from 143 state leaders and created an original dataset containing information on the growth of followers. I used ordinary least square regression models. This led to the finding that 64.8% of UN member states had a leader that tweeted about COVID-19. Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of followers during the pandemic compared to months prior was noted. Since March, the pandemic has been a dominant topic on Twitter. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest percentage increase in gaining Twitter followers was experienced by politicians who frequently tweeted and those who had a lower ratio of the number of followers to internet users. The research implies that citizens are interested in being informed about emergencies through social networks, and government officials should use them.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|COVID-19|governments|politicians|politics|state leaders,2020-06-05T10:32:22.764337,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-05T10:32:06.401654,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/citation/,u4maf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ua3fv/,ua3fv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed9713bc67d3000201f08fb/,5ed9713bc67d3000201f08fb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u4maf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u4maf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u4maf,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05540

Both unilateral and bilateral types of credit risks are considered. Our study shows that credit risk should be modeled as American style options in most cases, which require a backward induction valuation. To correct a common mistake in the literature, we emphasize that the market value of a defaultable derivative is actually a risky value rather than a risk-free value. Credit value adjustment (CVA) is also elaborated. A practical framework is developed for pricing defaultable derivatives and calculating their CVAs at a portfolio level.",TRUE,FALSE,asset pricing|credit risk|credit valuation adjustment|financial derivatives|valuation,2020-06-05T10:34:07.563495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-05T10:33:43.547924,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/citation/,jc43a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed95f53c67d30000b1effc2/,5ed95f53c67d30000b1effc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jc43a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jc43a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jc43a,NA
