An analysis of literary tastes of occupational groups,"Looking for differences in tastes of macrosocial units, such as classes or status groups, has been sociology of culture’s preoccupation for decades. The recent turn to the study of “micro-classes” (Grusky, 2005) in the sociology of stratification, however, questions the reality of such entities, suggesting rather that individual occupations are the real building blocks of social structures and, by implication, a natural site of differences in lifestyles. There have so far been few attempts in the sociology of culture to disaggregate classes into specific occupations in order to study potential contrasts in their artistic tastes, as this requires extensive datasets usually unavailable from surveys. In this paper, we begin to fill this gap using a dataset from the public library system of a major Russian city. Using information on the literary preferences of 15,470 readers who gave their current employment details, we show that indeed there are striking contrasts between occupational groups, with only a minor part of those existing contrasts captured by the class and socioeconomic status scales having the widest currency (ISEI, Treiman, EGP). We discuss several interpretations of this failure of conventional status schema: (a) inapplicability of socioeconomic status schemata to Russia; (b) the existence of strong micro-class cultures; (c) the presence of “economic” and “cultural” dimensions of status, implicating two different ordering of occupations; and (d) difference between occupational and class mobility, and the role of cultural consumption as a strategy of managing discrepancy between class and occupation.",TRUE,FALSE,artistic tastes|cultural consumption|micro-classes|occupations|sociology of culture|sociology of culture;,2018-07-02T11:42:10.448028,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-09T00:07:38.515935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Nadezhda Sokolova|Mikhail Sokolov (authors),2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/citation/,5tvfd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wutnd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/relationships/node/,wutnd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa19731f25d10000d3a90d6/,5aa19731f25d10000d3a90d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5tvfd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5tvfd,NA

An analysis of fiction readership in Russia,"In his paper establishing the foundations of omnivorousness theory, Richard Peterson suggested that the system of tastes is organized as a pyramid “with one elite taste at the top and more and more alternative forms at about the same level as one moves down the pyramid toward its base”, with tastes at the bottom “mark[ing] the status boundaries between taste groups defined by age, gender, race, region, religion, lifestyle” (1992). High-status individuals are likely to consume a few genres at all levels of the taste pyramid, while low-status ones tend to patronise only one genre situated at the bottom. While one of the predictions following from this model —concerning the omnivorounsness of privileged groups—has been tested in numerous studies, the thesis of stronger structural embeddedness of low-brow tastes has been researched much less extensively. If Peterson is right, we would find that the consumption of high-brow objects strongly correlates with class characteristics, such as education, although consumption of low- and middle-brow does not; on the contrary, the consumption of low-brow objects correlates with belonging to gender, age, ethnic, or other groupings, where the consumption of high-brow objects does not. In this paper, we use a dataset from a Saint Petersburg public library system to analyze 1 900 000 book choices of above 170 000 readers to find out whether these predictions hold. We find that there is indeed a strong negative correlation between the attractiveness of an author for predominantly educated readers and the gender and age specificity of his/her audience. In the second part of the article we discuss two possible theoretical explanation of this finding: (a) the opposition between the high-grid culture of unprivileged groups and the low-grid culture of elites, as described in Mary Douglas’ “cultural theory”, and (b) the opposition between relaxational and self-cultivating usages of culture.",TRUE,FALSE,Big Data|cultural consumption|literary tastes|Mary Douglas|Russian culture,2018-07-02T11:42:10.413861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-09T00:04:29.459117,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Nadezhda Sokolova|Mikhail Sokolov (authors),2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/citation/,zf8m2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/czp2y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/relationships/node/,czp2y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa172c3f25d10000f3a111f/,5aa172c3f25d10000f3a111f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zf8m2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zf8m2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.11.008

The extent of hedging activities disclosures is captured through a 32-item-template, which consists of a mandatory and voluntary disclosure scores. The results of this study indicate that the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure is still insufficient among the sampled companies even though the disclosure scored is quite high. This study also examines the relationship between the existence of risk management committee (RMC), its characteristics and the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure in two separate statistical models. The regression results imply that the existence of RMC is positive but does not significantly influence the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure. However its characteristics (i.e. RMC independence and RMC meeting) have a significant influence.

An analysis of fiction readership in Russia,"In his now-classical paper, Paul DiMaggio (1987) claimed that popular culture in modern societies “provide(s) stuff of everyday sociability”. It serves to bridge cultural holes between major social groups patronizing different artistic genres. Intuitively appealing and grounded in a long tradition of theorizing on “mass culture”, the proposition that low-brow art serves as the “least cultural denominator”, however, has been scarcely empirically tested. We developed a dual network approach to testing this proposition. We use data on readership in St. Petersburg, Russia, from the city’s municipal public library system (above 1.300.000 records) to reconstruct a network of 22.000 authors. With this, we demonstrate that counter to DiMaggio and others, authors with predominantly university-educated readership are more likely to bridge cultural holes in taste networks, as measured by weighted betweenness and constraint. We interpret this as a sign that, at least as far as the literature is concerned, it is the relatively high-brow, rather than low-brow, artistic figures that are more likely to serve to bridge cultural holes providing themes for “culture talk” (Lizardo) across large social distances. We discuss three explanations for this fact: institutional (the central role of educational institutions in distribution of literature, in contrast to cinema and other predominantly commercial art forms), structural (we claim that the centrality of high-brow tastes is implicated by Peterson’s omnivorousness model) and taste (more educated audiences prefer cultural products transgressing traditional genre boundaries). We argue that the evidence points in the direction of a combination of all three explanations.",TRUE,FALSE,centrality|cultural capital|cultural consumption|omnivorousness|two mode networks,2018-07-02T11:42:10.147242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-08T23:57:30.301551,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Nadezhda Sokolova|Mikhail Sokolov (authors),2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/citation/,6xwzm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rkpmv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/relationships/node/,rkpmv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa15f1df25d10000e39d816/,5aa15f1df25d10000e39d816,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6xwzm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6xwzm,NA

Using nationally representative survey data (N = 2,569) and semi-structured interviews from the National Study of Youth and Religion (N = 30), I test for and explain differences in school grades of five common profiles of religiosity among adolescents in the U.S: Abiders, Adapters, Assenters, Avoiders and Atheists. My quantitative findings suggest that abiders report better grades than avoiders, and the difference is greatest among middle-class families. This pattern holds after controlling for race, religious denomination, sex, mother’s education level, and income. More importantly, the association between religiousness and grades remains after accounting for other factors associated with religiousness, such as increased parental supervision and reduced likelihood of drinking and having sex. My qualitative evidence suggests that this association is a function of greater conscientiousness and agreeableness among abiders. Therefore, I suggest that middle and high schools reward students who are obedient, respectful, and agreeable. Although it is well known that academic performance is associated with income, school grades are also driven by dispositions stemming from religious engagement. This study has implications for how we think about the academic achievement gap.",TRUE,FALSE,sociology of education|sociology of religion,2018-07-02T11:42:08.551132,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-07T04:32:12.560311,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,Ilana M.

In this paper, we suggest that the distinction between personal culture and public culture offers a productive way forward. We propose an approach centered on an analytic contrast between schemas, which we define as a form of personal culture, and frames, which we define as a form of public culture. We develop an “evocation model” of the structure and function of frames. In the model, frames are conceived as material assemblages that activate a network of schemas, thereby evoking a response when people are exposed to them. We discuss how the proposed model extends, and clarifies, extant approaches, and consider new directions for future research.",TRUE,FALSE,cognition|culture|frames|framing|schemas|theory,2018-07-02T11:42:08.483581,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-06T21:59:58.319187,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/citation/,b3u48,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vzdf3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/relationships/node/,vzdf3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9eea03f6318700100f7283/,5a9eea03f6318700100f7283,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3u48/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b3u48/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b3u48,NA

Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace `big data' -- Facebook's advertisement audience estimates -- that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform's over 2 billion users to measure and `nowcast' digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining `online' indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, `offline' indicators related to a country's overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as  online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps. It enables us to improve geographical coverage for an important development indicator, with the biggest gains made for low-income countries for which existing data are most limited.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|development indicators|digital demography|digital divide|digital trace data|gender gaps|internet access|mobile phones,2018-07-02T11:42:08.321402,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-06T21:58:41.496030,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Masoomali Fatehkia|Ridhi Kashyap|Ingmar Weber,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/citation/,rkvb3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eq7ja/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/relationships/node/,eq7ja,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9e8c10a9181f000f769100/,5a9e8c10a9181f000f769100,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rkvb3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rkvb3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rkvb3,NA
