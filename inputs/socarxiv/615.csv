In the era of modern technology self-access learning can be done through online. This means internet has become a popular medium for online educational information retrieval (Hambali, 2016). The use of E-portfolio, specifically in micro teaching class therefore might be one of the solutions to prepare better English student teachers before they face the real world of teaching. This study examines the issues and challenges that have been revealed after the E-portfolio implementation. The E-portfolio was designed to ensure an assessment focus on student learning through intentional teaching practices and the systematic collection of teaching artifacts. The participants involved in this study were the English student teachers enrolling in microteaching class. The A and B classes are chosen purposively as only that class applies microteaching in the morning regular sessions. The number of English student teachers as the participants of this study is fifty-two. However, not all participants were included due to the research feasibility. Some Issues due to the quality of E-portfolio gave clear insights of what the English student teachers expect from the product and how it can be developed more to meet their needs as prospective teachers.

The study has used mixed approach of qualitative and quantitative analysis to evaluate learning and writing skills of second language among 400 students from different primary and secondary schools in Riyadh. The teachers were instructed to fill an assessment form to evaluate skills of students in learning second language through Bench-marking techniques of brainstorming, fable writing, speed writing, loop writing, and mini saga. The data was analyzed using a statistical software (SPSS) 20.0 version. Cross tabulation technique has been applied on the data collected through questionnaires to observe the appropriate responses of the teachers. The results revealed that 75% of the students were interested in learning writing in second language. Brainstorming technique (56.3%) was found to be most popular among the students and teachers. The majority of the teachers (84.4%) believe that acquiring writing skills is the toughest task for the second language learners. Moreover, brainstorming (p=0.000), narrating fables (p=0.002), and loop writing (0.000) were significant among students for learning second language.

There is a more or less agreement on what happens to teaching and learning processes in high and low power distance (PD) classrooms. However, there are some findings suggesting thesimultaneous existence of both individualism and collectivism (e.g. North Vietnam). In that case, individualism and collectivism have separate identities, rather than being mutually exclusive parts of a single dimension. There are some works in which Hofstede’s(1983, 1986) cultural dimensions could not explain observed differences in thelearning environment.  There are possibilities of learning-specific new sets of cultural dimensions in classrooms due to the attitudinal changes of students compared to the average culture of the general population.  In many works, a variety of approaches has been suggested for the teacher either to adapt to the culture of the classroom or to use methods of low PD and individualistic methods in high PD-collectivist classrooms in a cautious manner. Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) seems an effective alternative to Grammar-Translation Method (GTM). Contradictory findings have been reported on Japanese classrooms. In one, the students desire to study independently, which the high PD and the collectivist culture of Japan does not allow. Two, for the Japanese learners, group working is more effective due to the collectivist culture.

It covers several aspects such as how interpersonal relationships relate to complimenting behaviour. In addition, it examines how the culture of complimenting is relevant with some conditions such as power relation, and gender. The significance of the study is to explore the cultural transfer might appearing in complimenting. The subjects of research in this study are EFL learners at State Islamic University of Maulana Malik Ibrahim, Indonesia. It employs ethnographical method to gain the explanation for the phenomenon underlying the complexities in complimenting behaviour. The complexities concern with the interference of culture, the influence of gender and power relation. The finding shows that female learners tend to use more complimenting strategies compared to males. The complimenting expression is also various affected by the relation with the hearers. Some variations occurring in complimenting cover overstatement, mixed language, non-sensical, no compliment and question. The context of Islamic institution also results in specific expression related to power display in complimenting strategies used. However, in EFL context, complimenting becomes an issue as there is lack of authentic English examples in course books and the inefficient instructions English learners receive which particularly expose them to variation in English compliments. Therefore, further studies are needed to develop teaching construct that accommodates the improvement of pragmatic competence particularly in complimenting for politeness awareness which today becomes a significant value.",TRUE,FALSE,complimenting behaviour|Indonesian EFL learners,2018-07-02T11:03:34.120846,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T03:22:05.119057,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/citation/,vhbez,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hbfjg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/relationships/node/,hbfjg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972c435b83f69022b3005e7/,5972c435b83f69022b3005e7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhbez/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vhbez/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhbez

It also aims to explore the pattern of errors that Palestinian speakers follow in speaking English. Two main questions have been explored in the study: 1) what are the most common mispronounced English consonants produced by Palestinian students? and 2) what patterns do these students follow in so doing? 20 undergraduate students from the English Department at An-Najah National University are observed and their English is recorded to identify the problematic consonant sounds. The study results show that the most problematic sounds include /p/, /tʃ/, /dʒ/, /ɹ/, and /ŋ/. In the light of the findings, the researchers recommend that the best way to learn the pronunciation of a second language is by listening to native speakers of that language and by practicing it regularly.",TRUE,FALSE,Consonants|mother tongue interference|Palestinian spoken Arabic|problematic sound(s)|pronunciation mistakes,2018-07-02T11:03:34.084313,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T03:18:06.917994,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/citation/,dmjyf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7tuzd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/relationships/node/,7tuzd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972c2849ad5a10238560358/,5972c2849ad5a10238560358,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmjyf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dmjyf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dmjyf
