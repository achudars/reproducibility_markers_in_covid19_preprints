To reduce emissions, policies aim to enhance material efficiency and the circular economy, but our understanding of the dynamics of material-related greenhouse gas emissions is limited. Here, I quantify the greenhouse gas emissions from material production and the carbon footprint of materials in industries that are the first users of materials, and in final consumption, using a multiregional input–output model of the global economy and the hypothetical extraction method. From 1995 to 2015, greenhouse gas emissions from just material production increased by 120%, with 11 billion tons of CO2-equivalent emitted in 2015. As a proportion of global emissions, material production rose from 15 to 23%. China accounted for 75% of the growth. In terms of the first use of materials, two-fifths of the carbon footprint of materials is attributed to construction, and two-fifths to the manufacturing of machinery, vehicles and other durable products. Overall, the replacement of existing or formation of new capital stocks now accounts for 60% of material-related emissions. Policies that address the rapidly growing capital stocks in emerging economies therefore offer the best prospect for emission reductions from material efficiency.",TRUE,FALSE,circular economy|climate change mitigation|life cycle assessment|multiregional input-output analysis|resource efficiency,2019-08-30T10:43:43.334576,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-30T10:43:25.625149,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://zenodo.org/record/3583071,no,This is not a causal analysis but a modeling study.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/citation/,n9ecw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g72hy/,g72hy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d67c0fb6f41fc001a2e1719/,5d67c0fb6f41fc001a2e1719,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9ecw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n9ecw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n9ecw,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-021-00690-8

Despite its critical importance, it curiously remains poorly understood in a number of dimensions. In order to address this, we have analysed peer review to assess where the major gaps in our theoretical and empirical understanding of it lie. We identify core themes including editorial responsibility, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, the function and quality of peer review, and the social and epistemic implications of peer review. The high-priority gaps are focused around increased accountability and justification in decision making processes for editors, and developing a deeper, empirical understanding of the social impact of peer review. Addressing this at the bare minimum will require the design of a consensus for a minimal set of standards for what constitutes peer review, and the development of a shared data infrastructure to support this. Such a field requires sustained funding and commitment from publishers and research funders, who both have a commitment to uphold the integrity of the published scholarly record.

Past research offers three explanations of this phenomenon: 1. the economic explanation maintaining that parents contribute in order to supplement lagging public investments in education; 2. the opportunity hoarding explanation arguing parents contribute to secure educational advantages for their children; and 3. the civic engagement and social capital explanation that sees parent fundraising as an element of parents’ democratic participation in schools. This article considers the efficacy of these explanations in the case of parent fundraising in a Manhattan elementary school I call PSX. Applied to data collected through ethnographic research among PSX parents, the existing explanations provide an incomplete understanding of parent fundraising because they focus on the intentions and motivations of parents. A normative-institutional perspective provides additional explanatory leverage. Educational policy and normative expectations link parental fundraising and school quality.

This contradicts the tenet that life expectancy is positively correlated with human welfare, but it coheres with recent literature on mortality and recessions. We construct Lee-Carter interval estimates of life expectancy during the Great Depression, based on trends before 1929. In this analysis, all-race life expectancy did not grow unusually during the Great Depression. However, nonwhites did see greater-than-expected increases in life expectancy in 1930-33.

And in my point of view, tomb of King Qa’a resembles a particular burial system – “Huangchangticou”(黄肠题凑). Since human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups O be found in Egypt, but no in the others in the image in the paper, I speculate that there must be a “indigenous people” in the Liangzhu area to return to Egypt with the fleet. From the paper , I speculate that the eagle in a statue of a man, dating from Yue State (越国) and the eagles in Fanshan Cemetery and Yaoshan Hill, the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City (良渚古城遗址反山墓地和瑶山), resemble the God Horus in Egypt. I can also get a conclusion that Zhejiang(浙江)(including Yuhang(余杭)and Shaoxing(绍兴)) was once Egypt’s colony. From the paper, I can get a conclusion that Mojiaoshan Terrace (莫角山台地) resembles the Ziggurat of Ur and Anu Ziggurat, Uruk (modern Warka) in function and shape. In my point of view, Narmer's tomb in Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos in Upper Egypt is a cenotaph of his. And from the paper, I can conclude that the “grass-wrapped silt” discovered by Liangzhu archaeologists in Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City has the same shape, size and use of building materials as the mud bricks used in the construction of cities, palaces and tombs during Narmer’s period of ancient Egypt, so I can conclude that the territory of Liangzhu culture (including Yuhang(余杭)and Shaoxing(绍兴)) was once Egypt’s colony. From the paper, I can find the prototype of the square-shape (the shape of ""Hui""(回), a Chinese character) altars on Mt. Yaoshan and Mt. Huiguanshan from Dendera zodiac. From the paper, I can conclude that the divine emblem unearthed from Tomb M12, Fanshan cemetery indicates that the owner of the tomb was probably the governor of ancient Egypt. Since Fanshan (反山) is an artificially piled up mastaba shape like mound and it is larger than any other tombs of mastabas of the kings in ancient Egypt, I can get a hypothesis that Yu (Narmer) died while on a hunting tour to the eastern frontier of his empire, and chose Fanshan (反山) as his tomb at first , but for some unknown reasons, he buried in Yu mausoleum (大禹陵) ,  Mount Kuaiji (会稽山) , south of present-day Shaoxing (绍兴).",TRUE,FALSE,Anu Ziggurat|Dendera zodiac|divine emblem|Fanshan (反山)|governor of ancient Egypt|grass-wrapped silt|Horus|Huangchangticou(黄肠题凑)|mastaba|Mojiaoshan Terrace|mud bricks|Narmer|square-shape altars|Uruk|Yu mausoleum (大禹陵)|Yu (禹)|Ziggurat of Ur,2019-08-28T20:54:25.351548,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-28T20:53:58.828076,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce5|Arts and Humanities|History|Other History,"Bohai,Xu",2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/citation/,gbhvf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d650c392a8cc000163d47c8/,5d650c392a8cc000163d47c8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gbhvf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gbhvf,NA

This approach is addressed from the establishment of an organized set of Afro-North American music structured on several ethnomusicological and sociohistorical data. At the methodological level, the Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used for the visualization and analysis of the faced phenomenon, complemented in an analytical perspective with the musical comparison of a specific case of African American musical evolution. The results indicate a high stylistic cohesion between the different relationships perceived in the phenomenon addressed. At the musical level, there is the gradual increase in the harmonic complexity of a classic song from the Afro-North American repertoire.

Ego network data provide personal network information, as the data are based on a sample of individuals. This chapter details the basic features of such data, describing the advantages, disadvantages and potential applications of using ego network data. Ego network data remain a popular choice, despite the growing availability of full networks from automated sources (such as cell phone records). This is in large part because ego network data are easy to collect but still provide a surprisingly large amount of network information. Ego network data are also quite flexible, with past work using the same basic data structure for widely different purposes: from measuring social support and social boundaries; to inferring global network features from a sample; to acting as a corrective for other sampling techniques (such as respondent-driven sampling). Ego network data are thus easy to collect and useful for a wide variety of substantive and methodological problems. Given the ease of collection and the flexibility of use, there is every reason to believe that ego network data will continue to be a useful option for network scholars.
