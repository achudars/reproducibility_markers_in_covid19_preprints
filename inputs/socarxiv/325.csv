Scenario developments in Industrial Ecology have focused on disparate components of the socioeconomic metabolism and case studies, and few efforts of comprehensive and cumulative scenario formulation are documented. Many important, empirically derived relationships between material cycles, end-use services, and energy use are relevant to global scenario modeling efforts, e.g., of integrated assessment models (IAMs), which do not routinely describe material cycles or the life-cycle impacts of various technology shifts. These inconsistent depictions of material cycles and their environmental impacts hinder the assessment of sustainable development strategies such as demand-side sufficiency, material efficiency, and energy efficiency. We developed three highly detailed scenarios covering 20 global regions to 2060 for the service provisioning of dwelling area and personal transport grounded in salient building and vehicle operation parameters. Our scenarios are based on, and interface with, the Low Energy Demand (LED) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1 and SSP2) narratives. The results comprise scenario-, region-, and period-specific narratives and corresponding parameter values, including per-capita floor space and vehicle stocks, building and vehicle archetype mixes, passenger-km, vehicle-km, vehicle occupancy rates, and implementation potentials of nine material efficiency strategies. The explicit storyline extension approach presented here is an alternative to the aggregate GDP-driven or historical trend extrapolations of service or energy demands.

More efficient use of materials – through decoupling of services that support human wellbeing from material use – is imperative as other emissions mitigation options are expensive. An interdisciplinary scientific assessment of material efficiency and its links to service provision, material cycle management, and climate policy is needed to identify effective strategies and help design the policy framework required for their implementation. 
We present RECC, the Resource Efficiency-Climate Change mitigation framework, a first step towards such a comprehensive assessment. RECC is based on dynamic material flow analysis and links the services provided (individual motorized transport and dwelling) to the operation of in-use stocks (passenger vehicles and residential buildings), to the expansion and maintenance of these stocks to their material cycles (major materials like steel and cement), and to energy use and climate impacts. A key innovation of RECC is the up-scaling of detailed descriptions of future product archetypes with different degrees of material and energy efficiency, which are simulated with engineering tools.
We utilize RECC with augmented storylines of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) to describe future service demand and associated material requirements. Ten material efficiency strategies at different stages of the material cycle can be assessed by ramping up their implementation rates to the identified technical potentials. RECC provides scenario results for the life cycle impacts of ambitious service-material decoupling concurrent with energy system decarbonization, giving detailed insights on the resource efficiency-climate change mitigation nexus to policy makers worldwide.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change mitigation|decoupling|material efficiency|material flow analysis|Resource efficiency|scenario analysis,2020-02-16T17:13:02.101706,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-16T17:12:53.912393,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/citation/,7ubrp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e495de93e86a8019c6e510a/,5e495de93e86a8019c6e510a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7ubrp/,https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13023,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7ubrp

We analyze the SSM survey data to assess people's vulnerability in terms of household income and subjective well-being in response to negative life events, such as unemployment and loss of a spouse, and reveal differences based on gender, age, and educational attainment.

As for unemployment, we find from the analyses that both men and women who are around 40 years old and has less education face the most severe risk of damaging household income, while younger men are at severe risk of damaging their subjective well-being through the event.

Governments, international organizations and civil society organizations implement a variety of campaigns to counter misinformation spread by smuggling and trafficking networks. The evidence on the effects of such information interventions on potential migrants remains limited and largely anecdotal. More generally, the role of risk perceptions for the decision-making process of potential irregular migrants is rarely explicitly tested while the concept of risk pervades conventional migration models, particularly in the field of economics. We address this gap by providing causal evidence of the effects of a peer-to-peer information intervention on the perceptions, knowledge and intentions of potential migrants in Dakar, Senegal, using a randomized controlled trial design. The results show that – three months after the intervention – peer-to-peer information events about risks increased potential migrants’ subjective information levels, raised risk perceptions; and reduced intentions to migrate irregularly. We found no substantial effects on factual migration knowledge.

Please refer to the DOI for the accepted manuscript: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abc279.*** Environmental and social problems triggered by rapid palm oil expansion in the tropics have spurred the proliferation of sustainability certification systems such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). While the RSPO aims to improve the impact of oil palm production on people and environments, its effect on local development, environmental quality, and, especially, potential trade-offs between these outcomes remain unclear. Here, we evaluate whether RSPO certification of large-scale industrial concessions has promoted village development and supported environmental quality in Indonesia, the top global palm oil producer. Using a panel dataset with observations from 11,000 villages in Kalimantan and Sumatra from 2003-2014, we apply rigorous quasi-experimental methods to quantify the RSPO's impacts on village development and environmental outcomes. In the short-run, RSPO contributed to environmental conservation, but had limited development outcomes. On average, relative to villages with non-certified concessions, RSPO certification reduced deforestation and protected primary forests in Sumatra and lowered the incidence of village-reported land pollution in Kalimantan. RSPO certification also increased the number of private educational facilities in Kalimantan, but had no statistically significant impacts on other development indicators. However, the trade-offs and complementarities between conservation and development vary by slope, a proxy for ecosystem fragility and oil palm profitability. On gentler slopes, we generally find complementarities between conservation and development outcomes. In Kalimantan, certification increased the number of private educational facilities and reduced deforestation and the incidence of land pollution on slopes &lt;2°. In Sumatra, certification increased primary forests, decreased deforestation and the incidence of water pollution on slopes &lt;1°, along with a decrease in population density.

Ecological research implies that the total population of writers can consist of target specialists, generalists, or both. Target preferences are either similar or dissimilar among individuals.
Methods: One year of graffiti removal data relating to 1,904 incidents committed by 263 individuals were extracted for a medium-sized city in Belgium. Individual target specialization and preferences were analyzed using ecological network methods.
Results: The total diversity in target choices at the aggregate level is primarily the result of substantial between-individual variation. The results indicate that the total population of graffiti writers largely consists of target specialists, and can be divided into subgroups that share similar target preferences. Aggregate patterns of target selection do not accurately reflect individual variation in target choice specialization, at least for graffiti writing.
Conclusions: We recommend future research to account for individual differences in target specialization. The patterns observed here are similar to those observed in animal ecology studies supporting the idea that crime patterns might correspond to common behavioral ecological patterns.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral ecology|competition|enviromental criminology|graffiti|network analysis|optimal foraging|specialization|target choice,2020-02-14T08:12:41.877625,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-14T08:12:33.715914,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/citation/,bu7p8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e45ca3dd6622100b5992c6c/,5e45ca3dd6622100b5992c6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu7p8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bu7p8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bu7p8

Evidence from Ph.D. granting institutions in the United States,"The aging of the professoriate throughout the end of the 20th century and the early years of the 2000’s (both before and after the end of mandatory retirement in the United States, ca. 1994) has become a source of concern for some scholars and research administrators, who posit that the “greying” of the academy results in lower research activity and a decline in scientific advancement. Some published opinions concur that senior scholars’ research programs do not keep pace with those of their younger colleagues, but little quantitative evidence has been presented to evaluate that claim. In this study, we quantify senior faculty publication activity in six broad fields, comparing their publication rates to their younger colleagues across four modes of knowledge dissemination: journal articles, conference proceedings, books, and book chapters. Career publication activity does not follow the “peak and decline” pattern described in earlier studies. In most fields, journal article publication rates do not decline substantively with age (and in some cases article publication rates are higher among senior scholars), conference proceeding publication rates tend to decline with age, while book and chapter publication rates increase markedly with age. Overall, senior scholars maintain publishing activity levels and tend to shift their focus to the development and evolution of ideas through the publication of longer-format works as books and book chapters.",TRUE,FALSE,aging|aging professoriate|bibliometrics|book chapters|book publications|conference proceedings|journal articles|mandatory retirement|publication activity|publishing trajectory|research productivity|retirement|scientometrics|senior faculty,2020-02-14T08:13:23.621571,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-14T08:13:05.414591,TRUE,"AJO and WES are paid employees of Academic Analytics, LLC.
