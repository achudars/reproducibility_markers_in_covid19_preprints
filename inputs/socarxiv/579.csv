While traffic-related noise has been studied extensively, research on construction noise has been lacking. In this study, we examined the relationship between construction activities and noise annoyance and tested whether this relationship is stronger during after-hours. Data were drawn from a historical inventory of major development projects and crowdsourced citizen complaints data (311 calls) in Vancouver, Canada from 2011 to 2016. Mixed effects models were developed with an interaction between construction activities and after-hours report. Results show that neighborhood noise complaints were significantly associated with major constructions (IRR = 1.062, 95% CI = 1.024–1.097). A significant interaction effect was also found between construction activities and after-hours reporting (IRR = 1.050 CI = 1.012–1.087). To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically show adverse effects of urban development on noise annoyance.

The dimension problem consists of a simple dilemma: when we aggregate, the observer must choose the dimension of analysis. The dilemma is that this choice affects the resulting measurement. This means that aggregate measurements are dependent on one's goals, and on underlying theory. I explore the consequences of this predicament for ecological and biophysical economics.  I discuss the many problems of using 'real' monetary value as the dimension of analysis.  And I highlight how the dimension problem undermines the  practice of seeking 'optimal' policy.

Despite some evidence that risk concerns vary across societies and risk domains, these variations remain understudied. To address this gap, this paper conducts a multi-level analysis of public concerns about biological and chemical/technical food risks in 26 European countries. Findings confirm previous work on individual predictors of risk concern and suggest that several contextual factors contribute to cross-national variations: aggregate perceptions of risks as unnatural, retail concentration in the food sector, and media coverage. The effect of institutional trust on risk concerns varies substantially across nations. Findings also reveal important differences in public concerns about biological versus chemical/technical food risks, supporting the view that food risk perception is multi-dimensional and complex.",TRUE,FALSE,cross-national|food safety|multi-level modeling|risk perception,2018-07-02T11:56:46.274469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-20T13:43:41.166303,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/citation/,c2khw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hz4wn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/relationships/node/,hz4wn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b29e55b76e62b000d27ed94/,5b29e55b76e62b000d27ed94,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2khw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c2khw,https://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2017.1422789

For some scholars, the emergence of a decidedly self-referential mode of fiction in the early twentieth century is part and parcel of what defines this modernity. In Japan there was the ""I-novel""; and in China, Romantic fiction. The two are recognized as foundational genres that distinguished themselves from prior fiction by the adoption of a narrow autobiographical focus, extended psycho-narration, and a new vernacular writing style. At the same time, others have struggled to define these genres in more precise stylistic or formal terms. Edward Fowler once said of the I-novel that ""writing about [it] is not unlike pursuing a desert oasis...How is one to analyze a form that critics have debated for well over half a century but for which they have failed to come up with a workable definition?""

Conducting surveys and analyzing subsequent data requires a way to identify which responses belong to the same entity. This might be, for example, members of the same team or data from different organizational levels. It can be very difficult to collect such data in environments marked by high concerns for anonymity and data privacy. This article suggests a procedure for matching survey data without compromising respondents’ anonymity.",TRUE,FALSE,custodian|data privacy|matching|multilevel|survey research|unique identifiers,2018-07-02T11:56:43.937084,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-17T00:06:55.306034,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/citation/,nwjd7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gknj7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/relationships/node/,gknj7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2547438b4bed000fb64d69/,5b2547438b4bed000fb64d69,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwjd7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nwjd7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nwjd7,https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPSM-12-2017-0330

Both included a long term mission for manned space flights to Mars in the 2030s. Since that time NASA has shifted the majority of its efforts toward that target. Research on the International Space Station (ISS), for example, has focused on subjects like the long term impacts of microgravity environments. On earth NASA has focused its efforts toward a similar goal. Several projects through the Human Research Program have endeavored to research factors such as human health countermeasures, exploration medical capability, and human factors and behavioral performance in analog environments, simulating how explorers will inhabit and exist on the surface of Mars. One such project, the Hawai’i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS), began its first mission in 2013, sending six crew members to live in a 1,200 square foot dome for four months in the barren volcanic ash fields of Mauna Loa.

HI-SEAS’ first campaign’s objective was to research the nutritional and psychosocial issues of a proposed Mars food system. This study helped show that cooking and eating will be an important activity for Mars astronauts for physical and psychological health by improving appetites, building community relationships, and maintaining morale. The HI-SEAS team maintained a blog and youtube channel, documenting their lives and scientific pursuits. Much of this content recorded information about cooking and eating on the station, including a video series entitled Meals for Mars, a makeshift cooking show about producing meals with freeze dried and shelf stable ingredients. These psychosocial and nutritional results make an interesting comparison to the theoretical work completed at the Johnson Space Center in the previous decade.

In my presentation I will use NASA’s digital Technical Reports Server to look at documents from the Human Research Program in conjunction with the HI-SEAS blog and video archives. By using these materials as primary source documents, I will show how the development of food science in human spaceflight has shifted from theoretical nutrition to a more humanistic model, incorporating personal insights on the comforts of earth.
