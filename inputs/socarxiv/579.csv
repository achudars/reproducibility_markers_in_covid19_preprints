Proposals of introducing many methods to raise students’ involvement and centeredness in the process evolved and many concepts from other disciplines were implemented. One of these evolving concepts was Project Based Learning (PBL) which was popular across many education fields: the main essence of it is involving the students in an authentic and practical translation project. This article investigates the experiences of Saudi under-preparation-translators in a Computer Aided Translation (CAT) course that was introduced using the PBL method. Using qualitative methods (mainly interviews and observations), students’ receptions were collected and analyzed and themes were elicited to report the students’ attitude to PBL method. Although many positive experiences such as autonomy and team work skills were reported, some indicated the concerns of the practicality of the procedure as well as time issues.",TRUE,FALSE,Computer Aided Translation|method|perceptions|Project-Based-Learning|Saudi translators|Translation,2018-07-02T11:22:42.921183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T04:22:14.084342,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/citation/,bp6ya,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j5kpc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/relationships/node/,j5kpc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07cbf2b83f69026586f541/,5a07cbf2b83f69026586f541,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp6ya/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bp6ya/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bp6ya

It uses Edward Said’s theory of Orientalism to demonstrate how ‘sexuality’ as an attributed Western discourse about the Prophet (pbuh) developed into exotic ideas embodied in the image of the Arabs and Turks. The analysis explores three main leitmotifs that help shape the idea of the ‘Prophet’s sexuality’, namely the harem, slavery and the notion of the ‘Mohammaden Paradise’, all of which have implicit or direct referencing to the Prophet (pbuh). This article attempts to show how Orientalist travelogues in particular, have contributed to a very negative conception of Muhammad (pbuh) and his marital life—an image that unfortunately persists until today. The discourse carries with it a familiar yet dangerous binary attitude that continuously positions the West and Muslims antithetically.

Moreover, by providing a sexual-textual political reading of some of the women’s poems and/or the anecdotes (akhbār) about them, the article demonstrates how these women exerted their social and political agency in a male-dominated society.

Semantic content is not always sufficient to fully comprehend the exact meaning of a particular utterance as the meaning of that utterance may hinge upon the contextual detail with which it is inferentially associated. The success of the process of communication relies on whether or not the recipient makes use of the context intended by the speaker. Failure to do so would give rise to miscommunication (Gutt, 1998, p. 42). Translation, as a communicative act, involves interpretation made by the translator, which takes the context of the target text (TT) reader and his/her knowledge into consideration. The present paper argues that even though the translator, according to relevance theory, is required to reproduce a TT that can stand as a faithful rendering of the source text (ST), the translator, however, needs to make his/her translated text relevant to the target reader. This, in many instances, may demand following certain procedures of explications in the TT to equip the target reader with the relevant contextual information needed to draw the appropriate inferences from the utterance concerned, and therefore make the right interpretation. Such exegesis needs to be added to the target text as what is inferable for the ST user may not be inferable for the TT receiver owing to cognitive and cultural differences.",TRUE,FALSE,Communication|inference|interpretation|relevance theory|translation,2018-07-02T11:22:42.800579,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T04:01:11.503531,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/citation/,26zax,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ubjn9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/relationships/node/,ubjn9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07c6d6594d9002657cab71/,5a07c6d6594d9002657cab71,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/26zax/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/26zax

Despite the existence of an established national body and institutions that accredit and train translators, translation for Arab migrants still suffers from problems that hinder these goals and render lip service to the Arabic language because of the prevalence of subjective interference and inappropriate transfer process.

Romeo and Juliet (1597) and Othello (1604) are tragedies of sweeping passion and rash action where love falters and lovers fall. In her 1988 play entitled Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet), Ann-Marie MacDonald parodies the two Shakespearean texts and visits the intersections between genre and gender where tragedy modulates into comedy and liminal gender identities fade in and out across permeable genre spaces. The protagonist of the play, Constance Ledbelly, is sucked into the wonderland of her unconscious mind where she outwits her opponents, Iago and Tybalt, and moderates the extremes of her avatars, Desdemona and Juliet. She thus breaks free from her stalking shadow, Night the Professor, and realises that she is the unwitting author of the play. Her unconscious leap onto the stages of mourning becomes a farewell to the night, and a greeting of the morning that becomes the queerness of the postmodernist world—laughing off its past and laughing at its present. The golden pen which Constance finds at the end of her toying with genre, language, and gender is a reward for the author who takes refuge in a world where the fool of court is king of wit, and where the pandemonium of tragedy becomes the playground of parody. The author of this paper studies the alchemy of Constance’s change and MacDonald’s reconsideration of genre and gender through parody, the postmodern philosopher’s stone. He also argues for a politics of identity revisiting the aesthetics of mourning.",TRUE,FALSE,comedy|gender|identity|parody|subversion|tragedy,2018-07-02T11:22:42.730945,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T03:50:27.308988,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/citation/,szx9g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9p8ez/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/relationships/node/,9p8ez,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07c3dfb83f69026586f1de/,5a07c3dfb83f69026586f1de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/szx9g/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/szx9g

This study uses original nationally-representative data (N=5,601) with strategic oversamples of minority groups to examine variation in how religion and gender intersect across ethnoreligious identities in Israel. We demonstrate that Israel diverges from the typical pattern of women appearing more religious than men. In fact, Israeli men are consistently more religious than Israeli women on commonly used measures and frequently more religious on a broader set of questions specific to Judaism and Israel. Subgroup analyses highlight the intersectional nature of gender and religion, showing that men’s greater religiosity in Israel is limited to Jews, and, more specifically, non-secular Jews. We suggest that gender gaps arise, at least in part, because religions are gendered institutions with gendered norms, expectations, and incentives, and that these norms, expectations, and incentives vary from religion to religion.",TRUE,FALSE,Christians|Druze|Ethnoreligious Identity|Gender|Intersectionality|Israel|Jews|Muslims|Religion,2018-07-02T11:21:50.289880,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-10T20:36:48.693332,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/citation/,n3cw5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r4h5m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/relationships/node/,r4h5m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a060cf3594d9002657c0518/,5a060cf3594d9002657c0518,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3cw5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n3cw5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n3cw5

Using nationally representative data from the 1973-2016 General Social Surveys (N = 20,620), and taking into account different ethno-religious histories with pornography as a moral issue, we examine how race, gender, and religion intersect to influence trends in pornography viewership over 43 years. Analyses reveal that black Americans in general are more likely to view pornography than whites, and they are increasing in their pornography viewership at a higher rate than whites. Moreover, black men are more likely to consume pornography than all other race-gender combinations, but only differ from white women in their increasing rate of pornography viewership. Lastly, frequent worship attendance only moderates trends in pornography viewership for white men. By contrast, regardless of attendance frequency, black men and women show increasing rates of pornography use while white women show flat rates. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for research on the intersections of race, gender, religion, and sexuality.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:21:50.154718,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-10T20:01:53.483329,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Samuel,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/citation/,9ykdn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gz4s9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/relationships/node/,gz4s9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a05bc01b83f690266860051/,5a05bc01b83f690266860051,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ykdn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ykdn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ykdn

Using the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), we assess the roles of a range of pathways through which educational advantage may lead to occupational attainment: cognitive development; private and selective secondary schools; school level qualifications; and higher education, including institution and field of study. Whereas past research has shown a residual direct effect of social origins on class destinations, we find that, once a sufficiently detailed picture of educational attainment is taken into account, education fully explains the link between social origins and top social class destinations. In contrast, the gap between men and women in achieving top social class positions is in no part accounted for by education.",TRUE,FALSE,Social class; education; social mobility; social reproduction; elite education; private schools,2018-07-02T11:21:49.933963,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-10T17:25:04.491221,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/citation/,r2hfb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pk5rf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/relationships/node/,pk5rf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a05de4f9ad5a1026d0201f9/,5a05de4f9ad5a1026d0201f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2hfb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r2hfb/,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12314,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r2hfb
