Mantel has received praise for her depiction of Cromwell, but also endured criticism for portraying him in an overly positive light. This paper examines the role of Mantel’s work and depiction of Cromwell in the evolution and potential re-framing of the historical fiction genre. It seeks to achieve four things: to assess the compelling nature of her fiction, to situate her depiction of Cromwell in opposition to other depictions, to highlight her literary approach, and to contextualise Mantel’s writing within ‘women’s writing’. Through this multifaceted approach it is conclusively established  that although Mantel’s narratives are situated within a female-dominated genre, they are told from a masculine perspective and gaze. Nonetheless, they still hold a significant subtext suggestive of the ‘feminine’. This paper thereby reinforces the argument of feminist critic Julia Kristeva and shows Hilary Mantel and her ‘embodied’ depiction of Cromwell in a light previously unseen, holding merit for the genre of historical fiction as a whole.",TRUE,FALSE,Cromwell|historical fiction|Mantel|semiotics|women’s writing,2018-07-02T11:39:47.902862,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:37:12.132318,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/citation/,3pzfu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b2uhs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/relationships/node/,b2uhs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba82b60511e000fdc913e/,5a8ba82b60511e000fdc913e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pzfu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pzfu/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pzfu

In mocking Malvolio’s morality and ridiculous behaviour, Shakespeare wanted to denounce Puritans’ sober society in early modern England. Indeed, Puritans were depicted in the play as being selfish, idiot, hypocrite, and killjoy. In the same way, many other writers of different generations, obviously influenced by Shakespeare, have espoused his views and consequently contributed to promote this anti-Puritan literature, which is still felt today. This article discusses whether Shakespeare’s portrayal of Puritans was accurate or not. To do so, the writer first attempts to define the term “Puritan,” as the latter is quite equivocal, then take some Puritans’ characteristics, namely hypocrisy and killjoy, as provided in the play, and analyze them in the light of the studies of some historians and scholars, experts on the post Reformation Puritanism, to demonstrate that Shakespeare’s view on Puritanism is completely caricatural.",TRUE,FALSE,caricature|early modern theatre|Malvolio|Puritans|satire,2018-07-02T11:39:47.835387,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:36:39.695963,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/citation/,kangw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vpn4q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/relationships/node/,vpn4q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba6ab571031000d450980/,5a8ba6ab571031000d450980,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kangw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kangw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kangw

It has generated new attitudes towards childhood and changing practices around literature. The concept of literature for entertainment along with instruction, as proposed by Peter Hunt, has changed the traditional mode of reading methods and gave new dimensions in reading and experiencing children’s books. Nowadays, children’s books are available in various forms like printed books, audio/video recordings, animated movies, Disney cartoons etc. New developments in computational field and digital media have opened wider ways of exploring children’s stories. This has also led to the notion of cross-reading. Most of the stories for children are re-told or    re-visioned adapting to different socio-cultural, linguistic domains. This adaptation is both a product and process as seen by Hutcheon (2012). The chief characteristics of postmodern picture books include usually a non-linear plot structure, using pictures or texts to position the reader and focalizing ideas through the point of view of a character, construction of meaning by the reader, intertextual references and above all, the varied design layout and styles of illustration as envisioned by Anstey (2002). All these developments appease the tastes of the modern child as well as the adult reader.

The problem is more aggravated when the translation occurs from a sacred and sophisticated text such as the Holy Quran. As a result, losses in translation occur. This study, therefore, is an attempt to identify the losses in the translation of connotative meaning in the Holy Quran, propose strategies to reduce such losses, and identify the causes of such losses. For this purpose, seven examples were extracted from the Holy Quran and were qualitatively analysed. The analysis of the extracted data revealed that connotative meaning was quite challenging in translation and losses occurred. These problems in preserving the connotative meaning of the source text (ST) word or playing it down are due to two main causes: the first cause is the lack of equivalence, while the second one is the translator’s failure to pick the most appropriate equivalent. Non-equivalence problems were mainly represented in lack of lexicalization, semantic complexity, culturally-bound terms, difference in expressive meaning, and difference in distinction of meaning between the source language (SL) and the target language (TL). Some strategies were suggested to reduce such loss in the translation of connotative meaning. These strategies include footnoting, transliteration, periphrastic translation, and accuracy of selecting the proper equivalent that can be achieved by triangulation procedures such as peer-checking and expert-checking.",TRUE,FALSE,connotative meaning|the Holy Quran|translation loss|translation strategies,2018-07-02T11:39:47.766143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:35:24.405540,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/citation/,qvk95,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cjubw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/relationships/node/,cjubw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba53860511e000ddcd64b/,5a8ba53860511e000ddcd64b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvk95/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qvk95/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qvk95

It also makes use of feminist concepts given that the content in question is written by Egyptian women writers and hence blends general social transformations with those affected by feminism. Four Egyptian authoresses were selected for this study along with samples of their literary works, written between 2011 and 2017, in an attempt to unpick the social transformations taking place in the short story during that critical period. The study shows that social transformations begin with the subject that is aware of those transformations embedded in the short story and taking different forms. It, in addition, underlines the impact and significance of the setting and how it is used by the women writers to locate and shed light on those transformations. Moreover, there are two types of social transformations, namely negative transformation, embodied in the deterioration of social relations or any undesired behavior, and positive transformation, characterized by the awareness of the subject of the sources of power in relation to the act of change and the influence of the revolutionary action on it.

Although the novel’s fictional island may stand for Trinidad, this paper stresses the fact that, according to Naipaul, the disordered Isabella may well match the characteristics of other chaotic Third World nations. The narrator-protagonist symbolizes more of the disillusionment worthy of Naipaul’s other placeless characters like Salim in A Bend in the River and Mr. Biswas in A House for Mr Biswas. This means that Naipaul tries a writing of a (hi)story that adheres to his personal idiosyncrasies and beliefs, a narrative in which he exposes the abnormalities and pretences of a society in which nothing seems sure and lasting. As the title of the novel suggests, the pattern is that of mimicry; postcolonial countries, all together lacking a sense of creativity, duplicate and distort metropolitan models. Thus, this paper sheds light in the tunnel between the ‘us’ (Europeans) and the ‘them’ (Caribbean) arguing that for Naipaul the first stands for authenticity and reality while the second signifies mimicry and unreality.",TRUE,FALSE,alienation|homelessness|mimicry uprootedness|V.

It is a dynamic and ever changing process. It is expected to respond positively to new developments in the studies of language and style. Cognitive stylistics is one of the major new developments in the study of style. It is based on viewing and analyzing style as a cognitive process of mind that goes beyond the boundaries of surface meaning to unearth the truth behind it. This process draws heavily on the cultural, social, political, and ideological conceptualization of style and meaning. The cognitive process of translating is claimed here to have been influenced by contemporary cognitive stylistic approaches that view meaning as the product of style as mind. This paper investigates the updated cognitive properties, responsibilities, practices and other characteristics to be assumed by the cognitive stylistic translator in the light of these new cognitive approaches to meaning and style in terms of mind. Accordingly, the cognitive translator is urged to approach the translation of the texts' styles and meaning cognitively to respond creatively to the explorations of cognitive stylistic theory and applications. This will make them uncover buried truths and meanings that cannot be discovered otherwise. Toward the end of the paper, a relativity theory of cognitive stylistic translation is put forward. This theory is flexible enough to respond effectively to all cognitive potentials of meaning and style. Further, it accommodates more than one cognitive version of translation by means of applying two suggested methods of translation to the same text: direct (or style-based); and indirect (non-style-based).

The human psyche is complicated; it is a mix of emotions, instincts, actions ad reactions. The 20th century is revolutionary, new inventions and discoveries were trending, with the new way of living people started to lose faith.  William Golding's Free Fall as Künstlerroman is tracing the development of the artist Sammy Mountjoy's character from childhood until he matures. The things he faced and the factors that reshaped his life. He was chastened by suffering as he learned from the school of life. In this non-thesis paper, a study of the character of Sammy as he grows up is explored with examining the factors that affected his personality. The introduction illustrates Künstlerroman as a subgenre of Bildungsroman and explains them as a theoretical framework, the difference between them and their characteristics. Also, it discusses psychoanalysis definition. Chapter I will focus on Sammy's childhood living in Rotten Row and his friends, the role of his parents and moving to the art school where he met Beatrice. Chapter II will discuss Sammy the man when he was investigated in prison. It deals with mature Sammy who wants to fix his mistakes and feels free from guilt.",TRUE,FALSE,Free will|Künstlerroman|maturation|psychoanalysis|role model,2018-07-02T11:39:47.630432,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:31:23.287245,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/citation/,z82tm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3p5f4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/relationships/node/,3p5f4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba008571031000e44d9ab/,5a8ba008571031000e44d9ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z82tm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z82tm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.200,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z82tm

Flynn makes an appeal for researchers to move beyond psychology’s standard disciplinary boundaries and to consider sociological contexts, in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive inequalities. In this article we respond to this appeal and investigate social class inequalities in general cognitive ability test scores over time. We analyse data from the National Child Development Study (1958) and the British Cohort Study (1970). These two British birth cohorts are suitable nationally representative large-scale data resources for studying inequalities in general cognitive ability.
We observe a large parental social class effect, net of parental education and gender in both cohorts. The overall finding is that large social class divisions in cognitive ability can be observed when children are still at primary school, and similar patterns are observed in each cohort. Notably, pupils with fathers at the lower end of the class structure are at a distinct disadvantage. This is a disturbing finding and it is especially important because cognitive ability is known to influence individuals later in the lifecourse.",TRUE,FALSE,1970 British Cohort Study|Cognitive Ability|Cohort Studies|Inequality|Longitudinal|National Child Development Study|Reproducible Sociology|social class|Social Stratification,2018-07-02T11:39:47.457529,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T09:36:09.917504,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/citation/,szxdm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vey7q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/relationships/node/,vey7q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8b310660511e000cdc4947/,5a8b310660511e000cdc4947,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxdm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/szxdm/,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12343,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/szxdm
