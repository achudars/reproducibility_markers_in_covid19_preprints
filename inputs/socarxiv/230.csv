Negatively skewed variation--negative shocks being larger than positive shocks--could contribute to bias by making long-run average growth smaller than typical-year (median) growth. This positively biases forecasts based on typical years. We compare medians and means in real per-capita GDP growth across countries, regions, and time windows from 1820-2016. Over decadal periods, we find mean growth rates &lt;1%/y smaller than median growth rates in most countries and regions (median 0.23%/y across countries). Surprisingly, we find both large- and medium-magnitude shocks contribute to these differences, rather than only large ‘black swan’ events. We find negative skewness correlated with high levels and slow growth of per-capita GDP and population, and high per-capita GDP growth volatility, building on previous studies. We find negative skewness alone insufficient to explain recent growth over-projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO).",TRUE,FALSE,business cycle|climate change|COVID-19|growth|recessions|sustainability,2020-07-09T05:04:51.272352,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-09T05:04:13.512372,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth|https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth|https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/world-economic-outlook-databases#sort=%40imfdate%20descending|https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#1|https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=about,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/citation/,vndqr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f04f5831484ac00b266cda9/,5f04f5831484ac00b266cda9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vndqr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vndqr

However, the effectiveness of such governmental measures in reducing the mortality burden remains a key question of scientific interest and public debate. In this study, we leverage digital mobility data to assess the effects of reduced human mobility on excess mortality, focusing on regional data in England and Wales between February and August 2020. We estimate a robust association between mobility reductions and lower excess mortality, after adjusting for time trends and regional differences in a mixed-effects regression framework and considering a five-week lag between the two measures. We predict that, in the absence of mobility reductions, the number of excess deaths could have more than doubled in England and Wales during this period, especially in the London area.

Testing the socialisation effect of educational field of study on cosmopolitan attitudes in the Netherlands,"Across Europe, those with higher education are consistently found to be more pro-cosmopolitan than those with less education. However, it remains an open question what aspects of education drive this relationship. One influential mechanism through which education is argued to affect cosmopolitan attitudes is by instilling tolerance inducing values and beliefs that continue to influence the thinking of students long after they have left the education system. Using the Dutch LISS panel between 2008 and 2019, we explore differences in the emphasis on tolerant values and beliefs across fields of study to assess the explanatory power of the socialisation model of education for cosmopolitan attitudes. By estimating between- and within subject panel regressions, we find that although there are cross-sectional differences between fields of study in cosmopolitan attitudes, these differences cannot conclusively be attributed to the socialisation influence of the specific field. Consequently, our results challenge the importance of the socialisation model to understand the current educational divide in cosmopolitanism.",TRUE,FALSE,Cosmopolitanism|Education|Field of study|LISS panel,2020-07-07T13:04:22.421119,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-07T13:03:50.674601,FALSE,NA,no,Data can be accessed via CentERdata.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Sander Kunst,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/citation/,d9sjr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0464c03e18460066c9a137/,5f0464c03e18460066c9a137,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9sjr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d9sjr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d9sjr

Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. 
To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics.
We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). 
In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.",TRUE,FALSE,consequences of covid-19|coronavirus|covid-19|mental health|physical distancing|sars-cov-2|social relationships,2020-07-07T13:06:02.169813,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-07T13:05:41.900307,FALSE,NA,no,https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/citation/,4sfv9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f039fe43e1846004ac9157e/,5f039fe43e1846004ac9157e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4sfv9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4sfv9

This is likely to bring great disruption to earth systems, leading to increased natural hazard risks, crop failures, civil unrest and population migration. There is, however, a high degree of uncertainty about the impacts that such events may have on land use and ecosystems in individual countries. Integrated assessment modelling (IAM) of scenarios like the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) offers one way to address this uncertainty, allowing outcomes such as the relative land cover under food production or forestry to be compared for each scenario. However, global and continental-scale IAMs need to be complemented by landscape scale spatial modelling to inform national and regional policy making. In this paper, we demonstrate impacts and trade-offs of future land cover change in Scotland, a UK region with a high degree of political autonomy, using downscaled SSPs from Europe to the national and finally the regional level. Our methods integrate participatory knowledge co-construction approaches with land-use modelling. Firstly, a stakeholder workshop held in November 2018 led to the development of detailed narratives for 5 UK SSPs. Two contrasting UK SSPs, SSP1 (Sustainability), and SSP5 (Fossil-Fuelled Development) were then adapted to the case of Scotland and simulated to the year 2040 using a land use change model (APoLUS). Land use demands for each scenario were quantified based on historical tendencies, narrative information derived from the workshop, and future Scottish Government targets. Results highlight trade-offs between forest cover, grasslands, natural areas including marginal peatlands important for carbon sequestration, and cropland for food production and the drinks industry.

Our first contribution is to account for this secular change using regressions of the probability of being in the top 1%, fitted separately for men and women, in order to contrast between the sexes the role of changes in characteristics and changes in returns to characteristics. We show that the rise of women in the top 1% is primarily accounted for by their greater increases (relative to men) in the number of years spent in full-time education. Although most top income analysis uses tax return data, we derive our findings taking advantage of the much more extensive information about personal characteristics that is available in survey data. Our use of survey data requires justification given survey under-coverage of top incomes. Providing this justification is our second contribution.

Financial advisors provide an interesting context for exploring such premiums, as financial advising is a historically male-dominated profession that has been found to exhibit large unadjusted gender pay gaps. Using a large sample of financial advisors recruited via a professional continuing education website (n=555), this study investigates whether gender differences exist among financial advisors with respect to the marriage premium, the parenthood premium, the parental leave effect, and the stay-at-home spouse premium. This study examined premiums both with and without potentially endogenous human capital covariates. Without including potentially endogenous covariates, a marriage premium was observed among men but not women, a parenthood premium was observed among women but not men, a parental leave premium was observed among neither men nor women, and a stay-at-home spouse premium was observed among men but not women. When potentially endogenous covariates were included, a marriage penalty was observed among women but not men, a parenthood premium was observed among women while a parenthood penalty observed among men, a parental leave premium was observed among men but not women, and a stay-at-home spouse premium was observed among men while a stay-at-home spouse penalty was observed among women. Exploratory Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analyses revealed sizeable unadjusted income gaps by gender (16.7%), marriage (32.8%), parenthood (8.1%), parental leave (16.7%), and spousal employment (39.8%).",TRUE,FALSE,fatherhood premium|gender differences|gender pay gap|marriage premium|parental leave effect|stay-at-home spouse premium,2020-07-06T19:33:53.493874,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-06T19:33:18.358606,TRUE,M.K. owns Kitces.com—the website through which the survey this analysis is based on was conducted.

In den letzten Jahren zeigte sich dabei ein deutlicher Trend zum Medium Video gegenüber Text. Wir untersuchten die Effekte video- und textfallbasierter Lehr-Lernarrangements auf die Quantität selektierter Unterrichtssituationen, die Qualität der Interpretation dieser Situationen und die Verwendung theoretischer Prinzipien mit Bezug zum Classroom Management. Im Pre-Post-Design der Studie bearbeiteten 645 Lehramtsstudierende aus 21 curricular identischen Seminaren entweder Video- oder Textfälle zum Thema Classroom Management. Im Pre-Posttest zeigte sich lediglich für die Qualität der Interpretation ein Unterschied zwischen den Medien, und zwar zugunsten des Einsatzes von Texten. Überdies zeigte sich ein starker Einfluss der Einstellung der Dozierenden gegenüber der Art der Fallarbeit auf die Verwendung theoretischer Prinzipien ermitteln.

Yet, cross sectional estimates seriously underestimate women’s lifetime odds of becoming their family’s primary earner. Using longitudinal data from the 2014 SIPP panels, we created annualized earnings to model transition rates into and out of primary-earning status among mothers. Results show, using a conservative threshold of at least 60% of total household earnings, over 70% of American mothers can expect to be primary earners at some point during their first 18 years of motherhood.
