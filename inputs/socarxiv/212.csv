Evidence from three survey experiments,"The extent to which citizens comply with newly-enacted public health measures such as social distancing or lockdowns strongly affects the propagation of the virus and the number of deaths from COVID-19. It is however very difficult to identify non-compliance through survey research because claiming to follow the rules is socially desirable. Using three survey experiments, we examine the efficacy of different “face-saving” questions that aim to reduce social desirability in the measurement of compliance with public health measures. Our treatments soften the social norm of compliance by way of a short preamble in combination with a guilty-free answer choice making it easier for respondents to admit non-compliance. We find that self-reported non-compliance increases by up to 11 percentage points when making use of a face-saving question. Considering the current context and the importance of measuring non-compliance, we argue that researchers around the world should adopt our most efficient face-saving question.",TRUE,FALSE,Compliance|Coronavirus|COVID19|COVID-19|Measurement|Methodology|Public health|Self-isolation|Survey experiment,2020-05-04T15:02:06.804641,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-29T11:10:57.037075,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/citation/,gursd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea8858776188b020791220d/,5ea8858776188b020791220d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gursd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gursd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gursd,NA

The Center for Digital Scholarship (CDS) at Leiden University (LU) library is a scholarly lab that promotes open science literacy among Leiden’s scholars by two complementary strategies: existing top-down structures are used to provide training and services, while bottom-up initiatives from the research community are actively supported by offering the CDS’s expertise and facilities. An example of how bottom-up initiatives can blossom with the help of library structures such as the CDS is ReproHack. ReproHack – a reproducibility hackathon – is a grass-root initiative by young scholars with the goal of improving research reproducibility in three ways. First, hackathon attendees learn about reproducibility tools and challenges by reproducing published results and providing feedback to authors on their attempt. Second, authors can nominate their work and receive feedback on their reproducibility efforts. Third, the collaborative atmosphere helps building a community interested in making their own research reproducible. A first ReproHack in the Netherlands took place on November 30th, 2019, co-organised by the CDS at the LU Library with 44 participants from the fields of psychology, engineering, biomedicine, and computer science. For 19 papers, 24 feedback forms were returned and five papers were reported as successfully reproduced. Besides the researchers’ learning experience, the event led to recommendations on how to enhance research reproducibility. The ReproHack format therefore provides an opportunity for libraries to improve scientific reproducibility through community engagement.",TRUE,FALSE,community engagement|grassroot initiative|hackathon|Open Science|reproducibility,2020-05-04T15:01:35.741141,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-28T16:19:14.609366,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/citation/,6f4zv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea83735e4f08101b30773f6/,5ea83735e4f08101b30773f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6f4zv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6f4zv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6f4zv,https://doi.org/10.29173/iq977

introduces it as an instrument in studying culture. It uses the concept of calendars/calendar systems
as a criterion for recognition and formation of culture in general. Starting from an assumption that
the calendar is a structurally organized system of events or holidays, it analyses the basic units of a
calendar: day, month and year, and distinguishes a calendar holiday from a non-calendar holiday.
It states that the calendars are a structural list of collective memory within a social group, where
this memory is described in cyclical categories – calendar holidays. Furthermore, considering that
the initial epoch of year counting may be different in different cultures, it discusses how cultural
self-awareness is expressed through the epoch of the calendar era. Finally, it explores how and to
what extent the formation, interaction, and reforms of calendars and their systems reflect the change
in culture. The paper concludes that calendars and their systems should be used as a criterion in
defining culture.",TRUE,FALSE,Calendar|Culture,2020-05-04T15:01:35.399772,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-28T16:18:16.935559,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/citation/,rp5hb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea8330b76188b01df9102a2/,5ea8330b76188b01df9102a2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp5hb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rp5hb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rp5hb,NA

Previous research mostly supports the notion that parenting affects the skill development of children in early childhood. There are, however, no studies testing whether parenting in early adolescence has such a causal influence. We estimate the causal effects of parenting on early adolescents’ noncognitive skills using data from the German Twin Family Panel (TwinLife). Specifically, we look at the effects of parenting styles, parental activities, and extracurricular activities on the academic self-concept, motivation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control of 10 to 14 years old children. To control for unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality, we employ twin fixed-effects models combined with longitudinal information. In addition, based on separate analyses for dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic (MZ) twins, we test whether genetic variation moderates the effects of parenting. Our findings provide no support to the notion that parenting styles, parental activities, and extracurricular activities in early adolescence affect the development of children’s noncognitive skills. We conclude that our results, in combination with the majority of evidence from previous research, are in line with a model according to which parenting has larger effects on the skill development of children in early childhood than in early adolescence.",TRUE,FALSE,Causality|child development|noncognitive skills|parenting|twins,2020-05-04T15:01:35.899000,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-28T16:16:53.975578,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/citation/,8c6r7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7afp/,c7afp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea828773854e201b569e89b/,5ea828773854e201b569e89b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6r7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8c6r7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8c6r7,NA

associated with beauty and attractiveness prevails in society. In dominant endogamous
societies within an ethnicity, these characteristics are preserved and highly prioritized as
markers of physical attractiveness in that ethnicity. Such dominant groups within an ethnicity
dominate others, among other things, in terms of public portrayal, places, spaces and various
opportunities on the basis of characteristics largely possessed and hence prized by dominant
groups and are held up as aspiration goals to the rest. People who have fairer skin tone as
compared to the darker skin tone tries to dominate other in terms of public portrayal. These
public portrayals are clearly seen in the case of visual mass media like cinema and
advertisement. This paper explores whether such skin colour tone based bias exists in case of
Bangali ethnicity. The skin tone of heroes and heroines of popular Bangla films produced in
West Bengal was taken as a proxy to explore the nature of skin colour tone based bias (if
any), in case of the Bangla mother tongue population, the 5th largest mother tongue
population in the world. We found that the heroes and heroines have significantly lighter skin
tones than other males and females of same ethnicity who are portrayed in a film. The results

All else equal, social connectedness is stronger between regions with residents of similar ages and education levels, as well as between those that share a language and religion. In contrast, region-pairs with dissimilar incomes tend to be more connected, likely due to increased migration from poorer to richer regions. We find more socially connected region-pairs to have more passenger train trips between them, even after controlling for distance and travel time.

We created a systematic map of the cross‐disciplinary conservation science literature, which draws on social psychology concepts and methods in their application broadly described as conservation psychology. Established protocols were used to systematically collect and collate peer‐reviewed research published in an explicit selection of multidisciplinary conservation journals. We sought to catalog the literature, elucidate trends and gaps, and critically reflect on the state of conservation psychology and its research practices that aim to influence conservation outcomes. The volume of publications per year and per decade increased from 1974 to 2016. Although a diversity of research designs and methods was applied, studies disproportionately focused on specific concepts (attitudes and beliefs), locations (North America and Europe), and contexts (terrestrial, rural). Studies also tended to be descriptive, quantitative, and atheoretical in nature. Our findings demonstrate that although conservation psychology has generally become more visible and prominent, it has done so within a limited space and suggest that disciplinary research principles and reporting standards must be more universally adopted by traditional and multidisciplinary conservation journals to raise the floor of empirical research.",TRUE,FALSE,Conservation psychology|Conservation social science|Human dimensions|Social psychology|Systematic map|Systematic review,2020-05-04T15:01:11.663661,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-28T03:32:09.111616,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://figshare.com/projects/Systematic_map_of_conservation_social_psychology_research/73773,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,Kenneth E Wallen,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/citation/,bjtfn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea7319e3854e2013269bc12/,5ea7319e3854e2013269bc12,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjtfn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bjtfn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bjtfn,https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13623

All available evidence suggests that the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 among those living in nursing homes is extremely high. Yet, it remains unknown to what extent there are socio-economic differences among nursing home residents, which can lead, in turn, to social inequality in mortality linked to COVID.

OBJECTIVE
We investigate whether there are educational differences in the likelihood of living in a nursing home across 13 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

METHODS
We use SHARE data (waves 5-7). We compute logistic regression models for rare events.

RESULTS
We find that there are sizeable differences in the probability of being in a nursing home, with low-educated individuals more likely to live in this kind of arrangement. This general pattern holds in all the European countries considered. There is considerable uncertainty in our estimates due to small Ns problems and firm conclusions on how the effect of education varies across countries cannot be drawn. Still, there is some indication that the largest educational differences are found in the Scandinavian countries and the smaller ones, even close to zero, in Southern European Countries, with countries in Continental Europe and Eastern Europe laying in between. 


CONTRIBUTION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides country specific evidence of educational differences in the probability of being in a nursing home in recent years. In this way, we also provide indirect evidence on social inequality in mortality linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Nursing homes|Social Inequalities,2020-05-04T15:01:09.124995,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-28T03:27:38.680220,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/citation/,ksefy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea6d1a83854e200f569e15d/,5ea6d1a83854e200f569e15d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ksefy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ksefy,NA

These findings challenge the assumptions of stable ideologies over the life-course as well as cohort replacement-based convergence over time. This study expands on previous research by analysing differences and trends in gender ideologies in the context of East and West Germany using data from the German Family Panel pairfam (2008-2018). It distinguishes between three cohorts born in the early 1970s, 1980s and 1990s who have different socialisation experiences before and after reunification. The results show smaller East-West differences in gender ideologies for the youngest cohort compared with larger gaps for the two older cohorts born before reunification. Convergence of ideologies is partly due to modernisation trends in West Germany and re-traditionalisation effects in East Germany across cohorts, but also due to attitudinal changes with age. Attitudes towards housework and female employment have particularly converged, while views on maternal employment and the consequences for children’s well-being continue to differ between East and West Germany. The findings underline the importance of persistent, long-lasting ideology differences due to the regime‐specific socialisation and composition resulting from the division of Germany, but also emphasizes the role of ideology change across cohorts and over the life-course for the overall converging trends in gender ideologies.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-05-04T15:01:18.770543,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-28T03:25:45.875690,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/citation/,pfwyu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea6cc7de4f0810107076157/,5ea6cc7de4f0810107076157,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfwyu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pfwyu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pfwyu,NA
