Information symmetry and mechanical motion,"The concept of quantum information is introduced as both normed superposition of two orthogonal subspaces of the separable complex Hilbert space and invariance of Hamilton and Lagrange representation of any mechanical system. The base is the isomorphism of the standard introduction and the representation of a qubit to a 3D unit ball, in which two points are chosen.
The separable complex Hilbert space is considered as the free variable of quantum information and any point in it (a wave function describing a state of a quantum system) as its value as the bound variable.
A qubit is equivalent to the generalization of ‚Äòbit‚Äô from the set of two equally probable alternatives to an infinite set of alternatives. Then, that Hilbert space is considered as a generalization of Peano arithmetic where any unit is substituted by a qubit and thus the set of natural number is mappable within any qubit as the complex internal structure of the unit or a different state of it. Thus, any mathematical structure being reducible to set theory is representable as a set of wave functions and a subspace of the separable complex Hilbert space, and it can be identified as the category of all categories for any functor represents an operator transforming a set (or subspace) of the separable complex Hilbert space into another. Thus, category theory is isomorphic to the Hilbert-space representation of set theory &amp; Peano arithmetic as above.
Given any value of quantum information, i.e. a point in the separable complex Hilbert space, it always admits two equally acceptable interpretations: the one is physical, the other is mathematical. The former is a wave function as the exhausted description of a certain state of a certain quantum system. The latter chooses a certain mathematical structure among a certain category. Thus there is no way to be distinguished a mathematical structure from a physical state for both are described exhaustedly as a value of quantum information. This statement in turn can be utilized to be defined quantum information by the identity of any mathematical structure to a physical state, and also vice versa. Further, that definition is equivalent to both standard definition as the normed superposition and invariance of Hamilton and Lagrange interpretation of mechanical motion introduced in the beginning of the paper.
Then, the concept of information symmetry can be involved as the symmetry between three elements or two pairs of elements: Lagrange representation and each counterpart of the pair of Hamilton representation. The sense and meaning of information symmetry may be visualized by a single (quantum) bit and its interpretation as both (privileged) reference frame and the symmetries ùëàùëà(1), ùëÜùëÜùëÜ (2), and ùëÜùëÜùëÜ (3) of the Standard model.",TRUE,FALSE,|axiom of choice|axiom of (transfinite) induction|category theory|Hamilton representation|Hilbert space|information|Lagrange representation|Minkowski space|nformation symmetry|Peano arithmetic|pseudo-Riemannian space|quantum mechanics|qubit|set theory|special &amp; general relativity|Standard model,2020-05-04T15:05:16.092324,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-03T23:40:53.216965,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/citation/,etp5f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaf19320ffc0500b96f821c/,5eaf19320ffc0500b96f821c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/etp5f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/etp5f,NA

This means that these two behavioral aspects, representative of a very selected branch in the phylogenetic tree of the Primate order, are shared by the two lineages of great African apes that diverged from a common ancestor around six million years in the past, leading to extant humans and chimpanzees. Therefore, this article proposes an ethological understanding of warfare and social ethics, as both are innate to the social high-specialized modular mind present in the species of genera Pan and Homo. However behavioral restraints to intersocietal coalitionary violence seems to be an exclusive aspect of the transdominial modular cognition that characterizes modern humans.

In this article, we stress the relevance of the ‚Äòperennity of war‚Äô thesis, and the impropriety of a dichotomy between political rationality vs. instinct.

Given the political and moral context of the pandemic and the nation‚Äôs response to it, this study sought to assess the extent of American‚Äôs personal fear about the virus as well as their fear for others (altruistic fear), identify potential predictors of these fears, and examine the mental health impact of heightened COVID-19 fears. Overall, a majority of respondents worried about various aspects of the virus, from being exposed to dying and reported often worrying about others, including family, the elderly, and healthcare professionals. Building on the fear of crime literature, we find that certain individuals, including those who believe they are at a high risk of dying from the virus, those who closely follow news coverage of the pandemic, and those with strong moral foundations, are likely to experience elevated fear and, possibly, its consequences.",TRUE,FALSE,|altruistic fear|COVID-19|faith in Trump|Moral Foundations Theory|personal fear|psychological distress,2020-05-04T15:05:14.399678,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-03T18:24:03.589794,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/citation/,txqb6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eae07ce62d4ab006e6ca9b0/,5eae07ce62d4ab006e6ca9b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqb6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/txqb6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/txqb6,NA

In the current study, we examine the effect of healthy aging, empathy, and anxiety traits on a social communication task using video stimuli that reflect real-world interactions. By means of an online recruitment platform, we asked young, middle-aged, and older adults between the ages 18 and 76 (N=100) to evaluate videos of actors using different forms of literal and nonliteral language, such as sarcasm or teasing. The participants‚Äô task was to infer the speakers‚Äô belief and the speaker‚Äôs intention, and we also collected data on self-reported social anxiety levels and empathy. Older participants demonstrated lower accuracy in discriminating nonliteral from literal interactions compared to younger and middle-aged groups, while older adults with higher perspective-taking scores were more accurate at identifying teasing as nonliteral. This effect was partially mediated by empathy. When evaluating speaker intentions, older adults judged sarcasm as friendlier compared to literal negative utterances. Our results expand on age-related similarities and differences in evaluating speaker intentions and we discuss our results in the context of the Tinge Hypothesis.",TRUE,FALSE,aging|anxiety|empathy|nonliteral language|pragmatics|social cognition,2020-05-04T15:05:14.601916,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-03T18:22:53.817185,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognition and Perception|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/citation/,adgmy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eadfcc362d4ab006d6c941d/,5eadfcc362d4ab006d6c941d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adgmy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adgmy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/adgmy,NA
