Abstract
There is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that leads to COVID-19 and respiratory
failure. Our study is to discover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological
signaling pathways by using a bioinformatics approach to elucidate their potential
pathogenesis. The gene expression profiles of the GSE150819 datasets were originally
produced using an Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens). KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes) and GO (Gene Ontology) were utilized to identify functional
categories and significant pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that the Cytokinecytokine receptor interaction, P53 signaling pathway, and Apoptosis are the main
signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchial organoids (hBOs).
Furthermore, NFKBIA, C3, and CCL20 may be key genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs.
Therefore, our study provides further insights into the therapy of COVID-19.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally (1). Coronaviruses are
single-stranded ribonucleic acids (ssRNA) which contain genome sizes ranging from 26
to 32kb (2). SARS-CoV-2 is formed with structural proteins such as spike glycoproteins,
membrane glycoproteins, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins, and other non-structural
proteins including papain-like proteases and coronavirus main proteases (3). The
infection of cells may trigger host immunity to eliminate viral infections (4). However, an
insufficient immune response may cause severe damage to patients. Most of the serious
infected patients have invasive lesions and are accompanied by inflammation, respiratory
distress syndrome, and death (5). This virus may lead to a difficult-to-treat disease which
affects not only cilia activities but also wide signaling pathways. Moreover, the human
bronchial epithelial cells with ACE2 receptors are the gates for the SARS-CoV-2 invasion
(6). Microarray technologies on COVID-19 have been performed in several studies (7, 8).
However, the shortcomings of microarray, such as the limited sample size (9), lead to a
major challenge to the understanding of key pathogenesis of COVID-19.

In this study, we investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human bronchial organoids
(hBOs) which were generated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEpC). We
analyzed the GEO data (GSE150819), provided by Okamoto T and Takayama K (Osaka
University),

from

the

Gene

Expression

Omnibus

database

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) to identify DEGs and the relevant biological processes
by utilizing comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. These pathogenetic genes and
pathways could be the targets for future therapeutic interventions.

Methods
Data resources
Gene expression profile dataset GSE150819 was downloaded from the GEO database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The data was produced by using an Illumina NextSeq
500 (Homo sapiens) (Research Institute for microbial diseases, Osaka University, Suita,
Osaka, Japan).

Data acquisition and preprocessing
The raw microarray data files between SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchial organoids
(hBOs) from commercially available cryopreserved primary human bronchial epithelial
cells (hBEpC) and uninfected controls were subsequently conducted by R script. We
utilized a classical t-test to identify DEGs with P<.05 and fold change ≥1.5 as being
statistically significant.

Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) database are commonly used for systematic analysis of gene functions and
annotation of biological pathways. GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
of DEGs in this study were performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (http://david.ncifcrf.gov/) online tools. P<0.05 and gene
counts >10 were considered statistically significant.

Module analysis

Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to detect densely connected regions
in Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. The significant modules were from the
constructed PPI network using MCODE from Cytoscape software (https://cytoscape.org/).
the functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID
(http://david.ncifcrf.gov/) online tools.

Results
Identification of DEGs in SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs
To understand the mechanism on SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchus, the modular
transcriptional signature of SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchial organoids (hBOs) was
compared to that of the uninfected controls. A total of 89 genes were identified to be
differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs with the threshold of P<0.01.
Among these DEGs, 59 were up-regulated and 30 down-regulated in SARS-CoV-2
infected hBOs compared with the negative controls. The top 10 up- and down-regulated
genes for SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs and negative controls are listed in Table 1.

Enrichment analysis of DEGs in SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs
To further analyze the biological roles of the DEGs from negative controls versus SARSCoV-2 infected hBOs, we performed the KEGG pathway and GO categories enrichment
analysis (Figure 1). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment is used for interpreting sets of genes,
in which genes are assigned to a set of predefined areas depending on their functional
characteristics (10). We herein identified the top 3 cellular components: “Cell fraction”,
“Insoluble fraction”, and “Membrane fraction”. We then identified the top 3 biological
processes including “Death”, “Cell death”, and “Apoptosis”. We also identified the top 3
molecular functions: “Enzyme inhibitor activity”, “Peptidase inhibitor activity”, and
“Endopeptidase inhibitor activity” (Figure 1).
KEGG is an integrated database resource and a computationally generated database in
many categories including metabolism, other cellular processes, organismal functions,
and human diseases (11). In this study, we identified the top 3 KEGG pathways:
“Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”, “P53 signaling pathway”, and “Apoptosis”
(Figure 1).

PPI network analysis of DEGs in SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs
To explore the relationships of DEGs, we used the Cytoscape software to set up a PPI
network at protein levels. The predefined criterion of combined score >0.7, a total of 30
interactions, and 84 nodes were created to form a PPI network between SARS-CoV-2
infected hBOs and the uninfected hBOs. The top 5 hub genes with degree scores are
depicted in Table 2.

Module analysis
The top significant modules of SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs versus uninfected controls
were analyzed by the functional annotation of the genes (Figure 2). The functional genes
were then analyzed by String and DAVID. We identified the top ten significant biological
processes or pathways: "Leishmaniasis", "Apoptosis", "Measles", "Tuberculosis",
"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection", "Legionellosis", "P53 signaling
pathway", "Pertussis", "NF-kappa B signaling pathway", and "Chagas disease (American
trypanosomiasis)" in Supplemental Table S1.

Discussion
COVID-19 is a highly infectious and transmissible disease among humans (12). Small
groups of patients with COVID-19 who experience severe pneumonia can cause ARDS
and death (13). The primary step after inhalation of SARS coronaviruses is an invasion
of epithelial cells through binding the SARS spike protein to angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (14). An important mechanism regulating lung pathology in
SARS infections is a cytokine storm leading to the "inflammation storm" or “macrophage
activation syndrome” (15). However, how SARS-CoV-2 affected the signaling pathways
and potential mechanisms in epithelial cells or bronchus is totally unknown.
In our study, we identified 59 up-regulated and 30 down-regulated DEGs between SARSCoV-2 infected hBOs and the control ones. To better understand the DEGs, we first
performed the GO analysis. Interestingly, we found the death and apoptosis process were
mainly shown in the biological process panel. A recent report showed that XAF1, TNNF,
and FAS induce T cell apoptosis in COVID-19 patients (16). The previous report showed

cilium abnormalities in bronchus are associated with COVID-19 (17). The cilium shrinking
and abnormal beating lead to secondary infections, apoptosis, and cell death (18). Also,
apoptosis and pericyte loss are identified in alveolar capillaries in COVID-19 infections
(19). Cell death in response to oxidative stress is also found in the global analysis of
SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions (20). Similarly, the apoptosis and death signaling are
critical steps when SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs. It is believed that, during the progress of
COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 will infect extensively tracheal cells leading to apoptosis and
necrosis. COVID-19 is involved in the regulation of enzyme activities in hBOs (21). During
the synthesis of SARS-CoV-2, the polyproteins are translated from the viral RNA (22).
We found that “Enzyme inhibitor activity”, “Peptidase inhibitor activity”, and
“Endopeptidase inhibitor activity” were the top three processes in SARS-CoV-2 infected
hBOs. These findings indicated that SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit the enzyme inhibitor activity
in hBOs to create more polyproteins and viruses. Thus, hBOs may be a potential virus
production base during COVID-19 diseases.
KEGG analysis showed the “Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction” is the main pathway
in SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs. Cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα are in response
to an activating stimulus, and they trigger the cell response via association with the
specific receptors on the cell surface (23). Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and promotes cellular entry (24).
Thus, our results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 entered cells accompanying with many
cytokines binding reactions. To identify these cytokines and inhibit the bindings may
become an effective strategy to treat COVID-19 diseases.
After analyzing the PPI network, we found the NF-κB pathway is involved in the COVID19. The NF-κB pathway is considered as an inflammation center, which is based on the
role in the expression of proinflammatory genes including cytokines, chemokines, and
adhesion molecules (25). NF-κB activation induces various target genes in inflammatory
diseases and NF-κB signaling crosstalk affects many signaling pathways such as STAT3,
RGS12,

WNT–β-catenin,

and

P53

(26-28).

Cytokine

storm

syndromes

and

immunosuppression, which are mainly regulated by NF-κB, are the specific pathological
processes in the severe COVID-19 patients (29, 30). Thus, inhibition of NF-κB therapy
can inhibit the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.

In summary, NFKBIA, C3, and CCL20 may be key genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs.
Our study suggested that “Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”, “P53 signaling
pathway”, and “Apoptosis” were the main signaling pathways during SARS-CoV-2
infection. Our data provide further evidence for the intervention during SARS-CoV-2
infection.
