Abstract
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 is most
closely related to viral metagenomes isolated from bats and, more distantly, pangolins. All are of
sarbecoviruses of the genus Betacoronavirus. We have unravelled their recombinational and
mutational histories. All showed clear evidence of recombination, most events involving the 3'
half of the genomes. The 5' region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free, and a phylogeny
calculated from this region confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to RmYN02 than RaTG13, and
showed that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from RmYN02 at least 26 years ago, and both diverged from
RaTG13 at least 37 years ago; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no
additional information as they matched no other Genbank sequences closely. Simple pairwise
comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non-synonymous changes
probably occurred; the DUF3655 region of the nsp3, the S gene and ORF 8 gene. Differences in
the last two of those regions have probably resulted from recombinational changes, however
differences in the DUF3655 region may have resulted from selection. A hexamer of the proteins
encoded by the nsp3 region may form the molecular pore spanning the double membrane of the
coronavirus replication organelle (Wolff et al., 2020), and perhaps the acidic polypeptide encoded
by DUF3655 lines it, and presents a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention.

Keywords: betacoronaviruses, phylogeny, evolution, SARS-CoV-2, DUF3655, pharmaceutical
intervention.

The family Coronaviridae is divided into two subfamilies, five genera, 26 subgenera, and 46
species (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses; https://talk.ictvonline.org/). However,
only members of the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus have been reported to infect
humans. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes that are
several-fold larger than those of other RNA viruses (Anthony et al., 2017); this reflects the fact
that the CoV nsp14 is a proof-reading bi-functional enzyme, ExoN (Ferron et al., 2018) responsible
for recombination (Gribble et al., 2020).

In December of 2019 a novel coronavirus causing pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China
(Wu et al., 2020). Initially, the virus was called 2019-nCoV, but it is now known as SARS-CoV2 (Gorbalenya et al., 2020), and is the etiologic agent of the disease COVID-19. It is the seventh
CoV of humans to be reported (Rodríguez-Román and Gibbs, 2020; Ye et al., 2020), and it has
generated a pandemic with more than 10 million people infected, and 0.5 million people dead by
the end of June 2020. While trying to establish from where this virus emerged, there have been
conflicting claims that it may have come from bats or pangolins, and is most closely related to
either the YN02 virus or the RaTG13 virus (Li et al., 2020; Lin and Chen, 2020; Wang et al., 2020;
Xiao et al, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), and in this short paper we resolve some of these differences
and discus an interesting betacoronavirus region - DUF3655!

Sequences were downloaded from the Genbank and GISAID databases. They were edited
using BioEdit (Hall, 1999), aligned using the neighbor-joining (NJ) option of ClustalX
(Jeanmougin et al., 1998), and the maximum likelihood (ML) method PhyML 3.0 (ML) (Guindon
and Gascuel, 2003). Sequences were tested for the presence of phylogenetic anomalies using the
full suite of options in RDP4 with default parameters (Maynard-Smith, 1992; Holmes et al., 1999;
Padidam et al., 1999; Gibbs et al., 2000; Martin and Rybicki, 2000; McGuire and Wright, 2000;
Posada and Crandall, 2001; Martin et al., 2005; Boni et al., 2007; Lemey et al., 2009; Martin et
al., 2015); anomalies found by four or fewer methods and with greater than 10-5 random probability
were ignored; statistical support for their topologies was assessed using the SH method
(Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 1999). Trees were drawn using Figtree Version 1.3
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/soft ware/figtree/; 12 May 2018) and a commercial graphics package.
Patristic distances within trees were calculated using Patristic 1.0 (Fourment and Gibbs, 2006) to
convert trefiles to matrices of pairwise branch lengths.
Pairs of sequences were individually aligned using the TranslatorX server (Abascal et al.,
2010; http://translatorx.co.uk). They were then compared using the DnDscan method (Gibbs et
al., 2007), which is a simple heuristic method for scanning aligned sequences, codon-by-codon

and codon position-by-position, to identify the NS and S changes that may have occurred
converting one codon to the other. NS and S variation is taken to be the sum of the scores for all
pairwise position comparisons within that codon. Each comparison involves substituting a
nucleotide of one codon with the homologous nucleotide of the other codon and then checking
how this affects the amino acid it encodes using the standard genetic code. The process is then
reversed, replacing the nucleotides of the second codon of the pair with those of the first, again
only one at a time. Thus, there are six possible exchanges between a single codon pair. If, say, the
first codon is ACT (Thr) and the second GGA (Gly), then all three nucleotides differ and six out
of six changed codons are produced. Substituting of the first position of ACT (Thr) with the first
nucleotide of the second codon (GGA) will generate GCT (Ala), a NS change, and similarly
substituting of the second position C with the second position G generates AGT (Ser), also a NS
change, and the third generates ACA (Thr), a S change. Likewise swopping the second GGA
(Gly) generates AGA (Arg), GCA (Ala) and GGT (Gly), which are NS, NS and S changes
respectively. In all, the pairwise comparison provides a score of 2/6 S changes, and 4/6 to the NS.
Pairs of codons that are identical merely contribute 0/6 to both the total S and NS scores for the
window position, and indels are treated as 6/6 NS changes. These calculations make no assumption
about the direction of evolutionary change nor of the optimal or most parsimonious path of
substitution between two codons. The aim is to assess each of the single possible substitutions
indicated by two homologous but different codons. The results for each codon position in the
alignment are recorded in a CSV file so that they can be further processed for viewing. The scores
used for Fig. 3, for example, were running (overlapping) sums of 5 codon scores, and thus the
NS=5.0 maxima represent five adjacent codons each with a maximum NS score of one.
The theoretical isoelectric points of the DUF3655 peptides were calculated using the online
ProtParam facility of the ExPASy (Gasteiger et al., 2005; https://web.expasy.org/protoparam/).

In mid-May 2020 a BLAST search (Altschul et al., 1990) of the Genbank databases was
made using the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence (NC_045512) as a query, and over 100
related full-length genomic sequences were identified. These were downloaded, and two from the
GISAID database that had been discussed in reports, were added (Rodríguez-Román and Gibbs,
2020).

The sequences were aligned using MAFFT with its L option. A Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
phylogeny of these sequences identified eight distinct genomic sequences in the SARS-CoV-2
lineage, together with eleven others in a more distant divergence that included the SARS-CoV
reference sequence (NC_004718), and with an outgroup of ten other coronavirus genomes. These
were checked for recombination using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP 4.95) (Martin
et al., 2015). Recombinants were detected in, and between, all betacoronaviruses, but not between
them and the outgroup sequences. Eleven were chosen for analysis; all eight from the SARS-CoV-

Genes are found in all three reading frames of coronavirus genomes, therefore the 11
sequences were aligned using MAFFT-L, and BioEdit (Hall, 1999) was used to create, for each of
the eleven, a single concatenated alignment of their open reading frames (i.e. all the genes in the
same reading frame). We call these, concats. The concats were aligned, using their encoded amino
acids as guide, by the TranslatorX online server (Abascal et al., 2010; http://translatorx.co.uk) with
its MAFFT option (Katoh and Standley, 2013), and further refined by hand resulting in a concat
alignment of 29,286 nts.

The maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny of the eleven complete sarbecovirus concats
(Fig. 1A), calculated by the PhyML method, confirmed that they form two lineages diverging from
the midpoint root (circled), one including SARS-1 and the other SARS-2. However, the individual
nodes in the SARS-2 crown group were not fully supported statistically in this phylogeny; only an
average of 0.89 SH support for the terminal three nodes of the SARS-2 lineage. The concat
alignment was therefore checked for recombinants using RDP 4.95, and gave the recombinant map
shown in Fig. 2, which shows that all concats have recombinant regions. Notably SARS-2, YN02
and RaTG13, which we call the crown group of the SARS-2 lineage, all have two identically placed
recombinant regions from the same minor 'parent', Rf4092 (i.e. a SARS-1 lineage bat virus).
Significant recombinant regions specific to each these three viruses in the spike region, and 3' to
it, provided no additional phylogenetic or dating information as they matched no other sequences
in Genbank closely (<84% ID).

Concats of the basal branches of the phylogeny, ZC45 and ZXC21, have a large central
recombinant region most closely related to the homologous region of HKU3-8, which is of the
SARS-1 lineage. Further recombinant regions were found in all the sequences, but mostly in their
3' terminal halves and, in summary, only one statistically significant recombinant region (i.e. not
marked in Fig. 2 with a black dot at its 5' end) was found between nts 1 and 11496 of all eleven
concats, and that was in the ZC45 sequence (nts 1443-1768; parent 'unknown') (Fig. 2). Thus,
importantly, the 5' terminal region of all eleven concats, stretching from nts 1 to 11496, was
available to obtain a phylogeny based on point mutations alone, and not confounded by
recombination; the ZC45 recombinant is unlikely to have distorted the phylogeny much as it is
only 2.8% of the 11496 nts.

Fig. 1B shows the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny calculated from nts 1-11496
region of the 11 concats. All nodes in this phylogeny have full statistical support (i.e. 1.0 SH), and
most of the 'root to tip' distances in the tree were similar, unlike those in Fig. 1A; one effect of
recombination. The topology of the '1-11496' tree was different from that of the tree of complete
concats as the SARS-2 concat now groups with all SARS-2 lineage bat isolates, and the pangolin
isolates are now basal. Closest to the SARS-2 concat is the YN02 concat with the RaTG13 concat
a little further away.

The minor 'parent' of the shared recombinant regions in the centre of the SARS-2, YN02
and RaTG13 concats (nts 14372-15124 and nts 16383-17566) is Rf4092 of the SARS-1 lineage.
These recombinant regions were not found in the other bat sequences of the SARS-2 lineage
indicating that they resulted from a recombination event that occurred after the crown group
diverged from the ZXC21 and ZC45 branch, but before RaTG13 diverged. Confusingly however
the second of these recombinant regions was also found in the pangolin G/1/19 concat!

The recombination map also shows the complex recombinational history of the spike gene,
the position of which is coloured yellow in the simplified genomic map at the top of Fig. 2. This
is confirmed by the phylogeny of that region (Fig. 1C), which is fully supported statistically except
for the SARS-1, Rf4092 and HKU3-8 cluster (mean 0.91 SH). The spike phylogeny has pangolin
genes immediately basal to the SARS-2 and RaTG13 twig, and the spike region of YN02 gene is
shown to be from the SARS-1 lineage. However, it is essential to realize that, although we know
the hosts from which the isolates were collected, other hosts may have been infected en route.

The dates of the nodes in the '1-11496' SARS-2 phylogeny (Fig. 1B) can be inferred using
published estimates of the evolutionary rate of the SARS-2 population in the human population,
assuming that the pre- and post- emergence rates are the same (Rodríguez-Román and Gibbs,
2020). Various estimates of the SARS-2 evolutionary rate have been published recently; 1.126 x
10-3 (95 % BCI: 1.03–1.23 x 10-3) substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) (Candido et al., 2020),
1.1×10−3 s/s/y (95% CI 7.03×10−4 and 1.5×10−3 s/s/y) (Duchêne et al., 2020), 9.41×10-4 s/s/y +/4.99×10-5 (Pybus et al., 2020) and 8 x 10-4 s/s/y (Resende et al., 2020).

The mean of these rate estimates is 0.99 x10-3 s/s/y, and, assuming that the virus is
evolving at the same rate as the '1-11496' region of its genome, then the mean patristic distances
passing through nodes in Fig. 1B suggest that the SARS-2 and YN02 viruses diverged in 1994
CE (26.03 years before present; ybp), they diverged from RatG13 in 1983 CE (36.8 ybp), and
from ZXC21 and ZC45 in 1936 CE (83.6 ybp) and from G/1/19 in 1908 CE (111.8 ybp). The
standard deviation of the branch length estimates varied between 0.8% and 2.8%. The most
recent estimates are probably the most accurate because although all mutations contribute to the
‘molecular clock’, most are quickly lost (Duchêne et al. 2014), and therefore times to the older
dates are overestimated. Nonetheless, it is probable that SARS-2 and YN02 diverged over 20
years ago, and the two recombinant regions characteristic of the SARS-2, YN02 and RaTG13
virus genomes were acquired by their shared progenitor more than 30, but less than 80, years
ago! All these datings are based on a large number of assumptions, and could be earlier as
concluded by Wang et al. (2020).

Finally, we compared the concat sequences directly in pairs, not only to identify any
regions that were evolving abnormally, but also to confirm the recombination map patterns shown
in Fig. 2. We used the DnDscan method (Gibbs et al., 2007 - see Methods) as this enables simple
visual comparisons to be made, as well as numerical. Fig. 3 shows the synonymous (S - blue) and
non-synonymous (NS - gold) differences in five of 45 pairwise possible comparisons of eleven

concats. It can be seen that S differences occur throughout most of the comparisons, but NS
differences are most obvious in three regions of the genomes. There are slightly fewer S
differences between SARS-2 and YN02 than between SARS-2 and RatG13 or between YN02 and
RaTG13, and this confirms the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B); it shows that SARS-2 is closest to
YN02 as the total DnDscan scores for the '1-11496' regions of SARS-2 v YN02 are S 100.0 NS
27.5, but, for the other combinations, S134.0 NS 30.1 and S131.5 NS37.6, respectively. The
largest NS differences are in the DnDscans of the spike protein gene, especially its RBD region
and an adjacent "-PRRA- " insertion (Andersen et al. 2020). Again, the recombination map results
(Fig. 2) are confirmed by the DnDscan as the spike region of the SARS-2 x RaTG13 comparison,
especially its 5' end, has few NS differences, as they share an 'unknown' recombinant (nts 21257 22152).

There are also two other regions of the concats consistently showing larger numbers of NS
differences. One is centred on the 'Domain of Unknown Function' (DUF) 3655 region of the nsp3,
a "disordered binding region" (Prates et al. 2020), that is N' terminally adjacent to the ADP-ribose
phosphatase. This region of increased NS differences was found to some extent in all concat
comparisons suggesting that its differences result from evolution/selection, whereas the other, the
ORF 8 region near the 3' end of the genome, was not found in some comparisons, such as SARS2 x RaTG13, and may therefore have resulted from recombination. The DUF3655 region is
discussed below.

We have discombobulated the recombinational and mutational history of the SARS-2 lineage
of betacoronaviruses and their metagenomes using the published genomic sequences, despite the
possibilities, in this metagenomic age, of the sort of problems outlined by Chan and Zhan (2020).
We have shown that the 5' third of their genome is largely free of recombinant regions, n-rec,
whereas the remainder is a mélange of recombinant regions from various 'parental' genomes. The
SARS-2 crown group share a distinctive pair of recombinant regions that are most closely related
to the homologous region of the SARS-1 lineage bat virus, Rf4092. A phylogeny calculated from
the 5' n-rec region of the eleven concats shows that the SARS-2 lineage has basal branches of
viruses isolated from pangolins, and a crown group consisting of SARS-2 together with YN02,
RatG13, ZXC21 and ZC45 all of which come from bats, and in that phylogeny SARS-2 is more
closely related to YN02 than RaTG13. This is confirmed by the DnDscan comparisons of the
three viruses. YN02, however, has a recombinant region in its 3' half (nts 21098-24042) of
'unknown' parentage, but which is probably close to the pangolin virus G/1/19, and which is not
present in SARS-2 or RaTG13. Thus, most of the SARS-2 concat, especially its 5' 39%, is closest
to the homologous regions of YN02, but the intact concats of SARS-2 and RaTG13 are more
distant but complete.

Our conclusions about the relationships of the SARS-2 crown group are confirmed in the
report of Latinne et al (2020; Fig. 3A) of a large survey of bat viruses of SE Asia. They used
primers to amplify a 440 nts region of the RdRp genes of these viruses, and based their phylogeny
on that region. Although their amplicon overlapped the 3' end of one of the recombinant regions
shared by the SARS-2, YN02 and RaTG13 concats, the overlap is only 78 nts (18%), and the
comparison of the 440 nts amplicons found SARS-2 to be closest to YN02.

DnDscan, a simple direct comparison of two sequences, found regions of NS change where
other more complex methods (Angeletti et al., 2020) did not, and we overcame possible problems
with sliding windows (Schmid and Yang, 2008) by making several homologous comparisons. The
NS differences around codon 1000 of the DnDscans are from the DUF3655 region. DUF3655
marks the 5' end of the nsp3 region and is adjacent to its ADP-ribose phosphatase gene (Michalska
et al., 2020). It encodes the N-terminal portion of the nsp3 protein, which has recently been
identified by cryo-electron microscopy as forming hexameric molecular pores spanning the double
membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle (Wolff et al., 2020). The pores probably allow
the progeny SARS-2 genomes to pass from the replication organelle into the lumen of the cytosol,
where their 'structural genes' are translated, and together they are assembled to form progeny
virions (Hsin et al., 2018). Table 2 shows the DUF3655 peptides of the eleven betacoronaviruses
with the acidic and basic residues outlined with different colours; acidic residues in red, and the
few basic residues in blue, and with the theoretical pI of these peptides ranging from 3.01 - 3.40,
in sharp contrast to the nucleocapsid protein encoded by ORF9 which binds the progeny genomes
in the cytosol and has a pI of 10.07 (McBride et al., 2014; Verheije et al., 2010). Table 2 also
shows the secondary structures of the SARS-2 crown group DUF3655 proteins predicted by the
PSIPRED Workbench (Buchan and Jones, 2019). The DUF3655 proteins are found to have similar
N-terminal regions of unstructured residues attached to homologous helical regions, and with Ctermini that are more variable in length and composition. The fact that the DUF3655 protein is so
acidic indicates its likely function in the pore where it may both electrostatically stabilize the lumen
of the pore (Desikan et al., 2020) and ensure that long negatively charged nucleic acid molecules,
like progeny viral genomes, are held centrally in the lumen of the pore as they pass through.

The FFPred Prediction database of PSIPRED (Cozzetto et al., 2016) found that the most
likely "biological process" of SARS-2, YN02 and RaTG13 that involves their DUF3655 proteins
is "regulation of metabolic process" (mean probability 0.978) and "regulation of gene expression"

The DUF3655 region seems to have evaded virological, medical and pharmaceutical
scrutiny so far (e.g. Chen and Zhong, 2020; Wei et al., 2020). We suggest that it is probably
involved in a unique rate-limiting step of the coronavirus replicative cycle, and may make CoV
infections susceptible to drugs, like chloroquine, that increase cellular pH
(https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-questions-around-potential-treatmentsfor-covid-19/ March 18 2020). The detailed analysis of this region, specially from residues 9 to

27, which have many negatively charged amino acids (Asp and Glu) (Table 2), and probably the
absence of binding sites for macromolecules (RNA, DNA and proteins), would suggest that this
region might be an excellent target for the development of an effective treatment for
sarbecoviruses.

The DUF3655 region warrants more attention especially as repetitive acidic amino acids
are present in similar regions of the genomes of human αCoV (JX504050, KF514433, MT438700),
MERS-βCoV (MN481964), bulbul δCoV (NC_011547) and infectious bronchitis γCoV
(NC_001451).
