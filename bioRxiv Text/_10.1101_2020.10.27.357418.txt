Abstract

Spanish flu and other influenza outbreaks, the recent Zika epidemics, and the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic are the most profound examples of severe widespread diseases that are caused by RNA
viruses. Perhaps less well known yet dangerous RNA viruses cause deadly diseases such as polio, Ebola,
measles, rubella, yellow fever, dengue fever and many others. To combat a particular viral disease by
diminishing its spread and number of fatal cases, effective vaccines and antivirals are indispensable.
Therefore, quick access to the means of discovery of new treatments for any epidemic outbreak is of
great interest and in vitro biochemical assays are the basis of drug discovery. The recent outbreak of the
coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
demands an affordable and reliable assay for testing antivirals. Here, we developed a quick and
inexpensive high-throughput fluorescent assay to test inhibitors of viral proteases. Accordingly, we
employed this assay to sample inhibitors for papain-like protease from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we
validated this assay for screening inhibitors of flaviviral protease from the tick-borne encephalitis virus
to emphasize a broad range of applications of our approach. This fluorescent high-throughput assay is
based on fluorescent energy transfer (FRET) between two distinct fluorescent proteins (eGFP and
mCherry) connected via a substrate polypeptide. When the substrate is cleaved, FRET is abolished and
the change in fluorescence corresponds to reaction progress. Our data show that this assay can be used
for testing the inhibitors in the 96 or 384 well plates format with robust and reproducible outcomes.

Introduction
RNA viruses are considered to be one of the most severe threats to the human population and quality
of life [1]. Since the beginning of this millennium, we have witnessed at least 60 epidemic outbreaks
around the world, mostly caused by RNA viruses. Excluding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these
have caused more than a million deaths. The viruses responsible include: influenza virus, Ebola virus
(EBOV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue viruses (DENV), measles, and
coronaviruses such as SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2. The effect on human health is devastating, just
as is the economic burden of these epidemics. The global cost of COVID-19 alone is astronomical and
is predicted to surpass the GDPs of Germany, the UK and France combined. Therefore, the global
importance of targeting the RNA viruses is indisputable.
The name and classification of RNA viruses originate from their genomic material which is composed
of single-stranded or double-stranded RNA. Recent work has classified RNA viruses into 5 different
orders with 47 families [2]. Although the nature of nucleic acid determines the classification of these
viruses, more detailed classification is difficult due to the high mutation rate and recombination of the
RNA viruses [3, 4]. RNA viruses have the highest mutation rates among all viruses, which often leads
to the development of resistance against antivirals. These high mutation rates generate new species,
where 2-3 novel viruses are discovered every year [5]. Understanding how mutation rates drive and
shape the evolution of new and potentially deadly viruses that can cross interspecies boundaries is an
ongoing topic of scientific interest [6].
Upon the infection of the host cell, viral RNA is replicated by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
and translated to one or more polyproteins. Subsequently, these polyproteins are processed by viral and
host proteases into individual structural and nonstructural proteins. The presence and the functionality
of viral enzymes, particularly proteases and polymerases, is a vital step in the replication and spread of
the virus. A potential antiviral drug is correspondingly aimed at inhibiting the viral enzymes, thus
limiting the spread of the virus. However, approved antivirals against RNA viruses are generally
lacking, and only a few RNA viruses can be currently treated by approved antivirals: the influenza virus,
the respiratory syncytial virus, and hemorrhagic viruses such as the Lassa mammarenavirus or the
hepatitis C virus (HCV). Without antiviral drugs, the only current form of treatment is supportive care,
i.e. relieving pain and other symptoms. What has been raising hope for developing RNA antivirals are
the successes of antiviral therapy against the HCV [7]. The potent effects of these antivirals are mainly
based on targeting proteases and polymerases, two of the essential viral enzymes. Basic research of
these enzymes has formed the groundwork of rational drug design, enabling the development of specific
molecules that bind and inhibit the enzymes. However, the action of novel synthetic molecules within
the human body is rather unpredictable, leading to a high failure rate in the later stages of clinical trials.
Additionally, the rapid rates of mutation further increase the overall fitness of the virus, making it

resistant to antiviral agents, especially in the case of single-compound regimens. Greater antiviral effect
is achieved by the combination of several antivirals, which usually include both polymerase and
protease inhibitors.
A papain-like protease (PLpro) is one of two proteases encoded by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the
cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic. PLpro is a deubiquitinating-like (DUB-like) enzyme which
negates the host interferon-induced cellular response by cleaving the interferon-stimulated gene 15
(ISG15). ISG15 is a small di-ubiquitin-like protein which is overexpressed during viral infection and
covalently attached to newly synthesized proteins to mark the viral invader. ISG15 impedes the
processes of the viral replication cycle. It is thought to block the formation of new viral particles due to
the steric hindrance of ISG15 molecules attached to structural proteins that form the virion [8, 9].
Therefore, cessation of the viral defense mediated by PLpro makes it a bona fide therapeutic target.
Moreover, the inhibition of the PLpro enzyme from other coronaviruses has been demonstrated to
suppress viral replication [10-12].
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most significant flaviviral tick-borne disease that causes brain
damage, paralysis and death. There are 10,000 to 12,000 reported cases of TBE each year and an
increase in the worldwide risk of incidence is predicted on account of the expansion of the tick
population in times of global warming and human mobility [13-15]. Other severe human pathogens in
the Flavivirus genus include ZIKV, DENV, YFV, West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis
virus (JEV). The virology and enzymology of YFV, DEVN, WNV and ZIKV have been studied
extensively for the past 30 years, and several kinetic and structural studies of key enzymes are available
[16-21]. Significant structural and functional similarity between proteins of a single genus make these
findings transferable and instrumental in other studies [22].
TBEV polyprotein is processed into three structural proteins which form the envelope, membrane and
capsid, and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins, named NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5.
NS3 possesses two distinct activities, helicase and protease activity, on N-terminus and C-terminus,
respectively. NS3 protease (NS3pro) is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease whose cleavage site is
specified by the sequence XX↓Y where X is a positively charged residue and Y is a small residue such
as serine or glycine [23]. NS2B anchors the NS3 to the endoplasmic reticulum by its termini, and is
known to participate in the protease reaction.
Here, we report a general FRET-based method for high-throughput quantitative screening (HTS) of
potential inhibitors, and for testing other enzymatic properties of viral and non-viral proteases. In
addition to validating potential rationally designed molecules, HTS enables screening of already
developed and clinically approved molecules that can potentially serve other purposes. As HTS plays

an indispensable role in antiviral drug development, the methods must be as economical and rapid as
possible while granting high reproducibility and robustness.
For our assay, we have selected common, attainable and stable fluorescent proteins. The FRET pair of
our choice consisted of a fluorescence donor (eGFP) and a fluorescence acceptor (mCherry). FRET is
a non-radiative transfer of energy from one fluorophore (donor) to the other chromophore (acceptor).
Essentially, FRET-based assays report on the distance between the donor and the acceptor. While the
fluorophores are in close proximity, the donor is excited and transfers its energy to the acceptor, which
then produces a fluorescence signal at its characteristic wavelength. Upon separation, i.e. increase in
the distance between the fluorophores, FRET is abolished, and the acceptor ceases to produce the signal
(Figure 1). Thanks to its dependence on inverse-sixth-power distance, FRET is a remarkably sensitive
tool for measuring dissociation of molecules. FRET is also influenced by an overlap between the
emission spectrum of the donor and absorption spectrum of the acceptor, quantum yield of the donor,
orientation between fluorophores dipoles and other physical factors of the environment [24]. The
fluorescent pair can be readily changed accordingly to the needs of a particular experiment. As a proof
of principle, we have selected two medicinally significant targets, the PLpro from SARS-CoV-2 and the
NS2B-NS3 protease from TBEV, and tested several small molecules to optimize and validate the assay
for an array of molecules and also different classes of proteases.
Materials and Methods
Cloning, expression and purification of the recombinant NS2B-NS3pro and PLpro
The DNA sequence encoding the TBEV NS2B-NS3pro enzyme (strain Hypr; GeneBank: KP716978.1)
was commercially synthesized (Invitrogen) and encoded NS2B (residues 45-96), a GGGGSGGGG
linker and NS3 (residues 116-131) followed by a 6xHis-tag. The NS2B-NS3pro encoding gene was
cloned into the NcoI and the NotI sites of pRSFD vector (Novagen). The vector was transformed into
Escherichia coli (E. coli) NiCo21 (DE3) cells and cultured in LB medium with 40 μg/ml of kanamycin.
The culture was left to shake overnight at 37 °C and then used to inoculate ZY5052 autoinduction
media. After reaching an optical density of 0.6-0.8 (OD600) at 37 °C, the temperature was lowered to
18 °C and the culture was grown overnight. The cells were lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer
containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8; 300 mM NaCl; 20mM imidazole; 10% glycerol and 3 mM βmercaptoethanol (β-ME). The supernatant was separated by centrifugation, incubated with 2 ml of NiNTA resin (Machery-Nagel) and extensively washed with the lysis buffer using the batch technique.
The slurry was loaded on the column and the protein was eluted with the lysis buffer supplemented with
300 mM imidazole pH = 8.0. The eluate was further purified using the size-exclusion Superdex 75
HiLoad 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) with a gel filtration buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8; 300 mM

NaCl; 10% glycerol and 3 mM β-ME). Protein was desalted on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE
Healthcare) and loaded on an anion-exchange HiTrap Q HP column. The protein was eluted by a salt
gradient in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8, 50 mM NaCl 10% glycerol and 3 mM β-ME). The purity
of the protein was verified on SDS-PAGE in 15% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide gel, stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue. The protein was concentrated to 2.8 mg/mol frozen in N2(l) and kept at -80
°C.
The gene encoding the PLpro (also known as nsp3) protein from SARS-CoV-2 (YP_009725299.1) was
also synthesized commercially (Invitrogen) and cloned into the pSUMO1 vector with N-terminal 8xHis
conjugated with yeast SUMO, forming a fusion solubility/affinity tag. The plasmid was transformed
into E. coli NiCo21 (DE3) and expressed in ZY5052 autoinduction media supplemented with 50 µM
ZnSO4 and affinity purified identically as the NS2B-NS3pro. The protein was desalted on a HiPrep 26/10
desalting column (GE Healthcare) and loaded on an anion-exchange HiTrap Q HP column (GE
Healthcare). Next, the 8xHis-SUMO-tag was cleaved using SUMO protease from yeast (Ulp1), and
after overnight incubation at 4°C, the sample was loaded onto a HisTrap HP, equilibrated in a lysis
buffer. Unbound fractions containing PLpro were pooled, concentrated and loaded on a Superdex 75
HiLoad 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7,4; 50 mM NaCl;
10% glycerol and 3 mM β-ME. The protein was concentrated, frozen in N2(l) and kept at -80 °C.
Preparation of fluorescent substrates eGFP-RSSRRSDLVFS-mCherry and mCherry-ISG-15eGFP
A substrate for the proteolytic reaction of NS2B-NS3pro was designed to have a sequence
(RSSRRSDLVFS) derived from a cleavage site present between the NS2B and NS3 of TBEV, flanked
by GFP and mCherry fluorophores resulting in a plasmid encoding for GFP-RSSRRSDLVFS-mCherry.
The plasmid was prepared by restriction cloning. First, a gene encoding for GFP was cloned in the
pHis2 vector. In the second step, the NS2B-NS3pro site and mCherry were added. The plasmid was
transformed into the E. coli NiCo21 (DE3), and the protein was expressed in LB medium supplemented
with 0.1 μg/ml of ampicillin, 10 μM ZnSO4, 1 mM of MgCl2 and MgSO4, 0.25 mM KCl, and 15 μM
FeCl2 dissolved in citric acid. The media was incubated in a shaker at 37 °C. After reaching an OD600
of 0.4, the temperature was lowered to 25 °C, at which 0.3 μM IPTG was added to initiate the
expression. The temperature was immediately lowered to 18 °C, and the culture was grown overnight.
The purification steps were similar to those used to produce the NS2B-NS3pro. The cells were briefly
lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8; 300 mM NaCl; 20mM imidazole; 10%
(v/v) glycerol and 3 mM β-ME), and then supplemented with one tablet/l of the complete mini EDTAfree protease inhibitor cocktail. The supernatant was purified in a Ni-NTA column, Superdex 75 HiLoad
16/600 column, HiPrep 26/10 desalting column, and HiTrap Q HP column, respectively, using the same

buffers and procedures as described above. Additionally, NaCl was added to a final concentration of
800 mM and the protein was further purified on the Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/600 column. The enzyme
stored in -80 °C.
Human ISG15 is the substrate of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The gene encoding ISG15 was subcloned in
between genes encoding the FRET pair consisting of mCherry and eGFP (Figure 1A). All these
components were amplified using PCR, and they were cloned into the plasmid pET-24a using a Gibson
assembly [25]. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli NiCo21 (DE3), expressed and purified to
homogeneity. The final recombinant protein used for the assays contained an N-terminal 6 x His-Tag,
mCherry, a cleavage site for TEV protease, ISG15 and eGFP (mCherry-ISG15-eGFP). The TEV site
was included for validation and versatility of the substrate.
FRET-based assays of the NS2B-NS3pro and PLpro activity and inhibition
The reactions of the proteases and their FRET substrates were performed in 80 μl in black 384-well
plates. In the case of NS2B-NS3pro reactions, there was a 2.5 μM protease and 0.25 μM substrate. In the
case of the PLpro reaction, there was 20 nM protease and 1 μM substrate. The reaction buffer contained
20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM β-ME for NS2B-NS3pro or 20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.4,
50 mM NaCl, 10 % Glycerol, 3 mM β-ME for PLpro. The reaction conditions were optimized to fulfil
the HTS character. In the case of the inhibitor 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), β-ME was
omitted from the buffer due to the easy reduction of DTNB to 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (TNB). Similarly,
β-ME was omitted in the cases of 2-MP, 6-MP and Antabuse. The enzyme stock solution was desalted
using the MicroSpin G-25 columns (Cytiva) when testing the easily reduced inhibitors. The titration
series of the inhibitor was performed in a mixture containing a constant concentration of the substrate.
Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes (i.e. 40 μl) of the mixture containing the substrate
and inhibitor with a mixture containing the enzyme. For the negative control, the substrate mixture did
not include the inhibitor. Another control was set up by not adding the enzyme into the reaction mixture.
Every reaction was performed in triplicate. Measurements were performed using the Tecan microplate
reader at 25 °C for 6 hours (NS2B-NS3pro) or 40-60 mins (PLpro). To prevent the NS2B-NS3pro reaction
mixture from evaporating, the plates were covered with a transparent Crystal Clear Sealing tape
(Hampton research).
In the reaction, the decreasing fluorescence (FRET) intensity of mCherry was monitored at an emission
wavelength of 610 nm. The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, with a 5 nm bandwidth for both slits.
The lag time was zero, the integration time was 20 μs, and the settle time was 10 ms for 400 Hz of flash
frequency. An optimal 96% gain was calculated in every measurement. A Z-position was set at 20000
μm height. For each time point, 10 flashes were integrated and combined with the multiple reads per
well with 100 μm offset from the border of the well. At the end of the measurement, SDS sample buffer

(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.8; 0,25 M glycine; 0,1% (w/w) SDS) was added to terminate the reaction and
validate the progress on the SDS-PAGE. The gel was scanned, using a laser at 532 nm and filter at 660
nm on the Amersham Typhoon Biomolecular Imager (Cytiva).
Determination of the inhibitor potency
To quantify the inhibitory effect of the tested molecules, we determined the half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) from the measured data. The slope of relative fluorescence units (RFU) versus time
was calculated from points in the first 2.5 hours in the case of NS2B-NS3pro, and 40-60 min in the case
of PLpro. As the slope corresponded to the reaction velocity, we normalized every calculated slope of
the inhibition reaction according to the calculated slope of the two control reactions—one in which the
inhibitor was omitted (100% activity), and the second in which both inhibitor and enzyme were omitted
(0% activity). These normalized data were plotted against the log of the concentration of the inhibitor
to give an IC50 curve of the specific inhibitor.
Results
Preparation of TBEV chymotrypsin-like protease and SARS-CoV2 papain-like protease
The proteolytic activity of the TBEV NS3 protease is dependent on association with the NS2B cofactor.
We prepared the NS2B-NS3 protease construct composed of NS2B (residues 45-96 linked with residues
116 to 131), followed by residues 1-190 of NS3 linked via a glycine-rich linker (Figure S1A). This
construct is similar to the constructs previously used to express other active and soluble flaviviral
proteases, such as DENV [26]. The recombinant NS2B-NS3pro protease was transformed and
expressed in E. coli NiCo21 (DE3) cells and purified to homogeneity with yields of 2.4 mg per 1 litre
of E. coli culture. The junction between NS2B and NS3 was cleaved by autoproteolytic activity during
the purification (Figure S1B) as it has been observed for ZIKV protease [18]. The cleavage site
corresponds to the enzyme’s specificity for two basic residues followed by a small residue (here ArgArg-Ser) which directly confirmed the in vitro enzymatic activity. PLpro from SARS-CoV2 was recently
recognized to facilitate specific cleavage of the di-ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 [27]. We have also
produced the PLpro protein recombinantly in E.coli and purified it to homogeneity
Fluorogenic substrates for NS2B-NS3pro and PLpro and optimization of activity assays
A sequence of the substrate for the proteolytic reaction of NS2B-NS3pro was designed to have a natural
cleavage site present between the NS2B and NS3 of TBEV, flanked by GFP and mCherry fluorescent
proteins on the N and C terminus, respectively (Figure 1). This recombinant substrate was expressed in
E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The fluorogenic PLpro substrate was generated similarly as for

NS2B-NS3pro, but the substrate molecule, ISG15, was cloned between the genes for the identical FRET
pair (mCherry and eGFP) (Figure 1). This fusion protein was recombinantly expressed in E. coli and
purified to homogeneity too.
The activities of both NS2B-NS3pro and PLpro were tested in vitro using small-batch reactions in
physiological conditions. The results of these reactions and the subsequent activity of both proteases
were validated on an SDS-PAGE based assay (Figure 1). Then, the fluorescent properties of NS2BNS3pro and PLpro substrates were tested on a plate reader with adjustable wavelength (Tecan). In the
case of FRET-based kinetics, both the increase of the donor fluorescence or decrease of the acceptor
fluorescence can be followed to determine the rate of the reactions. We measured both the excitation
and the emission spectra of the substrate and of the final product. This allowed us to determine the
spectral conditions where the change of fluorescence was greatest upon the addition of the enzyme
(Figure S2). The optimal excitation wavelength was 488 nm and the optimal emission wavelength was
610 nm. These parameters were used for all the FRET measurements.
Quantitative FRET assay for testing potential inhibitors of viral proteases in a high-throughput
format
With established reaction conditions for the assay, we proceeded to measure the optimal enzyme
concentration to achieve steady-state kinetics where the reaction rate is constant. This allows the linear
fit of reaction rates for a given well. It additionally gives sufficient time for the measurement of the
reactions in a high-throughput mode in the entire plate. We tested serial dilutions of enzymes with
constant amounts of the substrate. The fluorescence change and reaction rates were satisfactory when
we used 1 μM substrate and 20 nM enzyme in the case for PLpro, and 0.25 μM substrate and 2.5 μM
enzyme in the case for NS2B-NS3pro (Figure 1-3).
We selected several inhibitors of PLpro and NS2B-NS3pro to be tested in our FRET-based assay in the
384-well plate format. All inhibitors were dissolved close to their solubility limits to achieve the
maximum range of concentrations in individual assays. Typically, we prepared inhibitors at 3 mM, 10
mM or 50 mM concentrations and, where possible, serial dilutions of inhibitors in the reaction buffer
were used. The 384-well plate layout of the reaction allowed for the following setup: two control
reactions where no enzyme or inhibitor was present, twelve to sixteen different reactions with a gradient
of concentration, and one control with both enzyme and substrate. In this set, the reactions were
measured in three to four technical replicates, and all of the sets of these reactions were repeated at least
three times. The time allowed for the proteolytic reaction was 40-60 mins for PLpro, and 6 hours for
NS2B-NS3pro. Our intention was the rapid measurement of the IC50 values in a broad range of
concentrations. Up to 3 different inhibitors were measured simultaneously. The assay setup was

optimized such that the linear phase of the reaction would be sufficiently long to allow the mixing and
measuring of the entire plate of 384-wells.
FRET-based high-throughput assay determines reproducible IC50 values
Fluorogenic substrates with protease-specific cleavage sites were used to investigate the activity of the
PLpro and NS2B-NS3pro and their inhibition by small molecule and peptide inhibitors. To quantitatively
measure the potency of the potential inhibitors, we determined their IC50 values. The optimum
concentration of enzymes and their substrates were used for all the inhibition reactions, i.e. 20 nM
enzyme and 1 μM substrate, and 2.5 μM enzyme and 0.25 μM substrate were used for PLpro and NS2BNS3pro, respectively. The radical excess of NS2B-NS3pro over its substrate was used to compensate for
the low activity of this protease in vitro. At a 1:1 molar ratio between the enzyme and its substrate, the
reaction went to completion in 16 hours. Upon the 10-fold saturation with the enzyme, the reaction time
was effectively reduced to 6 hours.
The potency of TBEV NS2B-NS3pro inhibitors
TBEV protease has not been characterized structurally. However, it is known that the flaviviral NS2BNS3pro is a serine protease that is highly conserved among the Flavivirus genus [22]. Therefore, we have
chosen to test several commercially available inhibitors that are sufficiently soluble and their interaction
with the ZIKV, DENV and WNV proteases was well characterized (DTNB, aprotinin) [17, 18, 28].
Additionally, leupeptin was picked to represent a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor [29].
The measured IC50 values are listed in SI Table 1. Figure 2 shows the dose-response curves and
illustrative SDS-PAGE gels. In the case of leupeptin, there was no inhibition observed as confirmed by
the SDS-PAGE analysis. Aprotinin (also known as bovine pancreatic inhibitor), a competitive serine
protease inhibitor, inhibits the TBEV protease with an IC50 value of 2.4 ± 0.2 μM. DTNB, an allosteric
inhibitor, inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 value of 303 ± 54 μM. The DTNB molecule inhibits
enzymes by forming disulfide bonds with cysteine residues on their surface. Therefore, reducing agents
needed to be omitted from the reaction buffer and the enzyme stock solution (containing β-ME) was
desalted to avoid premature reduction of DTNB. As expected, desalting resulted in increased instability
of the enzyme and a tendency to precipitate. Rapid manipulation at low temperature was thus essential
prior to the measurement.

Potential SARS-CoV-2 PIpro inhibitors, Antabuse inhibits PLpro within the nanomolar range
For the establishment and validity of the high-throughput character of our assay, we have selected 2mercaptopurine (2-MP), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), JB24, Antabuse and aprotinin (SI Figure 3), and
tested them with the PLpro enzyme.
All the reactions were tested in the same aforementioned conditions. As expected, aprotinin displayed
no inhibition of the enzyme in the measured range of concentrations. We synthesized JB24 as previously
described as compound number 24 [30]. This molecule inhibited PLpro significantly with an IC50 of 1.48
± 0.39 μM. These two small molecules were utilized during the optimization of the assay. The results
were reproducible as individual titrations were measured with different batches of defrosted and newly
diluted enzyme and a substrate (Figure 3).
Next, Antabuse, 2-MP and 6-MP were tested in order to measure their inhibition properties on PLpro.
The inhibition of these compounds is sensitive to reducing agents. Therefore, the reducing agent had to
be omitted from the reactions. It is noteworthy that even in the presence of a reducing agent only in the
stock solution of substrate and enzyme, it influenced the IC50 values of these compounds [31].
Therefore, it had to be removed from the reaction by desalting. Antabuse inhibition was 80 ± 38 nM in
the absence of DTT or β-ME. Interestingly, only 2-MP but not 6-MP had an inhibitory effect on PLpro
(IC50 = 0.82 ± 0.6 μM). 2-MP inhibition was also diminished by the presence of DTT in the reaction
buffer.
Discussion
The assay presented in this study offers a rapid, inexpensive and sensitive high-throughput screening of
protease inhibitors. We demonstrate its effectivity and robustness on two viral proteases which differ
both in specificity and activity. Both proteases represent significant therapeutic targets. The protease
from SARS-CoV-2, a papain-like protease (PLpro), is a relatively fast acting enzyme which prevents
cellular antiviral response by its DUB activity. The second protease, formed by the nonstructural
proteins 2B and 3 (NS2B-NS3pro), from the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) processes newly
synthesized TBEV polyprotein during viral infection and displays low catalytic activity in vitro.
To validate the assay quantitatively, we obtained reproducible values of the half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50). Aprotinin (also known as the bovine pancreatic inhibitor) inhibited NS2B-NS3pro
with an IC50 of 2.35 μM at an enzyme concentration of 2.5 μM. Notably, this protease is inhibited
significantly less efficiently than other proteases of Flaviviruses. For instance, the WNF protease
displayed an IC50 of 20 nM when the enzyme concentration was 10 nM [32], and the DENV protease
displayed an IC50 of 65 nM when the enzyme concentration was 1 μM [33].

We have demonstrated the versatility of this assay and that the fluorogenic substrate can be prepared
easily by recombinant expression in E. coli. Moreover, the recombinant character of the substrate
broadens the area for the assessment to practically any protease from any source from viruses to humans.
In the case of our assay, eGFP and mCherry have been used for several reasons. The genes of these
molecules are readily available in most laboratories. The excitation maximum of eGFP is in the vicinity
of one of the most commonly used lasers (argon laser, 488 nm), which is available on most instruments.
Our assays with enzymes from very distinct kinetics have demonstrated the practicality of our choice
of the FRET pair (eGFP and mCherry) in combination within the gel-based assays. Both eGFP and
mCherry are very stable proteins with sufficiently good FRET efficiency for the assay. In the case of
further revalidation in the PAGE gel, the larger spectral differences are advantageous. Importantly, for
enhanced sensitivity of this type of assay, other FRET pairs such as the CyPet-YPet pair could be
considered. This pair offers greater FRET emission gains, especially when instrumental setup allows
for excitation at 414 nm and the collection of emissions at 530 nm [34].
In comparison with radioisotope-based methods, the fluorescence-based methods are safe to use, easy
to operate, and the measurements and possible evaluation are carried out in real-time. In most cases,
our fluorescent assay does not require further manipulation and analysis of the sample, e.g. separation
of reactants from products and measurements. On the other hand, interference from other components
of the assay may be an issue in case of fluorescent assays and has to be taken into consideration. These
components may interfere with the assay by altering the amount of fluorescent signal and decreasing
the sensitivity of the assay. In the proper set-up of our assay, the photobleaching of the components can
be corrected for by running the controls for the assay, e.g. fluorescent substrate without the enzyme. It
is noteworthy that the fluorescent substrate, cofactors or inhibitors may interfere with the assay in such
a way that FRET-based results are not suitable for evaluation. In such a case, assays can be resolved on
a PAGE gel, with the cost of a lower throughput.
Other fluorescent techniques besides FRET-based methods may be considered to be applicable for
measurements of the rate of proteolysis, especially in similar sample setups where the large fluorescent
substrate is proteolytically cleaved to one or several small fluorescent molecules. In this case,
fluorescence anisotropy or polarisation (FA/FP), homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF),
and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) are among these options. There are advantages and
disadvantages to all of these methods, however, there is one key aspect that outweighs these excellent
techniques in favour of FRET-based techniques and that is its suitability for the HTS.
The recent advances in FCS allow measurements in high-throughput mode, but the instrument cost,
complex evaluation and speed in processing of the samples may be a major obstacle in the use of such
a method [35]. On the other hand, when the number of available components is limited and there are
low volumes of the sample, confocal microscopy may be favorable. Although FP and HTRF methods

can be also used in high-throughput screening (HTS), they require more complex instrumentation and
evaluation of the results. In this case, low cost and greater versatility, modality and possibly greater
sensitivity favour the FRET-based method [36].
The other fluorescent-based methods have plenty of advantages, but one of the overwhelming factors
in favour of this assay is its low cost and versatility of preparation. This assay can be easily performed
in a typical laboratory and only requires a fluorescent plate reader. The fluorescent parameters of the
substrate may be tailored to suit the available instruments of a particular researcher and to the given
application, e.g. mutagenic study of the variability of the substrate or testing the enzyme kinetics. Since
the substrate is recombinant, it avoids costly synthesis of specific substrates with synthetic fluorescent
probes that might be essential for the aforementioned methods.
Fluorescence assays typically offer the best balance between cost and sensitivity in high-throughput
screening (HTS) experiments.
Rapid response to threats posed by viral pathogens is and will clearly continue to be one of the most
important challenges for our globalized society. This response is associated with our ability to quickly
design and prepare new antivirals that will be able to affect these pathogens at their weakest points.
Experience with the discovery of drugs against both HIV and HCV illustrates that viral proteases are
important drug targets. Here, we have shown that it is possible to quickly and efficiently develop an
assay against various viral proteases and convert it to the HTS format. Therefore, the assay developed
here is a very useful tool for early drug discovery and can be quickly designed and used for both drug
repurposing and the identification of completely new protease inhibitors in fight against various viral
pathogens.
