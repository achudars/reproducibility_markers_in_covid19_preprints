Abstract
The novel coronavirus pneumonia, which was named later as Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, namely
SARS-CoV-2. It is a positive-strand RNA virus that is the seventh coronavirus known to infect
humans. The COVID-19 outbreak presents enormous challenges for global health behind the
pandemic outbreak. The first diagnosed patient in Turkey has been reported by the Republic of
Turkey Ministry of Health on March 11, 2020. Today, over ninety thousand cases in Turkey, and
two million cases around the world have been declared. Due to the urgent need for vaccine and
anti-viral drug, isolation of the virus is crucial. Here, we report one of the first isolation and
characterization studies of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens of
diagnosed patients in Turkey. This study provides an isolation and replication methodology, and
cell culture tropism of the virus that will be available to the research communities.

Introduction
New coronaviruses are likely to occur periodically in humans, considering the high prevalence
and wide distribution of coronaviruses, the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of
genomes, common interspecific infections, and rare outbreaks.1,2 The novel coronavirus
pneumonia, which was named later as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is caused by the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, namely SARS-CoV-23. It is a positivestrand RNA virus (family: Coronaviridae), showing high homology with SARS-CoV and bat
coronavirus4,5. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans; SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease, whereas HKU1, NL63, OC43, and
229E are associated with mild symptoms6. The novel SARS-CoV-2 is the virus behind the
pandemic outbreak originating from China7 and this recent coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19)
presents enormous challenges for global health. The first diagnosed patient in Turkey was
announced by the Ministry of Health on March 11, 2020. Since then, more than ninety thousand
diagnosed patients have been reported, showing the urgent need for vaccine studies and anti-viral
drug discoveries. Thus, it is important to isolate and propagate SARS-CoV-2 strains from Turkish
COVID-19 patients. We isolated the virus from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens.
We characterized replication properties and cell culture tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in different cell
lines including green monkey kidney cell line (Vero) and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cell line
(MDBK). This study provides isolation and characterization methodology, which enable research
communities to propagate the isolated virus in high-titer for vaccine development and anti-viral
drug screening.

Methods
1. Collection and transportation of specimen
Samples were collected from the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal cavity of COVID-19
positive diagnosed patients according to their Real-Time PCR analysis in Acibadem Altunizade
Hospital, Istanbul. Swabs were put into the transportation medium and transfered at 4oC to
Acıbadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory BSL-3 Units on the same day for analysis and
propagation. Transfer medium contains DMEM High glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA),
2% Penicillin-Streptomycin solution (Biological Industries, Israel), and 5 µg/mL Amphotericin
(Bristol Myers Squibb, USA).
2. Virus propagation
The propagation process was started with the 96-well plate with a Vero cell line (CCl-81, ATCC)
because of the low virus titer. Firstly, Vero cells were trypsinized, centrifuged and suspended in
virus media that is composed of DMEM high glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), with 2%
fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and 1% Penicillin-StreptomycinAmphotericin (PSA) solution (Pan Biotech, Germany). Cells were seeded 2.5x104 into each well.
Then, 100 µl of virus sample was added to the 1st line, and 50 µl of the virus media added to
other wells of plate. Serial dilution was done starting from the 1st line to 12th with 50 µl of virus
solution and incubated at 37oC. Each day cytopathic effect was recorded under inverted
microscope (Leica Microsystems) and after its detection; cells were scraped from the well and
transferred to the 24-well plate with the Vero cell line in 25x104 concentrations per well. The
cytopathic effect was observed and cells transferred to the T75 tissue culture flask. Before adding

the virus inoculation, Vero cells were seeded in T75 tissue culture flask in 5x106 concentration
and virus inoculum were transferred to monolayer cells. At this point, the average number of days
for cytopathic effect can be known as 3-4 days. For higher propagation, virus inoculum was
transferred to the T300 tissue culture flask.
3. Isolation of Viruses
Infected cells were observed each day and the following analysis was performed to confirm
SARS-CoV-2.
Real-Time PCR: Total RNA isolations were carried using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kits (Zymo
Research, USA), and concentrations were determined using Qubit fluorometer with the Qubit
RNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). cDNA synthesis was performed using random
oligonucleotides. Two LAMP assay reactions were set-up in CFX-96 (Bio-Rad, USA) for each
sample with SARS-CoV-2 LAMP primer mix and internal control LAMP primer mix. EvaGreen
fluorescent dye (Biotium, USA) was added to each reaction mixture for real-time LAMP
detection. Melt curve analysis and %2 agarose gel electrophoresis were used for the evaluation of
the results. Here, the virus N gene was used as a target gene in SARS-CoV-2 and actin as an
internal control.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): Infected Vero cells were scraped from the flask and
centrifuged at 300xg for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was rinsed with 0.1M phosphate buffer saline
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) centrifuged at 300xg for 10 minutes. Pellet was fixed 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) for at least 2 hours at room
temperature. The fixed block was washed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer three times for 15 minutes.
Post fixation was done in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer 1-2 hours at room

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.056309; this version posted April 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

temperature. In this step, 2% aqueous OsO4 and 0.2M phosphate buffer were mixed in equal
volume and used immediately. En Bloc Staining was done to enhance contrast. Bloc was washed
at least 3-5 times of 10 minutes each in distilled water to remove all excess phosphate ions,
therefore, preventing uranyl acetate (UA) from being precipitated. En bloc was stained with 2%
aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 hour at room temperature or 2 hours at 4 ºC in dark to prevent uranyl
acetate from being precipitated as UA is photo reductive. It was washed 2-3 times of 5 minutes in
distilled water. In the dehydration process, bloc was put in 50% ethanol for 10-15 min. Then, it
was put in 70% ethanol for 10-15 min. If it is necessary, the bloc may be stored overnight at this
stage. The alcohol ratio was increased to 95% and put in it for 10-15 min then transferred into
100% ethanol 3 times for 15 min. Bloc was put 100% Propylene oxide 3 times for 15 min. The
sample was transferred in 1:1 EMBed 812 and Propylene Oxide overnight at room temperature in
tightly capped vials to prevent moisture from coming into the specimen. EMBed 812 (100%) was
straight for 1-2 hours at room temperature. The caps were removed from vials to allow any
remaining propylene oxide to evaporate. The sample was labeled and embedded in beam capsules
or embedding molds. It was polymerized in 60-70 ºC (~65 ºC) oven for 24-48 hours. The sample
was viewed in different scales.
Plaque Assay: Plaque test was performed based on general procedure with small modifications as
following. Vero cells were seeded for 6-well plate (1x105cells/well) and leaved for 24 h
incubation at 37oC. After cell incubation period, virus titration was prepared in Log10 serial
dilutions. Cells were washed with cell media (DMEM High, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) that
contain only 1% PSA (Pan Biotech Germany). Virus titrations were inoculated to cells in 1 ml
volume, leaved for the 1-hour incubation, and plates were shaken gently in 20 minutes. In this
period also plaque medium that contains 2% agarose and media (2% FBS and 1% PSA) in 1:1

volume ratio were prepared and put into the 56oC water bath for 30 minutes. After virus
inoculation, excess viruses were removed and 1 ml plaque medium added on infected cells. The
plaque medium should warm avoid the damage of the cell monolayer. Plates were left under the
hood for 15 minutes without a cap and then put into 37 oC incubator for 7-10 days. For the
counting of the plaque firstly cells were fixated with 10% of paraformaldehyde for 1 hour.
Agarose layers were removed from the well and then 500 µl of crystal violet solution was added
to each well and incubated on a shaker for 5-10 minutes. Crystal violet was discarded and plates
were washed with tap water without disrupting cell monolayer until the water was clear. Plates
were left on a paper towel till dry. Plaques were imaged under an inverted microscope.
4. Immunological Response
Inactivation of Virus: Infected Vero cells were scraped from the flask and centrifuged at 1000
rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was rinsed with 0.1M phosphate buffer saline (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA) centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Pellet was fixed 2.5% glutaraldehyde (GA)
in 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) for at least 2 hours at room temperature. Virus
solution (15 ml) was added to Amicon Ultra 50,000 KDa NMWL and centrifuge at 4,000xg for
15 minutes to wash from excess GA. For washing sample was diluted with 1ml of PBS and
centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4,000xg. The sample was diluted with 1ml of PBS and centrifuge for
3 minutes at 4,000xg. The concentrator was transferred to a clean tube and centrifuge at 1,000xg
for 2 minutes to collect the concentrated sample. The sample was diluted in serum physiologic.

PBMC Culturing: Three healthy adult bloods were obtained from Acibadem Labcell Cellular
Therapy Laboratory. Following the isolation of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) by

overlaying blood on Ficoll-paque plus (GE Healthcare), the serially diluted GA-inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 samples were incubated with the PBMCs for 48hr in T cell medium (6% Human
AB Serum and 1% Pen/Strep, Texmacs medium). Immunocult human CD3/CD28 T cell activator
(STEMCELL Technologies, USA) was used to stimulate the PBMCs as a positive control for
immunological activation.
Flow cytometry: Immune cell subtypes and their activation levels were determined by Miltenyi
MACSQuant flow cytometry analysis using αCD3-PE, αCD19-PE.cy7, αCD56-FITC, αCD4Viogreen, αCD8-Vioblue, αCD25-APC and αCD107a-PE.cy5.5 (Miltenyi).
Interferon-gamma ELISA: Three human PBMC’s were added to different inactivated SARSCoV-2 virus diluted to five different dilutions. After 48 hours, supernatants were collected and
cytokine levels assed with Human IFNγ ELISA Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Vienna, Austria)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatants (50 µl) were added into 450 µl
sample diluents (TexMACs) and 50µl test samples, positive control (immunocult-activated) and
negative control were added into wells. ELISA plate was measured at 450 nm, and 550 nm using
a Microplate reader (Bmg Labtech, Germany).

Results:
Propagation and Genetic Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 collected from COVID-19 patient
The SARS-CoV-2 including swab specimens collected from COVID-19 diagnosed patients were
quickly transferred in the same day to the laboratory and incubated with Vero cell in 96-well
plate as mentioned in the method. Because of low titer viruses, initial small size culture led easy
recovery. Upon observation of the first cytopathic effect, supernatant and the cells were
transferred to a 24-well plate with suspension form of Vero cell. Through one week, propagation
of the virus was followed and increasing cytopathic effects were recorded (Fig. 1A). As Bovine
Coronavirus (B-CoV) is incubated with a bovine kidney cell line (MDBK)8, we wanted to test
propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 with this cell line. It showed cytopathic effect faster than Vero
cell line (Fig. 1B). Next, we wanted to identify the propagated virus as SARS-CoV-2 using RTPCR along with SARS-CoV-2 N gene specific primers. Results shown in Fig. 1C and 1D proved
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the propagated samples.

Transmission Electron Microscopy imaging and Plaque assay of SARS-CoV-2.
Afterwards, a detailed scanning was performed with TEM analysis to show existence of the

and propagated virus. Although the literature10 suggests that plaque formation were determined in
72hr, the plaques were observed in our experiments after 6 days in both cell lines (Fig. 3). The

Immunological Response of Inactivated Virus:
PBMC from healthy donors are a useful tool for assessment of host response upon pathogen
infection. The cells can be stimulated by encountering SARS-CoV and recruit immune cell
subtypes such as natural killer T (NKT), T, and B cells to the site of inflammation to give early
adaptive immune response11. Therefore, we performed immunological assays to show impact of
GA-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 on frequencies and activation capacities of the cell subtypes. We
incubated healthy adult PBMCs with the inactivated virus in a dose-dependent manner for 48hr
and assessed their proportions and expression level of activation markers (CD25 and CD107a)
using flow cytometry as shown in Fig. 4A. We determined an increase in frequency of CD3+ T
cells, especially CD3+ CD4+ T helper cell, except CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells at the highest
concentration of the virus (Fig. 4B-C). On the other hand, CD19+ B cell proportion has
decreased upon increasing of the virus concentration, suggesting activation of the immune cells
(Fig. 4B-C). Afterwards, we assessed activation of the T cells and NKT cells, and we determined
a significant upregulation of CD25 on CD3+ CD56+ NK T cells and an increase of CD25 level in
CD3+ CD4+ T helper cell but not in CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Fig. 4B-C). However, we
could not detect expression of a degranulation marker (CD107a) on the cells (data not shown).
These results led us to determine another immunological stimulus marker (IFNγ secretion) using
collected supernatant of the samples after 48hr. We determined a significant increase in IFNγ
secretion (Fig. 5) using ELISA, which confirm occurrence of the immune response with
chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion:
Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that are widely distributed among humans, other
mammals, birds, which cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases12,13. After the
first outbreaks of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, China, a new coronavirus was detected as a
disease-causing agent in late 2019 and January 202014. In April, 2020, above two million cases
have been reported from 26 countries, including China15. The emergence of coronaviruses at
regular intervals poses an important threat to human health and economy of countries. Ironically,
even after a decade of research on the coronavirus, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic
agents to treat coronavirus infection. This emphasizes the urgent need to develop effective
vaccines to prevent future outbreaks16 and therefore isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses
become important issues.
In the process of specimen collection from patient and transfer to the laboratory, the process
should be started and virus cultured immediately because lots of virus became inactivated.
Therefore, we tested several transfer solutions to safe infectious SARS-CoV-2 during the
transportation and we decided FBS-free media is the best for protecting the infectivity of the
virus. Also, before culturing the cells with the specimens, we wash the cells with FBS free media
to remove excess of fetal bovine serum. Then, to propagate virus, cells were resuspended with a
virus media including 2% FBS, which enabled much easier propagation of the virus than the
media including 10% FBS. Afterwards, we tested Vero and MDBK cell lines to observe
cytopathic effects and it was determined that the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in MDBK
cells faster than in Vero cells. Also, the cytopathic effect in Vero cell line was observed as clump
form while in MDBK cell line as a single cell bases. Plaque assay is a reliable way to show an
infectious form of viruses. Therefore, in this study, we performed plaque assay to see infectivity

of SARS-CoV-2. During the plaque assay processes, we observed that monolayer form of Vero
cells behave more sensitive than that of MDBK cells, which makes difficulties in setup of the
assay. Therefore, MDBK cell line is suggested for efficient plaque assay for virus titration and
antiviral drug screening. Furthermore, studies reported that plaque formation time for SARSCoV-2 was 72h, however; in our study, plaque formation was observed in 6th day of the infection,
probably because of the virus low titer. Thus, we suggest waiting for 10 days post infection to
determine titer of the virus by counting plaques.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are used to test immune response stimulated by pathogens.
To determine immune cell activation through the proteins of inactivated SARS-CoV-2, we
incubated PBMCs with chemically-inactivated virus. The study shows us that T cells and NKT
cells can be stimulated with the virus and can be assessed significantly in in vitro setup. We also
observed a decrease in B cell population in higher concentrations of the inoculums; probably
activated and proliferated T cells interfere with B cell proliferation17. To further confirm the
activation, we determined IFNγ secretion from the stimulated cells in PBMCs. These preliminary
results suggest that early immune response tests can be performed in vitro in the process of
vaccine and anti-viral drug developments.
To conclude, this study can be referenced for researchers who aimed to isolate and propagate
SARS-CoV-2 to work in molecular biology studies including genomics, proteomics, and gene
editing like CRISPR, antisense peptide and small interference RNA (siRNA) therapies.
