Abstract

28

Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 the etiological agent of COVID-19 disease, have

29

caused multiple epidemic and pandemic outbreaks in the past 20 years1-3. With no vaccines,

30

and only recently developed antiviral therapeutics, we are ill equipped to handle coronavirus

31

outbreaks4. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate coronavirus

32

replication and pathogenesis is needed to guide the development of new antiviral therapeutics

33

and vaccines. RNA secondary structures play critical roles in multiple aspects of coronavirus

34

replication, but the extent and conservation of RNA secondary structure across coronavirus

35

genomes is unknown5. Here, we define highly structured RNA regions throughout the MERS-

36

CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We find that highly stable RNA structures are

37

pervasive throughout coronavirus genomes, and are conserved between the SARS-like CoV.

38

Our data suggests that selective pressure helps preserve RNA secondary structure in

39

coronavirus genomes, suggesting that these structures may play important roles in virus

40

replication and pathogenesis. Thus, disruption of conserved RNA secondary structures could be

41

a novel strategy for the generation of attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use against the

42

current COVID-19 pandemic.

45

Main
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory

46

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of the current

47

COVID-19 pandemic, have caused widespread disease, death, and economic hardship in the

48

past 20 years1, highlighting the pandemic potential of the CoV genus. While recently developed

49

antivirals show promise against MERS and SARS-CoV-2, further understanding of coronavirus

50

molecular virology is necessary to inform the design of more effective antiviral therapeutics and

51

vaccines6, 7.

52

RNA structures in the ~30kb of single-stranded RNA8 genomes of Coronavirus play

53

important roles in coronavirus replication9, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13. Given the length of coronavirus RNA

54

genomes, additional RNA structures likely exist that regulate CoV replication and disease14. In

55

this study, we used selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation by primer extension and mutational profiling

56

(SHAPE-MaP)15 to identify highly stable, structured regions of the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and

57

SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our results revealed novel areas of RNA structure across the genomes

58

of all three viruses. SHAPE-MaP analysis confirmed previously described structures, and also

59

revealed that SARS-like coronaviruses contain a greater number of highly structured RNA

60

regions than MERS-CoV. Comparing nucleotide variation across multiple strains of each virus,

61

we find that highly variable nucleotides rarely impact RNA secondary structure, suggesting the

62

existence of selective pressure against RNA secondary structure disruption. We also identified

63

dozens of conserved highly stable structured regions in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that share

64

similar structures, highlighting the possible importance of these stable RNA structures in virus

65

replication.

68

Stable RNA secondary structure is pervasive throughout coronavirus genomes
To identify regions of significant RNA secondary structure in the genomes of MERS-

69

CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 we performed selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by

70

primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) analysis of virion-associated RNA15, 16

71

(Fig 1A-C; Supplemental Table 1). Highly stable structured regions likely to maintain a single

72

confirmation were identified using high confidence cutoffs for SHAPE reactivity (<0.3, blue bars)

73

and of Shannon entropy (<0.04, black bars). We identified 85 highly stable regions in the

74

MERS-CoV genome (Fig 1A), 123 stable regions in the SARS-CoV genome (Fig 1B), and 139

75

stable regions within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig 1C). Stable structured regions were present

76

throughout the coding and non-coding regions of each genome. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

77

exhibited greater RNA structuredness across their genomes compared to MERS-CoV. This was

78

not due to differences in overall GC content or bias in average SHAPE reactivity (Supplemental

79

Fig 1A). Thus, SARS-like coronavirus genomes contain greater overall stable RNA

80

structuredness than the MERS-CoV genome.

81

We used the SHAPE reactivity to create a structural model for stable RNA elements in

82

each genome (Fig 1A-C; Supplemental Figure 5, Supplemental Table 2). The top twenty

83

most stable structures for each virus were present in the coding region, and largely consisted of

84

hairpin and bulged stem loop structures. The most highly stable RNA structures were present in

85

the regions encoding open reading frame (ORF) ORF1a, ORF1b and Spike. The majority of the

86

most highly stable structures for all coronaviruses were present within ORF1a, while the number

87

of highly stable structures in ORF1b ranged from three in SARS-CoV to eight in MERS-CoV

88

(Supplemental Fig 1B). All coronaviruses had multiple highly stable structures in the Spike

89

ORF. These data highlight the pervasive presence of highly stable RNA structure throughout

90

coronavirus genomes.

elements

94

The RNA structural elements within the 5’ and 3’ UTRs of the related murine hepatitis

95

coronavirus (MHV) genome have been extensively characterized 5, 17,18. Our SHAPE-MaP

96

analysis recapitulated previously described 5’ and 3’ UTR RNA secondary structures. Within the

97

5’ UTR of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we identified the conserved stem loop

98

(SL) SL1, SL2, SL4 and SL5ABC RNA elements (Fig 2A). Consistent with previous modeling5,

99

both SARS-like coronaviruses contained SL3 upstream of SL4, while this hairpin was absent

100

from MERS-CoV. A similar pattern was observed for structures within the 3’UTR (Fig 2B). Each

101

virus exhibited a bulged stem loop (BSL) structure, followed by a pseudoknot (PK) and each

102

genome ends in a long hypervariable (HVR) bulged stem loop structure, confirming the

103

conservation of these RNA secondary structures across coronaviruses.

104

Coronaviruses utilize a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift to produce the ORF1a/1b

105

fusion protein. A stable RNA pseudoknot upstream of the frameshift position is necessary for

106

the frameshift to occur12, 13, and our data supports the presence this pseudoknot in the same

107

position in all three coronaviruses (Fig 2C). Interestingly, the MERS-CoV two-stemmed

108

pseudoknot is distinct from the single-stemmed pseudoknot present in both SARS-like

109

coronaviruses. Together, these results demonstrate the capability of SHAPE-MaP analysis to

110

accurately identify RNA structures in coronavirus genomic RNA.

111

Transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs) are conserved, short sequences (6-8

112

nucleotides) within coronavirus genomes that act as cis-regulatory elements of transcription18, 19,

113

20

114

transcription, most TRS elements were not associated with areas of high RNA structuredness

115

(Supplemental Fig 2A-D). In fact, only a single TRS from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were

116

associated with highly structured RNA regions, while four TRSs from SARS-CoV-2 were

117

associated. Thus, TRS elements are not consistently associated with highly stable RNA

118

structures, suggesting that RNA secondary structure may not play a role in TRS recognition.

. While RNA secondary structure has been suggested plays a role in TRS regulation of

Covariance and MUSCLE alignment analysis reveal selective pressure for coronavirus

RNA secondary structure

122

To determine if RNA structuredness is a driver of mutational variance across virus

123

strains, we performed multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation (MUSCLE) alignment

124

analysis of 350 MERS-CoV, 141 SARS-CoV, and 1,542 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Supplemental

125

Table 3). As a whole, highly structured regions within SARS-CoV exhibited significantly less

126

nucleotide variance than areas of lower structuredness, suggesting these regions may be under

127

higher selective pressure. There was no significant difference in nucleotide variance within

128

MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 genomes, however 72.9% of highly structured regions in MERS-

129

CoV and 87.8% of highly structured regions in SARS-CoV-2 had lower variance than regions of

130

lower structuredness. Eighteen nucleotides in MERS-CoV, 3 nucleotides in SARS-CoV, and 8

131

nucleotides in SARS-CoV-2 showed significant variance across all strains and were located in

132

structured regions (Supplemental Table 4). Of these variants, 72% in MERS-CoV, 100% in

133

SARS-CoV, and 75% in SARS-CoV-2 occur in unpaired nucleotides in the stable RNA

134

secondary structure, suggesting that the majority of polymorphisms in highly structured regions

135

across coronavirus strains maintain RNA secondary structures.

136

We performed covariation analysis to further assess conservation of structuredness.

137

This analysis determines if two nucleotide changes occurred in tandem to conserve RNA

138

secondary structure. 21 structured regions in MERS-CoV strains, 1 structured region in SARS-

139

CoV strains, and 4 structured regions in SARS-CoV-2 strains contained significant covarying

140

nucleotide changes that conserved RNA secondary structure (Supplemental Table 5).

141

Together, these results suggest that regions of RNA structuredness and specific RNA

142

secondary structures are conserved within each virus family, and these structured regions may

143

be under selective pressure

144
145
146

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV structured regions are highly conserved
We next sought to identify conserved, highly stable RNA structures across all three

147

viruses. Surprisingly, outside of the previously described conserved 5’ and 3’ UTRs, we

148

identified only a single conserved structure across all three genomes, present within the RNA

149

region encoding nsp16 (Supplemental Fig 3). However, we found 98 areas of overlapping

150

highly structured regions when comparing only the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Fig

151

3A & Table 7). Within conserved regions of structuredness in the coding region of the SARS-

152

CoV-2 genome we identified 65 regions that contained similar RNA secondary structures (Fig

153

3B). The majority of these structures (26 total) were within ORF1b, in contrast to the distribution

154

of the most stable structures within a respective genome (Supplemental Fig 4).

155

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a 79% sequence homology, thus, conserved RNA

156

structures may be driven by sequence homology rather than conservation of RNA secondary

157

structure (Supplemental Table 6). To determine which RNA structures were likely conserved

158

based on RNA secondary structure rather than sequence homology we calculated the average

159

percent nucleotide conservation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 for each conserved

160

structure and compared this to the average nucleotide conservation of the two genomes (Fig

161

3C). Similar secondary structures that exhibit greater than average nucleotide homology are

162

likely driven by sequence homology, while similar structures that show lower than average

163

nucleotide homology are likely conserved based on preservation of RNA secondary structure.

164

We found 18 total structures (27.7%) with lower than average nucleotide homology, with

165

structure 6 showing the lowest sequence homology (59.4%). These data suggest that nearly

166

one third of conserved similar RNA secondary structures between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

167

are conserved based on RNA secondary structure.

168

Lastly, we assessed nucleotide covariation within conserved SARS-like CoV RNA

169

secondary structures. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV

170

strains and covarying nucleotides that support SARS-CoV-2 structures were identified

171

(Supplemental Table 5). In line with a lack of structure conservation, no MERS-CoV strains

172

showed covarying nucleotides that supported SARS-CoV-2 structures. In contrast, we identified

173

10 significant covariation events within SARS-CoV genomes that supported SARS-CoV-2

174

structures, two of which occurred within the viral UTRs. Five covariation events were observed

175

in non-conserved regions of structuredness, while three covariation events occurred within

176

conserved regions of structuredness. These results show that conservation of specific RNA

177

structures may extend outside of conserved regions of structuredness, and overall highlight the

178

high degree of structural conservation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

181

Using SHAPE-MaP analysis we found that members of the Coronaviradae, MERS-CoV,

182

SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, contain highly stable, structured RNA regions throughout their

183

genomes. SARS-like coronavirus genomes were more highly structured than the MERS-CoV

184

genome, suggesting that even within the betacoronavirus family, RNA structuredness may be

185

unique to viral species. Importantly, SHAPE-MaP analysis recapitulated previously described

186

RNA structures5, providing confidence that SHAPE-MaP identifies bona fide RNA secondary

187

structures. Outside of structurally conserved noncoding regions of the genome, only a single

188

RNA structure was conserved across all three viruses. However, 65 conserved highly stable

189

structured regions were found that contained similar RNA structures when comparing SARS-

190

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig 3). While some structures were conserved based

191

on sequence homology alone, the conservation in nearly a third of these structures appears to

192

be driven by structural conservation. Alignment and covariance analysis of >1000 SARS-CoV

193

and SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed greater levels of sequence conservation in SARS-like CoV

194

structured RNA regions, and maintenance of RNA secondary structures in highly stable

195

structures. This suggests these regions are under greater selective pressure than their non-

196

structured counterparts, and their likely importance in SARS-like coronavirus replication.

197

In contrast, we found distinct structural differences between MERS-CoV and the SARS-

198

like CoV, even within the known functional RNA structures (e.g. 5’ and 3’UTR, ribosomal

199

frameshift element; Fig 2A, 2C). Such subtle, but distinct, changes in RNA structure could drive

200

phenotypic differences in replication of distinct virus species, even when those structures are

201

within conserved regions of RNA structure.

202

We also found significant conservation of both structuredness and RNA secondary

203

structures within the SARS-like CoV (Fig 3A,B). While much of this conservation was due to

204

sequence homology between the two viruses, we found that almost a third of conserved

205

structures show lower than average sequence homology as compared to the rest of the

206

genome, suggesting a functional role for RNA secondary structure (Fig 3C). Further, in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.153197; this version posted June 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

207

structures that did show high sequence homology, we found evidence of covariance

208

conservation of RNA structures, suggesting sequence variation constraints within the context of

209

an RNA structure. In conjunction with the fact that structured regions in SARS-CoV showed

210

lower sequence variance than non-structured regions, we hypothesize that RNA structuredness

211

and specific RNA secondary structures exert a selective pressure on sequence diversity. This

212

would suggest that these structures play important roles in SARS-like CoV replication, and

213

possibly pathogenesis. This suggests that disrupting these such conserved structures could be

214

a promising strategy for the development of live-attenuated vaccines. Understanding the

215

mechanism by which these novel RNA structures regulate SARS-CoV-2 replication could lead

216

to new antiviral therapeutic targets and inform rational vaccine design.

Methods

320

Virus growth and purification. MERS-CoV Jordan-N3/2012 isolate MG167 (accession

321

#KJ614529), was gown in Vero-81 cells. Vero-81 cells were cultured to ~80% confluence in

322

T175 flasks. Immediately prior to infection, the culture medium was aspirated and replaced with

323

Opti-MEM with 4% Hyclone FetalClone II (Cytiva). Cells were infected at a multiplicity of

324

infection (MOI) of 5 with MERS-CoV and were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After 1 hour, cells were

325

aspirated, washed 1X with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and supplemented with fresh, pre-

326

warmed Opti-MEM with 4% FetalClone II. Cells were then incubated at 37°C for an additional 19

327

hours.

328
329

SARS-CoV Urbani isolate (accession #MK062179) and SARS-CoV-2 USA-W1/2020
isolate (accession #MN985325) were gown in Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells were culture to ~90%

confluence in T175 flasks. Immediately prior to infection the culture medium was aspirated and

331

cells were washed with PBS. Flasks were infected at an MOI of 5 with SARS-CoV and MOI of 3

332

for SARS-CoV-2 at 37°C for 1 hour. After 1 hour cells were supplemented with pre-warmed

333

DMEM with 5% FetalClone II. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 hours at 37°C.

334

To isolate virion RNA, cell supernatant was aspirated and concentrated using Amicon Ultra

335

Centrifugal Filters (Millipore Sigma) to approximately 4 mL total volume. The supernatant was

336

then lysed in TRIzol LS (Invitrogen), and viral RNA pellets were harvested according to the

337

manufacturer’s suggested protocol. RNA was extracted from the TRIzol using chloroform

338

followed by overnight precipitation at -20°C.

339
340

SHAPE modification and library generation. Modified RNA was folded at 37°C in the

341

presence of 10 mM MgCl2 and 111 mM KCl for 15 minutes, flowed by a 5-minute treatment of

342

100 nM 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoicanhydride (1M7) also at 37°C. Unmodified RNA was folded under

343

the same conditions as the modified RNA and treated with DMSO for 5 minutes at 37°C. The

344

denatured control RNA was incubated at 90°C for 2 minutes followed by a 2-minute treatment of

345

100 nM 1M7 at 95°C. Following all treatments, RNAs were purified using the RNA Clean &

346

Concentrator -5 Kit (Zymo Research). Purified RNAs were random primed using Random

347

Primer 9 (NEB) by incubation at 65°C for 5 minutes followed by rapid cooling on ice. They were

348

then mixed with a master mix that consisted of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.1 M DTT, 500 mM Tris pH 8.0,

349

750 mM KCl, 500 mM MnCl2, and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher

350

Scientific). They were incubated at 25°C for 15 minutes, 42°C for 180 minutes, followed by a

351

heat inactivation at 70°C for 15 minutes. After reverse transcription they were then cleaned

352

using Illustra MicroSpin G-50 columns (GE Healthcare), double stranded DNA (dsDNA) was

353

generated by use of NEBNext Ultra II Non-Directional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module

354

(NEB), purified using PureLink PCR Micro Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and dsDNA was

355

quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

356

Libraries were prepared using Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina),

357

cleaned using a 1:0.6 ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter), and quantified again

358

using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit following manufacturer’s recommended protocol in each case.

362

Structural prediction. Sequenced reads from the unmodified RNAs were aligned to the

363

reference sequences downloaded from NCBI to correct viral sequences for potential mutations.

364

SHAPE reactivities were derived using the ShapeMapper Pipeline v1.2. Structural predictions

365

and Shannon entropy were obtained using Superfold v1.0 with a maximum pairing distance of

366

500 base pairs to calculate minimum free-energy models using SHAPE reactivities as folding

367

constraints. Highly stable structured regions were predicted based on 55 base pair rolling

368

averages of SHAPE reactivity (<0.3) and Shannon entropy (<0.04). Highly stable structured

369

regions were expanded to encompass full base pairing regions as needed3. Specific structure’s

370

minimum free energy models were generated using RNAstructure’s Fold v6.0.1 using standard

371

settings and incorporating SHAPE reactivities as folding constraints4.

372
373

Covariation and alignments. Homologous structures were found and base pairs with

374

significant covariation were identified as in Kutchko et al1. Briefly, homologous structures were

375

identified using the Infernal software suite v1.1.25. A model was built for each structure using

376

cmbuild and cmcalibrate. All available MERS-CoV (350 genomes), SARS-CoV (140 genomes),

377

and SARS-CoV-2 (1,524 genomes) sequences available on ViPR on 5-12-2020 were searched

378

for similar structures using cmsearch with -A option to automatically generate an alignment.

379

Base pairs with significant covariance were identified using R-scape program v1.2.36.

MUSCLE alignments were performed on the CLC Genomics Workbench v12.0.3

381

(Qiagen) module Additional Alignments v1.9 for mutational frequency identification using the

382

above mentioned ViPR sequences. Genomes containing gaps (>5 nucleotides) or multiple

383

unidentified nucleotides were excluded from alignments. ClustalOmega alignments were

384

performed using EMBL-EBI for individual viral genome comparisons7.

385
386

Sequence conservation and structuredness. A sequence conservation score, ranging from 0

387

to 1, was calculated at each aligned genomic position after insertions and deletions were

388

removed from the alignment. Whole genome conservation was calculated based on an average

389

of each position’s conservation score across the entire genome and also the average of 67 base

390

pair rolling windows across the entire genome. Structuredness was calculated at each

391

nucleotide position by adding the SHAPE reactivity value to Shannon entropy value, both

392

normalized to their mean value over the entire genome. This was used to create a ranking of

393

each highly stable structured regions. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA: Single

394

factor.
