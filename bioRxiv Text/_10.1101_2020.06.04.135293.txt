Abstract
The novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. The increasing sequencing data have shown
abundant single nucleotide variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, it is
difficult to quickly analyze genomic variation and screen key mutations of
SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we developed a visual program, named BioAider, for
quick and convenient sequence annotation and mutation analysis on multiple
genome-sequencing data. Using BioAider, we conducted a comprehensive genome
variation analysis on 3,240 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Herein, we detected
14 substitution hotspots within SARS-CoV-2 genome, including 10 non-synonymous
and 4 synonymous ones. Among these hotspots, NSP13-Y541C was predicted to be a
crucial substitution which might affect the unwinding activity of NSP13, a key protein
for viral replication. Besides, we also found 3 groups of potentially linked substitution
hotspots which were worth further study. In particular, we discovered a SR-rich region
(aa 184-204) on the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 distinct from SARS-CoV, indicating
more complex replication mechanism and unique N-M interaction of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, the quantity of SRXX repeat fragments in the SR-rich region well
reflected the evolutionary relationship among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related
animal coronaviruses, providing further evidence of its animal origin. Overall, we
developed an efficient tool for rapid identification of mutations, identified substitution
hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and detected a distinctive polymorphism SR-rich
region in N protein. This tool and the detected hotspots could facilitate the viral
genomic study and may contribute for screening antiviral target sites.

Introduction
The severe pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a
2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which was first detected and characterized in
Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 [1, 2]. Later, the name of this virus was suggested as
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [3]. SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen and
showing high infectiousness, fast spread, partial asymptomatic infection, and other
new features [4, 5]. At present, the virus has been detected in the most countries and
regions around the world, threatening public health, normal social life, and economy.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people with more than 250,000 deaths
worldwide
as
of
May
8th,
2020
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/).
Most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 mainly present lower respiratory tract
infections, accompanied by fever, dry cough, dyspnea [6]. So far, there is no specific
drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is
still on the way. The world will be still facing COVID-19 for a long time.
Coronaviruses are enveloped virus with a non-segmented positive sense RNA
genome, the full-length genome is the largest among RNA viruses [7]. The first ORF
encodes a polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab, ORF1ab) and approximately occupied the first
two-thirds of the genome, the remainder are structural and non-structural proteins [8].
The pp1ab usually is hydrolyzed into 16 non-structural proteins (NSP1-16) by one or
two papain-like protease (PLPs) in NSP3 and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) in NSP5, to
promote viral RNA replication and transcription [9, 10]. For these non-structural
proteins in pp1ab, NSP2 can inhibit two host proteins of PHB1 and PHB2, which play
an important role in viral infection [11]. The PLPs of NSP3 hydrolyze the N-terminal
of pp1ab to NSP1 ~ NSP4, 3CLpro of NSP5 binds 11 conserved Q-S dipeptide sites in
pp1ab to produce 12 mature non-structural proteins (NSP5 ~ NSP16) [9, 12]. NSP12
is a key component, also known as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and
is crucial in the replication and transcription cycle of coronaviruses [13]. Currently,
RdRp is considered to be the main target of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2[14].
NSP13 owns NTPase/Helicase activity and can unwind double-stranded RNA and
DNA helix [15]. Due to the conservation of NSP13 sequence and necessity in all
coronaviruses species, it is considered an ideal target for the development of antiviral
drugs for SARS-CoV [16, 17]. The main four structural proteins of coronaviruses are
the spike protein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and
nucleocapsid protein (N) [18] . S protein interacts with molecular receptors to mediate
cell membrane fusion, allowing viruses to enter host cells [19]. E and M proteins are
involved in the assembly of the virus, which is related to the formation and release of

the viral envelope, N protein plays an important role in virus replication and
pathogenesis [19, 20].
Based on seven conserved replicase domains in pp1ab (polyprotein-1ab) for the
classification of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of
the genus Betacoronavirus in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae together with human
SARS-CoV and bat various SARSr-CoVs (SARS-related CoVs), and SARS-CoV-2 is
highly similar to bat coronavirus Bat-CoV-RaTG13 genetically [1, 21, 22]. Similar to
SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as
receptor, besides, the serine protease TMPRSS2 plays an important role in activating
spike (S) protein [23]. Some novel features of SARS-CoV-2 has been revealed, like a
furin protease cleavage site in the Spike which may be related to viral transmissibility
[24]. Recently, a novel bat-derived coronavirus RmYN02 with the similar furin
insertion in the S was found which emphasized the bat origin of the virus [25].
As a member of RNA virus, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
encoded by coronavirus lacks the proofreading capability, which leading to high
mis-incorporation rate during replication even with the help of exoribonuclease like
ExoN [26]. Together with the genome recombination events, it could cause viral
diversity and promote the transmission and disease of coronavirus [27]. At the same
time, in order to better adapt to the host, the virus usually mutates continuously under
the selection pressure of the host. In particular, some non-synonymous substitution
sites with high frequency are often experience strong positive selection [28].
Considering the continuous increase of infected people and the high variability of the
virus, it is important to pay attention to the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2.
Recently, 7 substitution hotspots in SARS-CoV-2, ORF1ab-G10818T
(ORF1ab-L3606F), ORF1ab-C8517T, ORF3a-G752T (ORF3a-G251V) S-A1841G
(D614G),
G171T
(Q57H),
ORF8-T251C
(ORF8-L84S)
and
N-GGG608_609_610AAC (N-RG203_204KR) have been reported [29-32]. In
addition, the non-synonymous substitution of ORF3a-G251V and ORF8-L84S both
cause the amino acid (aa) polarity changing, which may affect the conformation of the
protein and lead to function altering [31].
Despite these recent discoveries, in order to deal with the continuous variation of
SARS-CoV-2 and the accumulation of sequencing data, methods for quick and
efficient analysis of the mutations feature and substitutions hotspots of SARS-CoV-2
genome are urgently required. However, analyzing a large number of variant
sequences is difficult for biological or clinical expert without bioinformatics and
programming skills. Some tools such as MutPred can analyze variations by entering
amino acid sequence, but unable to handle synonymous substitutions and consecutive
nucleotide mutations like dinucleotide and trinucleotide substitution [33]. In this
respect, we have developed a visualization analysis tool, Bioinformatics Aider V1.0

(BioAider V1.0, https://github.com/ZhijianZhou01/BioAider/releases). BioAider
showed high efficiency and convenient in gene annotation and mutation screening on
multiple genome-sequencing data.
In this research, we collected 3240 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2
from 64 different countries and regions, sampling time from December 24, 2019 to
April 1, 2020. We conducted a detailed genome mutation analysis using BioAider. We
identified 14 substitution hotspots and 3 groups of possible linkage substitutions.
Especially, we found distinctive polymorphism on SR-rich region of N protein in
SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses in other animals. Our work provides a new
tool for recognition of the variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, contributes to
research the replication and pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, and gives further
evidence for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.

Results
BioAider
For these mutation analysis results of Bioaider V1.0, the two main results are the
summary of mutation sites (Fig. 1A) and the detailed log files (Fig. 1B) for
positioning mutated strain. BioAider puts complex algorithms and fault-tolerant
processing mechanisms inside, presenting users a very simple interface and prompts
are added to interface controls, which is extremely friendly for users. Especially, we
fully considered the time complexity and space complexity and optimization related
algorithms, which makes BioAider owns higher processing efficiency. More
importantly, it will continue to be in development, we will update the version for
Linux systems and add new features later. As a demonstration, here we used BioAider
for the mutations analysis of viral genome sequences.
Mutation sites in SARS-CoV-2 genomes
In this study, â€˜substitutionâ€™ refers to synonymous or non-synonymous
substitution, and â€˜mutationâ€™ includes all the genomic variance. The frequency of
mutation (or substitution) refers to the number of mutant strains compared to the
reference strain sequence in this study.
Compared with the early viral sampling strains (EPI_ISL_402119) in GISAID
database, a total of 2152 mutation sites (regardless of insertions or deletions) were
identified in 3239 SARS-CoV-2 sequenced whole genomes, accounting for 7.36% of
SARS-CoV-2 full-length gene (Table 1). The number of synonymous and
non-synonymous substitution sites was counted as 784 (2.68%) and 1335 (4.57%),
respectively. Among these non-synonymous substitution sites, 738 resulted in changes
in amino acid properties. Besides, 12 sites contained both synonymous and

non-synonymous substitution depending on the strains, and a total of 21 termination
mutation sites were also detected (Table 1). In all the coding genes, three with the of
the most mutation sites were ORF1ab, spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) gene, the
number of mutations sites were 1400, 296 and 168, respectively, accounting for
6.58%, 7.75% and 13.36% in their corresponding gene length (Table 1). The gene
with the highest proportion of mutation sites was ORF10, containing 16 mutation sites
were in 114 bases which occupied 14.04% of ORF10. All the mutation sites and viral
starins of SARS-CoV-2 detected by BioAider in this study were summarized in sTable
1 and sTable 2.
Substitution frequency distribution of synonymous or nonsynonymous sites
To assess the overall substitution frequency of these mutated sites, we divided
the substitution frequency into six different groups, and drew the frequency spectra of
2119 substitution sites (784 synonymous and 1335 nonsynonymous) of 3239
sequenced strains (Fig. 2). The result shows that the substitution sites of
non-synonymous were always over synonymous except for the fifth group. Besides, a
large number of sites with substitution frequencies between 1 and 5, and more than
half of the substitution sites only are observed in a single strain. We also found 60
sites owning a substitution frequency greater than 20, including 40 non-synonymous
substitution sites and 20 synonymous substitution sites. The substitution frequency
distribution of synonymous or nonsynonymous sites for each codon gene are in
sFigure 1.

Substitution hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 genomes
Totally, 2119 substitution sites were detected in 3239 sequenced strains, most of
them with a lower frequency. We defined the site with substitution frequency over 200
as the substitution hotspot, thus far, 14 substitution hotspots were identified which
distributed in ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N gene (Fig. 3). Among these
substitution hotspots, 10 sites were non-synonymous and 4 were synonymous. As for
these non-synonymous substitution hotspots, 6 substitution sites caused a change on
polarity or chargeability of amino acid. Especially, there was a trinucleotide
substitution hotspot on the N gene and caused two amino acid changes (Fig. 3).
Spatial distribution characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 in each substitution hotspot
According to the substitution hotspots, we divided two geographical regions,
China and outside of China, and studied the distribution differences of mutant and
referential type in geographical area at each substitution hotspots, respectively (Fig. 4).
As the result showing, except substitution hotspots of ORF1ab-10818 and ORF3a-752,

mutant type and referential type in the 12 other substitution hotspots showed
significant spatial distribution differences (p<0.01, chi-square test) between China and
outside of China. Furthermore, we found in substitution hotspots of ORF1ab-8517
and ORF8-251C, the mutant type (ORF1ab-8517T or ORF8-251C) owned a higher
ratio and were more prevalent in China than outside of China, opposite to other 10
substitution hotspots.
Linkage among these substitution hotspots
Make further efforts, we found some hotspots contains substitutions with similar
patterns and frequency (Table 2), indicating potential connection among these
substitution hotspots, and then we found 3 groups of possible linkage substitution. In
order to facilitate research, we used gene names and base position to mark them, these
linkage substitution hotspots were most likely ORF1ab-2772 & ORF1ab-14144 &
S-1841, ORF1ab-8517& ORF8-251 and ORF1ab-17483 & ORF1ab-17594 &
ORF1ab-17796.
To test our hypothesis, we compared the number of strains between referential
type and mutant type which synchronously mutated at the possible linkage
substitution hotspots (Table 3). For each combination of possible linkage substitution
hotspots, we found mutant type and referential type in accounts for more than 98% of
the population, it implied that the genetic variants in these combined substitution
hotspots were not independent, but linkage.
Vital substitution hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 NSP13
Given 541th aa was one of known key sites of NSP13 for binding to nucleic acids
in SARS-CoV, the non-synonymous substitution hotspot of ORF1ab-Y5865C
(NSP13-Y541C) in NSP13 probably affects the function of NSP13. We conducted
protein model prediction of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 by homology protein modeling. The
result showed that closest protein model to SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 was 6jyt.2.A with
99.83% amino acid identity, which came from SARS-CoV. As the result shown, the
tertiary structure of NSP13 were almost completely overlapping between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 5A). Besides, the 541th aa was relatively
conservative in SARS-CoV-2 related animal coronaviruses (Fig. 5B).
Non-synonymous substitutions sites near furin cleavage region
Two non-synonymous substitution sites near the furin cleavage region of PRRA
on S protein were identified (Fig. 6, Table 2). There were 7 mutant strains with
S-G2025C (S-Q675H) and one with S-A2024G (S-Q675R) among 3239 sequenced
strains. 675th aa on S protein was the sixth amino acid upstream of PRRA, and we
found S-Q675H and S-Q675R made original polar amino acids from no-charged to

positively charged.
Distinctive polymorphism in SR-rich fragment of SARS-CoV-2
We found a continuous variable area with non-synonymous substitutions from
183th to 204th aa on the N protein in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 7), and there were 5 variably
sites with non-synonymous substitutions frequency over 20, including a trinucleotide
substitution which led to two consecutive aa substitution of R203K and G204R (Table
2). Notably, there were 2 strains substituted on the 196th and 201th codons of
SARS-CoV-2, too, but they were synonymous substitutions which did not cause
amino acid substitutions (sTable 1).
The variable area was rich in Ser (S) and Arg (R) and contains SRXX repeat
fragments. We compared the region among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 related
coronavirus, SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV in this area (Fig. 7), and found that it was
relatively conserved in SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV and
SARS-CoV, but showed distinctive polymorphic in SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we
found 4 SRXX repeat fragments in most strains of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2
related coronavirus strains, but SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV lacked the third SRXX
repeat fragments due to one amino acid substitution. We found the number of SRXX
repeat fragments well reflects the evolutionary relationship among SARS-CoV-2,
SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV. Especially, he
substitution of two continuously amino acids on the last SRXX repeat fragments
(203th and 204th in SARS-CoV-2) was exclusively observed in SARS-CoV-2.
To explore the polymorphism of SR-rich region (aa 183-204) on SARS-CoV-2 N
protein, we intercepted the amino acids in this region. After culling some strains
sequence containing degenerate bases in the region that could not be translated
normally, we screened the SR-rich regions in the remaining 3233 strains. The results
showed the SR-rich regions in SARS-CoV-2 can be divided into 23 different types
(Table 4), including the reference type. The two main types were the reference type
(2561 strains) and the mutant type of N-R203K_G204R (494 strains). The majority of
the 22 mutant types harbored only single-amino-acid substitution compared to the
reference type, indicating that this region was relatively conserved among most
SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, we could still find some distinctive polymorphism
among different strains. The sampling date showed that most mutations existed in the
3233 recently sequenced strains, implying a constant evolution of the SR-rich region
in SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Discussion
Program tools for high-throughput analyses on big sequencing data of genome
are of great importance for genomic and evolutionary studies. In comparative
genomic studies, it is very important to identify whether amino acid properties have
changed when dealing with non-synonymous substitutions, which can help to identify
some important mutations. More importantly, simplicity of operation and high
summary of analysis results could save a lot of time for researchers. Thus, we have
developed the BioAider program, aiming to liberate researchers from numerous
sequencing data. BioAider V1.0 contains more than 10 functional programs for
sequence processing and analysis. It can be applied to assisting gene batch annotation
and quickly mutations analysis for coding gene. For mutations analysis, BioAider can
distinguish and summarize all the nucleotide variations sites with corresponding
mutation type and frequency, and then generates the frequency distribution map of
synonymous and non-synonymous substitution sites. The expansion and optimization
of BioAider in the future will endow the software more functions.
In this study, we conducted high-resolution analysis of mutations within
SARS-CoV-2 genome based on 3240 sequenced strains using BioAider. 2152
mutation sites among different strains were detected which accounted for 7.36% of
the complete genome. These mutation sites included 1,335 non-synonymous
substitution sites, implying abundant variations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2.
However, more than half of the mutation sites were only observed in a single strain of
SARS-CoV-2 which was difficult to be distinguished from sequencing errors.
Considering there were only 60 sites with substitution frequency above 20. Therefore,
we speculated that there were no large-scale mutations in the sequencing strains we
analyzed.
According to the spatial distribution analysis between strains of mutant types and
referential type regarding the substitution hotspots, 12 of 14 sites showed significant
distribution differences in China and outside of China, indicating different virus
prevalence in the two regions. We also noticed mostly strains sampled in China were
before Mar 2020, this was due to the epidemic of China has been roughly controlled
in March. Considering these facts, we speculate that virus differentiation in and
outside of China may attribute to human intervention.
In SARS-CoV NSP13, the 541th aa is critical for the protein function and double
mutations of S539A/Y541A show higher unwinding activity for nucleic acids binding
[17]. The amino acid identity of NSP13 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was
99.83% and their tertiary structure was almost completely overlapping, indicating that
NSP13 541th aa is also a vital site for the function of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13. Notably,
the mutant strain of NSP13-541C first appeared in the United States (sampled on Feb

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.04.135293; this version posted June 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

20, 2020), and the United States was the country with the largest number and
extremely high proportion of this mutant strains (316, 78% of all the 405 mutant
strains with NSP13-Y541C). We also noted that there were a total of 711 strains
sampled in the United States on Feb 20, 2020 and beyond, strains with NSP13-Y541C
accounted for almost half of these strains in the United States. This fact indicates that
NSP13-Y541C has gone through less negative selection pressure and even this
variation may be beneficial. Therefore, we speculate that NSP13-Y541C improves the
unwinding activity of NSP13 and promotes the replication of SARS-CoV-2,
contributing to their rapid spread in the United States. However, further studies are
required to reveal the detailed effect of substitution in 541th aa of SARS-CoV-2
NSP13 and whether the possible linkage substitution site of 504th aa plays a
synergistic role in this process.
Among the potential linkage substitution hotspots identified in this study,
ORF1ab-8517 and ORF8-251 were observed in a recent research [31, 34]. Among the
triple linkage substitution hotspots of ORF1ab-277, ORF1ab-14144 and S-1841,
ORF1ab-C2772T belongs to synonymous substitution, while ORF1ab-C14144T
caused the aa change of NSP12-P323L in interface region which is a bridge section
connecting NiRNA (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleo-tidyltransferase) and Fingers
of RdRp [14]. The 614th aa in S protein was located in the subdomain (SD) region
downstream of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on S1. We found that mutant
strains with NSP12-323L & S-614G were popular in the world and owned more than
half the frequency (52%) in the population, indicating that this mutant was dominant
in SARS-CoV-2. However, the functional impact of amino acid changed in these two
sites is still unclear at present, and whether NSP12-323 and S-614 are related on
specific function needed more experimental data to verify.
Previous studies have reported that SR-rich region in SARS-CoV is crucial for N
protein multimerization and the interaction with membrane (M) protein [35, 36]. In
the SR-rich region of N protein, there was only 2-aa difference between SARS-CoV-2
(referential type) and SARS-CoV. Therefore, the similar function of SR-rich region
may exist in SARS-CoV-2, although there is no relevant research reported at present.
Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 harbors one more SRXX repeat fragments in
the 193th -196th aa of N protein. Previous research reported that the SR-rich region of
SARS-CoV in 184th -196th aa was crucial for N protein multimerization and the
deletion of this region completely would make N protein abolish the
self-multimerization [36]. Besides, SRXX repeat fragments may play an important
role in SARS-CoV infection [37]. We noted that SARS-CoV could be regarded as a
deletion of SRXX in SR-rich region compared to SARS-CoV-2, and the transmission
rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than SARS-CoV, thus, whether SR-rich region of
SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in this process is worth to explore. However, the

research about SR-rich region in coronavirus was still limited at present. Especially,
unlike SARS-CoV, the region in SARS-CoV-2 is still constantly evolving, implying
that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may employ a more flexible replication
mechanism and even interaction with M protein. A study reported that the N protein
of SARS-CoV can specifically bind to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(hnRNPs) A1 and plays an important role in RNA replication and transcription,
especially, the key binding region is in the SR-rich region of SARS-CoV N protein (aa
161-210), the interaction between human hnRNP A1 and SARS-N protein may be the
key to SARS-CoV replication and transcription [37]. Whether such a similar
mechanism exists in SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. However, in human cells, there are
more than 20 hnRNPs has been discovered, and SR-rich region of SARS-CoV-2
showing distinctive polymorphism, whether the SARS-CoV-2 can bind to one of these
hnRNPs needs more verification. It might provide a new hint in understanding the
process of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Besides, the potential phenotype
changes related to nonsynonymous substitution hotspots on third SRXX repeat
fragments of SARS-CoV-2 may be also worth attention.
In the hotspot screening, we have found several substitutions critical for viral
replication potentially. For instance, the ORF1ab-C794T was located on NSP2 and
NSP2 was reported to inhibit the host protein PHB1 and PHB2 which benefited viral
replication, indicating that ORF1ab-C794T may affect viral replication [11]. The
ORF3a-G171T (Q57H) was located at the transmembranous domain of the 3a protein
(sFig. 2). 3a protein was reported to form ion channels on host cell membrane and
enhance the membrane permeability which benefited SARS-CoV life cycle [38]. Thus,
ORF3a-G171T (Q57H) may affect the formation of ion channels and subsequently
influence the viral replication. As for ORF3a-G752T (G251V), a recent analysis
predicted that it was in an important functional domain and might be related to
virulence, infectivity, ion channel formation and virus release [30]. We also found
several important sites for virus entry, though they showed lower substitution
frequency in our research data. For instance, S-Q675H and S-Q675R near furin
cleavage region possibly influence the cleavage of RRAR, a critical step for virus
entry (Fig. 6). We also detected a strain with the mutation of S-R408I located in the
RBD (sTable 1) which was reported to play an important role in virus-receptor
binding by a recent study [39].
In summary, we initially revealed the variation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2
and predicted the possible impact for some non-synonymous substitution hotspots.
The NSP13-Y541C was crucial, which may affect the unwinding activity of NSP13
and the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Especially, the SR-rich region of N protein in
SARS-CoV-2 shows distinctive polymorphism, and the quantity of SRXX repeat
fragments well reflects the evolutionary relationship among SARS-CoV-2,

SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV, it providing a new
clue to study the formation mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we could not
include all the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 due to the rapid increase of the genomic
data. More researches or real time analysis with relevant clinical data may contribute
to the viral epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment of COVID-19.

Methods and materials
Main functions and working principle of BioAider
BioAider V1.0 was developed based on Python 3.7 and R 3.5.2, and used PyQt5
for interface packaging. BioAider is a local software containing more 10 subroutines
and
can
run
on
Windows
systems
at
present
(https://github.com/ZhijianZhou01/BioAider/releases).
BioAider is mainly used to process and analysis genome sequencing data (such
as viral genome data), the main two functions are mutation analysis and batch extract
gene for auxiliary sequence annotation at present. First, for batch processing genes,
users can import the aligned complete genome sequence set (*.fasta or *.fas format),
and adjust the reference sequence for gene extraction to the forefront of the sequence
set. Paste the related gene information of reference sequence in the input box, gene
name, star string and end string, which separated by "," (sFig. 3A). Then user can
batch extract genes from a large number of sequences. Note that, the length of start
string or end string is not limited in, but it is required to be unique in the reference
sequence.
Second, for mutation analysis, BioAider will scan all the codons in the aligned
sequence, using the first sequence in the data set as a reference sequence. BioAider
can identify five different mutation types (synonymous, non-synonymous, insert,
deletion and termination) based on the standard codon method. It can distinguish the
changes in properties of amino acid when dealing non-synonymous substitutions.
Then, it will locate the position of the corresponding base in the mutated codon, so it
can identify multiple types of mutation at the same site, and also well discriminate
dinucleotide and trinucleotide substitution. Next, it summarizes all the mutation sites
with corresponding frequency and strains, and if user chooses to generate the
frequency distribution of synonymous or non-synonymous sites, BioAider will
directly generate the results in vector format image. (sFig. 3B). Of note, the frequency
distribution map does not include those sites that are both synonymous and
non-synonymous substitution, because such sites cannot determine the common
substitution frequency.

Mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2
The 3240 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with relatively higher
quality of sequencing were downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/), and
the reference genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) for ORF annotation
was from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank). All the viral strains used
in this study were listed in sTable3. Multiple sequence alignment of genomic
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were accomplished using MAFFT v7.407 [40].The
annotation and extraction of codon genes of these 3240 SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequences using BioAider V1.0. We extracted 11 continuously coding genes based on
the annotation information of NC_045512.2, including ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, E, M,
ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N and ORF10. Then we used MUSCLE program in
MEGA v7.0.14 to align these coding genes based on codons method [41].
We combined these 11 continuously coding genes to tandem sequence in
BioAider and used it to represent the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 for
subsequent analysis. Among all the early sampled virus strains (Dec 24, 2019 to
Dec30, 2019), genome of Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019 (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_402119,
sampled in Dec30, 2019) occupied most frequently (65 strains sequence were same
with IVDC-HB-01/2019) in 3240 sequenced strains and appears in multiple regions,
therefore, the strain of EPI_ISL_402119 was used the reference sequence for genome
variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in BioAider V1.0.
Structure prediction of protein
The tertiary protein structure was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB,
http://www.rcsb.org), and protein homology modeling was calculated by online tools
SWISS-MODEL then using Chimera 1.10.2 to simulate the effect of a single
amino acid mutation on protein structure[42, 43].
