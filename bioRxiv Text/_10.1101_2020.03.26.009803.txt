ABSTRACT
Outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and
has rapidly spread to almost all parts of world. In coronaviruses, the
receptor binding domain (RBD) in the distal part of S1 subunit of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can directly bind to angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2). RBD promote viral entry into the host cells and is an
important therapeutic target. In this study, we discovered that theaflavin
showed the lower idock score (idock score: −7.95 kcal/mol). To confirm
the result, we discovered that theaflavin showed FullFitness score of
-991.21 kcal/mol and estimated ΔG of -8.53 kcal/mol for the most
favorable interaction with contact area of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by
SwissDock service. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions
contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were
formed between theaflavin and Arg454, Phe456, Asn460, Cys480, Gln493,
Asn501 and Val503 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, near the direct contact area
with ACE2. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be the candidate of
SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor for further study.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
occurred in Wuhan, China, induced by SARS-CoV-2. Human-to-human
spread rapidly to the whole world triggering a global public health
emergency (1-3). In coronaviruses, spike protein on the surface envelop of
SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for promoting viral entry into the host cells (4).
The spike protein is composed of two functional subunits: the S1 subunit
that binds to the host cell receptors and the S2 subunit that mediates the
fusion of the viral and host cellular membranes. The distal part of the S1
subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that directly binds to
the peptidase domain of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)(5, 6).
The directly contact area between RBD and ACE2 included several regions.
Gln498, Thr500, Asn501 residues of the amino terminus (N) of RBD form
several hydrogen bonds with the Tyr41, Gln42, Lys353, and Arg357
residues of ACE2. Lys417 and Tyr453 residues of RBD can interact with
the Asp30 and His34 residues of ACE2, respectively. Gln474 in the
carboxyl terminus (C) of RBD forms hydrogen bond with Gln24 of ACE2.
In addition, Phe486 of RBD forms van der Waals forces with Met82 of

ACE24 (Fig 1)(5). However, the sequence identity of the spike protein
between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is 76%, and major variation exists
at the N-terminus encoding the RBD(7). Since RBD of spike protein is
surface-exposed and promotes entry into host cells, it could be a potential
target for therapy and vaccination using small molecules and neutralizing
antibodies to treat COVID-19 (4, 8).
In a recent study, we discovered that theaflavin possesses a potential
chemical

anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2

polymerase(9). Some Chinese medicinal compounds are also used for
prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the actual mechanisms
and efficiency of theaflavin for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into host
cells are still unclear. Therefore, we used molecular docking to target the
RBD of SARS-CoV-2, with the aim of screening these chemical structures
of traditional Chinese medicinal compounds demonstrating commonly used
against SARS-CoV and identifying alternative potential chemical structures
for antiviral therapy.

Methods and Materials
Structure preparation
The 3D structure of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (NCBI Reference
Sequence: YP_009724390.1) was generated based on homologous
modeling using Modeller(10) incorporated within the UCSF Chimera(11)
and SWISS-MODEL(12).
Compound dataset collection
Eighty-three chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal
compounds and their similar structures were retrieved from ZINC15
database.
Molecular docking and virtual screening
We used two molecular docking methods for analysis. First, molecular
docking and virtual screening was performed using idock download from
Github (https://github.com/HongjianLi/idock) in a local linux machine. For
each structure, nine docking posed were generated and the scores for the
best docking poses of each structure were used for ranking by idock.
Second, SwissDock server (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, University of
Lausanne, Switzerland) was used for in silico prediction of the lowest free

http://www.swissdock.ch/) in the Internet browser(13). The grid box
encompassed by Lys417 and Tyr453 of the middle of the bridge, Gln498,
Thr500, Asn501 of the N-terminus, Gln474 of C-terminus and surrounding
amino acids around contact surface of SARS-CoV-2 RBD was using for
ligand docking and virtual screening (Fig 1).

Result
Screening of these chemical structures, we discovered that theaflavin
(ZINC3978446, Fig 2A) also has a lower idock score in the contact area of
RBD in SARS-CoV-2 (−7.95 kcal/mol). The contact modes between
theaflavin and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 with the lowest idocking scores are
illustrated in Figure 1C. Regarding contact modes by idock, hydrophobic
interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen
bond was found between theaflavin and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig 2B).
Because theaflavin has the lower idock score in the contact area of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD (−7.95 kcal/mol), we used the SwissDock server to
confirm the result. Favorable binding modes were scored based on
FullFitness scores and binding energy (Estimated ΔG (kcal/mol)) by the
SwissDock server. The FullFitness scores and binding energy results and
were obtained from the docking of theaflavin (ZINC3978446) into contact
area of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Theaflavin showed FullFitness scores of
-991.21 kcal/mol and estimated ΔG of -8.53 kcal/mol for the most
favorable interaction with contact area of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig 3A). The
3D and 2D contact modes between contact area of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and

theaflavin with the lowest binding energy are illustrated in Figure 3B, C
and D. Regarding the contact modes by SwissDock server, hydrophobic
interactions contribute significantly for binding (Fig

3D and E). The

theaflavin and Arg454, Phe456, Asn460, Cys480, Gln493,Asn501 and

Discussion
The previous study reported that dihydrotanshinone I also had
inhibitory effects against viral entry and replication in the MERS-CoV
through the cell model (14). In addition, the recent study showed
dihydrotanshinone I could inhibit viral entry through binding to the fusion
cone of spike protein which is important for viral membrane fusion(15).
The docking binding energy between dihydrotanshinone I and spike protein
is -5.16 kcal/mol (15). In our previous study, we discovered that theaflavin
(ZINC3978446) is a potential chemical structure of anti-SARS-CoV-2
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(9). Moreover, we also found that
theaflvin was able to dock in contact area in RBD of SARS-CoV-2.
Theaflvin formed hydrophobic interactions and additional hydrogen bonds
with the direct contact area of RBD. It is possible that theaflavin could
ocuppy the contact area of RBD and block the interaction between ACE2
and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of viral entry
blockage by dihydrotanshinone I and theaflavin could vary.
Our results suggest that theaflavin could be the candidate for prophylaxis
or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection through RBD targeting. However,

the exact in vivo effect remains unclear and further studies are necessary to
confirm the effects of theaflavin against SARS-CoV-2 entry.
