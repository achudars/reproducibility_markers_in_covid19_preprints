ABSTRACT

10

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and

11

multiple organ failure that are largely attributed to the cytokine storm. The surface coronavirus

12

spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection

13

by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

14

revealed two B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host

15

protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The motif in S1 subunit is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

16

Phosphatases and kinases are major players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during

17

pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses target PP2A in order to

18

manipulate host’s antiviral responses. Recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is

19

involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is

20

possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight COVID-19, the

21

interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and the PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the

22

discovery and/or development of a bioactive ligand inhibitor for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, a

23

small molecule called Artepillin C (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis,

24

mimics the side chains of LxxLxE motif. Importantly, ArtC is known, among other effects, to have

25

anti-inflammatory activity that makes it an excellent candidate for future clinical trials in COVID-

26

19 patients.

INTRODUCTION

31
32

In March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19

33

(Coronavirus Disease-2019) situation is a pandemic. The novel SARS-CoV-2 has had serious

34

consequences for human health and socioeconomic stability worldwide. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are

35

a large family of enveloped single positive-stranded RNA viruses that can infect both mammalian

36

and avian species because their rapid mutation and recombination facilitate their adaptation to new

37

hosts (Graham and Baric, 2010; Li, 2013). They can cause severe, often fatal Acute Respiratory

38

Distress Syndrome (ARDS). CoVs are classified into Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and

39

Deltacoronavirus genetic genera. The novel betacoronavirus (betaCoVs) SARS-CoV-2 is

40

relatively close to other betaCoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),

41

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), bat coronavirus HKU4, mouse

42

hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and human OC43 coronavirus (HCoV-

43

OC43). SARS-CoV emerged in China (2002–2003) and spread to other countries (more than 8,000

44

infection cases and a fatality rate of ~10%) (Peiris et al., 2003). In 2012, MERS-CoV was detected

45

in the Middle East. It spread to multiple countries, infecting more than 1,700 people with a fatality

46

rate of ~36% (de Wit et al., 2016).

47
48

The surface-located SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S (S) is a 1273 amino acid residues. It is a

49

homotrimeric, multidomain, and integral membrane protein that give coronaviruses the appearance

50

of having crowns (Corona in Latin) (Li, 2016). It is a key piece of viral host recognition (receptor-

51

recognition) and organ tropism and induces strongly the host immune reaction (Li, 2015). It is

52

subdivided to S1 subunit that binds to a receptor on the host cell surface and S2 subunit that permits

53

viral and host membranes fusion. S1 subunit is divided into two domains, an N-terminal domain

54

(NTD) and a C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) that can function as viral receptors-

55

binding (Li, 2012). In addition, S1 subunit is normally more variable in sequence among different

56

CoVs than is the S2 subunit (Masters, 2006).

57
58

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major family of Serine/Threonine phosphatases in eukaryotic

59

cells and regulates diverse biological processes through dephosphorylation of numerous signaling

60

molecules. PPA2 and phosphatase 1 (PP1), regulates over 90% of all Ser/Thr dephosphorylation

61

events in eukaryotic cells (Eichhorn et al., 2009). PP2A is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme composed

62

of a stable heterodimer of the scaffold A-subunit (PP2A-A) and catalytic C-subunit (PP2A-C) and

63

a variable mutually exclusive regulatory subunit from four families (B (B55), B′ (B56), B″ and B‴)

64

which provide substrate specificity. The human B56 family consists of at least five different

65

members (α, β, γ, δ and ε). Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro-

66

inflammatory responses during microbial infections. Sun et al. (2017) showed that PP2A plays an

67

important role in regulating inflammation by controlling the production of inflammatory

68

cytokines/chemokines (Kozicky and Sly, 2015). In addition, PP2A is one of the phosphatases

69

involved in negatively regulating the inflammatory response (Shanley et al., 2001). Moreover,

70

studies have revealed that viruses use multiple strategies to target PP2A in the aim to manipulate

71

host antiviral responses (Guergnon et al., 2011).

72
73

Artepillin C (ArtC) is uniquely found in Brazilian honeybee green propolis and is one of its major

74

bioactive components (Marcucci et al., 2001; Park et al., 2004). It is a low-molecular weight

75

phenolic single ring with two prenyl groups (3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) (Szliszka et

76

al., 2013). These properties suggest high oral bioavailability and cell-permeability allowing good

77

biological activity of ArtC (Shimizu et al., 2004; Konishi et al. 2005; Konishi, 2005). Indeed,

78

Paulino et al. (2008) showed that ArtC exhibited bioavailability by oral administration in mice.

79

Interestingly, ArtC has many therapeutic effects, anti-microbial, anti-tumor, apoptosis-inductor,

80

immunomodulatory, and anti-oxidant effects (Salomão et al., 2004; Kimoto et al., 2001; Orsolic et

81

al., 2006; Matsuno et al., 1997; Gekker et al., 2005; Nakanishi et al., 2003). Many of these

82

therapeutic effects can be attributed to its immunomodulatory functions (Chan et al., 2013; Cheung

83

et al., 2011; Paulino, et al., 2008). Indeed, Szliszka et al., (2013) have tested the anti-inflammatory

84

activity of ArtC in activated RAW264.7 macrophages. They found that ArtC exerted strong

85

antioxidant activity and significantly inhibited the production of several pro-inflammatory

86

cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-12, which makes ArtC an excellent anti-inflammatory

87

drug. In addition, ArtC suppresses T cell proliferation and activation (Chan et al., 2013). Here, S

88

protein was analyzed because of its importance in mediating infection. This analysis revealed two

89

B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host PP2A.

Two LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits of Spike protein
Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) resource

100

(http://elm.eu.org/) revealed short linear motifs (SLiMs) known as LxxIxE-like motif

,293LDPLSE298 in S1 subunit and

102

acid residues (3-15) in proteins that facilitate protein sequence modifications and protein-protein

103

interactions (Davey et al., 2012; Van Roey et al., 2014). RNA viruses are known to mutate quickly

104

and thus are able to create mimic motifs, on very short time scales, that could hijack biological

105

processes in the host cell such as cell signaling networks (Davey et al., 2015; Via et al., 2015;

106

Davey et al., 2011). Interestingly, 293LDPLSE298 is only present in SARS-CoV-2 and absent in S

110

subunit and conserved in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, SARS-like of bat from China and Kenya (Fig.

111

1B). These last betacoronaviruses are phylogenetically close (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, the region

112

containing 1197LIDLQE1202 peptide has not been resolved in all known 3D structures of S protein

113

to know if it is exposed in the surface. Probably,

amino acid side chains in LxxLxE motif, the method developed by Baran et al. (2007) has been

120

used. This method allowed to discover a small molecule called Artepillin (ArtC) (Fig. 4A). It is a

121

low-molecular weight phenolic single ring with two prenyl groups (3,5-diprenyl-4-

122

honeybee green propolis and is one of its major bioactive components (Marcucci et al., 2001; Park

126

et al., 2004). In addition, it has many therapeutic effects, anti-microbial, anti-tumor, apoptosis-

127

inductor, immunomodulatory, and anti-oxidant effects (Salomão et al., 2004; Kimoto et al., 2001;

128

Orsolic et al., 2006; Matsuno et al., 1997; Gekker et al., 2005; Nakanishi et al., 2003). Many of

129

these therapeutic effects can be attributed to its immunomodulatory functions (Chan et al., 2013;

130

Cheung et al., 2011; Paulino, et al., 2008).

131
132
133
134

In order to determine the molecular interactions of

135

subunit of PP2A (PP2A-B56), molecular docking was performed with the software AutoDock vina

136

(Trott and Olson, 2010). Figure 4C and D show that 293LDPLSE298 peptide is localized in the same

137

region as pS-RepoMan peptide that contains the LxxIxE motif (PDBid: 5SW9_B) and important

138

amino acids of LxxIxE-like motif are superimposed with those of pS-RepoMan peptide (Fig. 4D).

139

That is confirmed the reliability of AutoDock vina peptide docking module. In addition, Leu293

140

of 293LDPLSE298 is docked into hydrophobic pocket and Glu298 form ionic interactions with amino

141

acid residues in positive charged region of PP2A-B56 (Fig. 4C). Note that 293LDPLSE298 contains

142

a serine that could be phosphorylated generating a negative charge that will interact with positive

143

patch in B56 subunit, enhancing binding affinity (Nygren and Scott, 2015). In the case of ArtC, its

144

two prenyl groups are docked into two pockets as already seen with

145

4E-F). Note that the side chain of carboxylic acid group of ArtC is short to form ionic interactions

146

with amino acid residues in positive charged region of PP2A-B56 (Fig. 4E). Therefore, to enhance

147

binding affinity of ArtC, it is necessary to increase the length of side chain of carboxylic acid group.

148

Interestingly, by using PinaColada, a computational method (Zaidman and Wolfson, 2016) for the

149

design and affinity improvement of peptides that preclude protein-protein interaction, the peptide

150

predicted (293LIDLEE298) by the software is mutated in C-terminal to negative charge residue

151

(glutamic acid), showing the importance of the negative charge of peptide to interact with PP2A-

152

B56. According to Autodock software, predicted binding affinity of 293LDPLSE298is -4.9 Kcal/mol,

153

and this of ArtC is -6.1 Kcal/mol. It is known that the binding affinity of SLiMs is relatively weak

154

(low µmolar range) (Gouw et al., 2018). This suggests that ArtC could compete with the virus to

155

bind to PP2A-B56. To my knowledge, no compound has been identified to interact with regulatory

156

subunits of PP2A, in addition it is the first time that a small molecule has been found that mimics

the LxxIxE motif. Despite of numerous studies on ArtC its target is not yet known. In this study,

158

its target is predicted as B56-PP2A. In general, activation of PP2A appears to have a suppressive

159

effect on the inflammatory response (Sun et al., 2017). This suggests according to anti-

167

shown an exacerbation of lung inflammation in mice infected with rhinovirus 1B (the most

168

common viral infectious agent in humans). Administrating Salmeterol (beta-agonist) treatment to

169

mice exerts anti-inflammatory effects by interacting with catalytic subunit PP2A, thus increasing

170

its activity. It is probable that beta-agonists have the potential to target distinct pro-inflammatory

171

pathways unresponsive to corticosteroids in patients with rhinovirus-induced exacerbations

172

(Hatchwell et al., 2014). Treatment with Salmeterol drug may merit investigation for the possibility

173

of using it in COVID-19's patients with sustained and dangerous inflammatory reaction.

host PP2A-B56 phosphatase. Interestingly, PP2A is involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory

responses during pathogen infections. Well, recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is

involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is

182

possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. LxxLxE motif of CoV-2 allowed to find a

183

small molecule called Artepillin (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis,

184

which is known to have anti-inflammatory activity. ArtC, by its non-cytotoxicity in cells, high oral

185

bioavailability, tested in mice, and cell-permeability, in addition that it can be synthesized in the

186

laboratory (Uto et al., 2002; Yashiro et al., 2015) and produced in yeast by using synthetic biology

187

(Munakata et al., 2019) makes it an ideal molecule for future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.

https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5472440#section=3D-Conformer.

202

For docking, the coordinates of the 293LDPLSE298 peptide were extracted from spike S protein of

203

CoV-2 structure (PDBid: 6VSB_A). Unfortunately, the region containing 1197LIDLQE1202 peptide

204

has not been resolved in all known 3D structures of spike S protein. So, Pep-Fold (Thevenet et al.,

205

2012) software was used to model de novo this peptide. The model quality of the peptide was

206

assessed by analysis of a Ramachandran plot through PROCHECK (Vaguine et al., 1999).

207

The docking of the two peptides into B56 regulatory subunit of PPA2 (PDBid: 5SWF_A) was

208

performed with the software AutoDock vina (Trott and Olson, 2010). The 3D complex containing

209

B56 subunit and peptides was refined by using FlexPepDock (London et al., 2011), which allows

210

full flexibility to the peptide and side-chain flexibility to the receptor. The electrostatic potential

211

surface of the B56 subunit was realized with PyMOL software (http://pymol.org/).

212

PinaColada a computational method (Zaidman and Wolfson, 2016) for inhibitory peptide design

213

was used to improve affinity of 293LDPLSE298 peptide to bind to B56 regulatory subunit of PPA2.
