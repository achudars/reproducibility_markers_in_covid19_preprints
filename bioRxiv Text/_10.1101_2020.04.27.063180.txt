The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in its replicating form.
The structure comprises the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and over two turns of RNA template-product duplex. The
active site cleft of nsp12 binds the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues. Two copies of nsp8
bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the RNA duplex as it exits. Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting
RNA, forming positively charged ‘sliding poles’ that may enable processive replication of the long coronavirus genome. Our
results will allow for a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms used by antivirals such as remdesivir, which is currently
in clinical trials for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

of the free enzyme16, but also reveals large additional protein
regions in nsp8 that became ordered upon RNA binding and
interact with RNA far outside the core enzyme (Extended Data
Figure 3a). These observations are unique, as RdRp complexes
of hepatitis C virus20, poliovirus21, and norovirus22 contain only
one turn of RNA that is however oriented in a similar way (Extended Data Figure 3b).
Our structure shows details of the RdRp-RNA interactions
(Fig. 3). The nsp12 subunit binds one turn of RNA between its
fingers and thumb subdomains (Fig. 3a, b). The active site is
located on the palm subdomain and formed by five conserved
nsp12 elements called motifs A-E (Fig. 3b). Motif C binds the
RNA 3’-end and contains the residues D760 and D761, of which
D760 is known to be essential for RNA synthesis15. The additional nsp12 motifs F and G reside in the fingers subdomain
and position the RNA template (Fig. 3b). The observed nsp12

Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses that pose a major health risk1. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)2,3 has caused a pandemic referred
to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Coronaviruses use
a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex for the
replication of their genome, and for sub-genomic transcription
of their genes4,5. This RdRp complex is the target for antiviral
nucleoside analogue inhibitors, such as remdesivir6,7. Remdesivir shows antiviral activity against coronaviruses in cell culture and animals8, inhibits coronavirus RdRp9,10, and is currently tested in the clinic as a drug candidate for treating COVID-19
patients11-13.
The RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of a catalytic subunit
called non-structural protein (nsp) 1214, and two accessory subunits, nsp8 and nsp75,15. The structure of the RdRp was recently
reported16 and is highly similar to the RdRp of SARS-CoV17, a
zoonotic coronavirus that spread into the human population
in 20021. The nsp12 subunit contains an N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain,
an interface domain, and a C-terminal RdRp domain16,17. The
RdRp domain resembles a right hand and comprises the fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains16,17 that are found in all
single-subunit polymerases. Subunit nsp7 binds to the thumb,
whereas two copies of nsp8 bind to the fingers and thumb subdomains16,17. Structural information is also available for isolated
nsp8-nsp7 complexes18,19.
To obtain the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in its
active form, we prepared recombinant nsp12, nsp8 and nsp7
(Fig. 1a, Experimental procedures). When added to a minimal RNA substrate (Fig. 1b), the purified proteins gave rise to
RNA-dependent RNA extension activity, which depended on
the presence of nsp8 and nsp7 (Fig. 1c). We assembled and purified a stable RdRp-RNA complex and collected single-particle
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data (Extended Data Figure 1, Extended Data Table 1). Particle classification yielded a
3D reconstruction at a nominal resolution of 2.9 Å and led to
a refined structure of the RdRp-RNA complex (Extended Data
Figures 1 and 2).
The structure shows the RdRp enzyme engaged with over
two turns of duplex RNA (Fig. 2). The structure resembles that

(Fig. 3c). The protruding RNA duplex is flanked by long α-helical extensions that are formed by the highly conserved18 N-terminal regions in the two nsp8 subunits (Figs. 2, 3). These prominent nsp8 extensions reach up to 26 base pairs away from the
active site and use positively charged residues to form multiple
RNA backbone interactions (Fig. 3). The two nsp8 extensions
form different RNA interactions, arguing for sequence-independent binding. The nsp8 extensions get ordered along RNA,
as they are flexible in nsp8-nsp7 complexes18,19.
The interactions of the nsp8 extensions with exiting RNA
may explain the processivity of the RdRp, which is required for
the replication of the very long RNA genome of coronaviruses
and other viruses of the nidovirus family5. It is known that nsp8
and nsp7 confer processivity to nsp12, and that mutation of residue K58 is lethal for the virus15. K58 is located in the nsp8 extension, and interacts with exiting RNA (Fig. 3c). Thus the nsp8
extensions may be regarded as ‘sliding poles’ that slide along
exiting RNA at the rear of the polymerase to prevent premature
dissociation of the RdRp during replication. The sliding poles
could serve a function similar to the ‘sliding clamps’ of DNA
replication machineries23.
To investigate how the RdRp binds the incoming nucleoside
triphosphate (NTP), we superimposed our structure onto the
related structure of the norovirus RdRp-nucleic acid complex22.
This suggested that contacts between nsp12 and the NTP are
conserved (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The nsp12 residue N691
may recognize the 2’-OH group of the NTP, thereby rendering
the RdRp specific for the synthesis of RNA, rather than DNA.
Our modeling is also consistent with binding of the triphosphorylated form of remdesivir to the NTP site, because there
is space in the NTP site to accommodate the additional nitrile
group that is present at the 1’ position of the ribose ring in this
nucleoside analogue.
When our study was about to be completed, a manuscript
became available that also describes a structure of a SARSCoV-2 RdRp-RNA complex24. Whereas the core structures
appear to be very similar, we additionally observe exiting RNA
and novel nsp8 extensions that are implicated in enzyme processivity. The other study suggested that remdesivir functions
as an immediate RNA chain terminator24. However, this contradicts previous biochemistry10,25 that showed that remdesivir
causes delayed chain termination after the addition of several
more nucleotides. To resolve this, we will study the mechanism
of RdRp inhibition by remdesivir with a combination of biochemistry and structural biology in the future.

As the RNA duplex exits from the RdRp cleft, there are no

derived vector 14-B (a gift from S. Gradia, UC Berkeley, Addgene: 48308). The two constructs for nsp8 and nsp7 contain an
N-terminal 6xHis tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage
site. The PCR product containing codon optimized nsp12 was
cloned into the modified pFastBac vector 438-C (a gift from S.
Gradia, UC Berkeley, Addgene: 55220) via LIC. The nsp12 construct contained an N-terminal 6xHis tag, followed by an MBP
tag, a 10xAsp sequence, and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. All constructs were verified by sequencing.
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 plasmid (500 ng) was transformed
into DH10EMBacY cells using electroporation to generate a
bacmid encoding full-length nsp12. Virus production and expression in insect cells was then performed as described26. After 60 hours of expression in Hi5 cells, cells were collected by
centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl,
50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 30 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.284 µg
ml-1 leupeptin, 1.37 µg ml-1 pepstatin, 0.17 mg ml-1 PMSF,
and 0.33 mg ml-1 benzamidine). The SARS-CoV-2 nsp8 and

nsp7 plasmids were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) RIL
cells grown in LB medium. Cells were grown to an OD of 600
at 37 °C and protein expression was subsequently induced with
0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C for 16
hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended
in lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 %
(v/v) glycerol, 30 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.284 µg ml-1 leupeptin, 1.37 µg ml-1 pepstatin, 0.17 mg
ml-1 PMSF, and 0.33 mg ml-1 benzamidine).
Protein purification
Protein purifications were performed at 4 °C. After harvest and
resuspension, cells of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 expression were
immediately sonicated for cell lysis. Lysates were subsequently
cleared by centrifugation (87,207g, 4 °C, 30 min) and ultracentrifugation (235,000g, 4 °C, 60 min). The supernatant containing nsp12 was filtered using a 5-μm syringe filter, followed by
filtration with a 0.8-µm syringe filter (Millipore) and applied
onto a HisTrap HP 5 mL (GE Healthcare), preequilibrated in
lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 %
(v/v) glycerol, 30 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM
β-mercaptoethanol, 0.284 µg ml-1 leupeptin, 1.37 µg ml-1 pepstatin, 0.17 mg ml-1 PMSF, and 0.33 mg ml-1 benzamidine).
After application of the sample, the column was washed with 6

pepstatin, 0.17 mg ml-1 PMSF, and 0.33 mg ml-1 benzamidine),
and 6 CV lysis buffer. The HisTrap was then attached to an XK
column 16/20 (GE Healthcare), prepacked with amylose resin
(New England Biolabs), which was pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. The protein was eluted from the HisTrap column directly
onto the amylose column using nickel elution buffer (300 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 500 mM
imidazole pH 8.0, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol).
The HisTrap column was then removed and the amylose column was washed with 10 CV of lysis buffer. Protein was eluted
from the amylose column using amylose elution buffer (300
mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 116.9
mM maltose, 30 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Peak fractions were assessed via SDS-PAGE and staining
with Coomassie. Peak fractions containing nsp12 were pooled
and mixed with 8 mg of His-tagged TEV protease. After 12
hours of protease digestion, protein was applied to a HisTrap
column equilibrated in lysis buffer to remove uncleaved nsp12,
His6-MBP, and TEV. Subsequently, the flow-through containing nsp12 was applied to a HiTrap Heparin 5 column mL (GE
Healthcare). The flow-through containing nsp12 was collected
and concentrated in a MWCO 50,000 Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter unit (Merck). The concentrated sample was applied to
a HiLoad S200 16/600 pg equilibrated in size exclusion buffer
(300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP). Peak fractions were assessed
by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Peak fractions were
pooled and concentrated in a MWCO 50,000 Amicon Ultra
Centrifugal Filter (Merck). The concentrated protein with a final concentration of 102 µM was aliquoted, flash-frozen, and
stored at -80 °C until use.
SARS-CoV-nsp8 and nsp7 were purified separately using
the same purification procedure, as follows. After cell harvest
and resuspension in lysis buffer, the protein of interest was immediately sonicated. Lysates were subsequently cleared by centrifugation (87.200g, 4 °C, 30 min). The supernatant was applied
to a HisTrap HP 5 mL column (GE Healthcare), preequilibrated
in lysis buffer. The column was washed with 9.5 CV high salt
buffer (1000 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v)
glycerol, 30 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
0.284 µg ml-1 leupeptin, 1.37 µg ml-1 pepstatin, 0.17 mg ml-1

buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v)
glycerol, 30 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol).
The sample was then eluted using nickel elution buffer (150
mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 500
mM imidazole pH 8.0, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The eluted
protein was dialyzed in dialysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM
Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) in the presence of 2 mg His-tagged TEV protease. After
12 hours, imidazole pH 8.0 was added to a final concentration
of 30 mM. The dialyzed sample was subsequently applied to
a HisTrap HP 5 mL column (GE Healthcare), preequilibrated
in dialysis buffer. The flow-through that contained the protein
of interest was then applied to a HiTrap Q 5 mL column (GE
Healthcare). The Q column flow-through containing nsp8 or
nsp7 was concentrated using a MWCO 3 kDa Amicon Ultra
Centrifugal Filter (Merck) and applied to a HiLoad S200 16/600
pg equilibrated in size exclusion buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 5 % (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Peak fractions were assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.
Peak fractions were pooled. Nsp7 with a final concentration of
418 µM was aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 °C until
use. Nsp8 with a final concentration of 250 µM was aliquoted,
flash-frozen, and stored at -80 °C until use. All protein identities
were confirmed by mass spectrometry.

RNA extension assays
All RNA oligos were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The RNA sequence used for the transcription assay is /56FAM/rUrUrU rUrCrA rUrGrC rUrArC rGrCrG rUrArG rUrUr
UrUrC rUrArC rGrCrG. We designed a minimal substrate by
connecting the template RNA to the RNA primer by a tetraloop,
to protect the blunt ends of the RNA duplex and to ensure efficient annealing. RNA was annealed in 50 mM NaCl and 10
mM Na-HEPES pH 7.5 by heating the solution to 75 °C and
gradually cooling to 4 °C. RNA extension reactions contained
RNA (5 µM), nsp12 (5 µM), nsp8 (15 µM) and nsp7 (15 µM)
in 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 5 % (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Reactions
were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and the RNA extension was
initiated by addition of NTPs (150 µM UTP, GTP and CTP, and
300 µM ATP). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2X
stop buffer (7M urea, 50 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1x TBE buffer).
Samples were digested with proteinase K (New England Biolabs) and RNA products were separated on 20% acrylamide gels
in 1X TBE buffer supplemented with 8M urea. 6-FAM labeled
RNA products were visualized by Typhoon 95000 FLA Imager
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection
An RNA scaffold for RdRP-RNA complex formation was annealed by mixing equimolar amounts of two RNA strands
(5’-rUrUrU rUrCrA rUrGrC rUrArC rGrCrG rUrArG-3’; 56FAM/rCrUrA rCrGrC rG-3’) (IDT Technologies) in annealing
buffer (10 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl) and heating
to 75 °C, followed by step-wise cooling to 4 °C. For complex
formation, 1.2 nmol of purified nsp12 was mixed with a 1.2fold molar excess of RNA scaffold and 6-fold molar excess of
each nsp8 and nsp7. After incubation at room temperature for
10 min, the EC was subjected to size exclusion chromatography
on a Superdex 200 Increase 3.2/300 equilibrated with complex
buffer (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2,
1 mM TCEP). Peak fractions corresponding to a nucleic-acid
rich high-molecular weight population (as judged by absorbance at 260 nm) were pooled and concentrated in a MWCO
30,000 Vivaspin 500 concentrator (Sartorius) to approx. 20 µl.
3 µL of the concentrated RdRp-RNA complex were mixed with
0.5 µl of octyl ß-D-glucopyranoside (0.003% final concentration) and applied to freshly glow discharged R 2/1 holey carbon
grids (Quantifoil). Prior to flash freezing in liquid ethane, the
grid was blotted for 6 seconds with a blot force of 5 using a
Vitrobot MarkIV (Thermo Fischer Scientific) at 4°C and 100%
humidity.
Cryo-EM data collection was performed with SerialEM27
using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo
Fischer Scientific) operated at 300 keV. Images were acquired
in EFTEM mode with a slit with of 20 eV using a GIF quantum
energy filter and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan) at a nominal magnification of 105,000x corresponding to a calibrated
pixel size of 0.834 Å/pixel. Exposures were recorded in counting mode for 2.2 seconds with a dose rate of 19 e-/px/s resulting
in a total dose of 60 e-/Å2 that was fractionated into 80 movie
frames. Because initial processing showed that the particles adopted only a limited number of orientations in the vitreous ice
layer, a total of 8168 movies were collected at 30° stage tilt to
yield a broader distribution of orientations. Untilted data was
discarded. Motion correction, CTF-estimation, and particle
picking and extraction were performed on the fly using Warp28.
Cryo-EM data processing and analysis
1.3 million particles were exported from Warp28 to cryoSPARC29,
and the particles were subjected to 2D classification. 25% of the

polymerase, and refined against a synthetic reference prepared
from PDB-6M71. Ab initio refinement was performed using
particles from bad 2D classes to obtain five 3D classes of ‘junk’.
These five classes and the first polymerase reconstruction were
used as starting references to sort the initial 1.3M particles in
supervised 3D classification rather than 2D, as the latter tended
to exclude less abundant projection directions. 514k particles
(39%) from the resulting polymerase class were subjected to
another ab initio refinement to obtain five starting references
containing four ‘junk’ classes and the complex of interest. These
classes were used as starting references in another supervised
3D classification. 418k particles (82%) from the class representing the complex were exported from cryoSPARC to RELION
3.030. There, all particles were refined in 3D against the reconstruction previously obtained in cryoSPARC, using a mask including only the core part of the polymerase and a short segment of upstream RNA to obtain a 3.1 Å reconstruction. CTF
refinement and another round of 3D refinement improved the
resolution further to 2.9 Å. Particles were re-extracted at 1.3 Å/
px in a bigger box in Warp to accommodate distant parts of the
RNA. Unsupervised 3D classification with local alignment was
performed to obtain 2 classes: with nsp8b present, and without.
172k particles with nsp8b present were finally subjected to focused 3D refinement using a mask including the RNA, nsp8a
and nsp8b.

Model building and refinement
To build the atomic model of the RdRp-RNA complex, we
started from the structure of the free SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB:
6M71) that was recently slightly adjusted by Tristan Croll
(Cambridge University, UK; https://twitter.com/CrollTristan/
status/1247846163061133312). The structure was rigid-body
fit into the cryo-EM reconstruction and adjusted manually in
Coot31. After adjustment of the protein subunits, unmodeled
density remained for helical segments in the N-terminal regions of both copies of nsp8. These nsp8 extensions were modeled by superimposing the nsp8 model (PDB: 2AHM; chain H)
from the crystal structure of the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecamer18, in
which the far N-terminal region of nsp8 adopts a similar fold.
Careful inspection of the remaining A-form RNA density revealed that in our complex, instead of the originally designed
short template-primer duplex (see above), four copies of one
of the RNA strands were annealed to form a pseudo-continuous, longer RNA duplex. Annealing was mediated by a 10 bp
self-complementary region within this RNA strand (Extended
Date Figure 1c). Nucleotides 5-18 of four RNA strands were
modeled, whereas the flapped-out nucleotides 1-4 were invisible due to mobility and excluded from the model. The model
was real-space refined using phenix.refine32 against a composite
map of the focused refinement and global reconstructions generated in phenix.combine_focused_maps and shows excellent
stereochemistry (Extended Data Table 1). Figures were prepared with PyMol and Chimera33.
