SUMMARY

29

During virus infection B cells are critical for the production of antibodies and protective

30

immunity. Here we show that the human B cell compartment in patients with diagnostically

31

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and clinical COVID-19 is rapidly altered with the early recruitment of

32

B cells expressing a limited subset of IGHV genes, progressing to a highly polyclonal response

33

of B cells with broader IGHV gene usage and extensive class switching to IgG and IgA

34

subclasses with limited somatic hypermutation in the initial weeks of infection. We identify

35

extensive convergence of antibody sequences across SARS-CoV-2 patients, highlighting

36

stereotyped naïve responses to this virus. Notably, sequence-based detection in COVID-19

37

patients of convergent B cell clonotypes previously reported in SARS-CoV infection predicts the

38

presence of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibody titers specific for the receptor-

39

binding domain. These findings offer molecular insights into shared features of human B cell

40

responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic spillover coronaviruses.

INTRODUCTION

47

The novel human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the

48

etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Huang et al., 2020; Zhu et al.,

49

2020) pandemic. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, six human coronaviruses (hCoVs)

50

were known; four seasonal hCoVs (hCoV-229E, -NL63, -HKU1, and -OC43) (Su et al., 2016)

51

causing usually mild upper respiratory illness, and the two more recently discovered SARS-CoV

52

(Peiris et al., 2003) and MERS-CoV (Zaki et al., 2012) viruses that arose from spillover events of

53

virus from animals into humans. It is expected that humans are naïve to SARS-CoV-2 and will

54

display a primary immune response to infection. Humoral immune responses will likely be

55

critical for the development of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, many novel

56

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from convalescent COVID-19 patients have been reported

57

(Cao et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2020b), which offer an

58

important resource to identify potential protective or therapeutic antibodies. However, a deeper

59

understanding of the B cell antigen receptors that are stimulated and specific to this acute

60

infection is needed to define the shared or distinct features of humoral responses elicited

61

compared to other viral infections, and to assess the extent to which responses to SARS-CoV-2

62

have breadth extending to other coronaviruses within the subgenus Sarbecovirus.

68

evolution, such as somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination during the

69

evolving humoral response (Zhou and Kleinstein, 2019). To study the development of SARS-

70

CoV-2-specific humoral responses, we collected a total of 38 longitudinal peripheral blood

71

specimens from 13 patients, sampled at a median of 3 time points (range 1-5) admitted to

72

Stanford Hospital with COVID-19 confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-

73

qPCR) testing. The times of blood sampling were measured as days post symptom onset

74

(DPSO). All patients exhibited SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA, IgG,

75

and IgM antibodies (Table 1). Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) repertoires were sequenced

76

and compared to a healthy human control (HHC) data set from 114 individuals (Nielsen et al.,

77

2019). An example of data from a HHC individual matched by mean sequencing depth of reads

78

and B cell clones across the COVID-19 cohort is shown in Figure 1 (top panel). In healthy

79

subjects at baseline, IgM and IgD sequences are primarily derived from naïve B cells with

80

unmutated IGHV genes, whereas class switched cells expressing IgA or IgG subtypes have

81

elevated SHM. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 seroconverted patients (blue labels in Figure 1), show a

82

highly polyclonal burst of B cell clones expressing IgG, and to a lesser extent IgA, with little to

83

no SHM. Longitudinal data from a patient prior to and after seroconversion shows an increase in

84

the proportion of class switched low SHM clones (bottom panels in Figure 1). Seronegative

85

samples (red labels in Figure 1) show IGH repertoires similar to uninfected HHC, suggesting an

86

earlier stage in the infection for these particular patients at these time points.

Figure 1. COVID-19 patient IGH repertoires show early and extensive class-switching to
IgG and IgA subclasses without significant somatic mutation. Points indicate B cell clonal
lineages, with the position denoting the clone’s isotype (panel column), human healthy control
(HHC) or patient ID (panel row), IGHV gene (x-axis, with IGHV gene in the same order and
position in panels, but not listed by name due to space constraints), and CDR-H3 length in amino
acids (AA) (y-axis within each panel). The point color indicates the median IGHV SHM
frequency for each clone and the size indicates the number of unique reads grouped into the
clone. Points are jittered to decrease over-plotting of clones with same IGHV gene and CDR-H3
length. Patient label colors indicate sample IgG seroconversion (blue) or seronegative (red) for
the displayed sample with the number following the patient ID corresponding to days post
symptom onset. The final four rows of panels show the IGH repertoire changes within a single
participant (7453) prior to and after seroconversion.

99

The increased fraction of unmutated and low mutation (<1% SHM in IGHV gene) clones among

100

the class switched IgG subclasses in seroconverted COVID-19 patients compared to HHC was

101

statistically significant (IgG1: p-value = 1.884e-08; IgG2: 1.554e-08; IgG3: 3.754e-08; IgG4:

102

0.00044) (Figures 2A and 2B). The detailed SHM frequencies and fractions of unmutated clones

103

of each sample are shown in Figure S1. While most B cells in COVID-19 patients prior to

104

seroconversion showed IgG SHM frequencies comparable to HHC, there is a rapid increase in

105

the proportion of IgG-expressing (IgG+) B cells with low SHM during the DPSO (Figure 2A,

106

lower panels). Notably, prior to seroconversion, B cells expressing a few IGHV genes,

107

particularly IGHV3-30-3 and IGHV1-2, showed earlier changes than the rest of the repertoire,

108

with increased IgG class switched low-SHM clones (Figures 2C and 2D). IGHV3-9 showed a

109

similar trend but was not significant (Figures 2C and 2D).

110

We previously observed a similar influx of low mutation clones into the IgG compartment in

111

acute Ebola virus (EBOV) infection (Davis et al., 2019), but in EBOV acute viral infection there

112

was a prolonged delay (lasting months) in accumulation of SHM in those clones. In contrast,

113

examination of clones detected at two or more time points show that after the initial appearance

114

of low-SHM clones, the COVID-19 patients show increases in the proportion of IgG+ B cells

115

with intermediate SHM frequencies (2-5%) within the first three weeks post-onset of symptoms

116

in the patients for whom the longest time courses were observed (patients 7453 and 7455, Figure

117

2B). Similarly, examination of the total clones within each isotype shows the appearance of low-

118

SHM clones post-seroconversion within the first two weeks post-onset of symptoms, and

119

subsequent increases in SHM over the following two weeks (Figure 2E). In further contrast to

120

EBOV, COVID-19 primary infection stimulated polyclonal B cell responses with both IgG and,

121

in some patients, IgA subclasses, rather than IgG alone (Figure 1). Overall, among IgG+ B cells

122

in COVID-19 patients, the proportion of IgG1+ cells was increased, with decreases in IgG2 and

123

IgG3, and median usage of IgG1 was 1.7-fold greater than that seen in HHC B cells (Table S1).

124

Comparison of the IGHV genes used by COVID-19 and HHC individuals (Figure S2) revealed

125

skewing of the responding IGH repertoires away from frequently utilized IGHV genes in HHC,

126

such as IGHV3-7, IGHV3-23, and IGHV5-51, and enrichment of IGHV1-24, IGHV3-9, IGHV3-

127

13, and IGHV3-20 in IgG+ B cells. The preferential selection of B cells using particular IGHV

128

genes has been observed in other antiviral responses, such as the preference for IGHV1-69 in

129

response to some influenza virus antigens (Avnir et al., 2016). Highly utilized IGHV genes in

130

IgG-seroconverted COVID-19 patients display low median SHM in IgG1-switched B cells

131

(range 2.4-7.5%), compared to higher median IgA1 SHM (range 5.8-9.5%) (Figure 2C).

132

In the SARS-CoV-2 stimulated B cell proliferations, high-frequency expanded clones detected in

133

two or more replicate IGH sequence libraries generated from separate aliquots of template

134

showed increased proportions of low-SHM members (Figures S3A and S3B, IgG1: p-value =

135

0.005, IgG2: 0.014, IgG3: 0.036). Expanded clones also had longer and more hydrophobic IGH

136

complementarity-determining region-3 (CDR-H3) sequences in the class switched isotypes

137

compared to HHC (Figure 2F), highlighting IGHV features selected in B cells responding to

138

SARS-Cov-2 infection and consistent with a rapid proliferation of cells recently differentiated

139

from naïve B cells (Grimsholm et al., 2020). CDR-H3 charge and aromaticity showed modest

140

differences in COVID-19 patients compared to HHC, including more negative charge in non-

141

expanded clones (Figure S3C). Notably, the relative IGHV gene usage frequencies in expanded

142

clones compared to non-expanded clones of COVID-19 patients showed a different pattern than

143

overall IGHV gene usage, with IGHV1-24, IGHV3-13, and IGHV3-20 frequencies that were

144

increased in the total repertoire but used less often in expanded clones, suggesting that the B

145

cells expressing these IGHV genes are highly polyclonal with small clone sizes. Eleven IGHV

146

genes were significantly enriched in expanded clones versus non-expanded clones (Figure S3D)

147

suggesting preferential recruitment of B cells and viral epitope binding by IGH using these

148

germline IGHV segments.

177

Convergent antibody rearrangements are elicited in COVID-19 patients

178

Despite the diversity of antigen-driven antibody responses, we and others have previously

179

identified patterns of highly similar, “convergent” antibodies shared by different individuals in

180

response to pathogens such as EBOV (Davis et al., 2019) or Dengue virus (Parameswaran et al.,

181

2013). Such convergent antibodies make up a small proportion of the total virus-specific B cell

182

response in each individual (Davis et al., 2019). To identify putative SARS-CoV-2-specific

183

antibody signatures, we analyzed clones with shared IGHV, IGHJ, and CDR-H3 region length,

184

and clustered the CDR-H3 sequences at 85% amino acid identity using CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012),

185

to find clusters spanning two or more COVID-19 patients and absent from the 114 HHC

186

individuals. 1,236 convergent clusters met these criteria and showed SHM frequencies averaging

187

1.7% (range 0.5% to 5.5%). An average of 196 convergent clusters were found per patient,

188

ranging from 69 clusters in patient 7485 to 477 clusters in patient 7455. 1,171 clusters were

189

shared pairwise between two patients, 53 clusters spanned three patients, nine clusters spanned

190

four patients, and three clusters spanned five patients (Figure 3A). To assess the significance of

191

these shared convergent clones in COVID-19 patients, we undertook an analysis of 13 randomly

192

selected HHCs with the same parameters and 100 permutations. The number of convergent

193

clones shared by COVID-19 patients greatly exceeded the mean convergent clone counts from

194

the HHC subsampling (Figure 3B), consistent with antigen-driven shared selection of the

195

convergent clones identified in COVID-19 patients. To directly test the antigen specificity of

196

these convergent clones, we expressed human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs 2A and 4A,

197

Table S2) belonging to two COVID-19 convergent antibody groups identified in two patients

198

from whom paired immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences were obtained from single

199

B cells using the 10x Genomics platform. mAb2A had a single nonsynonymous mutation in the

200

CDR-H2 of IGHV3-30-3 and mAb4A was fully germline and used IGHV3-15. In ELISA testing,

201

both mAbs bound the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and spike S1 domain, but not the RBD (Figure

202

3C), establishing their antigen specificity. We further validated the robustness of detection of

203

convergent clonotypes in the COVID-19 patients, and the wide distribution of these antibody

204

types in different individuals, by identifying ten SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD-specific sequence

205

clusters shared with independent external COVID-19 patient data sets (Cao et al., 2020; Noy-

206

Porat et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Nine of the thirteen COVID-19 patients (69%) in our study

207

(7450, 7452, 7454, 7455, 7480, 7483, 7484, 7485, and 7486) showed these RBD-specific

208

clonotypes, highlighting the high frequency of these shared antibodies (Figure 3D and Figure

209

S4). Notably, RBD-specific antibodies are primary candidates for virus neutralizing, potentially

210

protective antibodies in recovered patients (Ju et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020a).

211

We hypothesized that in addition to sharing common RBD-binding antibody types, some

212

COVID-19 patients might also demonstrate breadth in their antibody responses and recognize

213

antigens from the distinct but related sarbecovirus, SARS-CoV that was responsible for SARS.

214

Comparison of COVID-19 patient IGH sequences to published SARS patient IGH data revealed

215

convergent SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies in two COVID-19 patients, 7453 and 7455

216

(Coughlin et al., 2007; Pinto et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020a) (Figures 3E-3G). None of these

217

SARS-CoV-specific convergent IGH sequences were detected in the 114 HHC. To evaluate

218

whether such in silico IGH sequence comparisons could predict the serological responses of

219

patients, we tested the plasma samples from our 13 COVID-19 patients in ELISA assays with

220

SARS-CoV RBD antigen and detected cross-reactivity in five of the 13 patients (Figure 3H).

221

Strikingly, the two patients with the highest ELISA OD450 values were those who had

222

demonstrated convergent IGH sequences specific for SARS-CoV RBD. The three additional

223

COVID-19 patients who were seropositive for SARS-CoV RBD antibodies had convergent IGH

224

sequences to SARS-CoV-2 in their repertoires, suggesting that the presence of these convergent

225

antibodies could be a marker of more extensive or broadly-reactive humoral immune responses

226

in patients.

DISCUSSION

262

In these initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding human antibody responses to

263

SARS-CoV-2 has become a global priority. Our results provide several key findings that may

264

lend some support for vaccine strategies currently under development and suggest that

265

individuals convalescent from SARS-CoV-2 infection may be, at least for some time, protected

266

against reinfection by commonly-elicited RBD-specific antibodies. The IGH repertoires of

267

patients with diagnostically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 reveal robust polyclonal responses with

268

early class switching to IgG, and to a lesser extent, IgA isotypes, and evidence of accumulating

269

SHM in responding clones within the first month after onset of symptoms, rather than the

270

delayed SHM seen in Ebola patients (Davis et al., 2019). We note that the current COVID-19

271

study and prior analysis of EBOV infection are among very few published studies of human IGH

272

repertoire longitudinal responses to primary infections; examples from acute infection with

273

Dengue virus (Appanna et al., 2016; Godoy-Lozano et al., 2016) or H5N6 avian influenza virus

274

(Peng et al., 2019), have either had few patients with true primary infection, or did not analyze

275

SHM development in responding B cells.

276
277

Nine of thirteen COVID-19 patients (69%) demonstrated convergent antibodies specific for the

278

viral RBD, a major target for potentially neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

279

serum antibodies are reported to be present in 67-90% of patients post-infection, depending on

280

the severity of disease, neutralization assay and threshold for positive results (Robbiani et al.,

281

2020b; Suthar et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). It seems reasonable to predict that vaccines based

282

on spike or RBD antigens will also stimulate B cells expressing these common antibody types in

283

a significant fraction of the human population. The response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a

284

subset of patients also contained B cell clones expressing convergent IGH to previously

285

described SARS-CoV RBD antibodies; strikingly, the patients with these SARS-CoV-2/SARS-

286

CoV clonotypes also had the highest SARS-CoV RBD binding serum antibody IgG levels. This

287

association suggests that it may become possible to predict the fine specificity of human

288

serological responses from IGH sequence data, as the number of documented antigen-specific

289

clonotypes in public databases increases. This example also highlights the possibility that

290

common modes of human antibody response may enable some breadth of protection or humoral

291

memory against other sarbecoviruses in the future. Longitudinal tracking of IGH repertoires in

292

larger patient cohorts, further investigation into the binding properties, functional activity and

293

serum antibody levels produced by convergent responding clones in patients, and assessment of

294

clinical outcomes under conditions of exposure to infection will be important next steps toward

295

determining the immunological correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND SUBJECT DETAILS

341

Patients admitted to Stanford Hospital with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and confirmed

342

SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs were recruited. Venipuncture

343

blood samples were collected in K2EDTA- or sodium heparin-coated vacutainers for peripheral

344

blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation or serology on plasma, respectively. Recruitment of

345

COVID-19 patients, documentation of informed consent, collections of blood samples, and

346

experimental measurements were carried out with Institutional Review Board approval (IRB-

347

55689). The data set containing healthy adult control immunoglobulin receptor repertoires has

348

been described previously (Nielsen et al., 2019). In summary, healthy adults with no signs or

349

symptoms of acute illness or disease were recruited as volunteer blood donors at the Stanford

350

Blood Center. Pathogen diagnostics were performed for CMV, HIV, HCV, HBV, West Nile

METHOD DETAILS

355

Molecular and serological testing on COVID-19 patient samples

356

SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients was confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain

357

reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens, using the protocols described in (Corman et

358

al., 2020; Hogan et al., 2020). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on a

359

protocol described in (Stadlbauer et al., 2020) was performed to detect anti-SARS-CoV and anti-

360

SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD antibodies in plasma samples from COVID-19 patients. Briefly, 96-well

361

high binding plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike

362

RBD protein (0.1 µg per well) overnight at 4°C. After blocking plates with 3% non-fat milk in

363

PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, plasma samples were incubated at a dilution of 1:100 and bound

364

antibodies were detected with goat anti-human IgM/HRP (Sigma: cat. A6907, 1:6’000 dilution),

365

goat anti-human IgG/HRP (Thermo Fisher: cat. 62-8420, 1:6’000 dilution), or rabbit anti-human

366

IgA/HRP (Dako: cat. P0216, 1:5’000 dilution). Assays were developed by addition of 3,3',5,5'-

367

Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution. After stopping the reaction with 0.16 M sulfuric

368

acid, the optical density (OD) at 450 nanometers was read using an EMax Plus microplate reader

369

(Molecular Devices). The cut-off value for seroconversion was calculated as OD450 = 0.2 for the

370

anti-SARS-CoV IgG assay and as OD450 = 0.3 for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA assays

371

after analyzing SARS-CoV-2 pre-pandemic negative control samples from healthy blood donors.

373

HTS of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) libraries prepared from genomic DNA and

374

cDNA

375

The AllPrep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen) was used to extract genomic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA

376

from PBMCs. For each blood sample, six independent gDNA library PCRs were set up using

377

100 ng template/library (25ng/library for 7453-D0). Multiplexed primers to IGHJ and the FR1 or

378

FR2 framework regions (3 FR1 and 3 FR2 libraries), per the BIOMED-2 design were used (van

379

Dongen et al., 2003) with additional sequence representing the first part of the Illumina linkers.

380

In addition, for each sample, total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript III

381

RT (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers (Promega). Total RNA yield varied between

382

patients and between 6 ng-100 ng was used for each of the isotype PCRs using IGHV FR1

383

primers based on the BIOMED-2 design (van Dongen et al., 2003) and isotype specific primers

384

located in the first exon of the constant region for each isotype category (IgM, IgD, IgE, IgA,

385

IgG). Primers contain additional sequence representing the first part of the Illumina linkers. The

386

different isotypes were amplified in separate reaction tubes. Eight-nucleotide barcode sequences

387

were included in the primers to indicate sample (isotype and gDNA libraries) and replicate

388

identity (gDNA libraries). Four randomized bases were included upstream of the barcodes on the

389

IGHJ primer (gDNA libraries) and constant region primer (isotype libraries) for Illumina

390

clustering. PCR was carried out with AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) following the

391

manufacturer's instructions, and used a program of: 95°C 7 min; 35 cycles of 94°C 30 sec, 58°C

392

45 sec, 72°C 60 sec; and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. A second round of PCR using

393

Qiagen’s Multiplex PCR Kit was performed to complete the Illumina sequencing adapters at the

5’ and 3’ ends of amplicons; cycling conditions were: 95°C 15 min; 12 cycles of 95°C 30 sec,

395

60°C 45 sec, 72°C 60 sec; and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Products were subsequently

396

pooled, gel purified (Qiagen), and quantified with the Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). Samples

397

were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (PE300) using 600 cycle kits.

398
399

Sequence quality assessment, filtering, and analysis

400

Paired-end reads were merged using FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011), demultiplexed (100%

401

barcode match), and primer trimmed. The V, D, and J gene segments and V-D (N1), and D-J

402

(N2) junctions were identified using the IgBLAST alignment program (Ye et al., 2013). Quality

403

filtering of sequences included keeping only productive reads with a CDR-H3 region, and

404

minimum V-gene alignment score of 200. Sample cDNA or gDNA libraries with poor read

405

coverage were excluded from further analysis (Table 1). For cDNA-templated IGH reads,

406

isotypes and subclasses were called by exact matching to the constant region gene sequence

407

upstream from the primer. Clonal identities within each subject were inferred using single-

408

linkage clustering and the following definition: same IGHV and IGHJ usage (disregarding allele

409

call), equal CDR-H3 length, and minimum 90% CDR-H3 nucleotide identity. A total of

410

1,259,882 clones (per sample, mean number of clones: 33,154; median number of clones:

411

18,503) were identified. A total of 24,888,790 IGH sequences amplified from cDNA were

412

analyzed for the COVID-19 subjects (mean: 754,205 per sample; median: 650,812) and

413

68,831,446 sequences from healthy adult controls (mean: 603,785 per individual; median:

414

637,269). Each COVID-19 patient had on average 372,304 in-frame gDNA sequences and each

415

adult control had an average of 8,402 in-frame gDNA sequences.

417

For each clone, the median somatic mutation frequency of reads was calculated. Mean mutation

418

frequencies for all clonal lineages from a sample for each isotype were calculated from the

419

median mutation frequency within each clone, and so represent the mean of the median values.

420

Clones with <1% mutation were defined as unmutated and clones with ≥ 1% were defined as

421

being mutated. Subclass fractions were determined for each subject by dividing the number of

422

clones for a given subclass by the total number of clones for that isotype category. Expanded

423

clones within each sample were defined as clones that were present in two or more of the gDNA

424

replicate libraries. Clonal expansion in the isotype data was inferred from the gDNA data.

425

Analyses were conducted in R (Team, 2017) using base packages for statistical analysis and the

426

ggplot2 package for graphics (Wickham, 2016).

427
428

To determine convergent rearranged IGH among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we

429

clustered heavy-chain sequences annotated with the same IGHV and IGHJ segment (not

430

considering alleles) and the same CDR-H3 length were clustered based on 85% CDR-H3 amino

431

acid sequence similarity using CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012). To exclude IGH that are generally

432

shared between humans and to enrich the SARS-CoV-2-specific IGH that are likely shared

433

among the patients, clusters were selected as informative if (1) they contained at least five IGH

434

sequences from each COVID-19 patient and were present in at least two subjects; (2) no IGH

435

sequences from HHC samples (collected prior to the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak) were

436

identified in the same convergent cluster. The same selection criteria were used to determine the

437

convergent clusters between the COVID-19 samples and previously reported IGH sequences

438

specific to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Convergent IGH sequences between the deeply

443

Single-cell immunoglobulin libraries were prepared using the 10x Single Cell Immune Profiling

444

Solution Kit (v1.1 Chemistry), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were

445

washed once with PBS + 0.04% BSA. Following reverse transcription and cell barcoding in

446

droplets, emulsions were broken and cDNA purified using Dynabeads MyOne SILANE followed

447

by PCR amplification (98°C for 45 sec; 15 cycles of 98°C for 20 sec, 67°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1

448

min; 72°C for 1 min). For targeted Ig library construction, 2 µL of amplified cDNA was used for

449

target enrichment by PCR (Human B cell primer sets 1 and 2: 98°C for 45 sec; 6 and 8 cycles of

450

98°C for 20 sec, 67°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 1 min). Following Ig enrichment, up

451

to 50 ng of enriched PCR product was fragmented and end-repaired, size selected with SPRIselect

452

beads, PCR amplified with sample indexing primers (98°C for 45 sec; 9 cycles of 98°C for 20 sec,

453

54°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 20 sec; 72°C for 1 min), and size selected with SPRIselect beads.

454

Targeted single-cell Ig libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq to a minimum sequencing

455

depth of 5,000 reads/cell using the read lengths 26bp Read1, 8bp i7 Index, 91bp Read2 and reads

456

were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome and consensus Ig annotation was performed using

457

cellranger vdj (10x Genomics, version 3.1.0).

Identification of convergent IGH sequences for mAb expression

460

IGH sequences from single cells with paired productive heavy and light chains were searched

461

against COVID-19 patient bulk IGH repertoires to identify convergent sequences according to

the following criteria: utilization of the same IGHV and IGHJ genes; same CDR-H3 lengths; and

463

CDR-H3 amino acid sequences that were within a Hamming distance cutoff of 15% of the length

464

of the CDR-H3. Two native heavy and light chain pairs, designated mAb2A and mAb4A, which

465

were found in convergent clusters characterized by low- to mid-SHM frequencies and included

466

at least one class-switched member, were selected for cloning and expression.

467
468

mAb cloning

469

Paired heavy and light chain sequences from 10x single cell RNA-seq datasets were synthesized

470

by IDT as gBlocks encoding full-length heavy and light chain V(D)J regions. gBlocks were

471

resuspended at 50 ng/µL and amplified with AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) following the

472

manufacturer's instructions, using a program of: 95°C 7 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C

473

for 45 sec, 72°C for 60 sec; and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Products were gel purified

474

(Qiagen) and cloned as in-frame fusions to human IgG1, IgK or IgL constant regions into the

475

pYD7 vector (National Research Council (NRC), Canada) using Gibson Assembly Master Mix

476

(NEB) for 45 minutes at 50°C. Assembled constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing.

477
478

mAb expression and purification

479

Constructs were transiently transfected in HEK293-EBNA1-6E cells (NRC) at a density of 1.2-

480

1.6 million cells/mL using 25 kDa linear polyethylenimine (PEI) at a 3:1 PEI:DNA ratio in

481

OptiMEM reduced serum medium (Gibco), with a heavy chain: light chain ratio of 1:1. Cells

482

were maintained in Freestyle 293 Expression Medium (Gibco) and were supplemented with

483

0.5% tryptone 24-36 hours after transfection. Cell supernatants were harvested after 96 hours and

484

filtered through 0.45-µM filters (Millipore). Antibodies were purified via HiTrap Protein A HP

columns (GE Healthcare) run at a flow rate of 0.5-1 mL/min on Äkta Start protein purification

486

system (GE Healthcare). Antibodies were eluted using 0.1M glycine pH 2, dialyzed with 3

487

changes of PBS pH 7.4 using Slide-A-Lyzer-G2 10K dialysis cassettes (Thermo Fisher), and

488

concentrated using 30,000 kDa molecular weight cutoff polyethersulfone membrane spin

489

columns (Pierce). Final concentrations of purified antibodies were quantified with Nanodrop

490

2000 (Thermo Fisher).

491
492

ELISA testing of mAbs

493

ELISA conditions for mAbs were as described for COVID-19 plasma samples with the

494

following modifications: two-fold serial dilutions of mAbs were tested, starting at 100 µg/mL for

495

intra-COVID-19 convergent antibodies or peanut-specific negative mAb controls, or at 0.506

496

µg/mL for mAb CR3022; plates were coated overnight with RBD (0.1 µg per well), S1 (0.1 µg

497

per well), or spike protein (0.3 µg per well); and bound mAbs were detected with rabbit anti-

498

human IgG gamma chain-specific/HRP (Agilent: cat. P0214, 1:15,000 dilution).
