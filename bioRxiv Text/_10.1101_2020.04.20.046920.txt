Abstract
Motivation
Coronaviridae are a family of positivesense RNA viruses capable of infecting
humans and animals.
These viruses
usually cause a mild to moderate upper
respiratory tract infection, however, they
can also cause more severe symptoms,
gastrointestinal and central nervous
system diseases.
These viruses are
capable of flexibly adapting to new
environments, hence health threats from
coronavirus are constant and long-term.
Immunogenic spike proteins are glycoproteins found on the surface of
Coronaviridae particles that mediate entry
to host cells. The aim of this study was to
train deep learning neural networks to
produce
simulated
spike
protein
sequences, which may be able to aid in
knowledge and/or vaccine design by
creating
alternative
possible
spike
sequences that could arise from zoonotic
sources in future.
Results
Here we have trained deep learning
recurrent neural networks (RNN) to provide
computer-simulated coronavirus spike
protein sequences in the style of previously
known sequences and examine their
characteristics. Training used a dataset of
alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus
spike sequences. In a test set of 100
simulated sequences, all 100 had most
significant BLAST matches to Spike
proteins in searches against NCBI nonredundant dataset (NR) and also possessed
concomitant Pfam domain matches.

Conclusions
Simulated sequences from the neural
network may be able to guide us in future
with prospective targets for vaccine
discovery in advance of a potential novel
zoonosis. We may effectively be able to
fast-forward through evolution using
neural networks to investigate sequences
that could arise.
Introduction
1.1
Coronaviridae
Coronaviridae are a family of large,
enveloped single-stranded positive-sense
RNA viruses encompassing alpha, beta,
gamma and delta coronavirus divisions1 as
well as unclassified divisions in the
sequence databases. The genome is
packed inside a helical capsid and is further
surrounded by an envelope. The spike
protein forms large protrusions from the
virus surface, giving the coronaviruses the
appearance of wearing a ‘crown’ under
electron microscopy. Coronaviruses have
the ability to infect a wide range of
different animals and usually cause mild to
moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses,
however they can also cause severe
respiratory
infections
as
well
as
gastrointestinal and central nervous
system diseases. Coronaviruses circulate
among humans and animals such as bats,
pigs, camels, and cats1. Recent zoonoses
include SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV),
which emerged in November 2002 and
became effectively extinct by 20042–5.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERSCoV) was believed to be transmitted from
an animal reservoir in camels in 20126. In
veterinary terms, CoV such as porcine
epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV)

causes an extremely high fatality rate in
piglets7. SARS-CoV-2 emerged from China
in 20198,9 and was declared a pandemic
during the first quarter of 2020 with an
extremely high requirement for a vaccine
to be provided in a short timeframe. Spike
protein is a multifunctional viral protein
found on the outside of the virus particle.
It initially binds a host cell receptor though
its S1 subunit and fuses viral and host
membranes through its S2 subunit.
In
addition to mediating entry, the spike is a
critical determinant of viral host range and
a major inducer of host immune
responses10. Due to the key role of the S
protein, it is the main target for antibodymediated neutralization11.
1.2
A brief history of Artificial
Intelligence and Deep Learning
Artificial intelligence, based on the
assumption that the process of human
thought can be mechanized was first
conceived as an academic discipline in
1956 following Turing’s landmark paper in
195012. Deep learning (DL) is a subset of
Artificial Intelligence that employs deep
neural networks requiring the use of a
training set and are modelled on the
circuitry in the human brain. DL has its
roots in Rosenblatt’s Perceptron neural
network of 1957-196013. DL algorithms
use multiple layers to progressively extract
higher level features from raw input. Many
different architectures of neural network
exist, and for the most part are involved in
applications with image recognition. Some
recent uses of DL include self-driving cars
and robots; with creative projects using DL
to compose music, create novel art from
different styles of art and write ‘fake news’.
The recent advent of much increased
processing power and availability in the
shape of graphical processing units (GPUs),
and CUDA architecture from Nvidia, have
paved the way for a renewed interest in
machine learning and DL algorithms.

1.3

Recurrent Neural Network
The recurrent neural network (RNN)
is a type of neural network usually used for
text encoding implementations, mainly
through whole word encoding and the bag
of words concept.
Whilst character
encoding has been used on occasion this is
less often used and is less well supported
by software libraries, potentially due to
higher memory requirements.
The
recurrent neural network (RNN)14, is
trained on a set of sequences using an
optimization algorithm with estimations of
gradient
descent
combined
with
backpropagation through time. The RNN
has the potential to consider previously
seen data such as the character or word
that came before the current time step
using units such as long short-term
memory cells15 (LSTM) or gated recurrent
units16 (GRU).
1.4 Current and upcoming uses for DL
in medicine and health care
Recently, uses for DL have been
described in health care, particularly in
screening for breast cancer17,18 and for use
with electrocardiogram (ECG) traces19,20.
Potential novel antibiotics were searched
out by screening known drug databases for
structures21. The strength of this approach
lies in that these drugs already have
significant results and may have clinical
trial data. In 2007, Hochreiter, Heusel and
Obermayer proposed the use of LSTM for
protein homology detection15, commenting
that LSTM is capable of automatically
extracting local and global sequence
statistics like hydrophobicity, polarity,
volume and polarizability and combining
them with a pattern.
Common bioinformatic techniques involve
searching and identifying matches and
differences both at small and larger scale
and clustering sequences.
Hochreiter,
Heusel
and
Obermayer
specifically
identified the following features during the
use of RNNs which would not be otherwise
identified
using
other
common
bioinformatic techniques.

(i) extraction of dependencies between
subsequences. A subsequence AB, e.g.
may only be indicative if it is followed
later by the subsequence CD
(ii) extraction of correlations within
subsequences. Both
AB and CD subsequences may be
indicative for the class (motif [AC]–
[BD]), however, AD may not be
indicative for the class (AD is
a negative pattern)
(iii) extraction of global sequence
characteristics (hydrophobicity or
atomic weight)
and
(iv) extraction of dependencies between
amino acids which range over a long
interval in the amino acid sequence.
Methods
2.1 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Architecture
In creating the model described in this
study, character encoding was used on the
sequences in the training set. Alternative
model architectures were considered and
trialled, however, the most successful was
composed of a single embedding layer and
a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with 1024
RNN units followed by a dense linear layer.
The model was trained in Tensorflow
2.1.022 with Keras23 using an Adam
optimizer24 with AMSgrad25 option and
adaptive learning rate over 15 epochs,
where losses fell gradually from an initial
3.259 to 0.266. Python 3.5 and above is
required. Figures 1 and 3 were generated
in R 3.5.1 (‘Feather Spray’)26 with ggplot227
libraries and the Wes Anderson colour
palette.
2.2 Coronavirus training set
A training dataset was formulated
from a wide variety of coronavirus spike
protein sequences from alpha, beta,
gamma and delta coronaviruses and
constituted isolates from many different

animals. The dataset was downloaded
from NCBI Genbank on 19th March 2020,
prior to any very large release of newly
sequenced beta-coronaviruses from SARSCoV-2, which at the time of writing are
destined for later release and stored at
Gisaid.org. The total number of spike
protein sequences in the final training
dataset was 2406, encompassing 511
sequences from Human CoV including
examples of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS as well
as SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19), 232 Bovine, 194
Noctilionine (Bat), 106 Porcine and several
samples from other animals including
camel, Chinese ferret-badger, hedgehog,
dog, deer, avian and whale. Downloaded
sequences were searched and cleaned to
remove poorer quality and partial
sequences and subunits.
Results
3.1 Training dataset manipulation
Newer sequences of SARS-CoV-2
were not included in the training dataset in
the belief that the high number of these
closely-related beta coronavirus (CoV)
sequences could cause bias in the training
dataset.
Initial processing involved
generating a file of 4424729 sequences of
15-mer Kmer windows (overlapping
sequences shifted by one amino acid at a
time). This is a recognised strategy to help
with longer sequences. However, the
length of the Kmer was later raised to 100
to improve results and thereafter
generated on the fly.
Preliminary investigations on this dataset
trained an RNN for hundreds of epochs on
GPU with one-hot encoding and with deep
LSTM cells. However, a model with a
cleaner dataset, a GRU and character
indexing proved more successful and
relevant in providing simulated sequences.
Characteristics of the sequences are
examined below.

Amino Acid

Figure 1. Boxplot graph showing the amino acid composition of each amino acid as a fraction of the protein
sequence in both the real dataset (red) and the synthesized dataset (blue). The line in the box represents the
median. The amino acid single letter code is shown on the X axis with the fraction of the amino acid in each
sequence on the y axis as calculated by Biopython ProtParam module. The ‘Real’ dataset comprised 2406
sequences in total whilst the ‘Synth’ simulated example dataset was a sample of 100 sequences.

These downstream sequences were used
to investigate the possibility of creating
simulated new spike protein sequences
that could potentially arise as a chance
zoonosis event in future.
3.2
Characteristics of DL simulated
Spike proteins.
To create predictions, the RNN is
initially given a short seed protein
sequence. The seed sequence can be
passed as a random choice from previously
sequenced spike proteins or formulated of
random choices of amino acids starting
with Methionine chosen by the python
random library. In this study, the RNN was
then able to provide sequences up to the
full length of spike protein, a maximum
length in the input dataset of 1582 amino
acids with a mean length of 1324.4 amino
acids. The maximum sequence identity
that a simulated sequence achieved in
BLAST matches against the training set

was 100% sequence identity over 875
amino acids with a temperature scaling
value of 1.0 (see below for details) or
100% identity over the full length of the
protein with a temperature scaling value of
0.5. The lengths of all the synthesized
proteins were fixed at 1588 amino acids.
A dataset of 100 DL synthesised spike
protein sequences was collected for
preliminary investigations. The RNN was
initially provided with seed sequences of 16
amino acids chosen at random from the full
dataset of spike proteins. The amino acid
complement of the real and synthesized
spike proteins in the datasets is as
compared below in Figure 1. Although the
amino acid complements show some
differences, it is clear that there are
significant similarities across the two
datasets.
The simulated sequences
generated for this figure are provided with
the model and source code (as described
below).

total the identities were 940/1065 (88%) and positives
were 1003/1065 (94%). The complete alignment is
shown in Supplementary Data 1 (S1).

The real spike protein training dataset was
clustered and deduplicated using cd-hit
with default parameters resulting in 154
clusters. The 100 simulated sequences
were searched with BLASTP against the
representative cluster sequences. Figure
3A shows that the best BLAST hits for the
first set of simulated sequences covered
several distinct clusters.
There were
several hits to MERS clusters, possibly due
to a high representation of MERS in the
training set.
Figure 3B shows the
equivalent BLAST hits on the second set of
100 simulated sequences that each had an
identical seed text of 64 amino acids from

as Bat SARS-like sequences, although

Synthesized protein

BLAST searches of DL synthesized sequences against a clustered version of the Spike protein
sequence training set.
3A shows BLAST searches of the original 100 DL synthesized sequences filtered for matches by length over 200bp
and identity over 90%. 3B shows the second set of DL synthesized sequences which were all given identical feeder
sequence of 64 amino acids from the start of SARS-CoV-2. This graph is filtered for matches by length over 500
bp and identity over 90%. Highest length matches are represented by the largest diameter circle and most red
colour. However, large circles are generally of interest since the identity cut-off is high. Unfiltered data is presented
in Supplementary Figure 1.

This compared favourably with the most
commonly found domains within the real
training dataset of 2504 proteins which had
1781 domains of Spike_rec_bind, 2413
Corona_S2, 1052 Spike_NTD and 502
Corona_S1 (Coronavirus S1 glycoprotein
domain) among others. According to Pfam
architectures30, domain Corona_S2 is found
in real spike proteins in the databases with
either
Corona_S1,
Spike_NTD
and
Spike_rec_bind, just Spike_rec_bind, with
Spike_NTD and 2 x Spike_rec_bind and in
some sequences as a standalone domain.
3.33 Prediction temperature
parameter
During prediction, probabilities are
generated for the next character in the
sequence of the amino acid single letter
alphabet. A parameter known as the

‘temperature’ of 0.5 produces more similar
sequences by scaling the resultant
probabilities of the multinomial distribution,
for example the model was able to reach
100% identity over the full length of Spike
SARS glycoprotein at a temperature of 0.5
with the only differences being in the seed
text. The purpose of this study is to
provide sequences that are not identical to
known sequences hence we may find
better use of a higher temperature value.
A second dataset sample of 100
synthesized sequences was formed by
specifically using a seed text of 64 amino
acids from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
for each simulated sequence.
When
simulated sequences were clustered with
cd-hit31 at the default 90% level of identity,
the dataset provided 51 separate clusters

in which Cluster 0 had 27 members ranging
from 92% - 100% identity which
corresponded to SARS-CoV-1 type, Cluster
1 had 13 members of 97-100% identity
which corresponded to Bat RaTG13/SARSCoV-2 type, Cluster 38 had 3 members
corresponding to MERS type, Clusters 2, 8
and 8 each had two members, each
example of the rest of the dataset clustered
separately. Therefore, the seed text
provided SARS-like hits in several but not
all cases.
Once the initial predicted protein is
finished, the prediction commences a new
protein again immediately if the maximum
number of characters has not been
reached. Therefore, in some cases there
were hybrid matches to parts of sequence
from spike proteins in the dataset.
Some sequences were definitively of
interest to this study, such as a synthesized
protein with 97% full length identity to a
Bat beta-coronavirus sequence isolated
from Chaerephon plicata in Yunnan in
201132. Further sequences of interest
included those with high identity over
stretches of the protein sequence to SARSCoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2, particularly those
including hybrid regions. This dataset is
provided with the model and source (as
described below).
With the study of the most relevant
sequences of 2020, SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2 in mind, a much larger dataset of
1000 simulated sequences was generated
with the same SARS-CoV seed text as
previously. These simulated sequences
were clustered with cd-hit and clusters
corresponding to SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2 were aligned together with
examples of the real spike proteins from
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Alignments
were sliced in Biopython to remove extra
sequences at the ends and the seed text at
the start. The resulting multiple sequence
alignment is shown in Supplementary
Figure 2. This alignment indicates that
residues important in human ACE2
recognition33 are broadly conserved across
the simulated sequences.

Conclusions
This study used a comprehensive training
set formulated from Coronavirus Spike
protein sequences in the sequence
databases for DL neural networks to
produce novel sequence from a short
feeder seed text. The novel sequences
share features that can be searched with
bioinformatics tools to bring out highly
significant BLAST matches and Pfam
domain matches. That each of the
sequences examined had BLAST and Pfam
matches to Spike protein is exciting and
warrants further consideration.
Interestingly, in an example of a very
accurate alignment, the prediction query
was able to fill in a blank amino acid (G)
where one was called as X in the real
sequence that exactly matched other
sequences of that type. It is to be noted
that the generation of very large numbers
of these synthesized sequences from the
trained data is trivial and many thousands
can be further generated and examined
from the model
(model & source code available at:
https://github.com/LCrossman).
It is
hoped that the simulated sequences may
have the potential to aid in forthcoming
vaccine searches effectively by allowing a
peek into a fast-forward of evolution to see
what sequences may possibly arise in
future. However, it is to be noted that the
training set is only as comprehensive as the
initial database, animal CoV sequences
may exist elsewhere that are not present in
our database. Additionally, biases may
exist, for example, the training set is
overrepresented in MERS sequences and
these are also heavily represented in the
random simulated sequences. In some
cases the resultant protein may not
represent a viable protein (there could be
stability or other issues). One additional
potential issue could be that the premise is
difficult to test.

Nonetheless, the potential production of
novel sequence by DL is exciting and
warrants further consideration.
