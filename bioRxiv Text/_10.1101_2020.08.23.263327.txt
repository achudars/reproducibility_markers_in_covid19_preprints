Abstract

22

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute

23

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although a preliminary

24

understanding of the replication and transcription mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has

25

recently emerged, their regulation remains unclear.

26

Results: Based on reanalysis of public data, we propose a negative feedback model to

27

explain the regulation of replication and transcription in—but not limited

28

to—SARS-CoV-2. The key step leading to new discoveries was the identification of

29

the cleavage sites of nsp15—an RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, encoded by

30

CoVs. According to this model, nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs

31

(sgRNAs) and genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by cleaving transcription regulatory

32

sequences in the body. The expression level of nsp15 determines the relative

33

proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs, which in turn change the expression level of

34

nps15 to reach equilibrium between the replication and transcription of CoVs.

35

Conclusions: The replication and transcription of CoVs are regulated by a negative

36

feedback mechanism that influences the persistence of CoVs in hosts. Our findings

37

enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, and

38

provide new clues for future studies. One important clue is that nsp15 may be an

39

important and ideal target for the development of drugs (e.g. uridine derivatives)

40

against CoVs.

Introduction

47

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory

48

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As enveloped viruses composed of a

49

positive-sense, single-stranded RNAs, CoVs have the largest genomes (26–32 kb)

50

among all RNA virus families. SARS-CoV-2 has a genome of ∼30 kb [1]. In addition

51

to ORF1a and 1b (Figure 1A), the SARS-CoV-2 genome has sequences encoding

52

four conserved structural proteins [spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane

53

protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N)] and six accessory proteins (ORF3a, 6, 7a,

54

7b, 8, and 10) that are yet to be experimentally verified.

The elements used to represent the SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) were originally

61

The genomic RNA, as a positive-sense RNA [gRNA(+)], is used as a template

62

for the translation of ORF1a and ORF1b, and the replication and transcription of the

63

SARS-CoV-2 genome. Recently, the translation of 10 other proteins (S, E, M, N,

64

ORF3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 10) of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in a study [2] that

used in the previous study [2]. A. TRS-L: transcription regulatory sequence in the body; TRS-B:
transcription regulatory sequence in the leader. B. gRNA(+):genomic RNAs; gRNAs(-): antisense
genomic RNAs.

65

directly validates the prevailing “leader-to-body fusion” model using Nanopore

66

RNA-seq—a direct RNA sequencing method [3]. In the model validated in that study

67

(Figure 1A), replication and transcription require gRNA(+) as the template for the

68

synthesis of antisense genomic RNAs [gRNAs(-)] and antisense subgenomic RNAs

69

[sgRNAs(-)] by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). When RdRP pauses, as it

70

crosses a body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-B) and switches the template

71

to the leader TRS (TRS-L), sgRNAs(-) are formed. Otherwise, RdRP reads gRNAs(+)

72

continuously, without interruption, resulting in gRNAs(-). Thereafter, gRNAs(-) and

73

sgRNAs(-) are used as templates to synthesize gRNAs(+) and sgRNAs(+),

74

respectively; sgRNAs(+) are used as templates for the translation of the 10 proteins

75

mentioned above.

76

TRS-L usually forms the first 60–70 nts of the 5' UTR in a CoV genome. TRS-B

77

with varied length is located immediately upstream of ORFs except ORF1a and 1b

78

(Figure 1A). During antisense-strand synthesis, the discontinuous transcription

79

(referred to as polymerase jumping or template switching) by RdRP is described by

80

the “leader-to-body fusion” model that is conserved in the entire nidovirus order,

81

including arteriviruses, toroviruses, roniviruses and animal coronaviruses. Although

82

investigation was conducted to determine the underlying mechanisms in previous

83

studies [4], the molecular basis remain unknown. In the present study, we aimed to

84

determine the molecular basis of the “leader-body fusion” model and construct a

85

model to explain the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription.

Results

88

Reanalysis of leader-body junction regions

89

Using public Nanopore RNA-seq data (Materials and Methods), 575,106 out of

90

879,679 reads from a SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cell sample were aligned to the

91

SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. Among all aligned reads, 575,106 sense reads

92

represented gRNAs(+) or sgRNAs(+), while 30 antisense reads represented gRNAs(-)

93

or sgRNAs(-). This exceedingly high ratio (575,106 vs. 30) between sense and

94

antisense reads may be the result of significant differences between the

95

gRNAs(+)/sgRNAs(+) and gRNAs(-)/sgRNAs(-) degradation efficiencies. This

96

phenomenon, however, was not reported in the previous study [2]. Another

97

explanation for the high ratio is that gRNAs(+)/sgRNAs(+) are protected by binding

98

to the N proteins. Another super high ratio (198,198,542 vs. 11,820,438) between

99

contiguous and junction-spanning reads was reported in that previous study [2]. This

100

suggested that there were significant differences between gRNAs(+)/gRNAs(-) and

101

sgRNAs(+)/sgRNAs(-).

102

By reanalysis of junction-spanning reads, we found that TRS-Bs share ~12 nt

103

junction regions with TRS-Ls in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1A). Most junction regions in

104

eight protein-coding genes (S, E, M, N, ORF3a, 6, 7a and 8) exhibit high similarity to

105

those of TRS-Ls and are defined as canonical junction regions [2]. Accordingly, the

106

sgRNAs(+) and sgRNAs(-) containing these canonical junction regions are defined as

107

canonical sgRNAs(+) and sgRNAs(-), respectively. The junction regions of ORF7b

108

exhibit high diversity in their sequences. Whether junction regions exist in ORF10

109

remains unclear [2]. Our analysis of canonical junction regions determined their core

110

sequence (CS) of SARS-CoV-2 to be ACGAAC (Figure 1A).

111
112

Further investigation of“leader-to-body fusion” model

113

Further analysis of betacoronavirus subgroup B (Materials and Methods)

114

showed that ACGAAC is a highly conserved sequence among their genomes,

115

particularly in their putative TRS-Bs. This suggests that canonical junction regions

116

contain a specific motif for enzyme reorganization. Since all CoVs and even viruses

117

in the entire nidovirus order adhere to the “leader-to-body fusion” model [2], this or

118

these enzymes should be encoded by the ORF1a or 1b gene, given their likelihood to

119

be translated. After analysing 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1–16) encoded by the

120

ORF1a or 1b genes, we determined that nsp15 (a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.263327; this version posted August 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

121

endoribonuclease, NendoU [5]) is most likely to function in these junction regions,

122

given that a homolog of nsp15 has cleavage sites containing “GU” [6]. Thus, the

123

cleavage site of nsp15 was identified to follow the motif “GTTCGT|N” (the vertical

124

line indicates the breakpoint and N indicates any nucleotide base), read in the

125

antisense strands of CoV genomes. Furthermore, we found that almost all the genomic

126

sites containing the motif “GTTCGT” have polyT (not less than three T) at the tail,

127

which ensures the presence of at least one U for nsp5 cleavage.

The motifs (in the first column) were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3)

135

Upon searching for “GTTCGT” in the genomes of betacoronavirus subgroup B,

136

the occurrence of “GTTCGT” on the antisense strand was found to be more than 1.6

137

times that on the sense strand. In particular, “GTTCGT” occurred 3 and 9 times

138

(Table 1) on the sense and antisense strands of the SARS-CoV-2 genome,

139

respectively. These findings suggest that the basic function of nsp15 involves the

140

degradation of gRNAs and gsRNAs and that the high ratio between sense and

141

antisense reads (see above) results from substantially more cleavage of

using positions (in the second column) of the first nucleotides. ACGAAC indicated the motif
GTTCGT, read on the antisense strand of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The third column shows the
regions influenced by the motifs (in the first column). * this site is located in the CDS of RdRP
(nsp12). TRS-L: transcription regulatory sequence in the body; TRS-B: transcription regulatory
sequence in the leader; ICS: internal cleavage site; RdRP: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

142

gRNAs(-)/gsRNAs(-) than that of gRNAs(+)/gsRNAs(+). Among the three sites

143

containing “GTTCGT” on the sense strand of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (referred to

144

as internal cleavage sites—ICSs), one is located in the coding sequence (CDS) of

145

RdRP (nsp12), while the other two are located in the ORF8 gene (see below).

146

These two ICSs are also located in ORF8 of most SARS-CoV-2, SARS2-like

147

CoV and SARS-like CoV genomes; however, they are absent in the genomes of

148

SARS-CoVs obtained from humans (GenBank: AY274119 and AY278489) and

149

SARS-like CoV genomes from civets (GenBank: AY304486, AY515512 and

150

AY572034). One of the two ICSs is present in the genome of the SARS-like CoV

151

strain WIV1 from bats (GenBank: KF367457), which is the ancestor of SARS-CoV.

152

Deletions of ORF8 were reported to be associated with attenuation of SARS-CoV

153

(GenBank: AY274119) [8] and SARS-CoV-2 [10]. The ORF8 gene of SARS-CoV is

154

considered to have played a significant role in adaptation to human hosts following

155

interspecies transmission [7] via the modification of viral replication [8]. The loss of

156

two nsp15 ICSs in ORF8 of SARS-CoV is the key clue revealing the functions of

157

ORF8 and the pandemic of SARS-CoV.

158

Based on the above analyses, we modified the “leader-body fusion” model and

159

proposed the molecular basis of it. In our model, nsp15 cleaves synthesized gRNAs(-)

160

and sgRNAs(-). The cleavage occurs at TRS-Bs(-) synthesized using TRS-Bs as

161

templates. Next, the free 3' ends (~6 nts) of TRS-Bs(-) hybridize the junction regions

162

of TRS-Ls for template switching. Alternatively, the cleaved TRS-Ls(-) are used as

163

templates to synthesize TRS-Ls that then hybridize the junction regions of the cleaved

164

sgRNAs(-) without TRS-Ls(-) for template switching and gRNAs(+)/sgRNAs(+)

165

synthesis. These findings suggests that RdRP (nsp12) is so active that it must have a

166

very high enzyme activity.

167

Some non-canonical sgRNAs(+) and sgRNAs(-) are synthesized as a result of

168

occasional hybridization between the free 3' ends of TRS-Bs(-) and highly similar

169

sequences of TRS-L junction regions. The sgRNAs(-) without TRS-Ls are also

170

synthesized due to missing hybrids. In the previous study [2], sgRNAs(-) without

171

TRS-Ls, non-canonical sgRNAs(+) and sgRNAs(-) were reported, supporting our

172

model. Furthermore, cleavage also occurs at ICSs on the sense strands, after which the

173

free 3' ends of the cleaved 5' ends hybridize the antisense strands to synthesize

174

recombinant sgRNAs(+) or even gRNAs(+). This may also contributes to the multiple

175

recombination events in betacoronavirus genomes.

176
177

Proposal of a negative feedback model

178

Based on the above analyses, we proposed a negative feedback model (Figure

179

1B) to explain the regulation of replication and transcription in—but not limited

180

to—CoVs. In this model (Figure 1), nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic

181

RNAs (sgRNAs) or genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by the cleavage of TRS-Bs(-). The

182

expression level of nsp15 determines the relative proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs.

183

An increase in nsp15 expression results in less gRNAs(-) and more gsRNAs(-), after

184

which fewer gRNAs(+) and more gsRNAs(+) are synthesized, respectively. A

185

decrease in gRNAs(+) results in a decrease of nsp15 expression, given that nsp15 is

186

synthesized using gRNA(+) as the template. Furthermore, the nsp15 ICS in the CDS

187

of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 (Table 1) enhances the negative feedback. Via this negative

188

feedback mechanism, CoVs reach equilibrium between the replication and

189

transcription (Figure 1B); thus, this mechanism is important for the persistence of

190

CoVs in hosts.

191

Our negative feedback model is based on the determination of the molecular

192

basis of the “leader-body fusion” model. This molecular basis is associated to the

193

cleavage function of nsp15, which is different from other models proposed in the

194

previous studies [4], mainly due to the integration of information from many aspects,

195

particularly considering: (1) The direct RNA sequencing data [2]; (2) The nsp15

196

structure in complex with GpU (pdb code: 6X1B); (3) the polyT at the tail of

197

“GTTCGT”; and (4) the nsp15 ICSs in ORF8 (see above). These discoveries

198

confirmed the identification of the cleavage sites of nsp15. However, they were not

199

used to construct the models in the previous studies [4].

200
201

The necessity of negative feedback regulation

202

In our previous study [7], we proposed that first hairpins (immediately upstream

203

of ORF1a) have an important role in the functions (e.g. regulation of translational

204

initiation) of ribosome binding sites (RBSs) in 5' UTRs of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

205

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have an identical first hairpin, which may enhance the

206

translation of downstream genes. To indirectly prove that negative feedback is a basic

207

mechanism, we designed preliminary experiments to show that first hairpins from

208

SARS-CoV-2 enhance the translation of the downstream enhanced green fluorescent

209

proteins (EGFPs); however, over-expression of EGFP without negative feedback

210

regulation will cause cell death.

hairpin from Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Two other types of plasmids pSARS and pCoV-ba were
proceeded by replacement of first hairpins from SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronavirus subgroup A,
respectively (Materials and Methods). B. HEK293 cells were transfected with three types of plasmids.
At each time after transfection, cell viability and cell death were meausured using MTT and LDH,
respectively.

219

In total, three types of plasmids containing EGFP reporter genes—named

220

pEGFP-C1, pSARS, and pCoV-ba (betacoronavirus subgroup A)—were used in the

221

experiments (Figure 2A). The plasmid pEGFP-C1 was used as a control, given that it

222

contains 17-nt sequences, encoding the first hairpin from Cytomegalovirus (CMV).

223

Two types of plasmids proceeded by 30- and 29-nt inserts were used to evaluate their

224

influence on translation (Materials and Methods). These two inserts encoded the two

225

first hairpins from SARS-CoV-2 and the subgroup A of betacoronaviruses,

226

respectively. Comparing the fluorescent brightness of cells transfected with three

227

types of plasmids, the expression of EGFP in pSARS was markedly higher than that

228

in pEGFP-C1 and pCoV-ba (Supplementary 1). Moreover, pSARS caused cell death

229

at

230

3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium

231

lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) experiments to further evaluate the influence of plasmid

232

transfection (Materials and Methods). Both MTT and LDH experiments consistently

233

suggested that pSARS caused significantly more HEK293T and Hela cell death at 48

234

hours after plasmid transfection, than pEGFP-C1 and pCoV-ba. However, this

235

phenomenon appeared in HEK293 cells at 56 hours after plasmid transfection (Figure

236

2B). Given that the only difference among the three types of plasmids is their 17-, 30-,

237

and 29-nt sequences encoding different hairpins, we concluded that these hairpins

238

determined the translation efficiency of the downstream EGFPs. The hairpin in

239

pSARS resulted in the over-expression of EGFP, which caused more cell death. To

240

determine whether the factor acts at the translation level and to rule out other possible

241

factors that may exert influence at the replication or transcription level, we performed

242

the following experiments: (1) using HEK293 cells to rule out the possible influence

243

by the differences of plasmid copy numbers, since all three types of plasmids

244

containing the SV40 origins can be replicated to a copy number of between 400~1000

245

plasmids per cell within HEK293T; and (2) using qPCR to rule out the possible

246

influence by differential transcription (Supplementary 1).

Conclusion and Discussion

249

In the present study, we determined the molecular basis of the “leader-body

250

fusion” model and constructed a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of

251

SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription. The key step that led us to new

252

discoveries was our identification of the cleavage sites of nsp15, an RNA

253

uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU). Our model does not rule out other

254

RNAs or proteins involved in these two models. However, current studies involving

255

NendoU remain contradictory in terms of their findings regarding fundamental

256

questions [5]: (1) NendoU is conserved among coronaviruses, arteriviruses and

257

toroviruses, is it present in nonvertebrate-infecting representatives of the nidoviruses

258

order? (2) is nsp15 indispensable in viral replication and living? (3) is nsp15

259

responsible for protein interference with the innate immune response? and (4) does

260

nsp15 degrade viral RNA to hide it from host defences? Nsp15 cleavage sites in

261

relevant genes provide new clues to answer these questions.

262

The Kozak consensus sequence GCCACCAUGG (Figure 1B) is not necessary

263

for protein translation in eukaryotes. The hairpins immediately upstream of ORF1a

264

(first hairpins) play an important role in the functions of CoV RBSs. Hairpin with

265

proper structures may enhance the translation of their downstream proteins. These

266

findings can be used to design vaccine, drug and expression vectors. Based on our

267

preliminary experiments, we concluded that the hairpin in pSARS resulted in the

268

over-expression of EGFP, which caused cell death. These facts supported that the

269

negative feedback is necessary to prevent the over-expression of viral genes.

270

Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and

271

its regulation, and provide new clues for future studies. The template switching ability

272

and the high ratio between contiguous and junction-spanning reads indicated that

273

RdRP (nsp12) has a very high enzyme activity. Relatively few junction-spanning

274

reads indicated that nsp15 does not have a high enzyme activity. This suggested that

275

nsp15 may be an important and ideal target for the development of drugs against

276

CoVs. The most recent nsp15 structure in complex with GpU (PDB: 6X1B) shows

277

that the uridine in GpU binds to the active site of nsp15. Thus, uridine derivatives,

278

such as Trifluridine, Tipiracil, Tegafur, Carmofur, Furtulon, etc, are potential

279

inhibitors of this enzyme.

Materials and Methods

282

1,265 genome sequences of betacoronaviruses were downloaded from the NCBI

283

GenBank database in our previous study [8]. Nanopore RNA-seq data was

284

downloaded from the website (https://osf.io/8f6n9/files/) for the reanalysis of

285

leader-body junction regions. The results were confirmed using Illumina RNA-seq

286

data from the NCBI SRA database under the accession number SRP251618. Data

287

cleaning and quality control were performed using Fastq_clean [9]. Statistics and

288

plotting were conducted using the software R v2.15.3 with the package ggplot2 [10].

289

The 5' and 3' ends of gRNAs(+) and sgRNAs(+) were observed and double-checked

290

using the software Tablet v1.15.09.01 [11].

291

In the present study, three types of plasmids pEGFP-C1 (maintained in the lab of

292

Hao Zhou), pSARS and pCoV-ba, and three types (Hela, HEK293 and HEK293T) of

293

cell maintained in our lab were used for transfection. To construct pSARS, pEGFP-C1

294

was PCR amplified, using primers fVR and rRBS2 (Supplementary 1). Then the

295

linear PCR product was self-ligated into a plasmid by homologous recombination

296

technology using ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme Biotech, China).

297

Following the same procedure, primers fVR and rRBS3 (Supplementary 1) were

298

used to construct pCoV-ba. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle

299

Medium (DMEM) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For each

300

experiment, 100,000 cells were seeded into one well of a 6-well plate for plasmid

301

transfection. After 12 hours (0 hour in figure 2B), transfection of 1 μg of plasmid into

302

one well was performed using 3 μL PolyJet (SignaGen Laboratories, USA), following

303

the manufacturer’s instructions. The medium was changed at 12 hours after plasmid

304

transfection. MTT (200 μl, 5 mg/ml) and 1.8 ml medium was added to each well and

305

cultured at 37 °C for 4 h. Then, the cells in each well were removed of medium,

306

washed with PBS, then mixed with 1000 μl DMSO to dissolve the formazan product.

307

Finally, formazan absorbance was measured by a microplate reader with a wavelength

308

of 492 nm (Thermo Labsystems Helsinki, Finland). LDH experiments were

309

performed using LDH cytotoxicity assay detection kit (Beyotime, China), following

310

the manufacturer’s instructions.
