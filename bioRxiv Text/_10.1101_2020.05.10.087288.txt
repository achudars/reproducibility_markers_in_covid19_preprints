ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an
unprecedented global pandemic demanding the urgent development of therapeutic
strategies. Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS)
oligosaccharide library showed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of
SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal
ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds
with much higher affinity to heparin (KD = 55 nM) compared to the RBD (KD = 1 µM)
alone. We also found that heparin does not interfere in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) binding or proteolytic processing of the spike. Our data supports a model in which
HS functions as the point of initial attachment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tissue staining
studies using biologically relevant tissues indicate that heparan sulfate proteoglycan
(HSPG) is a critical attachment factor for the virus. Collectively, our results highlight the
potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
binding to target cells.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demands urgent development of therapeutic strategies. An
attractive approach is to interfere in the attachment of the virus to the host cell.1 The entry
of SARS-CoV-2 into cells is initiated by binding of the transmembrane spike (S)
glycoprotein of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the host.2 SARSCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and employs the same receptor.3 The spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2 is comprised of two subunits; S1 is responsible for binding to the host
receptor, whereas S2 promotes membrane fusion. The C terminal domain (CTD) of S1
harbors the receptor binding domain (RBD).4 It is known that the spike protein of a number
of human coronaviruses can bind to a secondary receptor, or co-receptor, to facilitate cell
entry. For example, MERS-CoV employs sialic acid as co-receptor along with its main
receptor DPP4.5 Human CoV-NL63, which also utilizes ACE2 as the receptor, uses
heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, as a co-receptor.6 It has also been shown that entry of
SARS-CoV pseudo-typed virus into Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells can substantially be
inhibited by heparin or treatment with heparin lyases, indicating the importance of HS for
infectivity.7
There are indications that the SARS-CoV-2 spike also interacts with HS. One early
report showed that heparin can induce a conformation change in the RBD of SARS-CoV2.8 A combined SPR and computational study indicated that glycosaminoglycans can bind
to the proteolytic cleavage site of the S1 and S2 protein.9-10 Several reports have indicated
that heparin or related structures can inhibit the infection process of SARS-CoV-2 in
different cell lines.11-14
HS are highly complex O- and N-sulfated polysaccharides that reside as major
components on the cell surface and extracellular matrix of all eukaryotic cells.15 Various
proteins interact with HS thereby regulating many biological and disease processes,
including cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. They are also used
by many viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), Dengue virus, HIV, and various
coronaviruses, as receptor or co-receptor.16-18
The biosynthesis of HS is highly regulated and the length, degree, and pattern of
sulfation of HS can differ substantially between different cell types. The so-called “HS
sulfate code hypothesis” is based on the notion that the expression of specific HS epitopes

by cells makes it possible to recruit specific HS-binding proteins, thereby controlling a
multitude of biological processes.19-20 In support of this hypothesis, several studies have
shown that HS binding proteins exhibit preferences for specific HS oligosaccharide
motifs.21-22 Therefore, we were compelled to investigate whether the spike of SARS-CoV2 recognizes specific HS motifs. Such insight is expected to pave the way to develop
inhibitors of viral cell binding and entry.
Previously, we prepared an unprecedented library of structurally well-defined heparan
sulfate oligosaccharides that differ in chain length, backbone composition and sulfation
pattern.23-24 This collection of HS oligosaccharides was used to develop a glycan
microarray for the systematic analysis of selectivity of HS-binding proteins. Using this
microarray platform in conjugation with detailed binding studies, we found that the RBD
domain of SARS-CoV-2-spike can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner,
and the observations support a model in which the RBD confers sequence selectivity, and
the affinity of binding is enhanced by additional interactions with other HS binding sites
in for example the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site.9 In addition, it was found that heparin
does not interfere in ACE binding or proteolytic processing of the spike. Tissue staining
studies using biologically relevant tissues indicate that heparan sulfate proteoglycans
(HSPG) is a critical attachment factor for the virus.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Surface plasma resonances (SPR) experiments were performed to probe whether the
RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can bind with heparin. Biotinylated heparin
was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip and binding experiments were
carried out by employing as analytes different concentrations of RBD, monomeric spike
protein and trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2 (S1+S2, extra cellular domain, amino acid residue 1-1213) was expressed in insect cells
having a C-terminal His-tag.25-26 Recombinant SARS-CoV-2-RBD, containing amino acid
residue 319-541, was expressed in HEK293 cells also with a C-terminal His-tag.25-26 The
spike protein trimer, having the furin cleavage site deleted and bearing with two stabilizing
mutations, was expressed in HEK293 cells with a C-terminal His-tag. Representative

and (C) spike trimer.

The RBD domain binds to heparin with a moderate affinity having a KD value of ~1
µM. The full-length monomeric spike protein showed a much higher binding affinity with
a KD value of 55 nM. Previously reported computational studies have indicated that the
RBD domain may harbor an additional HS binding domain located either within or adjacent
to the receptor binding motif.14, 27 It has also been suggested that another HS-binding site

reside in the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site of the spike of the S2 domain.9 Thus, the high
affinity of the monomeric spike protein probably is due to the presence of additional
binding site in the spike protein, which greatly enhanced its binding to heparin. The
trimeric spike protein displayed a similar binding affinity (KD = 64 nM) as the monomer.
One of the putative heparin binding sites in the trimeric spike protein, the S1/S2 proteolytic
cleavage site was mutated.25 Thus, a possible increase in avidity due to multivalency may
have been off-set by a lack of a secondary binding site.
Intrigued by these results, we examined if the SARS-CoV-2 proteins bind to heparan
sulfate in a sequence preferred manner. We have developed an HS microarray having well
over 100 unique di-, tetra-, hexa-, and octa-saccharides differing in backbone composition
and sulfation pattern23-24 (Fig. 2C). The synthetic HS oligosaccharides contains an
anomeric aminopentyl linker allowing printing on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-active
glass slides. The HS oligosaccharides were printed at 100 µM concentration in replicates
of 6 by non-contact piezoelectric printing. The quality of the HS microarray was validated
using various well characterized HS-binding proteins.
Sub-arrays were incubated with different concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and
spike protein in a binding buffer (pH 7.4, 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM
MgCl2 with 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing
and drying, the subarrays were exposed to an anti-His antibody labeled with AlexaFluor®
647 for another hour, washed, dried and binding was detected by fluorescent scanning.
To analyze the data, the compounds were arranged according to increasing backbone
length, and within each group by increasing numbers of sulfates. Intriguingly, the proteins
showed a strong preference for specific HS oligosaccharides (Fig. 2A, B). Furthermore, it
was found that the RBD, monomeric spike protein, and trimeric spike protein exhibit
similar binding patterns (Fig. S1). Compounds showing strong responsiveness (76, 77, 78,
and 80) are composed of tri-sulfated repeating units (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S). The binding is
length-dependent and HS oligosaccharide 80 (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S)4 and 78 (IdoA2SGlcNS6S)3 having four and three repeating units, respectively, showed the strongest
binding. On the other hand, tetrasaccharide 56 (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S)2, which has the same
repeating unit structure, gave very low responsiveness. A similar observation was made for
disaccharide 4 (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S).

The structure-binding data shows that perturbations in the backbone or sulfation pattern
led to substantial reductions in binding. The importance of the IdoA2S residue is
highlighted by comparing hexasaccharides 78 with 76 in which a single IdoA2S in the
distal disaccharide repeating unit is replaced with GlcA. This modification leads to a
substantial reduction in responsiveness. Further replacements of IdoA2S with GlcA in
compound 76 completely abolish binding, as evident for compounds 69, 67, and 61. The
structure-activity data also showed that the 2-O-sulfates are crucial, and binding was lost
when such functionalities were not present (76 vs. 70, 68, and 64). Lack of one or more 6O-sulfates also resulted in substantial reductions in binding (76 vs. 71 and 65). Although
the SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD showed similar selectivities, the binding of the spike
appeared stronger and much higher fluorescent readings were observed at the same protein
concentration.
Next, we examined whether HS oligosaccharide 80 can interfere in the interaction of
the spike or RBD with immobilized heparin. Thus, the spike protein (150 nM) or RBD (2.4
µM) were pre-mixed with different concentrations of compound 80 and then used as
analytes. The IC50 values were determined by non-linear fitting of Log(inhibitor) vs.
response using variable slope (Fig. S2). The IC50 values for the spike protein and RBD are
38 nM and 264 nM, respectively.
To further determine the possible role of HS in the infection process, we examined the
binding affinities of spike proteins to ACE2 and compared these with binding affinities for
heparin. Biotinylated ACE2 was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip and
binding experiments were performed with different concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2
derived proteins. Representative sensorgrams for the RBD domain, monomeric spike
protein, and trimeric spike protein are shown in Fig. 3. KD values of 3.6 nM, 24.5 nM and
0.7 nM were determined using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, respectively, which are in
agreement with reported data.28 It shows convincingly that the RBD domain has a much

A number of reports have indicated that heparin and related compounds can block
infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we were compelled to investigate the
molecular mechanisms by which heparin blocks viral entry.2, 10, 13 It is possible that the
anti-viral properties of heparin are due to binding to the RBD domain thereby blocking the
interaction with ACE2. Alternatively, heparin may interfere in the proteolytic processing
of the spike protein thereby preventing membrane fusion. In this respect, the spike of
SARS-CoV-2 contains a unique furin cleavage site, which is not present in other CoV’s,
and has been proposed to contribute to high infectivity,29 because cleavage of the spike
protein is a prerequisite for membrane fusion. Modeling studies have indicated that the
furin cleavage site may harbor a binding site for HS.27 Finally, HS may function as an
attachment factor and the addition of exogenous heparin may interfere in this process.
To examine whether heparin can interfere in binding of the spike to ACE2, we
performed microarray experiments in which biotinylated Fc tagged ACE2 (50 µg/mL) was
printed onto streptavidin coated microarray slides. The printing quality was confirmed by
using a goat-anti-human Fc antibody conjugated with AlexaFluoro®647 (Fig. S3A). Next,
His-tagged RBD and monomeric spike protein were premixed with different
concentrations of heparin and binding of the proteins to immobilized ACE2 was
accomplished by anti-His antibody. Soluble human ACE2 was used as positive control.
Although, ACE2 efficiently inhibited RBD and spike binding (Fig. S3 B, C), no substantial
changes in binding were observed in the presence of 10 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL of heparin
(Fig. 4 A, B). Furthermore, we immobilized the RBD and monomeric spike proteins on
ELISA plates and assayed the binding of ACE2 to the spike proteins in the presence or
absence of heparin (Fig. 4 C, D). Soluble human ACE2 was used as a positive control,
which as expected exhibited potent inhibition. At 100 µg/mL of heparin, no inhibition of
binding was observed for either RBD or monomeric spike protein. These results indicate
that heparin does not substantially interfere in the interaction of the spike with ACE2.
To investigate whether the binding of heparin can hinder cleavage of the spike protein
by furin, we exposed the monomeric spike protein to furin in the presence of different
concentrations of heparin and examined protein cleavage by SDS-PAGE. The spike protein

binding of trimeric RBD to relevant tissues.30 Ferrets are a susceptible animal model for
SARS-CoV-231-32 and closely related minks are easily infected on farms.33 Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded lung tissue slides resemble the complex membrane structures to which
spike proteins need to bind before it can engage with ACE2 for cell entry. Expression of
ACE2 was assessed using an ACE2 antibody allowing us to compare the binding with the
SARS-CoV-RBD protein and binding localization and dependency on HS. The ACE2
antibody (Fig. 5A) and the RBD trimer bound efficiently to the ferret lung tissues (Fig.
5B). We also examined a commonly used heparan sulfate antibody, which bound
efficiently to ferret lung tissue, indicating the omnipresence of HS. After overnight
exposure to heparanase (HPSE), the ACE2 antibody staining was mostly unaffected,
indicating HSPG-independent binding. On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD trimer
was not able to engage with the ferret lung tissue slide after HPSE treatment. No staining
was observed with the heparin sulfate antibody (10E4), indicating all HS had been
removed. Thus, these results indicate that HS is required for initial cell attachment before
the spike can engage with ACE2.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The glycan microarray and SPR results indicate that the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind
HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner, and hexa- and octa-saccharides composed
of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units have been defined as optimal ligands. The data
supports a model in which the RBD of the spike confers sequence specificity and an
additional HS binding site in the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site9 enhances the avidity of
binding probably by non-specific interactions. In a BioRxiv preprint, we presented, for the
first time, experimental support for such a model and subsequent papers have confirmed
that the RBD harbors a HS binding site. Although IdoA2S-GlcNS6S sequons are
abundantly present in heparin, it is a minor component of HS.34 Interestingly, it has been
reported that the expression of the (GlcNS6S-IdoA2S)3 motif is highly regulated and plays
a crucial role in cell behavior and disease including endothelial cell activation.35 Severe
thrombosis in COVID-19 patients is associated with endothelial dysfunction36 and a
connection may exist between SARS-CoV-2’s ability to bind to HS and thrombotic
disorder. It is also possible that HS is a determinant of the cell- and tissue tropism.
A number of reports have shown that heparin and related products can block infection
by pseudotyped virus or authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus.12-14, 27 We explored the possibility
that binding of heparin blocks the RBD from interacting with ACE2. However, in two
experimental formats such properties were not observed. We found that the affinity of the
RBD for heparin is much lower than that for ACE2, providing a rationale for the inability
of heparin to inhibit the binding between RBD or spike with ACE2. One computational
study has indicated that ACE2 and HS bind to the same region of the RBD.27 Another
docking study located the HS binding site adjacent to the ACE2-binding site and inferred
a model in which a ternary complex is formed between RBD, HS and ACE2.14 Further
studies are required to determine the exact location of the HS binding site, which in turn
may provide a better understanding of the interplay between binding of spike with ACE2
and heparin.
We employed physiological relevant tissues to explore the importance of HS for SARSCoV-2 adhesion and demonstrated that HPSE treatment greatly reduces RBD binding but
not that of ACE2. The data supports a model in which HS functions as a host attachment
factor that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The current clinical guidelines call for the use of unfractionated heparin or low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the treatment of all COVID-19 patients for
systemic clotting in the absences of contradictions.37-38 Heparin treatment may have
additional benefits and may compete with the binding of the spike protein to cell surface
HS thereby preventing infectivity. Our data suggest that non-coagulating heparin or HS
preparations can be developed that reduce cell binding and infectivity without a risk of
causing bleeding. In this respect, administration of heparin requires great care because its
anticoagulant activity can result in excessive bleeding. Antithrombin III (AT-III), which
confers anticoagulant activity, binds a specific pentasaccharide GlcNAc(6S)-GlcAGlcNS(3S)(6S)-IdoA2S-GlcNS(6S) embedded in HS or heparin. Removal of the sulfate at
C-3 of N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS3S) of the pentasaccharide results in a 105-fold
reduction in binding affinity.39 Importantly, such a functionality is not present in the
identified HS ligand of SARS-CoV-2 spike, and therefore compounds can be developed
that can inhibit cell binding, but do not interact with ATIII. As a result, such preparations
can be used at higher doses without causing adverse side effects. Our data also shows that
multivalent interactions of the spike with HS results in high avidity of binding. This
observation provides opportunities to develop glycopolymers modified by HS
oligosaccharides as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 cell binding to prevent or treat COVID-19.
