Abstract

32

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic rages on with devasting consequences on human lives and the

33

global economy1,2.

34

antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus.

35

Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5

36

infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that

37

potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite

38

potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping

39

showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to

40

the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating

41

that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two

42

other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping

43

with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one

44

antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs

45

revealed recognition of the closed, “all RBD-down” conformation of the spike. Several of

46

these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential

47

therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Background

50

A novel coronavirus, now termed SARS-CoV-21,2, has caused over 11 million confirmed

51

infections globally, leading to over 500,000 deaths. This pandemic has also put much of the world

52

on pause, with unprecedented disruption of lives and unparalleled damage to the economy. A

53

return to some semblance of normalcy will depend on science to deliver an effective solution, and

54

the scientific community has responded admirably. Drug development is well underway, and

55

vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials. Another promising approach is the isolation of

56

SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that could be used as therapeutic or

57

prophylactic agents. The primary target for such antibodies is the viral spike, a trimeric protein3,4

58

that is responsible for binding to the ACE2 receptor on the host cell1,3,5,6. The spike protein is

59

comprised of two subunits. The S1 subunit has two major structural elements: RBD and NTD; the

60

S2 subunit mediates virus-cell membrane fusion after the RBD engages ACE2. Reports of

61

discovery of neutralizing mAbs that target the RBD have been published recently7-11. We now

62

describe our efforts in isolating and characterizing a collection of mAbs that not only target

63

multiple epitopes on the viral spike but also show exquisite potency in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2.

64
65

Patient Selection

66

Forty patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in a cohort study on

67

virus-neutralizing antibodies. Plasma samples from all subjects were first tested for neutralizing

68

activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Wuhan-Hu-1 spike pseudotyped with vesicular

69

stomatitis virus). Widely varying neutralizing titers were observed, with IC50 ranging from a

70

reciprocal plasma dilution of <100 to ~13,000 (Fig. 1a). Five patients were chosen for mAb

71

isolation because their plasma virus-neutralizing titers were among the highest. The clinical

72

characteristics of these 5 cases are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. All were severely ill

73

with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation.

Monoclonal Antibody Isolation and Construction

76

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from each patient were put through an experimental schema

77

(Extended Data Fig. 1a) starting with cell sorting by flow cytometry. The sorting strategy focused

78

on live memory B lymphocytes that were CD3-negative, CD19-positive, and CD27-positive

79

(Extended Data Fig. 1b). The final step focused on those cells that bound the SARS-CoV-2 spike

80

trimer (S trimer)4. A total of 602, 325, 14, 147, and 145 such B cells from Patient 1, Patient 2,

81

Patient 3, Patient 4, and Patient 5, respectively, were labelled with a unique hashtag (Extended

82

Data Fig. 1c). The cells were then placed into the 10X Chromium (10X Genomics) for single-cell

83

5’mRNA and V(D)J sequencing to obtain paired heavy (H) and light (L) chain sequences. A

84

careful bioinformatic analysis was carried out on 1,145 paired sequences to downselect “high-

85

confidence” antigen-specific mAbs. A total of 331 mAb sequences were recovered, representing

86

252 individual clones. Only 6 mAbs were from Patient 3, whereas 44 to 100 mAbs were identified

87

from each of the other patients (Extended Data Table 2).

88

antibodies (one per clone) were codon-optimized and synthesized, and each VH and VL gene was

89

then cloned into an expression plasmid with corresponding constant region of H chain and L chain

90

of human IgG1, and mAbs were expressed by co-transfection of paired full-length H chain and L

91

chain genes into Expi293 cells.

The VH and VL sequences of 252

Monoclonal Antibody Screening

94

All 252 transfection supernatants were screened for binding to S trimer and RBD by enzyme-

95

linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), as well as for neutralization against SARS-CoV-2

96

pseudovirus and live virus. These results are graphically represented in Fig. 1b and tabulated in

97

Extended Data Table 2. It was evident that a substantial percentage of the mAbs in the supernatants

98

bound S trimer, and a subset of those bound RBD. Specifically, 121 supernatants were scored as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.153486; this version posted July 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

99

positive for S trimer binding, yielding an overall hit rate of 48%. Of these, 38 were positive for

100

RBD binding while the remaining 83 were negative. None of the 13 trimer-specific mAbs from

101

Patient 5 recognized RBD. In the pseudovirus neutralization screen, 61 supernatants were scored

102

as positive, indicating that half of the trimer-specific mAbs were virus neutralizing. In the screen

103

for neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 (strain USA-WA1/2020), 41 supernatants were scored as

104

positive. Overall, this screening strategy was quite effective in picking up neutralizing mAbs

105

(vertical lines and labelled antibodies at the bottom of Fig. 1b) that were later identified as potent.

106
107

Sequence Analysis of S Trimer-Specific Monoclonal Antibodies

108

Of the 121 mAbs that bound S trimer, 88% were IgG isotype, with IgG1 being predominant

109

(Extended Data Fig. 2a). Comparison to the IgG repertoire of three healthy human donors12

110

revealed a statistically significant over-representation of IGHV3-30, IGKV3-20, and IGHJ6 genes

111

for this collection of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs (Extended Data Figs. 2b and 2c). A longer average

112

CDRH3 length was also noted (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Interestingly, the average percentages of

113

somatic hypermutation in VH and VL were 2.1 and 2.5, respectively, which were significantly

114

lower than those found in healthy individuals (Extended Data Fig. 2e) and remarkably close to

115

germline sequences.

116
117

Antigen Binding and Virus Neutralization

118

Since the screening for pseudovirus neutralization was performed quantitatively with serial

119

dilutions of the transfection supernatants, we plotted in Extended Data Fig. 3 the best-fit

120

neutralization curves for 130 samples that were positive in at least one of the screens shown in Fig.

121

1b. Most were non-neutralizing or weakly neutralizing, but 18 showed evidently better potency.

122

One additional supernatant was initially missed in the pseudovirus screen (Patient 1 in Extended

123

Data Fig. 3) but was later found to be a potent neutralizing mAb. Together, these 19 mAbs were

124

purified from transfection supernatants and further characterized for their binding and

125

neutralization properties. As shown in Fig. 2a, all but one (2-43) of the mAbs bound the S trimer

126

by a quantitative ELISA. Nine of the antibodies clearly bound RBD, with little or no binding to

127

NTD. Eight antibodies bound NTD to varying degrees, with no binding to RBD. Two mAbs

128

bound neither RBD nor NTD, and were therefore categorized as “Others”.

129
130

The pseudovirus neutralization profiles for these purified 19 mAbs are shown in the top portion of

131

Fig. 2b. The RBD-directed antibodies neutralized the pseudovirus with IC50 of 0.005 to 0.512

132

µg/mL; the NTD-directed antibodies were slightly less potent, with IC50 ranging from 0.013 to

133

0.767 µg/mL. A common feature of the NTD mAbs was the plateauing of virus neutralization at

134

levels short of 100%. Two antibodies, categorized as “Others”, neutralized with IC50 of 0.071 and

135

0.652 µg/mL.

136

WA1/2020) was carried out using Vero cells inoculated with a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. As

137

shown in the bottom portion of Fig. 2b, the RBD-directed antibodies again neutralized the virus

138

but with IC50 of 0.0007 to 0.209 µg/mL; the NTD-directed antibodies showed similar potency,

139

with IC50 ranging from 0.007 to 0.109 µg/mL. Here, the plateauing effect seen in the pseudovirus

140

neutralization assay was less apparent. Antibodies 2-43 and 2-51 neutralized the live virus with

141

IC50 of 0.003 and 0.007 µg/mL, respectively. Overall, nine mAbs exhibited exquisite potency in

142

neutralizing authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with IC50 of 0.009 µg/mL or less, including four

143

directed to RBD (2-15, 2-7, 1-57, and 1-20), three to NTD (2-17, 5-24, and 4-8), and two to

144

undetermined regions on the S trimer (2-43 and 2-51). It is remarkable that Patient 2 alone

145

contributed five of the top nine SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs. Correlation of the results of the

146

two virus-neutralizing assays is shown in Extended Data Fig. 4.

147
148

Epitope Mapping

149

All 19 potent neutralizing mAbs (Fig. 2) were further studied in antibody competition experiments

150

to gain insight into their epitopes. In addition, 12 mAbs that bound the S trimer strongly during

151

the initial supernatant screen were also chosen, including 5 that bound RBD (1-97, 2-26, 4-13, 4-

152

24, and 4-29) and 7 that did not bind RBD (1-21, 2-29, 4-15, 4-32, 4-33, 4-41, and 5-45). Four of

153

these mAbs were weak in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, and the remaining 8 were non-

154

neutralizing (Extended Data Fig. 5). First, a total of 16 non-RBD mAbs were evaluated for

155

competition in binding to S trimer by ELISA in a “checkerboard” experiment. The extent of the

156

antibody competition is reflected by the intensity of the heatmap shown in Fig. 3a. There is one

157

large cluster (A) of mAbs that competed with one another, and it partially overlaps a small cluster

158

(B). A third cluster (C) does not overlap at all. Note that all but one of the antibodies in cluster A

159

recognized NTD. Antibody 2-51 is clearly directed to the NTD region even though it could not

160

bind NTD. Moreover, one mAb each from clusters B and C also recognized NTD, thereby

161

indicating that all three clusters are within or near the NTD. One mAb, 1-21, appears to have a

162

unique non-overlapping epitope (epitope region D).

163
164

Second, a similar “checkerboard” competition experiment was carried out by ELISA for 14 of our

165

RBD-directed mAbs plus CR302213,14. Here, the heatmap shows that there are four epitope

166

clusters that are serially overlapping (Fig. 3a). There is one large cluster (E) that contains mAbs

167

largely capable of blocking ACE2 binding. Furthermore, 4 antibodies in this cluster lost binding

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.153486; this version posted July 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

168

to a mutant RBD (L455R, A475R, G502R) that could no longer bind ACE2 (our unpublished

169

findings). Taken together, these results suggest that most of the mAbs in cluster E are directed to

170

the ACE2-binding interface of RBD. The next cluster (F) connects to both cluster E and cluster

171

G, the location of which is defined by its member CR302215. Lastly, cluster G overlaps another

172

cluster (H), which includes 1-97 that strongly inhibited the binding of 2-30 to the S trimer. This

173

finding suggests that cluster H may be proximal to one edge of cluster E.

174
175

One potent neutralizing mAb, 2-43, did not bind S trimer by ELISA (Fig. 2a) and thus could not

176

be tested in the above competition experiments. However, 2-43 did strongly bind S trimer when

177

expressed on the cell surface as determined by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 6a), and this

178

binding was competed out by itself but not by RBD, NTD, ACE2, or the soluble S trimer4

179

(Extended Data Fig. 6b). NTD-directed mAbs had only a modest effect on its binding to cell-

180

surface S trimer, but numerous RBD-directed mAbs in cluster E potently blocked the binding of

181

2-43, demonstrating that this antibody is likely targeting a quaternary epitope on the top of RBD.

182
183

These mapping results could be represented by two sets of Venn diagrams shown in Fig. 3b. In

184

the non-RBD region, the potent neutralizing mAbs reside exclusively in cluster A and bind a patch

185

on the NTD. Weaker neutralizing mAbs recognize a region at the interface between clusters A

186

and B. In the RBD region, the most potent neutralizing mAbs also group together within one

187

cluster (E). Given that all block ACE2 binding, it is likely they recognize the top of RBD and

188

neutralize the virus by competitive inhibition of receptor binding. Cluster G contains CR3022, a

189

mAb known to be directed to an epitope on a cryptic site on the side of RBD when it is in the “up”

190

position15. Cluster F is therefore likely situated between the top and this “cryptic” site. The Venn

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.153486; this version posted July 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

191

diagram also suggests that cluster H may occupy a different side surface of RBD, perhaps in the

192

region recognized by S309, a mAb isolated from a SARS-CoV-1 patient8.

193
194

Cryo-Electron Microscopy

195

We produced cryo-EM reconstructions of Fabs from three mAbs in complex with the S trimer4.

196

First, single-particle analysis of the complex with 2-4 Fab (RBD-directed) yielded maps of high

197

quality (Fig. 4a; Extended Data Table 3; Extended Data Fig. 7), with the most abundant particle

198

class representing a 3-Fab-per-trimer complex, refined to an overall resolution of 3.2 Å. While

199

density for the constant portion of the Fabs was visible, it was blurred due to molecular motion,

200

and thus only the variable domains were included in the molecular model. Fab 2-4 bound the spike

201

protein near the apex, with all RBDs in the “down” orientation, and the structure of the antibody-

202

bound spike protein was highly similar to previously published unliganded spike structures in the

203

“all-down” conformation3,4. Detailed interactions between 2-4 and RBD are discussed and

204

exhibited in Extended Data Fig. 8. Overall, the structure of the 2-4 Fab-spike complex shows that

205

neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by this mAb likely results from locking RBD in the down

206

conformation while also occluding access to ACE2.

207
208

Second, we also produced 3D cryo-EM reconstructions of 4-8 Fab (NTD-directed) in complex

209

with the S trimer (Extended Data Table 3; Extended Data Fig. 9). Two main particle classes were

210

observed – one for a 3-Fab-bound complex with all RBDs “down” at 3.9 Å resolution (Fig. 4b),

211

and another a 3-Fab-bound complex with one RBD “up” at 4.0 Å resolution (Extended Data Fig.

212

10). However, molecular motion prevented visualization of the interaction at high resolution.

213

Nevertheless, the density in the 4-8 map reveals the overall positions of the antibody chains

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.153486; this version posted July 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

214

targeting NTD. Such binding to the tip of NTD results in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization remains

215

unclear.

216
217

Third, a 5.8 Å resolution reconstructions of 2-43 Fab in complex with the S trimer (Extended Data

218

Table 3; Extended Data Fig. 11) revealed three bound Fabs, each targeting a quaternary epitope

219

on the top of the spike that included elements of the RBDs from two adjacent S1 protomers (Fig.

220

4c), consistent with the epitope mapping results (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Fig. 3b), including

221

the lack of binding to isolated RBD (Fig. 2a). Given these findings, the inability of 2-43 to bind S

222

trimer by ELISA is likely an artifact of the assay format, as this mAb did bind the spike expressed

223

on the cell surface and in the cryo-EM study.

224
225

Armed with these three cryo-EM reconstructions, we used the Venn diagrams from Fig. 3b to map

226

the epitopes of many of our SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs onto the surface of the spike (Fig.

227

4d). This is obviously a rough approximation since antibody footprints are much larger than the

228

area occupied by the mAb number. However, the spatial relationship of the antibody epitopes

229

should be reasonably represented by Fig. 4d.

230
231

Protection of Hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 Infection by mAb 2-15

232

To assess the in vivo potency of mAb 2-15, we performed a protection experiment in a golden

233

Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The hamsters were first given an intraperitoneal

234

injection of the antibody at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg, or PBS alone. Intranasal inoculations

235

of 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the HKU-001a strain of SARS-CoV-2 were carried out 24

236

hours later. Four days after virus challenge, lung tissues were harvested to quantify the viral load.

237

As shown in Fig. 5, both viral RNA copy numbers and infectious virus titers were reduced by 4

238

logs or more in hamsters given the dose of 1.5 mg/kg of mAb 2-15. The protection at the dose of

239

0.3 mg/kg was borderline, as we had estimated. This pilot animal study demonstrates that the

240

potency of mAb 2-15 in vitro is indeed reflected in vivo, with complete elimination of infectious

241

SARS-CoV-2 at a relatively modest antibody dose.

242
243

Discussion

244

We have discovered a collection of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs that are not only potent but

245

also diverse. Nine of these antibodies can neutralize the authentic virus in vitro at concentrations

246

of 9 ng/mL or less (Fig. 2b), including 4 directed to RBD, 3 directed to NTD, and 2 to quaternary

247

epitopes nearby. Surprisingly, many of the these mAbs have V(D)J sequences close to germline

248

sequences, without extensive somatic hypermutations (Extended Data Fig. 2e), a finding that bodes

249

well for vaccine development. Our most potent RBD-specific mAbs (e.g., 2-15, 2-7, 1-57, and 1-

250

20) compare favorably with such antibodies recently reported7,8,10,16-20, including those with high

251

potency9,11,21,22. The in vitro potency of 2-15 is well reflected in vivo in the hamster protection

252

experiment (Fig. 5). It appears from the epitope mapping studies that mAbs directed to the top of

253

RBD strongly compete with ACE2 binding and potently neutralize the virus, whereas those

254

directed to the side surfaces of RBD do not compete with ACE2 and neutralize less potently (Figs.

255

3b and 4d). Our collection of non-RBD neutralizing mAbs is unprecedented in that such antibodies

256

only have been sporadically reported and only with substantially lower potencies22-24. The most

257

potent of these mAbs are directed to (e.g., 2-17, 5-24, and 4-8) or overlapping with (2-51) a patch

258

on the NTD (Figs. 3b and 4d). It is unclear how NTD-directed mAbs block SARS-CoV-2 infection

259

and why their neutralization profiles are different from those of RBD-directed antibodies (Fig. 2b).

260

Nevertheless, vaccine strategies that do not include NTD will be unable to induce an important

261

class of virus-neutralizing antibodies.

262
263

The isolation of two mAbs (2-43 and 2-51) directed to epitopes that do not map to RBD and NTD

264

is also unprecedented. Cryo-EM of 2-43 Fab bound to the S trimer has confirmed its epitope as

265

quaternary in nature, crossing from the top of one RBD to the top of another RBD (Fig. 4c). It

266

will be equally informative to understand the epitope of 2-51. In this study, we also show the first

267

evidence by cryo-EM for a neutralizing mAb (4-8) bound to the NTD of the viral spike (Fig. 4b),

268

as well as another high-resolution structure of a mAb (2-4) bound to RBD (Fig. 4a).

269
270

The potency and diversity of our SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs are likely attributable to patient

271

selection. Previously, we observed that infected individuals with severe disease developed a more

272

robust virus-neutralizing antibody response25. If Patient 2 had not been included, five of the top

273

neutralizing mAbs would be lost. The diversity of our antibodies is also attributable, in part, to

274

the choice of using the S trimer to sort from memory B cells, while most groups focused on the

275

use of RBD7,9-11,16-19,21. The characterization of this diverse collection of mAbs has allowed us to

276

observe that all potent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies described to date are directed to the

277

top of the viral spike. RBD and NTD are, no doubt, quite immunogenic. Neutralizing antibodies

278

to the stem region of the S trimer remain to be discovered. In conclusion, we believe several of

279

our monoclonal antibodies with exquisite virus-neutralizing activity are promising candidates for

280

development as modalities to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

385
386

Expression and Purification of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins

387

The mammalian expression vector that encodes the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer and

388

the vector encoding RBD fused with SD1 at the N-terminus and an HRV-3C protease cleavage

389

site followed by a mFc tag and an 8xHis tag at the C-terminus were kindly provided by Jason

390

McLellan4. SARS-CoV-2 NTD (aa1-290) with an HRV-3C protease cleavage site, a mFc tag, and

391

an 8xHis tag at the C-terminus was also cloned into mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. Each

392

expression vector was transiently transfected into Expi293 cells using 1 mg/mL of

393

polyethylenimine (Polysciences). Five days post transfection, the S trimer was purified using

394

Strep-Tactin XT Resin (Zymo Research), and the RBD-mFc and NTD-mFc were purified using

395

protein A agarose (ThermoFisher Scientific). In order to obtain RBD-SD1 and NTD, the mFc and

396

8xHis tags at the C-terminus were removed by HRV-3C protease (Millipore-Sigma) and then

397

purified using Ni-NTA resin (Invitrogen) followed by protein A agarose.

398
399

Sorting for S Trimer-Specific B cells and Single-Cell BCR Sequencing

400

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five patients and one healthy donor were stained with

401

LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Yellow Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) at ambient temperature for 20

402

mins, followed by washing with RPMI-1640 complete medium and incubation with 10 µg/mL of

403

S trimer at 4˚C for 45 mins. Afterwards, the cells were washed again and incubated with a cocktail

404

of flow cytometry and hashtag antibodies, containing CD3 PE-CF594 (BD Biosciences), CD19

405

PE-Cy7 (Biolegend), CD20 APC-Cy7 (Biolegend), IgM V450 (BD Biosciences), CD27 PerCP-

406

Cy5.5 (BD Biosciences), anti-His PE (Biolegend), and human Hashtag 3 (Biolegend) at 4˚C for 1

407

hr. Stained cells were then washed, resuspended in RPMI-1640 complete medium and sorted for

408

S trimer-specific memory B cells (CD3-CD19+CD27+S trimer+ live single lymphocytes). The

409

sorted cells were mixed with mononuclear cells from the same donor, labeled with Hashtag 1, and

410

loaded into the 10X Chromium chip of the 5’ Single Cell Immune Profiling Assay (10X Genomics)

411

at the Columbia University Human Immune Monitoring Core (HIMC; RRID:SCR_016740). The

412

library preparation and quality control were performed according to manufacturer’s protocol and

413

sequenced on a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina).

414
415

Identification of S Trimer-Specific Antibody Transcripts

416

For each sample, full-length antibody transcripts were assembled using the VDJ module in Cell

417

Ranger (version 3.1.0, 10X Genomics) with default parameters and the GRCh38 genome as

418

reference. To identify cells from the antigen sort, we first used the count module in Cell Ranger

419

to calculate copies of all hashtags in each cell from the Illumina NGS raw reads. High confidence

420

antigen-specific cells were identified as follows. Briefly, based on the copy numbers of the

421

hashtags observed, a cell must contain more than 100 copies of the antigen sort-specific hashtag

422

to qualify as an antigen-specific cell. Because hashtags can fall off from cells and bind to cells

423

from a different population in the sample mixture, each cell usually has both sorted and spiked-in-

424

specific hashtags. To enrich for true antigen-specific cells, the copy number of the specific hashtag

425

has to be at least 1.5x higher than that of the non-specific hashtag. Low quality cells were

426

identified and removed using the cell-calling algorithm in Cell Ranger. Cells that do not have

427

productive H and L chain pairs were excluded. If a cell contains more than two H or/and L chain

428

transcripts, the transcripts with less than 3 unique molecular identifiers were removed. Cells with

429

identical H and L chain sequences, which may have resulted from mRNA leakage, were merged

430

into one cell. Additional filters were applied to remove low quality cells and/or transcripts in the

431

antibody gene annotation process.

432
433

Antibody Transcript Annotation and Selection Criteria

434

Antigen-specific antibody transcripts were processed using our bioinformatics pipeline SONAR

435

for quality control and annotation26. Briefly, V(D)J genes were assigned for each transcript using

436

BLAST27 with customized parameters against a germline gene database obtained from the

437

international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT) database26,28. Based on BLAST

438

alignments of V and J regions, CDR3 was identified using the conserved second cysteine in the V

439

region and WGXG (H chain) or FGXG (L chain) motifs in the J region (X represents any amino

440

acid). For H chain transcripts, the constant domain 1 (CH1) sequences were used to assign isotype

441

using BLAST with default parameters against a database of human CH1 genes obtained from

442

IMGT. A BLAST E-value threshold of 1E-6 was used to find significant isotype assignments, and

443

the CH1 allele with the lowest E-value was used. Sequences other than the V(D)J region were

444

removed and transcripts containing incomplete V(D)J or/and frame shift were excluded. We then

445

aligned each of the remaining transcripts to the assigned germline V gene using CLUSTALO29

446

and calculated the somatic hypermutation level.

447
448

To select representative antibodies for functional characterization, we first clustered all antibodies

449

using USEARCH30 with the following criteria: identical heavy chain V and J gene assignments,

450

the same length of CDRH3, and CDRH3 identity higher than 0.9. For each cluster, cells with the

451

same light chain V and J gene assignments were grouped into a clone. All clone assignments were

452

manually checked. We then calculated the clonal size for each clone, and one H and L chain pair

453

per clone was chosen for antibody synthesis. For clones with multiple members, the member with

454

the highest somatic hypermutation level was chosen for synthesis. For cells having multiple high

455

quality H or L chains, which may be from doublets, we synthesized all H and L chain combinations.

456
457

Analysis of S Trimer-Specific Antibody Repertoire

458

Because 88% of the S trimer-specific antibodies were IgG isotype, we therefore compared the

459

repertoire features to IgG repertoires from three healthy donors31 (17,243 H chains, 27,575 kappa

460

L chains, 20,889 lambda L chains). The repertoire data from the three healthy donors were

461

combined and annotated using SONAR with the same process as above.

462
463

Antibody Expression and Purification

464

For each antibody, variable genes were optimized for human cell expression and synthesized by

465

GenScript. VH and VL were inserted separately into plasmids (gWiz or pcDNA3.4) that encode

466

the constant region for H chain and L chain. Monoclonal antibodies were expressed in Expi293

467

(ThermoFisher, A14527) by co-transfection of H chain and L chain expressing plasmids using

468

polyethylenimine and culture in 37°C shaker at 125 RPM and 8% CO2. On day 3 post transfection,

469

400 µL of supernatant were collected for screening for binding to S trimer and RBD by ELISA,

470

and for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus. Supernatants were also

471

collected on day 5 for antibody purification by rProtein A Sepharose (GE, 17-1279-01) affinity

472

chromatography.

475

Recombinant Indiana VSV (rVSV) expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike was generated as previously

476

described32,33. HEK293T cells were grown to 80% confluency before transfection with pCMV3-

477

SARS-CoV-2-spike (Sino Biological) using FuGENE 6 (Promega). Cells were cultured overnight

478

at 37°C with 5% CO2. The next day, medium was removed and VSV-G pseudotyped ΔG-

479

luciferase (G*ΔG-luciferase, Kerafast) was used to infect the cells in DMEM at a MOI of 3 for

480

1 hr before washing the cells with 1X DPBS three times. DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal

481

bovine serum and 100 I.U./mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin were added to the

482

inoculated cells, which were cultured overnight as described above.

Pseudovirus Neutralization

487

Neutralization assays were performed by incubating pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of heat-

488

inactivated plasma together with supernatant or purified antibodies, and scored by the reduction in

489

luciferase gene expression. In brief, Vero E6 cells (ATCC) were seeded in a 96-well plate at a

490

concentration of 2 × 104 cells per well. Pseudoviruses were incubated the next day with serial

491

dilutions of the test samples in duplicate or triplicate for 30 mins at 37°C. The mixture was added

492

to cultured cells and incubated for an additional 24 hrs. The luminescence was measured by

493

Britelite plus Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer). IC50 was defined as the dilution at

494

which the relative light units were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells (virus +

495

cells) after subtraction of the background in the control groups with cells only. The IC50 values

496

were calculated using non-linear regression in GraphPad Prism 8.0.

Authentic SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization

499

Supernatants containing expressed mAbs were diluted 1:10 and 1:50 in EMEM with 7.5%

500

inactivated fetal calf serum and incubated with authentic SARS-CoV-2 (strain USA-WA1/2020;

501

MOI 0.1) for 1hr at 37°C. Post-incubation, the mixture was transferred onto a monolayer of Vero-

502

E6 cells that was cultured overnight. After incubation of the cells with the mixture for 70 hrs at

503

37°C, cytopathic effects (CPE) caused by the infection were scored for each well from 0 to 4 to

504

indicate the degree of virus inhibition. Semi-quantitative representation of the inhibition for each

505

antibody-containing supernatant at a dilution of 1:50 is shown in the lowest panel of Fig. 1b with

506

neutralization levels ranging from (-) for none to (+++) for complete neutralization.

507
508

An end-point dilution assay in a 96-well plate format was performed to measure the neutralization

509

activity of select purified mAbs. In brief, each antibody was serially diluted (5-fold dilutions)

510

starting at 20 µg/mL. Triplicates of each mAb dilution were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 at a

511

MOI of 0.1 in EMEM with 7.5% inactivated fetal calf serum for 1 hr at 37oC. Post incubation, the

512

virus-antibody mixture was transferred onto a monolayer of Vero-E6 cells grown overnight. The

513

cells were incubated with the mixture for 70 hrs. CPE were visually scored for each well in a

514

blinded fashion by two independent observers. The results were then converted into percentage

515

neutralization at a given mAb concentration, and the averages ± SEM were plotted using a five-

516

parameter dose-response curve in GraphPad Prism 8.0.

521

and 10% bovine calf serum (BCS) (Sigma) in PBS at 37°C for 2 hrs. Afterwards, supernatants

522

from the antibody transfection or purified antibodies were serially diluted using dilution buffer (1%

523

BSA and 20% BCS in PBS), incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Next, 100 µL of 10,000-fold diluted

524

Peroxidase AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG (H+L) antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were

525

added into each well and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. The plates were washed between each step

526

with PBST (0.5% Tween-20 in PBS). Finally, the TMB substrate (Sigma) was added and

527

incubated before the reaction was stopped using 1M sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at

528

450 nm.

529
530

For the competition ELISA, purified mAbs were biotin-labeled using One-Step Antibody

531

Biotinylation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following manufacturer recommendations and purified using

532

40K MWCO Desalting Column (ThermoFisher Scientific). 50 µL of serially diluted competitor

533

antibodies were added into S trimer-precoated ELISA plates, followed by 50 µL of biotinylated

534

antibodies at a concentration that achieves an OD450 reading of 1.5 in the absence of competitor

535

antibodies. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hr, and 100 µL of 500-fold diluted Avidin-HRP

536

(ThermoFisher Scientific) were added into each well and incubated for another 1 hr at 37°C. The

537

plates were washed by PBST between each of the previous steps. The plates were developed

538

afterwards with TMB and absorbance was read at 450 nm after the reaction was stopped.

539
540

For the ACE2 competition ELISA, 100 ng of ACE2 protein (Abcam) was immobilized on the

541

plates at 4°C overnight. The unbound ACE2 was washed away by PBST and then the plates were

542

blocked. After washing, 100 ng of S trimer in 50 µL of dilution buffer was added into each well,

2000-fold diluted anti-strep-HRP (Millipore Sigma) were added into each well for another 1 hr at

546

37°C. The plates were then washed, developed with TMB, and absorbance was read at 450 nm

547

after the reaction was stopped.

548
549

For all the competition ELISA experiments, the relative binding of biotinylated antibodies or

550

ACE2 to the S trimer in the presence of competitors was normalized by comparing to competitor-

551

free controls. Relative binding curve and the area under curve (AUC) were generated by fitting

552

the non-linear five-parameter dose-response curve in GraphPad Prism 8.0.

553
554

Cell-Surface Competition Binding Assay

555

Expi293 cells were co-transfected with vectors encoding pRRL-cPPT-PGK-GFP (Addgene) and

556

pCMV3-SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) Spike (Sino Biological) at a ratio of 1:1. Two days after

557

transfection, cells were incubated with a mixture of biotinylated mAb 2-43 (0.25 µg/mL) and

558

serially diluted competitor antibodies at 4°C for 1 hr. Then 100 µL of diluted APC-streptavidin

559

(Biolegend) were added to the cells and incubated at 4°C for 45 mins. Cells were washed 3 times

560

with FACS buffer before each step. Finally, cells were resuspended and 2-43 binding to cell-

561

surface S trimer was quantified on LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The mean

562

fluorescence intensity of APC in GFP-positive cells was analyzed using FlowJo and the relative

563

binding of 2-43 to S trimer in the presence of competitors was calculated as the percentage of the

564

mean fluorescence intensity compared to that of the competitor-free controls.

Cryo-EM Data Collection and Processing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.153486; this version posted July 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

567

SARS-CoV-2 S trimer at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml was incubated with 6-fold molar excess

568

per spike monomer of the antibody Fab fragments for 30 minutes in 10 mM sodium acetate pH

569

5.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM). 2 µL of sample were incubated

570

on C-flat 1.2/1.3 carbon grids for 30 secs and vitrified using a Leica EM GP Plunge Freezer. Data

571

were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan

572

K3 direct detector and energy filter using the Leginon software package34. A total electron fluence

573

of 51.3 e/Å2 was fractionated over 40 frames, with a total exposure time of 2 secs. A magnification

574

of 81,000x resulted in a pixel size of 1.058 Å, and a defocus range of -0.4 to -3.5 µm was used.

575

All processing was done using cryoSPARC v2.14.235. Raw movies were aligned and dose-

576

weighted using patch motion correction, and the CTF was estimated using patch CTF estimation.

577

A small subset of approximately 200 micrographs were picked using blob picker, followed by 2D

578

classification and manual curation of particle picks, and used to train a Topaz neural network36.

579

This network was then used to pick particles from the remaining micrographs, which were

580

extracted with a box size of 384 pixels.

581
582

For the 2-4 Fab dataset, 2D classification followed by ab initio modelling and 3D heterogeneous

583

refinement revealed 83,927 particles with three 2-4 Fabs bound, one to each RBD.

584

reconstruction of these particles using Non-Uniform Refinement with imposed C3 symmetry

585

resulted in a 3.6 Å map, as determined by the gold standard FSC. Given the relatively low

586

resolution of the RBD-Fab interface, masked local refinement was used to obtain a 3.5 Å map with

587

significantly improved density. A masked local refinement of the remainder of the S timer resulted

588

in a 3.5 Å reconstruction. These two local refinements were aligned and combined using the vop

589

maximum function in UCSF Chimera37. This was repeated for the half maps, which were used,

590

along with the refinement mask from the global Non-Uniform refinement, to calculate the

591

3DFSC38 and obtain an estimated resolution of 3.2 Å. All maps have been submitted to the EMDB

592

with the ID EMD-22156.

593
594

For the 4-8 Fab dataset, image preprocessing and particle picking was performed as above. 2D

595

classification, ab initio modelling, and 3D heterogeneous classification revealed 47,555 particles

596

with 3 Fabs bound, one to each NTD and with all 3 RBDs in the down conformation. While this

597

particle stack was refined to 3.9 Å using Non-Uniform refinement with imposed C3 symmetry,

598

significant molecular motion prevented the visualization of the Fab epitope at high resolution

599

(EMD-22159). In addition, 105,278 particles were shown to have 3 Fabs bound, but with 1 RBD

600

in the up conformation. These particles were refined to 4.0 Å using Non-Uniform refinement with

601

C1 symmetry (EMD-22158), and suffered from the same conformational flexibility as the all-

602

RBD-down particles. This flexibility was visualized using 3D variability analysis in cryoSPARC.

603
604

For the 2-43 Fab dataset, which was collected at an electron fluence of 51.69 e/Å2, image

605

preprocessing was performed as above, and particle picking was performed with blob picker. 2D

606

classification, ab initio modelling, and 3D heterogeneous classification revealed 10,068 particles

607

with 3 Fabs bound, which was refined to 5.8Å resolution (EMD-22157).

608
609

Cryo-EM Model Fitting

610

An initial homology model of the 2-4 Fab was built using Schrodinger Release 2020-2:

611

BioLuminate39. The RBD was initially modeled using the coordinates from PDB ID 6W41. The

612

remainder of the S timer was modeled using the coordinates from PDB ID 6VSB. These models

613

were docked into the consensus map using Chimera. The model was then fitted interactively using

614

ISOLDE 1.0b540 and COOT 0.8.9.241, and using real space refinement in Phenix 1.1842. In cases

615

where side chains were not visible in the experimental data, they were truncated to alanine.

616

Validation was performed using Molprobity43 and EMRinger44. The model was submitted to the

617

PDB with the ID 6XEY. Figures were prepared using ChimeraX45.

Hamster Protection Experiment

620

In vivo evaluation of mAb 2-15 in an established golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2

621

infection was performed as described previously with slight modifications46. Approval was

622

obtained from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Committee on the Use of Live Animals in

623

Teaching and Research. Briefly, 6-8-week-old male and female hamsters were obtained from the

624

Chinese University of Hong Kong Laboratory Animal Service Centre through the HKU

625

Laboratory Animal Unit and kept in Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) housing with access to standard

626

pellet feed and water ad libitum until virus challenge in the BSL-3 animal facility. Each hamster

627

(n = 4 per group) was intraperitoneally administered one dose of 1.5 mg/kg of mAb 2-15 in

628

phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.3 mg/kg of mAb 2-15 in PBS, or PBS alone as control.

629

Twenty-four hours later, each hamster was intranasally inoculated with a challenge dose of 100

630

µL of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium containing 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-001a strain,

631

GenBank accession no: MT230904.1) under intraperitoneal ketamine (200 mg/kg) and xylazine

632

(10 mg/kg) anesthesia. The hamsters were monitored twice daily for clinical signs of disease and

633

sacrificed at day 4 post-challenge. Half of each hamster’s lung tissues were used for viral load

634

determination by a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/Hel reverse transcription-polymerase chain

635

reaction assay47 and an infectious virus titration using a plaque assay described previously46.

774

are comparably used. b, Compared to IgG repertoires of healthy human donors (17,243, 27,575,

775

and 20,889 transcripts for heavy, kappa, and lambda chains respectively), IGHV3-30 (antigen-

776

specific n=26 and healthy donor n=1117) and IGKV3-20 genes (antigen-specific n=15 and healthy

777

donor n=4,071) are over-represented in heavy and light chain repertoires respectively (P values

778

are 6.415e-11 and 0.04332 respectively, c2-test with 1 degree of freedom). We did not test the

779

enrichment of other genes because the numbers of antigen-specific antibodies are less than 15. c,

780

The usage of IGHJ6 gene (antigen-specific n=36 and healthy donor n=3646) was significantly

781

higher in antigen-specific antibodies (c2-test with 1 degree of freedom, p=0.02807). d, The

782

CDRH3 length of antigen-specific antibodies is significantly longer than in healthy donors (two-

783

sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, p=0.014). e, For both heavy and light chains, the V region

784

nucleotide somatic hypermutation levels are significantly lower than in antibodies of healthy

785

donors (two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, p< 2.2e-16 for both heavy and light chains). For the

786

boxplots, the middle lines are medians. The lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and

787

third quartiles respectively. The upper whisker extends to values no larger than 1.5*IQR (the inter-

788

quartile range or distance between the first and third quartiles) from the hinge. The lower whisker

789

extends to values no smaller than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge. Data points beyond the whiskers were

790

plotted as outliers using dots.

Extended Data Fig. 4 Correlation of neutralizing antibody titers of the top 19 mAbs in the

793

live SARS-CoV-2 assay versus the pseudovirus assay. Green circles represent RBD-directed

794

antibodies; orange circles represent NTD-directed antibodies; and black circles represent

795

antibodies in the “Others” category. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the p value were

796

calculated using GraphPad Prism. Experiments were performed in triplicates for all mAbs tested.

Extended Data Fig. 5 The pseudovirus neutralization profiles for 12 purified mAbs that

798

strongly bound the S trimer but with weak or no virus-neutralizing activities. The four mAbs

799

with weak neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus are shown in sold lines, and

800

the remaining 8 non-neutralizing mAbs are shown in dashed lines.

Extended Data Fig. 6 Cell-surface staining with antibodies a, Antibody binding to the SARS-

802

CoV-1 (blue) and SARS-CoV-2 (red) spike proteins expressed on the cell surface. Expi293 cells

803

were co-transfected with GFP and full-length SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 spike genes. After

804

48 hours, antibody binding to spike protein in the GFP-positive cells was detected by flow

805

cytometer. The data show all antibodies tested were able to recognize the wildtype SARS-CoV-2

806

spike protein but not SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. b, Monoclonal Ab 2-43 bound to S trimer

807

expressed on Expi293 cell surface can be competed out by mAbs directed to RBD but only

808

minimally by mAbs to the NTD region. Shown are representative data from three independent

809

experiments.
