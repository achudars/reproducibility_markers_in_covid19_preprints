Abstract
SARS-CoV2 is a previously uncharacterized coronavirus and causative agent of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The host response to SARS-CoV2 has not yet been fully
delineated, hampering a precise approach to therapy. To address this, we carried out a
comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of
COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by
populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional
signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung
suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated
myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of
inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic
targets that could be modified with available drugs. The data suggest that transcriptomic
profiling can provide an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individual
patients.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a group of enveloped, single, positive-stranded RNA
viruses causing mild to severe respiratory illnesses in humans (Cui et al., 2019; Fung
and Liu, 2019; Greenberg, 2016). In the past two decades, three worldwide outbreaks
have originated from CoVs capable of infecting the lower respiratory tract, resulting in
heightened pathogenicity and high mortality rates. We are currently in the midst of a
pandemic stemming from a third CoV strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). In the majority of cases, patients exhibit mild symptoms, whereas in more severe
cases, patients may develop severe lung injury and death from respiratory failure (Chen
et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020).
At this time, there is still incomplete information available regarding the host
response to SARS-CoV2 infection and the perturbations resulting in a severe outcome.
Despite this, clues can be derived from our knowledge of the immune response to
infection by other respiratory viruses, including other CoVs. After infection, viruses are
typically detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the inflammasome
sensor NLRP3, which signal the release of interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory
cytokines including the IL-1 family, IL-6, and TNF, that activate a local and systemic
response to infection (Kelley et al., 2019; Lazear et al., 2019). This involves the
recruitment, activation, and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cells,
including neutrophils, inflammatory myeloid cells, CD8 T cells, and natural killer (NK)
cells (Newton et al., 2016). Resolution of infection is largely dependent on the cytotoxic
activity of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which enable clearance of virus-infected cells

(Newton et al., 2016). Failure to clear virus-infected cells may facilitate a hyperinflammatory state termed Macrophage (MΦ) activation syndrome (MAS) or “cytokine
storm”, and ultimately damage to the infected lung (Crayne et al., 2019; McGonagle et
al., 2020).
The recent emergence of SARS-CoV2 and the relative lack of comprehensive
knowledge regarding the progression of COVID-19 disease has constrained our ability
to develop effective treatments for infected patients. One means to obtain a more
complete understanding of the host response to SARS-CoV2 is to examine gene
expression in relevant tissues. A limited number of gene expression profiles are
available from patients with COVID-19 and have yielded some insights into the
pathogenic processes triggered by infection with SARS-CoV2 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020;
Wei et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020). However, because of the small number of samples
and limited analysis, a full picture of the biological state of SARS-CoV2-affected tissues
has not emerged. To address this, we have assessed available SARS-CoV2 gene
expression datasets from blood, lung, and airway using a number of orthogonal
bioinformatic tools to provide a more complete view of the nature of the COVID-19
inflammatory response and the potential points of therapeutic intervention.

Results
Gene expression analysis of blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients
To characterize the pathologic response to SARS-CoV2 infection, we analyzed
transcriptomic data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and postmortem
lung tissue of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls as well as bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) fluid of COVID-19 patients (CRA002390, GSE147507, Table S1) (BlancoMelo et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020). We first determined changes in gene expression
in the blood (PBMC-CTL vs PBMC-CoV2) and lung (Lung-CTL vs Lung-CoV2).
Because no control BAL fluids were associated with the BAL-CoV2 samples, we
compared BAL-CoV2 to PBMC-CoV2 from the same dataset to avoid effects related to
batch and methodology. Overall, we found 4,245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
in the blood (2,166 up and 2,079 down), 2,220 DEGs in the lung (684 up and 1,536
down), and 8,952 DEGs in the airway (BAL) (4,052 up and 4,900 down) (Table S2).

Conserved and differential enrichment of inflammatory cells and pathways in
COVID-19 patients
To interrogate pathologic pathways in the 3 compartments, we carried out Gene
Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) utilizing a number of informative gene modules (Catalina
et al., 2019), (Catalina et al. submitted manuscript) (Figure 1, Table S3). Numerous
innate immune response pathways were increased in all 3 compartments, whereas
adaptive immune signatures tended to be decreased in blood and airway, but not lung,
a pattern that is consistent with earlier studies (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Wen et al.,
2020; Xiong et al., 2020). Although heterogeneity was observed in all compartments,

closer examination revealed consistent perturbations. In the blood, the classical and
lectin-induced complement pathways, as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome, plasma
cells (PCs), and monocytes (Mo) were significantly enriched in COVID-19 patients,
whereas cytotoxic cells and neutrophils were decreased. In the lung, the NLRP3
inflammasome, Mo, myeloid cells and low-density granulocytes (LDGs) were enriched
in COVID-19 patients, whereas in the airway, the classical and alternative complement
pathways were enriched and T cells and cytotoxic cells were decreased.
Although there is conflicting data on the presence of an IFN gene signature (IGS)
and whether SARS-CoV2 infection induces a robust IFN response (Blanco-Melo et al.,
2020; Trouillet-Assant et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020), we observed increased expression
of Type I IFN genes (IFNA4, IFNA6, IFNA10) and significant enrichment of the common
Type I and Type II IGS, including enrichment of IFNA2, IFNB1 and IFNG gene
signatures specifically in the lung tissue (Figure 2A&B). Furthermore, we detected
increased expression of genes found to be important for the anti-viral innate immune
response (IFIH1, DDX58, EIF2AK2, OAS2) and decreased expression of negative
regulators of this response (IRF2BP1, SKIV2L) in both the lung and airway
compartments (Figure 2C) (Fischer et al., 2020). Interestingly, we found expression of
MAVS, a signaling adaptor for RNA virus sensors, was decreased in the airway, which
is consistent with the reported effect of SARS-CoV2 and may reflect a mechanism of
viral immune evasion (Bojkova et al., 2020; Vazquez and Horner, 2015).

Increased expression of inflammatory mediators in the lungs of COVID-19
patients
To examine the nature of the inflammatory response in the tissue compartments
in greater detail, we examined specific DEGs of interest (Figure 3A&B). In the blood,
we noted increased expression of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL10, which is an
IFNG response gene and involved in the activation and chemotaxis of peripheral
immune cells, (Lindell et al., 2008), the chemokine receptor CCR2, which has been
shown to be critical for immune cell recruitment in response to respiratory viral infection
(Teijaro, 2015), as well as the inflammatory IL-1 family member, IL18. Expression of a
number of chemokines, including ligands for CCR2, were significantly increased in both
the lung tissue and airway of COVID-19 patients, including CCL2, CCL3L1, CCL7,
CCL8, and CXCL10. We also observed elevated pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members,
IL1A and IL1B, in these 2 compartments. Furthermore, lung tissue exhibited enrichment
of the IL-1 cytokine gene signature, whereas the airway exhibited additional expression
of IL18, IL33, IL36B, and IL36G.

Non-hematopoietic cells in the BAL fluid may be indicative of viral-induced
damage
To determine whether viral infection resulted in modification of resident tissue
populations, we employed GSVA with various non-hematopoietic cell gene signatures
(Figure 3C). We found that signatures of various lung tissue cells but not endothelial
cells were enriched in the airway, but not the lung of COVID-19 subjects. Additionally,

we also detected increased expression of the viral entry genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2,
which are typically expressed on lung epithelium (Sungnak et al., 2020) (Figure 3D).

Protein-protein interactions identify myeloid subsets in COVID-19 patients
We next sought to utilize an unbiased, protein-protein interaction (PPI)-based
clustering approach to assess the inflammatory cell types within each tissue
compartment. PPI networks predicted from DEGs were simplified into metastructures
defined by the number of genes in each cluster, the number of significant intra-cluster
connections, and the number of associations connecting members of different clusters
to each other (Figure 4A-C, Table S4). Overall, upregulated PPI networks identified
numerous specific cell types and functions. In the blood, cluster 8 was dominated by a
Mo population expressing C2, C5, CXCL10, CCR2, and multiple IFN-stimulated genes,
whereas cluster 3 contained hallmarks of alternatively activated (M2) macrophages
(MΦs) and/or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), including CD33, CD36, CD93,
and ITGAM (Figure 4A). Smaller immune clusters were indicative of functions, including
inflammasome activation, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) activity, the
classical complement cascade and the response to Type II IFNs. Myeloid heterogeneity
in the blood was also reflected by the presence of multiple metabolic pathways, such as
enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cluster 1 linked to M2-like MΦs in
cluster 3 (mean interaction score of 0.875), and glycolysis in clusters 7 and 13
connected to activated Mo in cluster 8 (interaction scores of 0.86 and 0.82,
respectively). Consistent with our GSVA results, blood exhibited profoundly decreased

T cells determined by the downregulation of T cell activation markers CD28, LCK and
ITK (Figure S1A).
In addition to the various Mo/myeloid populations, lung tissue was infiltrated by
LDGs, granulocytes, T cells, and B cells. Metabolic function in the lung was varied, with
Mo-enriched clusters (1 and 7) linked to glycolysis in cluster 18 (interaction scores of
0.74 and 0.87, respectively) potentially reflecting cellular activation, whereas OXPHOS
was predominantly downregulated along with other nuclear processes (transcription and
mRNA processing) (Figure 4B, Figure S1B). The airway was enriched in inflammatory
Mo, mitochondrial function and transcription. Multifunctional cluster 4 was dominated by
numerous chemokine and cytokine receptor-ligand pairs, whereas smaller immune
clusters were enriched in classical complement activation, IFNG and IL-1 responses.
(Figure 4C). Consistent with tissue damage, we found numerous small clusters in the
airway, reflecting the presence of non-hematopoietic cells, including those containing
multiple intermediate filament keratin genes, cell-cell adhesion claudin genes and
surfactant genes. Notably, non-hematopoietic cell signatures in the airway were similar
in content to those derived from in vitro SARS-CoV-2-infected primary lung epithelial
cell lines (NHBE) (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) (Figure S1D).
Given the large number of clusters including Mo/myeloid/MΦ, we next examined
these clusters in greater detail by altering the stringency of PPI clustering to further
characterize unique myeloid lineage cells within each tissue compartment (Figure 4D-F,
Table S4). Myeloid lineage-specific clusters were then compared to previously
published gene signatures, including populations G1-G4 reported in BAL of COVID-19
patients (Liao et al., 2020) (Figure S2A). In the blood, we found gene modules

representative of common myeloid function (chemotaxis, proteolysis, etc.), as well as
two independent Mo/myeloid subpopulations (Figure 4D). Cluster 6 contained
numerous markers highly reminiscent of classically activated blood Mo and exhibited
significant overlap with the inflammatory G1 population (Liao et al., 2020), whereas
cluster 1 was similar to IFN-activated MΦs, CX3CR1+ synovial lining MΦs (from arthritic
mice) and alveolar MΦs (AM) (Figure S2A).
In the lung (Figure 4E), clusters 2, 3 and 6 overlapped with the G1 inflammatory
Mo population and expressed a number of chemotaxis genes. A second population
characteristic of AMs was also evident in the lung, defined by CSF2RB, the receptor for
GM-CSF, a cytokine that regulates AM differentiation (Joshi et al., 2006; Newton et al.,
2016; Suzuki et al., 2014). Further characterization of this population indicated
significant expression of the coagulation system genes F5, FGG, FGL1, SERPINA and
SERPINE2. Similarly, re-clustering of Mo/MΦs/myeloid clusters from the airway
revealed a population with hallmarks of inflammatory/M1 MΦ (MARCO and multiple
members of the complement cascade; cluster 7), and a second population of AMs
(Figure 4F) demonstrating significant overlap with the G3 and G4 populations (Figure
S2A) (Liao et al., 2020).

Characterization of myeloid populations in COVID-19 patients
The overlap between previously characterized BAL-defined gene signatures from
COVID-19 patients (Liao et al., 2020) and tissue-defined PPI clusters motivated us to
evaluate these populations in greater detail by GSVA. Consistent with PPI clusters, the
inflammatory-MΦ G1 population was increased in the blood (Figure S2B). The G1 and

G1 & G2 populations were increased in the lung, consistent with the expression of IFN
and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure S2C). In the airway, the G2, G3, and G4
populations were significantly enriched indicating the presence of both pro-inflammatory
MΦs and AMs (Figure S2D-F). As a whole, we found that gene signatures of previously
defined Mo/MΦ populations in COVID-19 BAL were dispersed among the blood, lung,
and airway compartments.

Co-expression further delineates Mo/MΦ gene expression profiles of COVID-19
patients
We next sought to identify the biology of the populations of Mo/MΦ in the tissue
compartments in greater detail. We derived a set of 196 co-expressed Mo/myeloid
genes and used them (Figure S3, Table S5, see Methods) to probe heterogeneity in
each tissue compartment (Figure 5A). Notably, we found co-expression of 40 core
genes between all compartments, which included complement, chemokine, and
cytokine genes (Figure 5B&C). In addition, there were 86 shared co-expressed genes
in lung and blood, 57 in the lung and airway, and 61 in the airway and blood (Figure
5B). To directly compare levels of these 196 co-expressed myeloid genes in each
compartment, we normalized gene expression in each sample using 3 genes included
in the core 40 genes, (FCGR1A, FCGR2A, FCGR2C) (Figure 5D). Although many
genes were not significantly different between compartments, numerous chemokines
and cell surface markers (CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CXCL10, CLEC4E, FCER1G) and
inflammatory cytokines (IL1A and TNF) were enriched in the lung compared to the
blood and airway. Furthermore, the complement genes C1QB, C1QC, and C2 were

increased in the lung compared to the blood, but not changed between the lung and the
airway. Altogether, these normalized gene expression results suggested that expression
of inflammatory mediators was increased in SARS-CoV2-infected lung over the other
compartments and in the airway compared to the blood.
To determine the function and nature of these myeloid populations, we compared
them to previously published myeloid signatures (Figure 5E, Table S6) (Culemann et
al., 2019; Kuo et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2020; Martinez et al., 2006; Reyfman et al.,
2019). The population increased in the blood (A1) was predominantly characterized by
features of AMs, M1 and M2 MΦs, pro-inflammatory MΦs with potential to infiltrate
tissue, and the inflammatory MΦ G1 population. The A1 population also exhibited
features of inflamed murine residential, interstitial MΦs. The myeloid cell population
increased in COVID lung (A2) was most similar to pro-fibrotic AMs, M1 MΦs, M2 MΦs,
blood-derived infiltrating MΦs, and the inflammatory Mo G1 population. A2 was also
marked by additional AM-specific genes, contributing to the observed overlap with the
other two compartments. However, overlap between A2 and the G4 AM signature was
relatively decreased, suggesting that the lung AMs are more similar to those found in
pulmonary fibrosis (Reyfman et al., 2019). Finally, the population increased in the
airway (A3) similarly exhibited characteristics of AMs, M1 and M2 MΦs, and proinflammatory MΦs that have infiltrated into the tissue compartment (Figure 5E). Of
note, the airway A3 population was not similar to the previously described BAL-derived
inflammatory MΦ G1 population (Liao et al., 2020).
We also evaluated the overlap between the Mo/MΦ A1-A3 gene clusters and
those identified using PPI clustering (Figure 4) (Figure 5F, Table S6). Interestingly, the

CD33+ pathogenic population (PPI-derived PBMC Myeloid Cluster 1) was most strongly
enriched in the blood, but was also increased in the tissue compartments. All
compartments were characterized by strong enrichment of pro-inflammatory Mo (PBMC
Myeloid Cluster 6, Lung Myeloid Clusters 3 and 6, and BAL Myeloid Cluster 7), although
A3 exhibited some differences in these populations compared to A1 and A2.
Additionally, this comparison suggested enrichment of AMs in all three compartments;
however, upon examination of the specific overlapping gene transcripts, the observed
enrichment in blood A1 was primarily related to the presence of non-AM-specific
myeloid genes. Finally, numerous common activators and functions of PPI-derived
clusters were enriched uniformly across A1, A2, and A3, providing further evidence for
pro-inflammatory activity of myeloid cell populations in COVID-19 blood and tissue
compartments.
We used trajectory analysis to understand potential transitions of Mo/MΦ in
various tissue compartments. We based this on the normalized 196 myeloid-cell specific
genes, as well as 425 additional normalized genes that could be important in
Mo/myeloid/MΦ cell differentiation, reflective of chemotaxis, IFN, and metabolism genes
(Table S6). This analysis suggested a branch point of differentiation of Mo/MΦ between
blood and lung, with some blood Mo/MΦ differentiating directly to airway cells and
others to lung cells in a more protracted manner as indicated by pseudotime (Figure
5G).

Analysis of the biologic activities of myeloid subpopulations

To focus on functional distinctions among the co-expressed myeloid populations
in the blood, lung, and airway compartments (A1-A3), we utilized linear regression
analyses between GSVA scores for A1-A3 and scores for metabolic, functional, and
signaling pathways (Figure 6, Figure S4). Blood A1 was significantly correlated with
glycolysis, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the classical and lectin-induced complement
pathways. In lung A2, there were no significant correlations detected with metabolism,
but this population was significantly correlated with the NLRP3 inflammasome and the
alternative complement pathway. Finally, airway A3 was positively correlated with
OXPHOS, the classical complement pathway, and TNF signaling and negatively
correlated with apoptosis. Overall, these results delineated the heterogeneity in
metabolic and inflammatory pathways among myeloid cells enriched in the blood, lung,
and airway of COVID-19 patients.

Pathway and upstream regulator analysis inform tissue-specific drug discovery
for treatment of COVID-19
To understand the biology of SARS-CoV2-infected patients in greater detail, we
conducted pathway analysis on DEGs from the 3 compartments using IPA canonical
signaling pathway and upstream regulator (UPR) analysis functions (Figure 7). In
general, IFN signaling, the inflammasome, and other components of anti-viral, innate
immunity were reflected by disease state gene expression profiles compared to healthy
controls (Figure 7A). In addition, metabolic pathways including OXPHOS and glycolysis
were significantly increased in the blood of COVID-19 patients compared to controls.

UPRs predicted to drive the responses in each compartment indicated uniform
involvement of inflammatory cytokines, with Type I IFN regulation dominant in the
SARS-CoV2-infected lung (Figure 7B). Notable UPRs of COVID-19 blood included
IFNA, IFNG, multiple growth factors and ligands, HIF1A, CSF1 and CSF2. Evidence of
inflammatory cytokine signaling by IL17 and IL36A was predicted in COVID-19 lung and
airway compartments. Whereas the airway DEG profile indicated regulation by both
inflammatory and inhibitory cytokines, the COVID-19 lung UPRs were markedly
inflammatory, including, NFκB, IL12, TNF, IL1B, and multiple Type I IFNs. These
proinflammatory drivers were consistent in each individual lung which we analyzed
separately because of the apparent heterogeneity between the lung samples (Figure
S5).
IPA analysis was also employed to predict drugs that might interfere with COVID19 inflammation (Figure 7B, Table S7). Of note, neutralizers of IL17, IL6, IL1, IFNA,
IFNG, and TNF were predicted as antagonists of COVID-19 biology. Corticosteroids
were predicted to revert the gene expression profile in the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung,
but were predicted as UPRs of COVID-19 blood, which may indicate that the patients
from whom blood was collected had been treated with corticosteroids rather than
indicating that these agents were driving disease pathology. Chloroquine (CQ) and
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were additionally predicted to revert the COVID-19
transcription profile in the lung, which may point to their potential utility as treatment
options. A number of drugs matched to unique targetable pathways in the lung,
including NFκB pathway inhibitors, antagonists of NOS2, and neutralizers of the TNF
family; however, some drugs also targeted pathways shared by both the lung and

airway, including anti-RNASE1 compounds and JAK inhibitors. In the BAL-CoV2 vs.
PBMC-CoV2 IPA comparison, several drugs were matched to UPRs with a negative Zscore, which provided additional therapeutic options directed towards the blood of
patients with COVID-19, given that downregulated, or inhibited UPRs are molecules that
could revert the BAL-CoV2 gene signature to that of the PBMC-CoV2 gene signature.
As such, several possible therapeutics arose from this analysis to target COVID-19
blood,

including

ustekinumab,

targeting

the IL12/23 signaling

pathway,

and

cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and lenalidomide, all of which have immunosuppressive
effects. In addition, IGF1R inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, VEGFR inhibitors, and AKT
inhibitors were among the compounds predicted to target COVID-19 PBMCs. No
specific drugs were predicted to target all three tissue compartments, but each
compartment was driven by inflammatory cytokines.
Another means to predict possible drug targets is by employing connectivity
scoring with drug-related gene expression profiles using the perturbagen CMAP
database within CLUE (Table S7, see Methods). Although CLUE-predicted drugs
tended to differ from those predicted by IPA or those matched to IPA-predicted UPRs,
there were some overlapping mechanisms, including inhibition of AKT, angiogenesis,
CDK, EGFR, FLT3, HSP, JAK, and mTOR. IPA-predicted drugs that were unique from
connectivity-predicted drugs tended to capture more cytokine and lymphocyte biology,
including inhibitors of IL1, IL6, IL17, TNF, type I and II interferon, CD40LG, CD38, and
CD19, among other cytokines and immune cell-specific markers. Overall, our gene
expression-based analysis of SARS-CoV2-infected blood and tissue compartments

Discussion
Multiple orthogonal bioinformatics approaches were employed to analyze DEG
profiles from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients and revealed the
dynamic nature of the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and possible points of
therapeutic intervention. In the blood, we saw evidence of myeloid cell activation,
lymphopenia, and elevation of plasma cells, as has been shown by both standard cell
counts, flow cytometry and gene expression analysis (Tay et al., 2020). In the lungs, we
found increased gene signatures of additional myeloid cell types including granulocytes,
infiltrating inflammatory Mo, and AMs as well as the presence of non-activated T, B, and
NK cells. Furthermore, inflammation in the lung tissue was enhanced by the greater
presence of IFNs and more pro-inflammatory cytokines than observed in the blood.
Finally, in the airway we found evidence of blood and AM-derived inflammatory and
regulatory MΦs, and non-hematopoietic lung tissue cells accompanied by expression of
SARS-CoV-2 receptors, and alarmins, indicative of viral infection and damage to the
lung and consistent with previous reports of detection of SARS-CoV2 in BAL fluid
(Corley et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020). Together these findings suggest a systemic, but
compartmentalized immune/inflammatory response with specific signs of cellular
activation in blood, lung and airway. This has informed a more comprehensive and
integrated model of the nature of the local and systemic host response to SARS-CoV2.
The predominant populations of immune cells we found to be enriched and
activated in COVID-19 patients were myeloid cells and, in particular, subsets of
inflammatory Mo and MΦs, which differed between the blood, lung, and airway
compartments. In the peripheral blood, we found significant enrichment of Mo, including

classically activated inflammatory M1 MΦs as well as a CD33+ myeloid subset, which
appeared to be an M2 population reminiscent of previously characterized IFN-activated
MΦs, AMs, and MDSCs, indicative of a potential regulatory population induced by
stimuli arising from the SARS-CoV2-infected lung. Myeloid cells enriched in the blood of
COVID-19 patients were also highly correlated with gene signatures of metabolic
pathways (Glycolysis, Pentose Phosphate Pathway, and TCA cycle) indicative of proinflammatory M1 MΦs (Viola et al., 2019).
The lung tissue was enriched in gene signatures of Mo/MΦs as well as other
myeloid cells including neutrophils and LDGs. The role of neutrophils and LDGs in
COVID-19 pathogenesis has been poorly characterized, although increases in blood
neutrophils have been found to be associated with poor disease outcome in COVID-19
patients and some have proposed that the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs) contributes to increased risk of death from SARS-CoV2 infection (Barnes et al.,
2020; Huang et al., 2020; Thierry and Roch, 2020). Although LDGs have not been
previously reported in the COVID-19 lung, in comparison to neutrophils, they exhibit an
enhanced capacity to produce Type I IFNs and form NETs and therefore, may have an
even greater impact on disease progression (Carmona-Rivera and Kaplan, 2013).
Mo/MΦ subsets in the lung of COVID-19 patients were characterized as
infiltrating inflammatory Mo and activated AMs, which exhibited a mixed metabolic
status suggestive of different states of activation. Infiltrating Mo from the peripheral
blood appeared to be further activated in the lung tissue as evidenced by enhanced
expression of markers of highly inflammatory Mo previously characterized in severe
COVID-19 cases (Liao et al., 2020). The AM population enriched in COVID lung tissue

clustered with genes involved in the coagulation system, which is consistent with
observations of procoagulant AM activity in COVID-19 and in ARDS (Tipping et al.,
1988). As pulmonary thrombosis has been associated with poor clinical outcomes in
COVID-19 patients, this result suggests that activated AMs in SARS-CoV2-infected lung
tissue may be involved in facilitating a pro-thrombotic status, and thereby, contribute to
poor disease outcome (Wichmann et al., 2020).
In the airway, we detected gene signatures of various post-activated MΦ subsets
including inflammatory M1 MΦs, alternatively activated M2 MΦs, and activated AMs.
Expression of myeloid cell genes in the airway also correlated with a signature of
oxidative metabolism, which is characteristic of M2 macrophages and typically
associated with control of tissue damage (Viola et al., 2019). However, in the context of
pulmonary infection, polarization of AMs toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype
was found to promote continued inflammation, suggesting that these MΦs may not be
effective at resolving anti-viral immunity (Allard et al., 2018).
In addition to myeloid cells, inflammatory mediators from the virally infected lung
typically promote migration and activation of NK cells and adaptive immune cells
including T and B cells (Newton et al., 2016). We found significant deficiencies in gene
signatures of T cells and cytotoxic CD8 and NK cells, consistent with clinical evidence of
lymphopenia in the peripheral blood and airway of COVID-19 patients (Chen et al.,
2020b; He et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). In contrast to T and NK cells,
we observed increased evidence of B cell activation through CD40/CD40L and an
increased plasma cell signature in the blood of COVID-19 patients. This result suggests
that COVID-19 patients are able to mount an antibody-mediated immune response.

However, whether a virus-specific antibody response is beneficial to recovery from
SARS-CoV2 infection is unclear (Wu et al., 2020). Low quality, low affinity antibody
responses to SARS-CoV have been found to promote lung injury in some patients,
although it is unknown if this occurs in SARS-CoV2 infected individuals (Iwasaki and
Yang, 2020; Liu et al., 2019).
The contents of the airway as assessed through the BAL fluid, act as a window
into events in the alveoli and airways and can be used to understand what is happening
in the infected tissue that is separate from the interstitium of the lung (Hamacher et al.,
2002; Heron et al., 2012). We found increased enrichment of lung epithelial cells in the
airway of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV2 infection of alveolar cells
together with localized inflammation as a result of enhanced myeloid cell infiltration
promote significant damage to the alveoli and result in affected cells being sloughed into
the airway. Furthermore, the lack of cytotoxic cells and thus, the inability to clear these
virus-infected lung epithelial cells in the airway likely accounts for the increased
presence of post-activated MΦs and high expression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family
members we observed in the BAL of COVID-19 patients. Importantly, these results
suggest that sampling of BAL may provide an important mechanism to evaluate the
impact of SARS-CoV2 infection.
DEGs from COVID-19 patients were enriched in IGS, complement pathways,
inflammatory cytokines and the inflammasome, which would be expected to activate
Mo/MΦ populations in the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients and initiate a
robust and systemic response to infection. In particular, our results support the
conclusion that IL-1 family-mediated inflammation plays a critical role in COVID-19

pathogenesis. However, in contrast to previous characterizations of both SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV2 infection, our analysis did not indicate the presence of overwhelming
pro-inflammatory cytokine production or “cytokine storm” in COVID-19 patients (Sun et
al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020). Rather, our data suggests that the increased numbers,
overactivation, and potentially heightened pathogenicity of monocyte/MΦ populations
are the main drivers of the dysregulated inflammatory response and resulting tissue
damage in COVID-19 patients.
In the absence of proven antiviral treatment and/or a SARS-CoV2-specific
vaccine, disease management is reliant upon supportive care and therapeutics capable
of limiting the severity of clinical manifestations. Using empiric evidence as a guide, the
current approach has been successful in identifying “actionable” points of intervention in
an unbiased manner and in spite of formidable patient heterogeneity. Analyses
presented here support several recent reports highlighting COVID-19 infection-related
increases in inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL6 and TNF, both of which function as
predictors of poor prognosis (Pedersen and Ho, 2020; Voiriot et al., 2017), as well as
complement activation (Gao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020).
Accordingly, anti-IL6 therapies including sarilumab, tocilizumab and clazakizumab, as
well as biologics targeting terminal components of the complement cascade, such as
eculizumab and ravulizumab, are in various clinical trial phases for treating COVID-19associated pneumonia. Candidate TNF blockers such as adalimumab, etanercept and
many others, represent additional options for inhibiting deleterious pro-inflammatory
signaling. However, most showed patient heterogeneity, suggesting a requirement to
identify the specific cytokine profile in each patient in order to offer personalized

treatment. Our analyses also point to the likely involvement of pro-inflammatory IL1
family members especially in the lung, suggesting anti-IL1 family interventions, including
canakinumab and anakinra, may be effective in preventing acute lung injury.
This analysis also establishes the predominance of inflammatory Mo/myeloid
lineage cells in driving disease pathology and suggests therapies effective at blocking
myeloid cell recruitment or forcing repolarization may prevent disease progression.
CCL5 (RANTES) is a potent leukocyte chemoattractant that interacts with multiple
receptors, including CCR1 (upregulated in the blood, lung and airway), and CCR5
(upregulated in the airway). Disruption of the CCR5-CCL5 axis was recently tested
using the CCR5 neutralizing monoclonal antibody leronlimab in a small compassionate
use trial with promising preliminary results (Patterson et al., 2020).
It has also been observed that COVID-19 may predispose patients to
thromboembolic disease (Klok et al., 2020; Middeldorp et al., 2020). Indeed, the gene
expression analyses presented here showing altered expression of coagulation factors
and fibrinogen genes suggests dysfunction within the intrinsic clotting pathway. These
findings, together with evidence of excessive inflammation, complement activation and
the involvement of LDGs in lung inflammation, may contribute to the systemic
coagulation underlying the remarkably high incidence of thrombotic complications
observed in severely ill patients, thereby reinforcing recommendations to apply
pharmacological anti-thrombotic medications.
Finally, there has been much recent discussion concerning the use of antirheumatic drugs for managing COVID-19. In fact, CQ was one compound predicted as
a UPR with potential phenotype-reversing properties. In vitro experiments examining the

anti-viral properties of CQ and its derivative HCQ were effective in limiting viral load;
however, the efficacy of these drugs in clinical trials has been less clear (Geleris et al.,
2020). Questions about drug timing, dosage and adverse events have all called into
question the use of these drugs for COVID-19 patients. Despite a recent report showing
no negative connectivity between the gene signatures of SARS-CoV2 infection and
HCQ treatment (Corley et al., 2020), IPA predicted a role of anti-malarials as limiting the
function of intracellular TLRs in the lung and also as a direct negative UPR of gene
expression abnormalities in the lung, suggesting a role in controlling COVID-19
inflammation and not viral replication. Further clinical testing may be necessary to test
this possible utility.
By comparing the transcriptomic profile of the blood, lung, and airway in COVID19 patients, a model of the systemic pathogenic response to SARS-CoV2 infection has
emerged (Graphical abstract). SARS-CoV2 infection leads to systemic Mo/MΦ
activation, likely as a result of the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from infected
cells.

Infiltration of immune cells into the lung tissue and alveolus, in particular,

neutrophils, LDGs, and pathogenic Mo/MΦ populations promotes a cycle of
inflammatory mediator release and further myeloid cell activation, which exacerbates
inflammation in the lung and leads to tissue damage. The local release of complement
components and clotting factors by infiltrating Mo/MΦ may contribute to both
inflammation and thrombotic events. As disease progresses, increased infiltration of
pro-inflammatory immune cells, release of inflammatory mediators, and damage to the
infected alveolus is reflected by the presence of Mo/MΦ cells and lung epithelial cells in
the airway (Heron et al., 2012). Furthermore, evidence of both Mo-derived inflammatory

MΦs and AMs in the airway compartment suggests that myeloid cell populations from
both the blood and the lung tissue are present in the BAL. The accumulation of virusinfected cells and release of alarmins in the airway may not only reflect ongoing
infection, but also promote inflammation and prevent resolution of the infection and
foster the continuation of the innate immune response. Therefore, sampling the BAL
fluid seems to be an effective strategy to monitor tissue inflammation and damage in
COVID-19 patients.
As SARS-CoV2 continues to propagate, viral clearance is impaired by a lack of
cytotoxic CD8 T cells and NK cells. This is consistent with MAS occurring in other
settings, in which defects in cytotoxic activity of CD8 T cells and NK cells result in
enhanced innate immune cell activation and intensified production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, many of which were also expressed in COVID-19 patients (Crayne et al.,
2019; McGonagle et al., 2020). Thus, we propose that the lack of activated CD8 T cells
and NK cells and subsequent failure to clear virus-infected cells, is a major contributor
to the MΦ-driven pathologic response to SARS-CoV2 observed in COVID-19 patients.
In order to develop a model of SARS-CoV2 infection, we have utilized multiple
orthogonal approaches to analyze gene expression from COVID-19 patients, but also
acknowledge the limitations of this data. For example, we were only able to analyze 2-3
samples per experimental condition and this limited the statistical power of each of our
bioinformatics techniques. In addition, the low number of samples meant that
heterogeneity among patients in any given cohort had an increased impact on the
overall outcome. One possible reason for this intra-cohort heterogeneity is that the
patients may have exhibited varying levels of disease severity and, unfortunately, we

did not have access to clinical information. These points highlight the need for additional
studies on more patients, preferably accounting for differences in demographic
information and disease status, in order to increase the power of downstream analyses.
In conclusion, transcriptomic analysis has contributed critical insights into the
pathogenesis of COVID-19. Diffuse Mo/MΦ activation is the likely primary driver of
clinical pathology. Therefore, this work provides a rationale for placing greater focus on
the detrimental effects of exaggerated activation of pathogenic Mo/MΦs and for
targeting these populations as an effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients.

Methods
Read quality, trimming, mapping and summarization
Publicly available data sets used in this study are listed in Table S1. RNA-seq
data were processed using a consistent workflow using FASTQC, Trimmomatic, STAR,
Sambamba, and featureCounts. As described below SRA files were downloaded and
converted into FASTQ format using SRA toolkit. Read ends and adapters were trimmed
with Trimmomatic (v0.38) using a sliding window, ilmnclip, and headcrop filters. Both
datasets were head cropped at 6bp and adapters were removed before read alignment.
Reads were mapped to the human reference genome hg38 using STAR, and the .sam
files were converted to sorted .bam files using Sambamba. Read counts were
summarized using the featureCounts function of the Subread package (v1.61.)

analysis.

Comparisons were made between control PBMCs and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients
(PBMC-CTL vs PBMC-CoV2) and control lung tissue and lung tissue from COVID-19
patients (Lung-CTL vs Lung-CoV2). Since no corresponding control BAL samples were
available for the COVID-19 BAL samples, we compared BAL samples from COVID-19
patients to COVID-19 PBMC (PBMC-CoV2 vs BAL-CoV2). This was possible because
these samples were analyzed on the same platform, run at the same time, and it was
done understanding the limitations of this analysis. We also compared normal BAL to
BAL of asthmatic individuals to identify genes unrelated to COVID-19 (PRJNA434133)
Two technical replicates were included for BAL cohort, and 4 technical replicates
were included for postmortem lung samples. The replicates were collapsed and
averaged into one using collapsereplicates function from DESeq2 package. The genes
with low expression (i.e genes with very few reads) were removed by filtration. The
filtered raw counts were normalized using the DESeq method and differentially
expressed genes were determined by FDR < 0.2 (Anders and Huber, 2010). Counts
were then log2 transformed and used for downstream analyses (Table S2).

The GSVA (Hänzelmann et al., 2013) (V1.25.0) software package is an open

(www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html). The inputs for the
GSVA algorithm were a gene expression matrix of log2 expression values for predefined gene sets (Table S3). All genes within a gene set were evaluated if the
interquartile range (IQR) of their expression across the samples was greater than 0.
Enrichment scores (GSVA scores) were calculated non-parametrically using a
Kolmogorov Smirnoff (KS)-like random walk statistic and a negative value for a
particular sample and gene set, indicating that the gene set has a lower expression than
the same gene set with a positive value. The enrichment scores (ES) were the largest
positive and negative random walk deviations from zero, respectively, for a particular
sample and gene set. The positive and negative ES for a particular gene set depend on
the expression levels of the genes that form the pre-defined gene set. GSVA calculates
enrichment scores using the log2 expression values for a group of genes in each SARSCoV2 patient and healthy control and normalizes these scores between -1 (no
enrichment) and +1 (enriched). Welch’s t-test was used to calculate the significance of
the gene sets between the cohorts. Significant enrichment of gene sets was determined
by p-value < 0.05.

Derivation of GSVA Gene Sets
All input gene sets used for GSVA analysis can be found in Table S3. Cellular
and inflammatory modules (Catalina et al. submitted manuscript) and IFN-induced gene
sets were previously derived (Catalina et al., 2019). Additional inflammatory pathways
(NLRP3 Inflammasome, Classical Complement, Alternative Complement, and Lectininduced Complement were curated from the Molecular Signatures Database. Other

signatures were derived from various publications (Culemann et al., 2019; Kotliarov et
al., 2020; Kuo et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2020; Martinez et al., 2006; Reyfman et al.,

Additional hematopoietic cellular gene signatures (monocyte, myeloid, and

lung cell gene sets were derived from T-Scope™, a tool developed to identify genes
specific for 45 non-hematopoietic cell types or tissues in big gene expression datasets.
The T-Scope™ database contains 1,234 transcripts derived initially from 10,000 tissue
enriched and 8,000 cell line enriched genes listed in the Human Protein Atlas. From the
list of 18,000 potential tissue or cell specific genes, housekeeping genes and genes
differentially expressed in 40 hematopoietic cell datasets were removed. The final gene
lists were checked against available single cell analyses to confirm cellular specificity.
Nine single-cell RNA-seq lung cell populations (AT1, AT2, Ciliated, Club,
Endothelial, Fibroblasts, Immuno Monocytes, Immuno T Cells, and Lymphatic
Endothelium) were downloaded from the Eils Lung Tissues set (Lukassen et al., 2020)
accessed by the UC Santa Cruz Genome Browser (https://eils-lung.cells.ucsc.edu).
Genes occurring in more than one cell type were removed. Additionally, genes known to
be expressed by immune cells were removed. The Eils Lung Tissues set Immuno
Monocyte, Immuno T Cell, Fibroblast, and Lymphatic Endothelium categories were not
employed in further analyses.

Apoptosis and NFkB gene signatures were derived and modified from Ingenuity®
Pathway Analysis pathways Apoptosis Signaling and NFkB Signaling. ROS-protection
was derived from Biologically Informed Gene-Clustering (BIG-C®).
Network analysis and visualization
Visualization of protein-protein interaction and relationships between genes
within datasets was done using Cytoscape (version 3.6.1) software (Table S4). Briefly,
STRING (version 1.3.2) generated networks were imported into Cytoscape (version
3.6.1) and partitioned with MCODE via the clusterMaker2 (version 1.2.1) plugin. For
PPIs in Figure 4A-C, STRING settings were adjusted to high confidence (0.7), for PPIs
in Figure 4D-F, settings were relaxed to medium confidence (0.4). All PPIs were
generated without the neighborhood or textmining features. For some PPIs, the average
interaction strength using STRING-based cumulative interaction scores was used to
determine the strength of interaction between clusters.

Functional and cellular enrichment analysis:
Functional enrichment of clusters was performed using Biologically Informed
Gene-Clustering (BIG-C®), which was developed to understand the potential biological
meaning of large lists of genes (Labonte et al., 2018). Genes are clustered into 53
categories based on their most likely biological function and/or cellular localization
based

using I-Scope™, a tool developed to identify immune cell specific genes in big data
gene expression analyses.
Statistically significant enriched types of cell types in DEGs are determined by Fisher’s
Exact test overlap p-value and then determining an Odds Ratio of enrichment.

Derivation of co-expressed myeloid subpopulations in each compartment
Co-expression analyses were conducted in R. Sample (control and patient) log2
expression values for each gene of the 221 identified monocyte/myeloid cell genes in
were analyzed for their Pearson correlation coefficient in each tissue compartment
(blood, lung, and airway) using the Cor function. Of note, only 196 of 221 genes had
changes in gene expression in at least one tissue by RNA-seq. Pearson correlations for
these 196 genes were hierarchically clustered by their Euclidian distance into 2 clusters
(k=2) using the heatmap.2 function in R. This resulted in 2 Mo/myeloid co-expressed
clusters in each compartment corresponding to increased and decreased gene sets.
The upregulated co-expressed genes were used to define the A1, A2, and A3 myeloid
subpopulations from the blood, lung, and airway compartments, respectively (Table
S5). The co-expressed myeloid populations in each compartment (A1-A3) were then
evaluated for enrichment by GSVA.

Inter-compartment myeloid gene comparisons
To compare relative expression of the 196 myeloid-specific genes among
compartments, HTS filtered log2 expression values for each gene were normalized to
the average expression of FCGR1A, FCGR2A, and FCGR2C in each sample. Welch’s

t-test was used to calculate the significant differences in normalized gene expression
between cohorts. Effect sizes were computed between cohorts using the cohen.d
function with Hedges’ correction in R.

Monocle
Trajectory analyses were performed with Monocle (Qiu et al., 2017a, 2017b;
Trapnell et al., 2014) version 2.14.0 in R. Gene expression values for 621 genes related
to myeloid cell differentiation and function including cell surface and secreted markers,
M1 and M2 markers, metabolism, and IFN genes were selected as a curated input list
(Table S5). The HTS filtered log2 expression values for each of these genes in each
sample for each tissue type (PBMC-CoV2, Lung-CoV2, and BAL-CoV2) was normalized
by the average log2 expression of FCGR1A, FCGR2A, and FCGR2C in that particular
sample as described above. Normalized expression of these genes was used as the
input expression data for Monocle. The CellDataSet was created with parameters of
lowerDetectionLimit = 0.01 and expressionFamily = uninormal(). Dimensions were
reduced using the DDRTree method, and the max_components parameter was set to 2.
Cell state was ordered based upon the state corresponding to PBMC-CoV2.

Linear Regression Analysis
Simple linear regression between calculated myeloid subpopulation A1, A2, and
A3 GSVA scores and biological functions or signaling pathway GSVA scores was
performed in GraphPad Prism Version 8.4.2. In all analyses where pathway genes (e.g.

classical complement) were also myeloid cell genes, these genes were removed from
the myeloid GSVA score for that comparison and kept in the pathway GSVA score. For
each regression analysis, the Goodness of Fit is displayed as the R squared value and
the p-value testing the significant of the slope is displayed. All p-values are displayed
with 3 digits and rounded-up unless rounding changes significance.
Ingenuity ® Pathway Analysis
The canonical pathway and upstream regulator functions of IPA core expression
analysis tool (Qiagen) were used to interrogate DEG lists. Canonical pathways and
upstream regulators were considered significant if |Activation Z-Score|≥2 and overlap pvalue<0.01. Chemical reagents, chemical toxicants, and endogenous non-mammalian
ligands were culled from all upstream regulator analyses.

Drug-Target Matching
IPA-predicted upstream regulators were annotated with respective targeting
drugs and compounds to elucidate potential useful therapies in SARS-CoV2. Drugs
targeting gene products of interest by both direct and indirect targeting mechanisms
were sourced by Combined Lupus Treatment Scoring (CoLTS)-scored drugs (Grammer
et al., 2016), the Connectivity Map via the drug repurposing tool, DrugBank, and
literature mining. Similar methods were employed to determine information about drugs
and compounds, including mechanism of action and stage of clinical development. The
drug repurposing tool was accessed at clue.io/repurposing-app.
