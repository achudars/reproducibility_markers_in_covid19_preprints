ABSTRACT
The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
has spread so much rapidly and severely to induce World Health Organization (WHO) to declare
state of emergency over the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While several countries have
chosen the almost complete lock-down for slowing down SARS-CoV-2 spread, scientific community
is called to respond to the devastating outbreak by identifying new tools for diagnosis and treatment
of the dangerous COVID-19. With this aim we performed an in silico comparative modeling analysis,
which allows to gain new insights about the main conformational changes occurring in the SARSCoV-2 spike protein, at the level of the receptor binding domain (RBD), along interactions with human
cells angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, that favour human cell invasion.
Furthermore, our analysis provides i) an ideal pipeline to identify already characterized antibodies
that might target SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, for preventing interactions with the human ACE2, and ii)
instructions for building new possible neutralizing antibodies, according to chemical/physical space
restraints and complementary determining regions (CDR) mutagenesis of the identified existing
antibodies. The proposed antibodies show in silico a high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and
can be used as reference antibodies also for building new high affinity antibodies against present
and future coronavirus able to invade human cells through interactions of their spike proteins with
the human ACE2. More in general, our analysis provides indications for the set-up of the right
biological molecular context for investigating spike RBD-ACE2 interactions for the development of
new vaccines, diagnosis kits and other treatments based on the usage or the targeting of SARSCoV-2 spike protein.

INTRODUCTION
Scientific community is called to respond to a pandemic of respiratory disease that has spread with
impressive rate among people of all the world. The new coronavirus has been called SARS-CoV-2
and the related disease indicated as COVID-19. WHO reports that positive patients in the world are
1353361 with 79235 (April 9th, 2020) ascertained died people due to COVID-19 complications. It also
appears that these numbers might be a smaller number of real cases due to our inability in
quantifying rescued or asymptomatic people.
In order to limit death rate and SARS-CoV-2 spread, it needs to develop a vaccine and to identify
new small molecules able to prevent or treat COVID-19 complications, as well as to prepare new
quick diagnosis kits, able to quantify the real number of people exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Among the
main actors of SARS-CoV-2 infection the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, RNA dependent RNA
polymerases and proteases deserve to be mentioned. Indeed, RNA dependent RNA polymerase
has become one of the main targets of a nucleoside analog antiviral drug, the remdesivir, already
used for reducing complications due to Ebola, Dengue and MERS-CoV infections (1–6). At the same
time viral protease inhibitors (7–10) are under investigation for their ability in preventing virus protein

(with specific reference to spike proteins) cleavage (11) leading to the fusion of virus proteins with
host cell membranes. Also anti-inflammatory antibodies/drugs in combination with anticoagulant
molecules are under investigation for limiting coagulopathies (12–15) and cytokine signaling
impressively triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection (16–20). Finally, the same SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein has become the most investigated target due to its ability in forming interactions with the
human ACE2 receptor, causing fusion events that make possible for the virus to penetrate host
human cells (21–23).
The crucial role played by the spike protein is also due to the possibility to use the recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for triggering immune response, working as a vaccine, that may help in
preventing and treating COVID-19, similarly to what proposed recently (24–26).
For clarifying SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms, several research groups have recently solved the
crystallized structure of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (6vsb.pdb (21); 6vxx.pdb and 6vyb.pdb
(22)), in pre-fusion conformation, and/or SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain in complex with the human
ACE2 (6vw1.pdb; 6lzg.pdb).
In light of the available cited crystallized/cryo-em solved structures, here we propose a strategy for
identifying/drawing new SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that
could be used for contrasting SARS-CoV-2 infection, aiming to prevent pre-/post-fusion spike
conformation interconversion, responsible for virus invasion, and to provide a molecular structural
context for studying new diagnosis kits based on the interactions between our engineered antibodies
and the human SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1. Crystal Structure Sampling Via Folding Recognition and multiple sequence alignments
(MSA)
CoV-Spike and ACE2 homologus protein-crystallized structures were searched by using the folding
recognition methods implemented in pGenThreader and i-Tasser according to our validated
protocols (27–30).
The sequences of the retrieved 48 crystallized structures (with reference to those crystallized
structures indicated with “Certain” or “High” confidence level in pGenThreader output) were aligned
by using ClustalW (31) implemented in the Jalview package (32). The 3D coordinates from the 48
crystallized structures were superimposed for comparative purposes by using PyMOL (33) according
to our validated protocols (29, 34).
Protein-protein and protein-ligand binding regions were highlighted by selecting residues within 4 Å
at the protein-protein interface or from the investigated ligands, in the superimposed structures.
All the generated 3D all atom models were energetically minimized by using the Yasara Minimization
server (35).

2.2. 3D atomic models preparation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in post-fusion conformation
and SARS-CoV-2 Spike-ACE2 interactions in pre-fusion conformations.
The 3D comparative model of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer in post-fusion conformation was built by
multi-template modeling by using Modeller (36). More in detail, the human SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein sequence was aligned to the sequences of the available entire post fusion conformation of
the murine coronavirus spike protein (6b3o, (37)) and the remaining available crystallized
subdomains of other coronavirus spike proteins in post fusion conformations (5yl9.pdb (38);
1wyy.pdb (39) and 1wdf (40)). Sequences of the cited crystallized structure fragments were used as
query sequences for sampling the corresponding entire spike monomer sequences, by reciprocalblastp, to be aligned with sequences of the investigated structures for comparative purposes. The
obtained MSA was used for driving the multi-template modeling.
Then a complex 3D model representing the pre-fusion spike trimer interacting with three ACE2
functional receptor units was built by superimposing the recently solved cryo-EM prefusion structure
of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complex (6vsb.pdb, (21); 6vyb.pdb and 6vxx.pdb (22)), the SARS-CoV2 spike RBD crystallized in complex with the human ACE2 (6vw1.pdb; 6lzg.pdb) the SARS-CoV-1
spike trimer interacting with one ACE2 functional receptor (conformations 1-3, 6acg.pdb, 6acj.pdb,
6ack.pdb, (41) and 6cs2.pdb, (42)), the SARS-CoV-1 spike-RBD crystallized in complex with the
human ACE2 (2ajf.pdb, (43)).
For investigating pre-/post-fusion conformation interconversion we superimposed the pre-fusion
available crystallized structures of SARS-CoV2 spike proteins and the generated 3D models about
pre-fusion conformation of the spike trimer in complex with three ACE2 units, to the obtained 3D
model of the post fusion conformation. All the generated 3D all atom models were energetically
minimized by using the Yasara Minimization server (35)

2.3 Antibody 3D modeling and mutagenesis
Starting from the 3D atomic coordinates of the crystallized neutralizing antibodies m396
(2dd8.pdb(44)) and S230 (6nb7.pdb, (45)) directed against the SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD domain, we
modelled the interactions of m396 and S230 (6nb7.pdb, (45)) with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain,
by superimposing the fragment antigen based (FAB) portions of m396 (2dd8.pdb (44)) and S230
(6nb7.pdb, (45) (both complexed with SARS-CoV-1 RBD) with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain,
complexed with ACE2 (6vw1.pdb), by using PyMOL.
For creating a more specific antibody directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, we replaced
residues of the CDR regions of the m396 crystallized FAB portion with residues that may
complement and fulfill better the SARS-CoV-2 RBD surface. Mutagenesis analyses and modeling of
the incomplete residues within the crystallized structures were performed by using SPDBV (46)
and/or PyMOL (47).

The proposed complete IgG chimeric antibodies were obtained by superimposing the above cited
m396 and the resulting engineered FAB portions, in complex with SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD, to the 3D
atomic model of a crystallized IgG, available on the PDB (1igt.pdb, (48)) by using SPDBV and
PyMOL, according to our validated protocols (29, 30, 49), that allow to model missing residues,
solving clashes and breaks in the backbone.
Each glycosylation ladder coming from the crystal structures here investigated (1igt.pdb; 2dd8.pdb;
6nb7.pdb) was alternatively retained within the generated structural models.
After superimposition operations, allowing backbone connections, we renumbered all the atoms and
the residues present in the resulting final pdb file, by using an in-house developed Perl script. The
obtained final models were examined in VMD, PyMOL, and SPDBV according to our protocols (30,
49). All the generated 3D all atom models were energetically minimized by using the Yasara
Minimization server (35).

2.4. Energy calculations
The FoldX AnalyseComplex assay, was performed to determine the interaction energy between the
four generated antibodies and the RBD domains of SARS-CoV-1/2 spike proteins, but also for
determining the interaction energy between ACE2 and the interacting spike RBDs for comparative
purposes.
The way the FoldX AnalyseComplex operates is by unfolding the selected targets and determining
the stability of the remaining molecules and then subtracting the sum of the individual energies from
the global energy. More negative energies indicate a better binding. Positive energies indicate no
binding (50, 51). The energy calculated for the crystallized m396-SARS-CoV-1 RBD protein complex
was used as a reference value.

RESULTS

3.1. Modelling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in post-fusion conformation.

The main event that allows virus envelop fusion with the host human cell plasma membrane
concerns a conformational change occurring at the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that converts from
pre-fusion conformation to post-fusion conformation after interactions with ACE2 and spike protein
cleavage. While SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer has been resolved by cryo-em (6vsb.pdb (21);
6vxx.pdb and 6vyb.pdb (22)), the post-fusion conformation is not available, yet. According to (11)
Coutard et al., protein cleavage at site S1/S2 and S2’ produces the division of the spike protein in
two subdomains, i.e. the N-ter S-I ectodomain (containing the RBD interacting with ACE2) and the
C-ter S-II membrane anchored subdomain, forming the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in post fusion

conformation, able to trigger the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell plasma membrane
determining host cell invasion.
For modelling 3D post-fusion conformation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein we searched for SARSCoV-2 spike protein homologous structures and found 48 crystallized structures that included poses
of the whole SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins or about protein domains of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in
complex with protein interactors (i.e. ACE2), several pre-fusion conformations of other coronavirus
spike proteins, one coronavirus spike protein in post-fusion conformation and three further protein
subdomains about spike proteins in post fusion conformation (Supp. Tab. 1).
Thus, we built a MSA by aligning the sequence of the human SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the
sequence of the available whole post fusion conformation of the murine coronavirus spike protein
(6b3o, (37)), sequences of the remaining crystallized subdomains of other coronavirus spike proteins
in post fusion conformations (5yl9.pdb (38); 1wyy.pdb (39) and 1wdf (40)), together with their
complete counterpart sequences sampled by reciprocal-blastp (Fig. 1).

whole protein or protein fragments observed in the post-fusion conformation from other coronavirus, resulting from
sequence cleavage. Panel a. Black boxes indicate the position of cleavage sites. In panel “a” it is reported the 6b3o.pdb
based sequence-structure alignment used for modeling the first portion of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in post fusion
conformation (amino acids S704-771A, YP_009724390.1 residues numbering). In panel “b” it is reported the 6b3o.pdb
based sequence-structure alignment used for modeling the second portion of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in post fusion
conformation (amino acids 922-1147, YP_009724390.1 residues numbering).

In the provided MSA (Fig. 1) it is possible to observe the conserved S1/S2 and S2’ cleavage sites,
according to (11) and the sequence of the C-terminal domain resulting from the cleavage.
Starting from the cited multi-template sequence alignment and according to our validated protocols
about multi-template 3D modeling (30, 36), we built the 3D model of a monomer of SARS-CoV-2
spike protein in post fusion conformation (Fig. 2). The modelled SARS-CoV-2 spike post-fusion
conformation consists of residues 704-771 and 922-1147, YP_009724390.1 residues numbering,
resulting from protein cleavage (11) and also the only protein fragments with a solved structure in

6b3o.pdb aligned (aminoacids 741-807 and 972-1248, NP_045300.1/6b3o.pdb residues numbering)
counterpart (37).
The trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in post fusion conformation was obtained by duplicating
two times the obtained monomer and superimposing the three SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monomers
on the three SARS-CoV-1 spike protein monomers reported in 6b3o.pdb (Fig. 2). The 3D
comparative model of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer built by multi-template comparative
modeling showed an RMSD lower than 0.5 Å with the murine coronavirus spike protein in post-fusion
conformation (6b3o.pdb). The resulting model (Fig. 2) appeared elongated and narrow, according to
what observed in fragments of the spike proteins crystallized in post-fusion conformations, whose
sequences are reported in Fig. 1 and whose PDB_ID are listed in Supp. Tab. 1.

colored representation.

3.2. Modelling of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human
ACE2 along pre-/post-fusion conformation interconversion.
Among the sampled crystallized structures, it was possible to observe three PDB_ID about the entire
SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and two about SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein interacting with the
human ACE2 (Supp. Tab. 1). Furthermore, it was possible to highlight several crystallized structures
about SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV spike proteins as single proteins or in complex with their
receptors or dedicated antibodies (Supp. Tab. 1). Notably, among the sampled structures, also the
four entries used for building the 3D comparative model of the post-fusion conformation, were
sampled (Supp. Tab. 1).

For modeling main interactions occurring between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2, thanks to
the high percentage of identical residues shared by spike RBD from several CoV strains (Fig. 3), it
was possible to structurally align three objects consisting of the human ACE2-SARS-CoV-1 spikeRBD protein complex (2ajf.pdb) to the human ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD protein complex
(6vw1.pdb, 6lzg.pdb) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer (6vsb.pdb; 6vxx.pdb; 6vyb.pdb).
More in detail, the superimposition performed by using PyMol was leaded by the structural alignment
of the RBD of ACE2-SARS-CoV1 (2ajf.pdb) and ACE-2-SARS-CoV-2 (6vw1.pdb, 6lzg.pdb) spike
proteins (Fig. 4), followed by the structure alignment with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer
(6vsb.pdb; 6vxx.pdb; 6vyb.pdb). Notably, we obtained an efficient superimposition of the two RBD
domains (RMSD lower than 0.5 Å) of the human SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins also
due to their high percentage of identical residues (> 75%).
It was possible to superimpose the crystallized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in pre-fusion conformation
and the modelled SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers in post-fusion conformation for showing the
deep conformational changes occurring along conformation interconversion (Fig. 4). Apparently, the
post-fusion conformation appears to be elongated and narrower than the pre-fusion conformation.
The top portion of the post-fusion conformation locates beyond ACE2 receptors (Fig. 4), known for
being anchored to plasma membrane and involved in internalization events (7, 41, 44, 45, 52).

cartoon representation with the 3 spike receptor binding domains reported in red (in the closed pre-fusion state) or green
(in the open pre-fusion state) cartoon. The open pre-fusion state allows establishing pre-invasion interactions with ACE2
N-terminal domain. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer C-terminal domain, resulting from protein cleavage that triggers the
post-fusion conformation, is reported in black cartoon representation in panel f (lateral view) and l (top view).

3.3. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues involved in direct interactions with ACE2
From the available crystallized structures and from the obtained 3D structure models it was possible
to highlight SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD (2ajf.pdb) and SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD residues (6) involved
in the binding of the human ACE2 (Fig. 5 and Supp. Tab. 1). Notably, ion pair interactions observed
between SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD and the human ACE2 are also observed between SARS-CoV-2
spike RBD and the human ACE2. The reported data represents an updated/integrated analysis of a
similar ones reported in (53), in light of the recently deposited SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in complex
with the human ACE2 (6vw1.pdb).

a pair or a cluster of residues involved in polar inter-protein interactions. Normal black residues indicate residues at the
Spike-RBD.vs.ACE2 protein interface distant less than 4 Å. The longest chains were chosen within those crystallized
structures with multiple chains, for highlighting the listed interacting residues.

3.4. Comparative analysis of existing SARS.CoV.1. Spike RBD directed neutralizing
antibodies and interaction predictions with SARS.CoV.2 Spike RBD.
RBD from SARS-CoV-1 was crystallized in complex with the FAB domain of two different antibodies,
namely m396 (2dd8.pdb, (44)) and S230 (6nb7.pdb, (45)). Both of them show high affinity for SARSCoV-1 spike RBD, being able to block attachment to ACE2 (44, 45). Nevertheless, they show
different peculiarities in their mechanism of action.
Indeed, S230 after binding RBD, similarly to ACE2, is able to trigger the SARS-CoV spike transition
to the post-fusion conformation and it is not clarified yet, if virus-cell fusion may be triggered by S230
also when S230-RBD interactions occurs close to the surface of the cells target of the SARS-CoV-1
(45). At variance with S230, m396 antibody appears to be able to prevent SARS-CoV-1 spike-ACE2
interactions and SARS-CoV-1 spike pre-/post-fusion conformation transition, neutralizing virus
attack (44).
Thanks to the high percentage of identical residues (> 75 %) between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV2 spike RBD domains and to their highly similar tertiary structure, as observed from the RMSD of
0.5 Å between the coordinates of RBDs from SARS-CoV-1 (6nb7.pdb, (45) and 2dd8.pdb, (44)) and
SARS-CoV-2 (6vw1.pdb (54) and 6vsb.pdb, (21)) spike proteins, it was possible to evaluate
interactions between m396 and SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and to propose a sequence/structure of an
ideal FAB m396-based chimeric antibody for targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain, preventing
fusion events with ACE2 and thus the following infection.
With this aim, we firstly highlighted the different RBD portions bound to the known antibodies. Then,
we superimposed SARS-CoV-1 RBD to SARS-CoV-2 RBD for highlighting differences in residues
involved in direct interactions with m396 CDR regions and with S230 CDR regions (Fig. 6 and Tab.
1).

3.5 SARS.CoV.2 Spike RBD directed neutralizing antibody engineering
Due to the uncertain data concerning fusion events and mechanism of action of S230 antibody, we
built a new SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD directed antibody starting from the analysis of monomer-monomer
interface interactions observed between the m396 antibody crystallized in complex with SARS-CoV1 RBD (44), superimposed to SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD / ACE2 complex (2ajf.pdb), and by comparing
them with monomer-monomer interface interactions observed between the modelled m396 antibody
in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, superimposed to SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 (6vw1.pdb; 6lzg.pdb)
protein complex (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7. Molecular framework of the investigated proteins hosting SARS-CoV-spike RBDs, light and heavy chain of the
m396 antibody and the human ACE2, simultaneously. The shown spike RBD, ACE2 and m396 protein portions are those
in a reciprocal distance range of 4 Å. Upper panel: Superimposition of the crystallized SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD (white
cartoon representation) in complex with m396 antibody (2d88.pdb, orange and blue cartoon) and ACE2 (2ajf.pdb, cyan

from 6vw1.pdb (cyan cartoon) and m396 from 2d88.pdb (orange and blue cartoon).

Then, we highlighted m396 CDR residues (Tab. 2) for replacing them aiming to increase m392
affinity versus SARS-CoV-1/2 spike RBDs. Residues to be mutated/replaced were chosen according

to space-restraints and chemical needs for better complementing SARS-CoV-1/2 spike RBD
surface, based on the available SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD structures in complex with ACE2, aiming to
produce something that resembled ACE2 surface (Tab. 1-2). Some of the proposed mutated
residues (Tab. 3) are surely allowed because already observed at the corresponding sites of other
known antibodies, according to Chotia/Kabat rules (http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/chothia.html; (55)).
Residues replacement was directly performed in the newly generated 3D model hosting the
interacting m396-SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Similarly, a complex of the modified m396 antibody
interacting with SARS-CoV-1 RBD was also created. All m396 CDR mutated residues are reported
in Tab. 3. Furthermore, mutated residues within m396 CDR interacting with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD
residues can be observed in Fig. 8.

view and perspective view of native m396 neutralizing antibody ( in orange blue cartoon) in complex with SARS-CoV-2
spike RBD (in white cartoon representation). Residues at the m396/RBD interface in a distance range withni 4 are indicated
by white sticks (RBD), orange sticks (m396 CDR-H residues) and blue sticks (m396 CDR-L residues). Panels c-d: exploded
view and perspective view of the engineered m396 predicted neutralizing antibody (in orange blue cartoon) in complex
with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (in white cartoon representation). Residues at the engineered m396/RBD interface in a

sticks (engieered m396 CDR-L residues).

The engineered FAB portions were thus aligned and superimposed on the FAB portion of a
crystallized IgG (1igt.pdb, (48)). The sequence of the chimeric antibodies can be observed in Supp.
Fig. 1, whereas their complete structure can be observed in Supp. Fig. 2.

3.6 Free energy calculation
The interaction energies calculated between the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain and m396 native
antibody FAB portion gives a negative value (Tab. 4), confirming that there might be a binding
interaction between m396 native antibody FAB portion and SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. This result is
encouraging, also due to the indirect validation obtained by getting similar interaction energies for
the crystallized SARS-CoV-1 RBD in complex with m396 (2d88.pdb) and for SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domains crystallized in complex with ACE2 (2ajf.pdb and 6vw1.pdb,
respectively) (Tab. 4). Furthermore, a strong interaction (in terms of interaction energies calculated
by FoldX Analyse complex assay) is also predicted between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (but also

engineered m396 might be more efficient than the native m396 in binding the SARS-CoV-2 (more

DISCUSSION
The indicated pipeline has allowed to set-up a molecular framework hosting SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein, ACE2 receptor and different antibodies in the same pdb session that could be handled with
different molecular visualizers. In this molecular framework it is possible to study and predict, at
molecular level, interactions between the different “pieces” of the framework that my help in
understanding virus invasion mechanisms, developing new vaccines or antibodies, identifying small
molecules with high affinity for viral proteins and establishing quick/safe diagnosis selective/specific
kits. Indeed, the scientific community is now focused in the development of new weapons for
containing SARS-CoV-2 spread and COVID-19 complications as it could be observed in the
enormous effort in developing new vaccines based on a virus protein/nucleic acid portion able to
induce an efficient and specific immunogenic response(56–60), or in developing a neutralizing
antibody highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (25, 26, 61–64), or in identifying chemicals with
high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 crucial proteins (1–3, 65–67).
Within the presented molecular framework, we have highlighted a set of possible efficient
interactions between the crystallized m396 antibody and SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, raising the
question about the possibility to test directly m396 on cultured cells exposed to the virus and then,
hopefully, on patients.
Starting from that observation we have also proposed a set of modifications of m396 CDR residues
resulting in a higher specific antibody, to be expressed and tested on cultured cells. Along the
development of our antibody engineering modeling session an important paper was published and
another is under revision in support of the hypothesis that m396 may be able to bind SARS-CoV-2
spike protein (61, 62).
It was also possible to pose in the proposed molecular framework the recent proposed SARS-CoV2 spike RBD directed CR3022 FAB antibody (6yla.pdb; 6w41.pdb, (62)), showing that it binds a
different site of RBD that protrudes towards the central cavity of the spike protein trimer (data not
shown). It appears that the RBD-antibody interaction is possible only if at least two RBDs on the
trimeric spike protein are in the "open" state of the prefusion conformation and slightly rotated, in a
site distant from ACE2 receptor binding region, according to what proposed by the authors (62).
Dedicated studies are necessary for understanding if steric hindering problems might rise by using
the whole antibody, and deepening the comprehension of the not competitive mechanism that would
be observed between CR3022 and RBD in presence of ACE2 receptor.
Studying all the cited interactions in the same pdb-molecular session has allowed to highlight maybe
the most crucial ACE2 portions involved in direct interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, suggesting
that the administration of the recombinant RBD, a spike monomer or the entire spike trimer, if
correctly folded, might result in the efficient triggering of antibody production from our plasma b-cells,
reducing COVID-19 complications (supporting what has been recently proposed (56–60)).

At the same time, the ACE2-RBD interactions estimated in our molecular framework has
strengthened the hypothesis to use the recombinant ACE2 for limiting COVID-19 infection
complications (according to what recently proposed (68, 69)).
A molecular framework like the ones here proposed will also help in studying the putative role of
ACE inhibitors in perturbing ACE2-RBD interactions. Indeed, it was recently proposed that patients
treated with ACE inhibitors might be more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection (70). Although ACE1
(refseq accession number: NP_068576.1, representing the main target of ACE inhibitors) and ACE2
(NP_690043.1, testis isoform or NP_000780, somatic isoform, among the most studied isoforms)
share the 40 % of identical residues, few uncertain data about ACE inhibitors and a possible greater
selectivity for ACE1 versus ACE2, or on their effect on ACE1/2 expression regulation are available
in literature (70, 71). From a structural comparison it is observed that the RMSD of the crystallized
native ACE2 coordinates (1r42.pdb, (72)) and ACE1 coordinates (1o8a.pdb, (73)) is lower than 2.5
Å.
Notably, the presence of ACE inhibitors captopril and enalaprilat (1uze.pdb,(74); 4c2p.pdb, (75)) and
lisinopril (1o86.pdb, (73)) produces an RMSD lower than 0.3 Å in the atomic coordinates of the cited
crystallized structures with reference to the native ACE1 (1r42.pdb, (72)).
Conversely, we cannot establish if the slightly higher RMSD observed between the native ACE2
(1r42.pdb) and ACE2 complexed with SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD (0. 41 Å, 2ajf.pdb) and SARS-CoV2 spike RBD (1.2 Å, 6vw1.pdb) can be attributed exclusively to interactions with SARS-CoV-RBD,
because the observed RMSDs are of the same order of magnitude of the experimental resolution of
the investigated crystallized structures.
However, also admitting that ACE1 inhibitors at the employed dosage would target ACE2, with the
same efficiency observed versus ACE1, the presence of those inhibitors in ACE2 binding cavity
should not be able to induce an important conformational change in ACE2, which might favour a
greater affinity of ACE2 versus SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD.
Thus, the only mechanism for which, patients treated with ACE inhibitors would be more exposed to
SARS-CoV-2, would rely in a positive feedback induced by ACE inhibitors in ACE2 expression.
Nevertheless, evidences in support of this hypothesis need to be deepened (71, 76).
In conclusion, the presented analysis highlights the importance to use fold recognition tools along
the approach to a drug design problem according to a rational protocol (similar to what previously
reported (29, 30, 49)), like the ones presented. Indeed, in this case, fold recognition tools have
helped us in identifying crystallized structures of ACE2, SARS-CoV-spike proteins similar to those
under investigation. Furthermore, performing structural comparative analysis has allowed to identify
a possible good starting point, like the ones represented by m396, already crystallized in complex
with SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD, for building the proposed antibodies. The same strategy might be

applied also for future infections by those researchers involved in drawing new antibodies and/or
developing new vaccines, i.e. for dealing with future coronaviruses.
To the best of our knowledge the reported SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer 3D model is the first
model describing a possible conformational change leading to a reliable SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
in post fusion conformation. The proposed model, based on the murine CoV spike protein (6b3o.pdb)
crystallized in post fusion conformation, will help in understanding the mechanism allowing the virus
envelop fusion with host cell plasma membranes, through and following interactions with ACE2.
Furthermore, the provided 3D model in post-fusion conformation according to the crystallized 3D
structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in pre-fusion conformation confirms the presence and stability
of a sort of channel at the interface of the three monomers that could represent a good target site of
a virtual screening of a chemical/drug library aiming to identify a small molecule/peptide with high
affinity for a monomer (similarly to what proposed for EK1 peptide (77)), for preventing trimer
formation and stabilization, or a small molecule/peptide with high affinity for the trimer, aiming to
prevent conformational changes leading to the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell plasma
membranes. The screening of a drug library would help in identifying an already approved drug with
high affinity for the spike channel, that might be immediately tested on the bed-side, in the context
of the drug-repositioning approaches (78, 79).
Notably, the provided molecular framework for investigating/drawing new antibodies based on
space-restraints needs, would be used for the set-up of new antibodies based on the available
tissue-specific immunoglobulin structures, as the proposed IgG2A (1igt.pdb, (48)) or other
specialized antibodies, already optimized for targeting specific cells or receptors (i.e.1hzh.pdb, (80)),
also among those that may successfully target the respiratory tract (1r70.pdb, (81) or 2qtj.pdb (82)
or 6ue7.pdb (83)), that might be administered even by aerosol (84, 85).
At the same time, already at the preclinical level, the administered vaccines based on the
administration of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ((56–58) or on the administration of the single
SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, will induce the production of specific antibodies that might be sequenced
and modelled in silico. On this concern, the provided molecular network will help in quantifying
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD (also in cases of different RBD variants (86)) and the newly
investigated antibodies, i.e.lower the calculated binding energy in the modelled complex, higher the
likelihood to have more success with the investigated vaccines/antibodies.
The discovered antibodies with the highest affinity for RBD might also be implemented in a diagnosis
kit aiming to the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 in sera, also in asymptomatic people.
Conversely, a new diagnosis kit could also be based on the native RBD or a modified synthetic RBD,
with greater affinity for the detected human antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD

protein, for determining the real number of healthy people already exposed to the virus in the
population.
The lacking knowledge about the real number of people exposed to the virus (including
asymptomatic people, people with mild symptoms and rescued people that never needed
hospitalization or quarantine) is the only important data that we still miss. Without data about the real
number of people, exposed to the virus, in the population, coming back to normal life will be
extremely slower.
