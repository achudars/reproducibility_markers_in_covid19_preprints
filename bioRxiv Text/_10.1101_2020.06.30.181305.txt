Assessment of Proton-Coupled Conformational Dynamics of SARS and
MERS Coronavirus Papain-like Proteases: Implication for Designing
Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Inhibitors

Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent future ones. The novel
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is
an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines
and histidines and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report
the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant
pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pKa ’s support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological
pH, among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations
revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271/270, in agreement with the crystal
structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling
both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine. Our work provides a starting point for more
detailed mechanistic studies to assist structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.

INTRODUCTION

Over the last two decades, three coronaviruses have caused
deadly epidemics, threatening the global human population.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) caused an outbreak in 2003, and a related Middle-East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused an
outbreak in 2012. Today the world is facing the pandemic of
the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which shares about 82% genome
sequence identity with the original SARS-CoV1 . All three
viruses are thought to have originated from animal reservoirs
and zoonotic transmission into the human population has led
to the outbreaks2 . Currently, no effective treatment exists for
any of the three coronavirus diseases; thus, there is an urgent
need to understand the potential therapeutic targets and develop inhibition strategies.
Following the release of the coronavirus genome from the
acidic endosome, the replicase polyproteins are translated and
subsequently self-cleaved by two cysteine proteases to produce the functional non-structural proteins (Nsps) that are required for viral replication. The papain-like protease (PLpro)
located in Nsp3 produces Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3, while the
3C-like or main protease located in Nsp5 cleaves 11 sites
downstream of Nsp4.2–6 In addition to the proteolytic function, CoV PLpro counteracts the host cell innate immune
response by deactivating signaling cascades that lead to the
impairment of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
interferons.7,8 The former is accomplished through a deubiquitinating (DUB) activity which leads to the removal of ubiquitin from signaling proteins,9 and latter through the deIS-

Gylating activity which leads to the removal of ISG15 from
IRF3.10 Thus, PLpro is a critical player in the viral life cycle
and as such an attractive drug target for stopping COVID-19
and other coronavirus outbreaks.
Most recently, the first (and only) two X-ray structures
of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro were determined (PDB 6W9C and
6WRH, Osipiuk, Joachimiak et al., to be published). The
PLpro monomer (about 300 residues), which is the predominant form in solution11 , is comprised of an independent Nterminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain (first 62 residues) and
a C-terminal catalytic domain (Fig. 1a and b). The latter
folds in a canonical thumb-palm-fingers like structure, with
the Ubl domain anchored to the thumb. The interface between
the thumb (residue 107-113, 162-168) and palm (residue 269279) forms the substrate binding site leading to the catalytic
triad of the active site comprised of Cys111, His272, and
Asp286 (Fig. 1b). The substrate binding site is solvent exposed and flanked by a flexible β -hairpin loop called the
blocking loop 2 or BL2 (G266-G271). The fingers subdomain
contains a zinc finger coordinated by four cysteines, which
upholds the structural integrity and is essential for the PLpro activity12 . The structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is nearly
identical to that of SARS-CoV PLpro13 , as expected from the
highly similar sequences (96% similarity and 83% identity,
Fig. 1c). In contrast, although the structure of MERS-CoV
PLpro overlays well with the SARS-CoV PLpro structures,
small differences are visible (Fig. 1a), as expected from the
larger sequence differences (66% similarity and 30% identity
with SARS-CoV PLpro, Fig. 1c).
All three CoV PLpros are rich in Cys and His residues.
SARS-CoV/CoV-2 PLpro contains 8/11 Cys and 11/9 His,
while MERS-CoV PLpro contains 14 Cys and 10 His residues
(Fig. 1c). Among them, 5 Cys and 2 His residues are conserved among all three PLpros, including the catalytic Cys
and His. Cys and His have model pKa ’s of 8.6 and 6.5, re-

spectively; thus, in model compounds or peptides at physiological pH 7.4, they are both predominantly neutral, i.e., Cys
is protonated and His is singly protonated. However, in the
protein environment, a small pKa downshift for Cys or upshift for His may occur, leading to a significant population of
or a complete switch to the alternative protonation state, i.e.,
negatively charged, deprotonated Cys and positively charged,
doubly protonated His.
Protonation state switch is an important energy transduction mechanism to enable functionally required conformational changes in biology. For example, the coronavirus spike
protein makes use of protonation state switches to induce large
conformational changes required for membrane fusion14,15 .
Our previous work demonstrated that proton-coupled conformational dynamics can be studied by continuous constant pH
molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations16 to obtain deeper
understanding of the structure-function relationships17 and inhibition mechanisms18–20 of aspartyl proteases.
Towards understanding the (possibly) proton-coupled
structure-function relationship and assisting broad-spectrum
inhibitor design, here we report the pKa calculations and preliminary assessment of proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in comparison to SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV PLpros. The work employed the recent GPU
implementation21 of the GB-Neck2 implicit-solvent based
CpHMD method22 as well as the conventional fixed-charged
MD in Amber1823 . The simulations allowed us to determine
the protonation states of all titratable sites, including the catalytic Cys-His-Asp triad, offering a timely knowledge to facilitate MD studies of PLpros in the community. Importantly,
we tested a hypothesis regarding the proton-coupled conformational plasticity of the BL2 loop, which modulates substrate and inhibitor binding. The contrasting features among
the three CoV PLpros have implications for designing broadspectrum antiviral inhibitors.

METHODS AND PROTOCOLS

a. System Preparation. The coordinates were retrieved
from the protein data bank (PDB): SARS-CoV PLpro
(PDB 2FE813 ), SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (PDB 6W9C, Osipiuk,
Joachimiak et al., to be published), and MERS-CoV PLpro
(PDB 4RNA24 ). If multiple chains were available in the xray crystal structure, only the first chain was used. Any small
molecules or solvent were removed. For each structure, the
acetylated N-terminus and amidated C-terminus along with
all missing hydrogens were added using the CHARMM program (C36b2)25 . In the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (PDB 6W9C), a disulfide bond is present in the fingers
subdomain in place of a zinc ion. Considering that zinc ion
cannot be represented in implicit-solvent simulations, we removed the zinc ion and added an analogous disulfide linkage
between the closest non-adjacent cysteine pairs in all other
structures to maintain the integrity of the fingers subdomain.
The disulfide linkage should not affect the pKa ’s of discussed
residues, as they are located far away in other subdomains
(Fig. 1a). Following the addition of hydrogens and disulfide

2

bridge, the structure was subject to a 20-step energy minimization with the heavy atoms restrained, and a 20-step energy minimization with all atoms restrained but the disulfide
bonded cysteine pairs. The minimization used 10 steps of
steepest decent and 10 steps Newton-Raphson methods. From
there the force field parameters and coordinate files were constructed from the CHARMM output with the LEAP utility
in AMBER.23 The ff14sb force field26 was used to represent the protein, and the GB-Neck2 (igb=8) implicit-solvent
model27 was used to represent solvent. The mbondi3 intrinsic Born radii were modified for improving titration simulations of His28 and Cys29 sidechains. The structure was then
energy minimized and equilibrated in the GB-Neck2 implicit
solvent27 , following our previous protocol21 . The energy minimization was performed using the steepest decent algorithm
for 5000 steps and the conjugate-gradient algorithm for 1000
steps. The equilibration was performed at pH 7 in four stages,
each having 2000 MD steps with gradually decreased restraining force constants of 5, 2, 1, and 0 kcal/mol/2 . The final
structure was used for CpHMD titration simulations.
b. pH replica-exchange CpHMD simulations. The titration simulations were performed using the GPU-accelerated
GBNeck2-CpHMD method28,30 in the pmemd engine of
AMBER18.23 An asynchronous version (Liu, Harris, Shen,
unpublished) of the pH replica-exchange protocol16 was implemented to allow replica exchange to be performed on a
single GPU card. Our previous work showed that pH replicaexchange enhances both protonation and conformational state
sampling, allowing pKa ’s to rapidly converge.16,30,31 In the
protocol, 9 pH replicas were placed at pH values ranging from
pH 4.5 to 8.5 at an interval of 0.5 pH units. An exchange of
two adjacent pH conditions was attempted every 1000 MD
steps (or 2 ps). Each replica was run for 55 ns, resulting in
an aggregate time of 495 ns for each. The λ values were
recorded after each exchange attempt. All sidechains of Asp,
Glu, His, Cys, and Lys were allowed to titrate, with their titration model parameters taken from our previous work.28–30 An
ionic strength of 0.15 M was used to represent the physiological salt condition. Simulations were run at a temperature of
300 K and an effectively infinite cutoff (999 Å) for nonbonded
interactions. SHAKE was used to constrain bonds involving
hydrogens to allow for a 2-fs time step.
c. Conventional all-atom fixed-charge MD simulations.
To support the findings from the GB-CpHMD simulations,
two all-atom MD simulations were carried out for SARSCoV-2 PLpro (PDB 6W9C), using the predicted protonation
states for Asp, Glu, His, Cys, and Lys at pH 8.5. Two additional runs were carried out using the protonated form of
Cys270. All simulations were performed with Amber1823 .
The protein and water were represented by the ff14SB26 and
TIP3P32 force fields. The initial structure was placed in a truncated octahedron box of water molecules. Long-range electrostatic interactions were handled by using the Particle Mesh
Ewald method33 . A non-bonded cut-off of 8 Å was used with
a time step of 2 fs. The starting structure underwent energy
minimization by applying 5000 steps of steepest descent, followed by 5000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization with
a force constant of 25 kcal/mol/Å2 applied to the solute heavy

atoms. The force constant was reduced to 5 kcal/mol/Å2 and
the system was heated from 100 K to 300 K for 50 ps. Following heating, solvent was equilibrated in the NPT ensemble
for 250 ps using the isotropic Berendsen barostat34 and with
the same force constant. Subsequently, the restraints were removed and the system was further relaxed for 100 ps in the
NPT ensemble. Finally, two production runs of 1 µs each
were performed for each system starting from a different random initial velocity seed. All analysis was performed with
the Amber module CPPTRAJ35 . The first 300 ns from each
trajectory was discarded.

see supplementary material. For the ease of discussion, we refer to the “standard” protonation states as the default settings
in the MD programs, i.e., deprotonated Asp/Glu (negatively
charged), deprotonated His (neutral), with one proton on either δ or ε nitrogen, protonated Cys (neutral), and protonated
Lys (positively charged). Our simulations showed that several
Cys, His residues and one Asp are in the “non-standard” protonation state or can switch to this state at physiological pH
in all three PLpros (Table I). A complete list of the calculated
pKa ’s are given in supplementary material.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We performed pH replica-exchange CpHMD simulations
to estimate the pKa values of Asp/Glu/His/Cys/Lys sidechains
and assess possible proton-coupled dynamics in SARS-CoV,
SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV PLpros. The titration simulations were conducted in the pH range 4.5–8.5 and lasted 55 ns
per replica (aggregate simulation time of 495 ns for each protein). The protonation states were well converged. Consistent
with our previous work31 , we found that the protonation states
of His residues converge rapidly within 10 ns per replica, and
those of Cys converge more slowly due to the formation of hydrogen bonds that are not present in the crystal structure (see
later discussion). The time series analysis of protonation state
sampling and replica walks along the pH ladder are given in

a. Protonation states and hydrogen bond network of the
catalytic triad. We first consider the catalytic triad in SARSCoV-2 PLpro. The catalytic Cys111 is located in the thumb,
His272 is located in the foothill of the palm adjacent the
flexible loop BL2, and Asp286 is located at the end of β 18
(Fig. 1b). Currently, no measured pKa data are available. Biochemical experiments of SARS-CoV PLpro suggested that the
Cys serves as a nucleophile, while the His functions as a general acid with the assistance of a negatively charged Asp12 ;
however, it is unclear whether the reactive nucleophile is the
thiolate of the Cys· · ·His ion pair or the neutral thiole which
becomes deprotonated upon binding of the substrate4 . The
calculated pKa ’s of Cys111 and Asp286 are <4.5, whereas
the pKa of His272 is >8.5, indicating that the catalytic triad
residues are all in the charged state at physiological pH. Thus,
our data supports the mechanism in which the reactive nucleophile is the thiolate ion, rather than the neutral thiol that
needs to be first activated by the substrate.4
The CpHMD simulations showed that the Cys-His-Asp
triad maintains a catalytic geometry through several hydrogen
bonds, which support their protonation states. The catalytic
His272 forms a hydrogen bond simultaneously with Cys111
and Asp286 in the entire pH range 4.5–8.5, stabilizing His272
in the doubly protonated state and Asp286 and Cys111 in the
deprotonated states (Fig. 2a and d). The doubly protonated
form allows His272 to perform its role as a general acid.4 The
catalytic Cys111 forms a hydrogen bond not only with His272
but also with the indole nitrogen of Trp106, which provides
further stabilization for the thiolate form and explains the significant downshifted pKa relative to the solution value of 8.5
(Table I). The Cys111· · ·Trp106 hydrogen bond is important,
as it maintains the position of Trp106; the analogous residue
in SARS-CoV PLpro has been hypothesized as the oxyanion hole residue that donates a hydrogen bond to stabilize the
negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate developed in the
course of peptide hydrolysis.13 The three hydrogen bond interactions in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro are consistent with those in
SARS-Cov PLpro (Fig. 2b).
In MERS-CoV PLpro, Trp106 is replaced with a Leu,
which is incapable of forming a hydrogen bond with the catalytic Cys or with the negatively charged intermediate. The
has been hypothesized as a cause for the significantly lower
catalytic activity of MERS-CoV as compared to SARS-CoV
PLpro36 . In addition to the missing Cys· · ·Trp hydrogen bond,
CpHMD simulations of MERS-CoV PLpro showed that the
hydrogen bond between the catalytic His and Asp is nearly
abolished (Fig. 2c). The loss of hydrogen bond interactions involving the catalytic His and Cys appears to provide less stabilization to the respective charged states in MERS-CoV PLpro,
as suggested by the partial titration at the highest and lowest
pH condition, respectively (see supplementary material). To
test whether the loss of hydrogen bond network affects the
flexibility of the regions near the catalytic triad, we calculated
the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) of the Cα atoms
of the catalytic triad and nearby 5 residues (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the RMSFs of the loop residues that are sequence
neighbors of the catalytic triad in MERS-CoV PLpro are increased as compared to those in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV

PLpros, which are similar except for the flexible BL2 loop
(267–271) region. The loop (106–116) adjacent to α4 which
harbors the catalytic Cys, the BL2 loop next to the catalytic
His, and the β -hairpin loop next to the catalytic Asp all display enhanced mobility (Fig. 3a and b). The largest increase
in RMSF is seen for the BL2 loop, whereby the RMSF in
MERS-CoV PLpro is nearly doubled relative to SARS-CoV-2
PLpro, which shows a somewhat higher mobility than SARSCoV PLpro. The extremely high flexibility of the BL2 loop in
MERS- as compared to SARS-CoV PLpro is consistent with
the lack of electron density for the region in the first X-ray
structure of the apo MERS-CoV PLpro36 .
b. Proton-coupled conformational dynamics of the BL2
loop in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 PLpro. The BL2 loop is perhaps
the most prominent feature of the substrate binding site in
SARS-CoV PLpro, as its movement modulates the substrate
and inhibitor binding4 . Crystal structures show that BL2 is
open in the unbound SARS-CoV PLpro and it closes by about
1.5–2 Å in the bound form, which allows hydrogen bonds to
form between Tyr269/Gln270 and the inhibitor4 . Upon inspection of the X-ray structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, We
noticed that the BL2 loop is open in the pH 7.5 structure (PDB
6W9C) and a zinc ion is found within the binding distance of
Cys270; however, in the structure determined at pH 4.5 (PDB
6WRH), the BL2 loop closes in by 1.9 Å (Cα distance between Tyr268 and Asp164) and the zinc ion is absent. Thus,

we hypothesized that the BL2 loop dynamics is coupled to the
titration of C270.
CpHMD titrations gave the pKa ’s of 6.7 and 6.9 for Cys270
in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and the equivalent Cys271 in SARSCoV PLpro, respectively (Table I). Thus, Cys270/C271 samples both protonated and deprotonated states at physiological
pH. The pKa downshifts relative to the model Cys pKa of 8.5
is due to the formation of local hydrogen bonds which favors
the thiolate state. In the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, Cys270 does not interact with Thr265. The titration simulations showed that the distance between Cys270 and Thr265
varies widely between 5 and 15 Å, when Cys270 is protonated (λ value close to 0); however, when Cys270 is deprotonated (λ value close to 1), the distance is locked to 1.5–2.5
Å, indicating the formation of a hydrogen bond (Fig. 4a). In
addition to the hydroxyl group of Thr265, the deprotonated
Cys270 can also accept a hydrogen bond from the backbone
amide groups of His272 and Gly271, stabilizing the charged
state (Fig. 4b). The same hydrogen bonds were also formed
in the simulations of SARS-CoV PLpro, which explains the
similarly downshifted pKa of the equivalent Cys271.
To test the hypothesis that protonation/deprotonation of
Cys270 modulates the BL2 dynamics, we examined the Cα
distance between Tyr268 on the BL2 loop and the conserved
Asp164 next to α7, which represents the width of the S3 subpocket (Fig. 4c and d). The equivalent Tyr269 in SARSCoV PLpro is an important residue, as it forms a hydrogen bond with the inhibitors that bind to the S3 pocket4 .
When Cys270 is protonated, the probability distribution of
the Tyr268–Asp164 distance covers a broad range of 8–20 Å
with a peak at around 12 Å; however, when Cys270 is depro-

tonated, the distribution samples a narrower range of 14–20
Å with a peak at around 16 Å (Fig. 4c). Thus, the CpHMD
data suggests that the deprotonated Cys270 is correlated with
the BL2 conformations that are more open and rigid, which
might be attributed to the aforementioned hydrogen bond formation between the deprotonated Cys270 and the surrounding
residues. Turning to SARS-CoV PLpro, Fig. 4c shows that the
BL2 movement is coupled to the protonation/deprotonation
of the analogous Cys271. However, in SARS-CoV PLpro, it
appears the BL2 with a deprotonated Cys270 can sample a
wider range of 10–20 Å as compared to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro,
although the peak remains around 16 Å. The wider range of
BL2 movement may be attributed to the somewhat weaker hydrogen bonds involving the deprotonated Cys271. The movement of the BL2 loop is very similar between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 PLpros when Cys270 is protonated.

lent Thr274–Asp164 distance for MERS-CoV PLpro at physiological pH (Fig. 5a and Fig. 4d) show that the widest position of the BL2 loop is about the same across the three PLpros;
however, the BL2 in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro samples the narrowest range, followed by SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV
PLpro which samples the widest range between 5–22 Å. The
enhanced flexibility of the BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro may
be attributed to the lack of a Cys equivalent to Cys271/270
in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 PLpro which can form hydrogen bonds
with neighboring residues to restrict the loop motion and perhaps also the loosening of the nearby catalytic His which no
longer forms double hydrogen bonds as in SARS-CoV/CoV-2
PLpro.
In agreement with the BL2 dynamics described with the
protonated and deprotonated states of Cys270 (Fig. 4c) and
the X-ray structures determined at pH 7.5 (PDB 6W9C) and
pH 4.5 (PDB 6WRH), a significant pH dependence is observed with the BL2 dynamics in the simulations of SARSCoV-2 PLpro (Fig. 5). In the simulation at pH 7.5, the BL2
loop samples a state that leaves the S3/S4 subpocket more
open, similar to the neutral pH crystal structure (Fig. 5c). In
the simulation at pH 4.5, the BL2 loop assumes a wide range
of dynamics, allowing it to sample a state that leaves the S3/4
subpocket more closed, similar to the low pH crystal structure
(Fig. 5c).
d. The Ubl domain contains an Asp with a highly upshifted pKa . As expected, nearly all Asp/Glu residues adopt
standard protonation states (i.e. charged) at physiological pH;

however, Asp12 in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro has a pKa abnormally
upshifted from its model pKa of 4.0 to 6.7 (Table I), making it possible to occasionally sample the protonated state at
pH 7.4. Trajectory analysis suggested that this upshift is in
part due to the protonated Asp12 acting as a hydrogen bond
donor to either (deprotonated) Glu67 or Asn15 (Fig. 6a and c),
which stabilizes the protonated state. The two hydrogen bonds
are mutually exclusive such that Asp12 is a hydrogen bond
donor 82–96% of the time when it is in the protonated state
(Fig. 6a). In addition to hydrogen bonding, Asp12 is buried in
a hydrophobic pocket with a very low solvent accessible surface area, which increases as Asp12 becomes deprotonated
at higher pH (Fig. 6b). In SARS-CoV PLpro, the analogous
Asp13 experiences a similar degree of hydrogen bonding and
solvent sequestration, resulting in a upshifted pKa of 5.9. In
MERS-CoV PLpro, the analogous Asp11 primarily donates a
hydrogen bond to Asn15, as the analogous residue to Glu67 is
missing (see supplementary material). Compared to Asp12/13
in SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro, Asp11 is more solvent exposed
in the lower pH range (see supplementary material), which
may contribute to a smaller degree of pKa upshift of Asp11 in
MERS-CoV PLpro as compared to SARS-CoV/CoV-2 PLpro.

pH. His74/73 located on the C-terminal end of α2 in SARSCoV/CoV-2 has a pKa of 7.3/7.3. Analysis suggested that
the pKa upshift relative to the model value of 6.5 is due to
the formation of hydrogen bonds with Phe70/69, Asn129/128

6 as Cys270 becomes fully protonated in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
(Fig. 2a).
To test the effect of Cys270 titration on the BL2 conformation, we calculated the probability distribution of the Cα distance between Tyr268 and Asp164. For the trajectories with
protonated Cys270, the distribution displays a single peak at
about 11 Å; however, for the trajectories with deprotonated
Cys270, a second peak appears at about 17 Å (Fig. 8b). This
data indicates that deprotonated Cys270 is correlated with the
more open BL2 loop conformations, consistent with the findings from the GB-CpHMD simulations (Fig. 4c). However,
due to the slow transition between the open and closed BL2
loop conformations in explicit solvent, more trajectories or
longer simulations are needed to solidify the conclusion.

which stabilizes the charged state. His90/89 located on the Cterminal end of α3 in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 has a pKa of 7.0/6.9.
Analysis showed that a small pKa upshift relative to the model
pKa is due to the stabilization of the charged state by the
occasional hydrogen bonding with the backbone carbonyl of
Ser86/85 or transient salt-bridge interaction with Asp107/108
located near the oxyanion hole of the CoV PLpro (see supplementary material). His176/175 is located on the C-terminal
end of α7 and opposite to His74/73. The increased pKa of
7.4/7.3 can also be attributed to local hydrogen bonding, either with His172 in SARS-CoV-1 or Tyr171 in SARS-CoV-2
PLpro (see supplementary material).

f. All-atom fixed-charge MD of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. To
provide support for the protonation states determined by GBCpHMD titrations and test the proton-coupled dynamics of
the BL2 loop, we performed conventional all-atom fixedcharge MD simulations of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with the catalytic sidechains fixed in the charged states and Cys270 fixed
in the protonated or deprotonated state. All other residues
were fixed in the standard protonation states. Two 1-µs trajectories were obtained with each Cys270 protonation state.
Consistent with the GB-CpHMD simulations at physiological
pH, the catalytic triad remained very stable, with the hydrogen
bond between His272 and Cys111 being the strongest, followed by the His272· · ·Asp286 and Cys111· · ·Trp106 hydrogen bonds, as shown in the hydrogen bond occupancy plots
(Fig. 8a). Interestingly, while the effect of Cys270 protonation/deprotonation appears negligible for the latter two hydrogen bonds (occupancy change is below 5%) , protonation of
Cys270 weakens the His272· · ·Cys111 hydrogen bond (occupancy decreases by over 20%). This decrease is consistent
with the GB-CpHMD data, which shows that the catalytic
His· · ·Cys hydrogen bond is significantly weakened below pH

CONCLUDING DISCUSSION

The protonation states and possible proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro were investigated
in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros, using
the GPU-accelerated GBNeck2-CpHMD titration simulations
with a new asynchronous pH replica-exchange scheme as well
as conventional all-atom MD. The simulations showed that the
catalytic Cys, His, and Asp are charged in the entire simulation pH range of 4.5–8.5 for all three PLpros, which supports
the mechanism in which the reactive nucleophile is the thiolate ion and the catalytic His serves as a general acid stabilized
by the catalytic aspartate. The catalytic triad in SARS-CoV2/CoV PLpro forms a hydrogen bond network among themselves and with a nearby Trp which serves as an oxyanion hole
residue to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate developed in
the peptide hydrolysis. In contrast, the hydrogen bond with
Trp is missing and the hydrogen bond between the catalytic

His and Asp is nearly abolished in MERS-CoV PLpro, consistent with the significantly lower catalytic activity compared
to SARS-CoV PLpro36 . Interestingly, the lack of a hydrogen bond network for the catalytic triad in MERS-CoV PLpro
is correlated with increased mobility of nearby loop residues,
particular the BL2 loop.
The simulations revealed that several titratable residues
have shifted pKa values such that they switch between two
protonation states at physiological pH. These include three
His and one Cys residues unique to SARS-CoV-2/CoV and
one Asp residue common to all three PLpros (Table I). Of
particular interest is Cys270/271 on the flexible BL2 loop of
SARS-CoV-2/CoV, which has a pKa of 6.7/6.9 and samples
both the standard thiol and charged thiolate forms at neutral
pH. CpHMD simulations showed that the BL2 loop samples
an open or a closed conformational ensemble with deprotonated or protonated Cys270/271, respectively, consistent with
two crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro determined at
neutral and low pH conditions and the conventional all-atom
MD trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with either deprotonated or protonated Cys270. Thus, the simulation data and
experiment together support our hypothesis that the BL2 loop
conformation is coupled to the titration of C270/271 in SARSCoV-2/CoV PLpro.
An induced fit mechanism, by which BL2 closes in to form
hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor, has been proposed in designing potent inhibitors targeting the S3/S4 pocket of SARSCoV PLpro4 . Our finding suggests that in the absence of a
ligand, protonation of C270/271 induces the closure of BL2
in SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro, which raises the possibility that
a conformational selection mechanism may be operative, in
which inhibitor binding shifts the BL2 conformational population to the closed form, perhaps by favoring the protonation of C270/271. While the unliganded crystal structures
show that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is more open than in
SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro, CpHMD simulations suggest that
BL2 has an increased flexibility in MERS-CoV PLpro and it
can sample closed conformations. This finding challenges a
current hypothesis, according to which SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors do not bind to MERS-CoV PLpro due to the more
open BL2 loop as a result of the sequence difference and one
extra residue24,37 . A main caveat of our work is the use of
the GB-Neck2 implicit-solvent model27 . Although it has been
demonstrated in the accurate de novo folding simulations of
nearly two dozen small proteins with α and β topologies38 ,
inherent issues such as the lack of solvent granularity may
limit the accuracy of detailed conformational representation.
Nonetheless, our work provides a starting point for further
mechanistic investigations using higher-level approaches such
as the all-atom CpHMD39 and more extensive conformational
sampling to assist the structure-based drug design targeting
the coronavirus PLpros.
