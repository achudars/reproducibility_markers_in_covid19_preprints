Abstract

14

Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019

15

(COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing more than a million deaths. The

16

SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody

17

responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling

18

infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the

19

transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of

20

antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines

21

rapidly after the resolution of the infection.

22

Study Design and Methods: To extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed

23

a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike

24

in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively

25

expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based

26

assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors.

27

Results and Conclusion: We found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-

28

CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related

29

to the number of donations, but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies

30

and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline

31

of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when

32

to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion.

Introduction

34

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute

35

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and as of October 2020, has caused over a

36

million deaths worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The transfusion of

37

convalescent plasma for the treatment of respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses, such as

38

SARS-CoV-1, has been successful to improve patient outcome 1. Its use has now been initiated

39

as an adjunctive therapy for patients with COVID-19 and several clinical trials are underway (for

40

example NCT04412486 and NCT04342182). Preliminary findings have suggested improvements

41

in the patients’ clinical status after convalescent plasma treatment 2-5.

42

Currently, the dynamics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation.

43

Of importance is the highly immunogenic trimeric Spike (S) glycoprotein, which is the target of

44

neutralizing antibodies (Abs) and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells via its receptor-

45

binding domain (RBD) that interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)

46

neutralization activity of plasma from convalescent donors has been suggested to be important

47

for clinical improvement and is a factor of consideration in screening convalescent plasma

48

However, several studies have shown that antibody titers and neutralization activity against S,

49

including RBD-specific Abs, decrease during the first weeks after resolution of infection

50

Furthermore, despite most neutralizing Abs being RBD-specific 12-14, studies have isolated potent

51

neutralizing Abs that are specific to other epitopes on the S trimer, mainly directed against the N-

52

terminal domain of the S1 subunit (NTD)

53

elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection were found to target two major immunodominant regions on the

54

S protein, such as the fusion peptide region and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) of the S2 subunit

55

Thus, current plasma screening processes using only recombinant RBD to determine

56

seropositivity and antibody titers for convalescent plasma therapy could overlook antibodies

57

specific to multiple epitopes on the viral spike. Here we have developed a high-throughput flow-

58

cytometry assay that is based on the recognition of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein

expressed on the surface of 293T cells. This method allows for the detection of antibodies binding

60

to various conformations and domains of the Spike. We used this method to screen longitudinal

61

convalescent plasma samples from 15 donors to determine the antibody response to the full Spike

62

over time.

64

Material and Methods

65

Convalescent plasma donors

66

Recovered COVID-19 patients were recruited mostly following self-identification and through

67

social media. All participants have received a diagnosis of COVID-19 by the Québec Provincial

68

Health Authority and met the donor selection criteria for plasma donation in use at Héma-Québec.

69

They donated plasma at least 14 days after complete resolution of COVID-19 symptoms. Males

70

and females with no history of pregnancy meeting the above criteria were invited to donate

71

plasma, after informed consent. A volume of 500 mL to 750 mL of plasma was collected by

72

plasmapheresis (TRIMA Accel®, Terumo BCT). Seropositive donors donated additional plasma

73

units every six days, for a maximum of 12 weeks. All work was conducted in accordance with the

74

Declaration of Helsinki in terms of informed consent and approval by an appropriate institutional

75

board. Convalescent plasmas were obtained from donors who consented to participate in this

76

research project at Héma-Québec (REB # 2020-004).

77
78

Transfection and transduction of 293T cells

79

293T human embryonic kidney cells (obtained from ATCC) were maintained at 37°C under 5%

80

CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Wisent) containing 5% fetal bovine serum

81

(VWR) and 100 μg/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Wisent). The plasmid expressing the full-length

82

SARS-CoV-2 Spike was kindly provided by Stefan Pöhlmann and was previously reported 7. 293T

83

cells were transfected with 10 μg of Spike expressor and 2 μg of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)

84

expressor (pIRES-GFP) for 2×106 293T cells using the standard calcium phosphate method. For

85

the generation of 293T cells stably expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, transgenic

86

lentiviruses were produced in 293T using a third-generation lentiviral vector system. Briefly, 293T

87

cells were co-transfected with two packaging plasmids (pLP1 and pLP2), an envelope plasmid

88

(pSVCMV-IN-VSV-G) and a lentiviral transfer plasmid coding for a GFP-tagged SARS-CoV-2

89

Spike (pLV-SARS-CoV-2 S C-GFPSpark tag) (Sino Biological). Supernatant containing lentiviral

90

particles was used to transduce more 293T cells in presence of 5μg/mL polybrene. The 293T

91

cells stably expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike (GFP+) were sorted by flow cytometry.

92
93

Cell surface staining and flow cytometry analysis

94

293T cells transfected with a Spike expressor or 293T-Spike cells were stained with the anti-RBD

95

CR3022 monoclonal Ab (5 μg/ml) or plasma (1:250 dilution). AlexaFluor-647-conjugated goat

96

anti-human IgG (H+L) Abs (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. The percentage of

97

transfected/transduced cells (GFP+ cells) was determined by gating the living cell population

98

based on viability dye staining (Aqua Vivid, Invitrogen). Samples were acquired on a LSRII

99

cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo v10.5.3 (Tree Star).

100

The seropositivity threshold was established using the following formula: (mean of all COVID-19

101

negative plasma + (3 standard deviation of the mean of all COVID-19 negative plasma) + inter-

102

assay coefficient of variability).

103
104

Statistical analyses

105

Statistics were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Every

106

dataset was tested for statistical normality and this information was used to apply the appropriate

107

(parametric or nonparametric) statistical test. P values < 0.05 were considered significant;

108

significance values are indicated as ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.

Results

110

Generation and characterization of a 293T-Spike cell line

111

To develop a high-throughput flow cytometry assay able to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies

112

in plasma from convalescent donors, we generated a cell line stably expressing the full-length S

113

glycoprotein. Third-generation transgenic lentiviruses encoding for SARS-CoV-2 S were used to

114

transduce 293T cells. Since the S glycoprotein is fused to a C-terminal GFP tag, 293T-Spike cells

115

were sorted by flow cytometry based on GFP expression. The presence of cell-surface S was

116

confirmed using the anti-RBD CR3022 monoclonal Ab and plasma from SARS-CoV-2 infected

117

individuals. Specificity was confirmed using pre-pandemic healthy donor plasma (Figure 1A). For

118

our high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay, parental 293T and 293T-Spike cells were mixed

119

at an equal ratio and incubated with plasma from convalescent donors. Spike-specific antibodies

120

were detected by adding a fluorescent anti-human IgG (H+L) secondary antibody. The signal was

121

measured by flow cytometry and background signal measured on parental 293T cells (GFP

122

negative) was subtracted for specificity. Signal obtained with plasma from 10 COVID-19 negative

123

donors were used to define a limit of detection for seropositivity (Figure 1B, C).

124
125

Longitudinal decline of Spike-specific antibodies in plasma from convalescent donors

126

Recently, a longitudinal analysis was performed to measure the RBD-specific antibody response

127

in convalescent plasma from 33 to 114 days post-symptom onset using a semi-quantitative ELISA

128

18

129

donated at least 4 times. A decrease in RBD-specific antibody titers between the first and last

130

donations was observed for all 15 donors tested and this decline was shown to depend on time

131

post-recovery but not on the number of donations. To extend this observation beyond the RBD

132

domain, we used our high-throughput flow-cytometry based assay using the 293T-Spike cells to

133

measure the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in these

134

convalescent plasma samples. Antibodies against S also decreased over time in these plasma

. This cohort consisted of 11 males and 4 females (median age of 56 years old) and plasma was

135

samples, with the decrease being significant ~74 days post-symptom onset onwards (Figure 2A).

136

This finding was corroborated using a previously characterized flow-cytometry method to quantify

137

SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies using 293T cells transiently transfected with a plasmid

138

encoding the full-length Spike 10,11,19-21 (Figure 2B), and the MFI obtained from both these methods

139

correlated significantly (r = 0.9207, p<0.0001) (Figure 2C). Results obtained with both flow

140

cytometry assays, using transduced or transfected 293T cells, also positively correlated with the

141

levels of RBD-specific antibodies as quantified by ELISA in the recently published study using the

142

same cohort

143

with the number of donations (r = 0.1379, p = 0.6217) but rather correlated with the time elapsed

144

between onset of symptoms and last donation (r = 0.5645, p = 0.0284) (Figure 2D).

18

(Figure 2C). Of note, the decline of total anti-Spike antibodies did not correlate

145
146

Discussion

147

There are many serodiagnosis platforms that have recently been approved for emergency use

148

authorization (EUA) by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this study, we developed

149

a high-throughput flow-cytometry based serodiagnosis tool by developing a cell line stably

150

expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike to screen for anti-Spike antibodies in plasma of COVID-19

151

patients. Although our study shows data with plasma from only 15 donors, this assay can be

152

readily adapted to a large-scale plasma screening with a high-throughput screening (HTS) plate

153

reader for flow cytometry. In addition, we also expanded on recent findings showing a decrease

154

in RBD-specific antibodies in convalescent plasma over time by showing that the level of

155

antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike also declines gradually after resolution of

156

infection. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the

157

SARS-CoV-2 Spike and suggest that plasma should be collected rapidly after recovery from

158

active infection in order to keep high levels of anti-Spike antibodies which are supposed to provide

159

a clinical benefit in convalescent plasma transfer.
