Abstract
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causal agent of
COVID-19 and stands at the center of the current global human pandemic, with death toll
exceeding one million. The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of
various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple and rapid
platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies towards
the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this study, we present the design of a lipid
nanoparticles (LNP)-encapsulated receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA vaccine.
Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase mRNA reporter assay,
and two leading LNPs formulation have been chosen for the subsequent RBD mRNA
vaccine experiment. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD mRNA elicited robust
humoral response, high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular
response in BALB/c mice. These novel lipids open new avenues for mRNA vaccines in
general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2, is a novel coronavirus
identified as the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). This
coronavirus stands at the center of the current global human pandemic, with recent
reports of more than 36 million cases and over one million deaths worldwide

[1]

. The

urgent need for a vaccine has led to an unprecedented recruitment of academic
laboratories, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies around the world, which translated
into a wide array (>180) of pre-clinical and clinical studies being conducted in an effort
to develop an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [2]. These vaccine candidates can be
classified into several categories: inactivated/live attenuated virus, recombinant viral
vector, recombinant protein, DNA vaccine and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine.
The mRNA vaccine platform has developed extremely rapidly in the past few years,
mainly due to advances in mRNA stabilization and the introduction of efficient delivery
methods that originated largely from the siRNA field. mRNA vaccines hold several
advantages over traditional vaccine approaches such as inactivated/ live attenuated,
subunit or DNA-based vaccines: This platform poses no potential risk of infection or
genome integration, does not require entry to the nucleus, and can be developed very
rapidly and easily. This last advantage has been demonstrated very clearly in the current
COVID-19 pandemic, with the development of an mRNA vaccine by Moderna directed
against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, with only 66 days from sequence selection to
first human dosing [3].
One of the main challenges in mRNA therapy is efficient delivery of mRNA to target
cells and tissues. High susceptibility to degradation by omnipresent ribonucleases

(RNases), together with inherent negative charge, hinder the successful delivery of
mRNA to cells and subsequent translocation across the negatively charged cell
membrane. Hence, successful mRNA delivery requires a carrier molecule which will
protect it from degradation, and facilitate cellular uptake. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are
a clinically advanced, non-viral delivery system for siRNA, approved by the FDA

[4]

. In

the past few years, LNPs have emerged as one of the most advanced and efficient mRNA
delivery platforms. Recent reports demonstrate antigen-encoded mRNA encapsulated in
lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) as a potent vaccine platform for several infectious
diseases including viral infections such as HIV, CMV, Rabies, influenza, Zika, and most
recently SARS-CoV-2

[3,5-10]

. LNPs are generally comprised of four components: 1) an

ionizable lipid, which promotes self-assembly of the LNPs; 2) cholesterol as a stabilizing
agent; 3) a phospholipid for support of lipid bilayer structure; and 4) a polyethylene
glycol (PEG)-lipid, which increases the half-life of the molecule. Of these, the ionizable
lipid is a key player for efficient intracellular delivery of the mRNA. The ionizable lipid
facilitates mRNA encapsulation, promotes interaction with cell membrane, and is
suggested to play a part in endosomal escape, a key step in the delivery of mRNA into the
cytoplasm, and subsequent translation of the protein of interest [11].
Our lab previously demonstrated the design and synthesis of novel ionizable amino lipids
for efficient siRNA delivery to leukocyte subsets

[12]

. Herein, we have selected several

structurally different ionizable lipids and screened for in vivo mRNA-LNPs delivery for
vaccine applications. The screen yielded two LNP formulations, which were chosen for
further immunization studies using SARS-CoV-2 RBD mRNA. These experiments
demonstrated the development of a specific humoral and cellular response against the

Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). Additionally, we measured Th1/Th2 specific
cytokine secretion in response to LNP-RBD mRNA vaccination.

Results
LNPs preparation and physicochemical characterization
The structures of the new amino lipids are shown in Figure 1A. The lipids were
structurally different in their head group region, linker and lipid tails. LNPs were
produced by mixing of lipids and mRNA through micro fluidic mixture device. A
schematic illustration of LNP synthesis is shown in Figure 1B and described in details in
the materials and methods section. The resultant mRNA-LNPs were small and uniformly
distributed as evidenced by small hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index (PDI),
measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 1C). Except lipid 5, the mean size of
the LNPs was less than 100 nm in diameter. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
analysis supported the DLS data, showing small and uniform size distribution of the
particles (Figure 1D).

In vivo luciferase expression screen shows two distinct formulations with superior
protein expression.
In order to evaluate the in vivo efficiency of the LNPs in terms of distribution, protein
expression efficiency and kinetics, we conducted a luciferase mRNA-based in vivo
screen. Animals were injected via the intradermal (i.d.), intramuscular (i.m.) or
subcutaneous (s.c.) routes with 5ug luciferase-mRNA encapsulated with one of the five
LNP-based formulations, represented herein as LNP #2, #5, #10, #14, #15, and luciferase
expression was evaluated daily using IVIS. As shown in Figure 2, LNPs #14 and #15
were superior to other formulations in terms of protein expression level and its duration
in all three routes of administration. Since i.d. and i.m. injections exhibited higher and
more prolonged protein expression, further immunization studies were conducted using
these routes of administration. We chose to proceed with LNPs #2, #14, and #15.
Although not showing relative advantage in terms of protein expression in vivo, we chose
to include LNP #2 in order to eliminate the possibility of a discrepancy between in vivo
luciferase expression and the resulting immunologic response.

Immune response to luciferase expression
Next, we examined the immune response that was developed against the luciferase
protein. Intramuscular-immunized mice were bled and sacrificed 4 weeks after
immunization with LNP-encapsulated luciferase mRNA. A panel of assays including
ELISA for the detection of anti-luciferase antibodies, and ELISpot for evaluation of
luciferase-specific cellular response were tested. While the humoral response was limited,
with no statistically significant differences between the vaccinated animals and the

control naïve mice, as expected after a single dose administration (Figure 3A), a
substantial cellular response was detected when splenocytes were stimulated with the
luciferase protein. Interestingly, immunization with LNPs #2 and #14 yielded a
significantly stronger (~3 fold and ~5 fold, respectively) cellular response compared to
LNP #15 (Figure 3B). Based on these results, we decided to perform the following
vaccinations with the two leading formulations #2 and #14.

Female BALB/c mice were intramuscularly administered with 5g LNPs-luc mRNA or

evaluation of luciferase-specific humoral (panel A) and cellular response (panel B), as
described in the materials and methods section. Statistical analysis was performed using
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (n.s., not significant; *p<0.05, **p<0.01).

including receptor-binding domain (RBD), and S2 subunits

[13]

. For our vaccine platform,

we chose the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 as the target antigen for the mRNA coding sequence,
as described in the materials and methods section. Mice were immunized i.m. or i.d. with
either naked RBD mRNA (5g), LNPs-encapsulated (#2 or #14) RBD mRNA (5g), or
Empty LNPs. We also included a recombinant RBD (rRBD) study group, which was
immunized (s.c.) with a recombinant RBD protein (10g) for comparison with the
mRNA vaccinated groups. In all groups, a prime-boost vaccination regimen was
employed, with animals being primed at day 0, and boosted 25 days later. Blood and
spleens were collected at day 23 (pre-boost) and 39 (14 days post-boost) for evaluation of
immune responses (see outline in Figure 4A).

Serum and spleen were collected at days 23 (“pre-boost”) and 39 (“post-boost”) after
initial vaccination. Panel A- Schematic diagram of immunization and sample collection.
Panel B- SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibody titer was determined by ELISA.
Panel C- PRNT50 titers were determined post-boost using a VSV-based pseudovirus
PRNT assay. Panel D- SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific cellular response was determined by
ELISpot. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
multiple comparisons test (for ELISA data) or an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (for
PRNT50 and ELISpot data) (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001).

As can be seen in Figure 4B, pre-boost humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 spike was
limited, both in mRNA (naked or LNP-encapsulated) and rRBD-vaccinated mice.
However, a robust antibody response could be detected 14 days after the boost in both
LNP-encapsulated mRNA and recombinant protein groups, while no response was
observed in the naked mRNA group. While both LNP formulations exhibited a boost
effect at the i.m. route, a differential antibody response was observed at the i.d. route
between LNP #2- and #14-encapsulated RBD mRNA, with only the latter yielding a
substantial anti-RBD titer (>10,000) (Figure 4B). Most importantly, this differential
response was also evident in the post-boost VSV neutralizing assay, where i.d. LNP #14encapsulated RBD mRNA vaccination induced a significant neutralizing response, while
no neutralizing activity was apparent in LNP #2-encapsulated RBD mRNA vaccinated
mice (Figure 4C). Immunization with rRBD also led to a robust boost effect in terms of
anti-spike and neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, no significant difference was
observed between vaccinations with the recombinant RBD protein alone or in the
presence of the CFA/IFA adjuvant.
The cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in the ability of the
immune system to overcome infection [14,15]. We thus evaluated the cellular response that

developed after immunization with LNP-encapsulated RBD or rRBD by using the
ELISpot method for quantification of IFN-secreting cells. In contrast to the humoral
response, which was very limited before boost administration, a clear specific cellular
response was observed 23 days after priming, particularly in mice that were vaccinated
via the i.m. route.
A significant increase in specific cellular response was observed after boost
administration in both i.m. and i.d. routes of administration, and in both LNP
formulations of the RBD mRNA. Conversely, immunization of mice with recombinant
RBD did not lead to a significant cellular response, and the post-boost elevation in IFN
secretion was not statistically significant (Figure 4D).
We next evaluated the Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion profile of LNP RBD mRNA
vaccinated mice. As shown in Figure 5 (and Figure 4D of ELISpot results for IFN
response), a specific and statistically significant secretion of IFN and IL-2 was observed
in vaccinated mice compared to vehicle treatment, both before and after boost
administration. In contrast, Th2 cytokines were either below limit of detection (IL-4) or
in comparable levels in vaccinated versus vehicle-treated animals (IL-10).

Discussion
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as
a global pandemic, risking most of the earth’s population health, and leading towards a
worldwide economic crisis since its outbreak. Numerous vaccination platforms have been
recently employed in the quest for an effective vaccine against the virus. mRNA-based
vaccines have been extensively explored in the last few years for immune therapy
applications and viral infections. Due to its negative charge and stability issues, mRNA
molecules need suitable agents for intracellular delivery. LNPs are one of the most
clinically advanced and commonly used tool for mRNA delivery [16].
In the present study, we developed LNPs-encapsulated mRNA as a vaccine platform.
Endosomal escape of LNPs is a key step for endosomal release and functional activity of

mRNA therapeutics. Towards this, several structurally-different lipids were chosen from
our previous work. Lipid #2 and #5 contain hydrazine linker and lipids #10, #14 and #15
contains ethanolamine linker. However, the hydrophobic lipid tails chosen from
fusogenic linoleic tails or acid sensitive mixed hydrophobic lipid tails. We compared
these lipids in the form of LNPs for their ability to deliver mRNA and facilitate protein
expression in mice, by employing commonly used routes of administration. First, we
conducted a luciferase-based screen to evaluate protein expression efficiency and
kinetics. IVIS data showed that two of these formulations, LNP #14 and #15, were more
potent in terms of both level and duration of luciferase expression, as was measured by
the luminescence signal after luciferin injection.
Next, we examined the immunologic response that developed against the expressed
luciferase protein. The immunogenicity of the luciferase protein has been demonstrated
previously [17], and we speculated that in vivo mRNA delivery efficiency would correlate
with the resulting immunological responses. While the humoral response was rather
limited, as one would expect after a single immunization, a substantial cellular response
was recorded against the luciferase protein. Interestingly, immunization with LNP #2, led
to a robust cellular immune response that was comparable to that of LNP #14 despite a
lower and shorter-lived luminescent signal. This shows that one should take caution in
making predictions regarding immunogenicity based on protein expression patterns. The
elicitation of a significant immune response depends ultimately on the extent to which the
delivered antigen is taken up by antigen presenting cells (APC), which migrate to lymph
nodes and induce T cell activation and subsequent production of immune mediators. It is
therefore possible, that in the case of LNP #2, while the IVIS data indicated a more

limited pattern of luciferase expression, the tissues and cell types in which the protein
was expressed, enabled the establishment of a more robust immune response. This issue
will be further addressed in future studies that will evaluate tissue and organ-specific
luciferase expression.
Given the robust cellular response observed in animals injected with LNPs #2 and #14,
these formulations were used for the subsequent vaccination experiment with SARSCoV-2 RBD mRNA. The RBD protein was chosen as an antigen for immunization based
on recent data demonstrating the importance of the RBD domain in SARS-CoV-2
vaccine design, by elicitation of protective immunity by an RBD-based DNA vaccine

[18]

and a recombinant RBD-based vaccine [19].
Mice were vaccinated in a prime-boost regimen with naked RBD mRNA, LNPencapsulated RBD mRNA or recombinant RBD.
Firstly, naked RBD mRNA immunization was unable to elicit detectable humoral or
cellular responses before or after the boost, suggesting that the mRNA was most likely
degraded

and

response.

Conversely, mice immunized with LNP RBD mRNA developed substantial anti-spike
IgG titers, a robust cellular response, and high levels of neutralizing antibodies after
boost administration in both intramuscular and intradermal groups. Interestingly, while
the pre-boost humoral response was largely undetected in these immunization groups,
ELISpot analysis demonstrated that a cellular response could be detected at that early
stage, particularly in mice immunized intramuscularly, demonstrating the importance of
characterization of the cellular response in SARS-CoV-2 immunization studies.
While the two LNP formulations, #2 and #14, led to comparable humoral and cellular

16

responses in intramuscularly-immunized mice, formulation #14 exhibited superior
immunogenicity following intradermal administration of LNP RBD mRNA. This effect
was most pronounced at the PRNT assay results (Figure 4C, middle panel). The observed
cellular responses induced by LNP #14 may be attributed to their ability to activate APC
via i.d. and i.m. administration, whereas LNP #2 is proficient via i.m. route only. This
interesting observation suggests that not only LNPs structure but also route of
administration needs to be considered for future clinical development of vaccines.
A large number of recombinant protein vaccines are currently in pre-clinical
development, and several spike/RBD-based vaccines have entered clinical trials

[2]

. In

order to evaluate the relative efficiency of our LNP-based mRNA vaccine, we performed
a recombinant RBD immunization experiment in parallel, using a standard protein
immunization protocol (a prime-boost s.c. administration of recombinant protein in the
presence of an adjuvant)

[20]

. Although displaying comparable anti-RBD IgG and VSV

neutralizing titers, the recombinant RBD immunization was unable to mount a significant
cellular response as was recorded in the LNP RBD mRNA vaccine groups (Figure 4).
These data demonstrate the inherent advantage of mRNA vaccination over recombinant
protein vaccination in elicitation of immune response. While recombinant protein
vaccination is dependent upon antigen uptake by APC, intracellular antigen expression
following mRNA vaccination eventually leads to efficient peptide epitope MHC class I
presentation which facilitates cytolytic T lymphocyte priming (in addition to helper T
cell response). This combined activation of the two T cell subtypes yields a robust, long
term humoral and cellular response, which may account for the apparent cellular response

we observe following LNP RBD mRNA vaccination, and not after recombinant RBD
immunization.
Two major concerns in the development of a safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) and vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease
(VAERD), which could worsen the clinical manifestations of infection

[21]

. Since these

two phenomena have been linked with a T helper 2 cell-biased response [21], we evaluated
Th1 (IFN, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine secretion in response to stimulation of
splenocytes from vaccinated mice with SARS-CoV-2 spike. Our data demonstrate that
both mRNA LNP formulations induced a Th1-biased cellular response towards the spike
protein.
In summary, we report here an LNP-based RBD mRNA vaccine which was designed
using a preliminary in vivo screen of structurally-different ionizable lipid-based LNPs.
Several groups have recently reported evidence of immunogenicity and efficacy of LNPbased RBD mRNA vaccines

[22-25]

, but have not referred to the issue of LNP lipid

composition. The physicochemical properties of the ionizable lipids may have dramatic
effects on delivery and protein expression efficiency, and should be considered upon
LNP-based mRNA vaccine design.

(San Diego, CA, USA). The Fc-conjugated RBD mRNA was designed to include the
exact translated Fc-RBD protein sequence as the recombinant protein.

LNP preparation and characterization
LNPs were synthesized by mixing one volume of lipid mixture of ionizable lipid, DSPC,
Cholesterol and DMG-PEG (40:10.5:47.5:2 mol ratio) in ethanol and three volumes of
mRNA (1:16 w/w mRNA to lipid) in acetate buffer. Lipids and mRNA were injected in
to a micro fluidic mixing device Nanoassemblr® (Precision Nanosystems, Vancouver
BC) at a combined flow rate of 12 mL/min. The resultant mixture was dialyzed against
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) for 16 h to remove ethanol.
Particles in PBS were analyzed for size and uniformity by dynamic light scattering
(DLS). Zeta potential was determined using the Malvern zeta-sizer (Malvern Instruments
Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). RNA encapsulation in LNPs was calculated according to
Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).

Animal vaccination experiments
For in vivo LNP formulations screen, groups of 6-8-week-old female BALB/c mice were
administered intramuscularly (50l in both hind legs), intradermally (100l) or
subcutaneously (100l) with luciferase mRNA (5g) encapsulated with five different
LNP formulations (LNPs #2, #5, #10, #14, #15). Luciferase expression was monitored as
described in the bioluminescence imaging studies section. 28 days post-intramuscular
injection, serum and spleen were collected from mice for evaluation of the immunologic
response that developed towards luciferase.
For RBD mRNA vaccination studies, groups of 6-8-week-old female BALB/c mice were
administered intramuscularly (50l in both hind legs) or intradermally (100l) with
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA (5g) encapsulated with LNP formulations #2 or #14.
For recombinant RBD (rRBD) vaccination studies, groups of 6-8-week-old female
BALB/c mice were administered subcutaneously (100l) with hFc-rRBD (10g), hFcrRBD emulsified in complete/incomplete Freund's adjuvant (CFA/IFA), or adjuvant
alone as control.
Both RBD mRNA- and recombinant RBD- immunized animals were boosted at day 25
with the same priming dose administered on day 0. Serum and spleens were collected on
day 23 ("pre-boost") and 49 ("post-boost") for evaluation of immunologic response
towards SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and measurement of cytokine secretion.

Bioluminescence Imaging Studies
Bioluminescence imaging was performed with an IVIS Spectrum imaging system
(Caliper Life Sciences). Female BALB/c mice were administered D-luciferin (Regis
Technologies) at a dose of 150 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Mice were anesthetized after
receiving D-luciferin with a mixture of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg )
and placed on the imaging platform. Mice were imaged at 5 minutes post administration
of D-luciferin using an exposure time of 60 seconds. Bioluminescence values were
quantified by measuring photon flux (photons/second) in the region of interest using the
Living IMAGE Software provided by Caliper.

ELISA
ELISA was performed for the detection of luciferase- or SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific
antibodies in immunized mouse sera. MaxiSORP ELISA plates (Nunc) were pre-coated
with recombinant luciferase (0.4g/ml, Promega, #E1701) or spike protein (2g/ml)
overnight at 4oC in carbonate buffer. Plated were washed three times with PBST
(PBS+0.05% Tween-20) and blocked with 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, #A8022) in PBST
for 1 h at 37 oC. After three washes with PBST, plates were incubated with serially
diluted mouse sera for 1 h at 37 oC. Following washing, goat anti-mouse alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Labs, #115-055-003) was added
for 1 h at 37 oC. The plates were washed with PBST and reactions were developed with
p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (PNPP, Sigma-Aldrich, N2765). Plates were read at
405 nm absorbance and antibody titers were calculated as the highest serum dilution with
an OD value above 2 times the average OD of the negative controls.

Cytokine assays
Splenocytes from immunized mice were incubated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein (10g/ml). Culture supernatants were harvested 48 h later and analyzed for
cytokines by ELISA techniques with commercially available kits. IL-2 (DY402), IL-4
(DY404) and IL-10 (DY417) kits were obtained from R & D Systems, Minneapolis,
Minn.

Murine IFN ELISpot Assay
Mice spleens were dissociated in GentleMACS C-tubes (Miltenyi Biotec), filtered,
treated with Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, #R7757), and washed. Pellets
were resuspended in 1ml of CTL-Test™ Medium (CTL, #CTLT 005) supplemented with
1% fresh glutamine, and 1 mM Pen/Strep (Biological Industries, Israel), and single cell
suspensions were seeded into 96-well, high-protein-binding, PVDF filter plates at
400,000 cells/well. Mice were tested individually in duplicates by stimulation with
recombinant luciferase (13g/ml, Promega, #E1701), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
(10g/ml), Concanavalin A (Sigma-Aldrich, #0412) (2g/ml) as positive control, or CTL
medium as negative control (no antigen). Cells were incubated with antigens for 24 h,
and the frequency of IFNγ-secreting cells was determined using Murine IFN SingleColor Enzymatic ELISPOT kit (CTL, #MIFNG 1M/5) with strict adherence to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Spot forming units (SFU) were counted using an automated
ELISpot counter (Cellular Technology Limited).

Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT)
VSV-spike [27]stocks were prepared by infection of Vero E6 cells for several days. When
viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, media were collected, clarified by
centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at -80oC. Titer of stock was determined by plaque
assay using Vero E6 cells.
For plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), Vero E6 cells (0.5*10 6 cells/well in 12well plates) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, MEM non-essential
amino acids, 2nM L-Glutamine, 100 Units/ml Penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and
12.5 Units/ml Nystatin (Biological Industries, Israel) overnight at 37 oC, 5% CO2.
Serum samples were 3-fold serially diluted (ranging from 1:50-1:12,500) in 400 l of
MEM supplemented with 2% FCS, MEM non-essential amino acids, 2nM L-Glutamine,
100 Units/ml Penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 12.5 Units/ml Nystatin. 400 l
containing 300 PFU/ml of VSV-spike were then added to the diluted serum samples and
the mixture was incubated at 37 oC, 5% CO2 for 1 h. Monolayers were then washed once
with DMEM w/o FBS and 200 l of each serum-virus mixture was added in triplicates to
the cells for 1 h. Virus mixture without serum was used as control. 1 ml overlay [MEM
containing 2% FBS and 0.4% tragacanth (Sigma, Israel)] was added to each well and
plates were incubated at 37 oC, 5%CO2 for 72 h. The number of plaques in each well was
determined following media aspiration, cells fixation and staining with 1 ml of crystal
violet (Biological Industries, Israel). NT50 was defined as serum dilution at which the
plaque number was reduced by 50%, compared to plaque number of the control (in the
absence of serum).
