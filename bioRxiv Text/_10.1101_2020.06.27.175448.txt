Abstract:
The novel coronavirus (nCOV-2019) outbreak has put the world on edge, causing millions of
cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths all around the world, as of June 2020, let alone the
societal and economic impacts of the crisis. The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the
virion’s surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding
domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2).
Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and
establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in
2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been
identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world.
In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning
mutations on the stability of RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturallyoccurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as
the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission
of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design
endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico
Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the
interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug
development endeavors. From an evolutional perspective, this study also identifies how the virus
has evolved from its predecessor SARS-COV and how it could further evolve to become more
infectious.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus (nCOV-2019) outbreak emerging from China has become a global
pandemic and a major threat for human public health. According to World Health Organization
(WHO) as of June 27th 2020, there has been about 10 million confirmed cases and approaching
500,000 deaths due to coronavirus in the world.1-2 Much of the human population including the
United States of America were under lockdown or official stay-at-home orders to minimize the
continued spread of the virus.
Coronaviruses are a family of single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses. Phylogenetic
analysis of coronavirus genome has shown that nCOV-2019 belongs to the beta-coronavirus
family, which also includes MERS-COV, SARS-COV and bat-SARS-related coronaviruses.3-4 It
is worth mentioning that SARS-COV, which was widespread in 2002 caused more than 8,000
cases and about 800 deaths and MERS-COV (middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in
2012 also spread in more than 25 countries, causing about 2,500 cases and more than 850 deaths.
(www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus).5
In all coronaviruses, a homotrimeric spike glycoprotein on the virion’s envelope mediates
coronavirus entry into host cells through a mechanism of receptor binding followed by fusion of
viral and host membranes.3,6 Coronavirus spike protein contains two functional subunits S1 and
S2. The S1 subunit is responsible for binding to host cell receptor, and the S2 subunit is
responsible for fusion of viral and host cell membranes.3,7 The spike protein in nCOV-2019
exists in a meta-stable pre-fusion conformation that undergoes a substantial conformational
rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane.7,8 nCOV-2019 is closely
related to bat coronavirus RaTG13 with about 93.1% sequence similarity in the spike protein
gene. The sequence similarity of nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV is less than 80% in the spike
genome.2 S1 subunit in the spike protein includes a receptor binding domain (RBD) that
recognizes and binds to the host cells receptor. The RBD of nCOV-2019 shares 72.8% sequence
identity to SARS-COV RBD and the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) for the structure
between the two proteins is 1.2 Å, which shows the high structural similarity.4,8,9 Experimental
binding affinity measurements using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) have shown that nCOV2019 spike protein binds its receptor human angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2) with 10 to 20

fold higher affinity than SARS-COV binding to ACE2.7 Based on the sequence similarity
between RBD of nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV and also the tight binding between RBD of
nCOV-2019 and ACE2, it is most probable that nCOV-2019 uses this receptor on human cells to
gain entry into the body.3,6,7,10
The spike protein and specifically the RBD domain in coronaviruses have been a major
target for therapeutic antibodies. However, no monoclonal antibodies targeted to RBD have been
able to bind efficiently and neutralize nCOV-2019.7,11 The core of nCOV-2019 RBD is a 5stranded antiparallel -sheet with connected short α-helices and loops (Figure 1). Binding
interface of nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV with ACE2 are very similar with less than 1.3 Å
RMSD. An extended insertion inside the core containing short strands, α-helices and loops
called the receptor binding motif (RBM) makes all the contacts with ACE2. In nCOV-2019
RBD, the RBM forms a concave surface with a ridge loop on one side and it binds to a convex
exposed surface of ACE2. The overlay of SARS and nCOV-2019 RBD proteins are shown in
Figure 1A. The binding interface in nCOV-2019 contains loops  to  and short -strands 
and  and a short helix  . The location of RBM in nCOV-2019 RBD as well as different
helices, strands and loops is shown in Figure 1B.

The sequence alignment between SARS-COV in human, SARS civet, Bat RaTG13
coronavirus and nCOV-2019 in the RBM is shown in Figure 2. There is a 50% sequence
similarity between the RBM of nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV. RBM mutations played an
important role in the SARS epidemic in 2002.12,3 Two mutations in the RBM of SARS-2002
from SARS-Civet were observed from strains of these viruses. These two mutations were K479N
and S487T. These two residues are close to the virus binding hotspots in ACE2 including
hotspot-31 and hotspot-353. Hotspot-31 centers on the salt-bridge between K31-E35 and
hotspot-353 is centered on the salt-bridge between K353-E358 on ACE2. Residues K479 and
S487 in SARS-Civet are in close proximity with these hotspots and mutations at these residues
caused SARS to bind ACE2 with significantly higher affinity than SARS-Civet and played a
major role in civet-to-human and human-to-human transmission of SARS coronavirus in
2002.3,13–15 Numerous mutations in the interface of SARS-COV RBD and ACE2 from different
strains of SARS isolated from humans in 2002 have been identified and the effect of these
mutations on binding ACE2 have been investigated by surface plasmon resonance.16,17 Two
identified RBD mutations (Y442F and L472F) increased the binding affinity of SARS-COV to
ACE2 and two mutations (N479K, T487S) decreased the binding affinity. It was demonstrated
that these mutations were viral adaptations to either human or civet ACE2.16,17 A pseudotyped
viral infection assay of the interaction between different spike proteins and ACE2 confirmed the
correlation between high affinity mutants and their high infection.16 Further investigation of
RBD residues in binding of SARS-COV and ACE2 was performed through ala-scanning
mutagenesis, which resulted in identification of 10 residues that reduce binding affinity to ACE2
upon mutation to alanine. These residues are K390, R429, D429, D454, I455, N473, F483,
Q492, Y494 and R495.18 RBD mutations have also been identified in MERS-COV, which
affected their affinity to receptor (DPP4) on human cells.17 Multiple monoclonal antibodies have
been developed for SARS since 2002 that neutralized spike glycoprotein on SARS-COV
surface.19–23 However, multiple escape mutations exist in the RBD of SARS-COV that affect
neutralization with antibodies, which led to the use of a cocktail of antibodies as robust
treatment.24

nCOV-2019. The mutations from SARS-2002 to nCOV-2019 are marked with blue. Important mutations in RBM
are marked with yellow. Red color shows the 3-resdiue motif in SARS and Civet and 4-residue motif in RaTG13
and nCOV-2019.

Full genome analysis of nCOV-2019 in different countries and the receptor binding
surveillance has shown multiple mutations in the RBD of glycosylated spike. The GISAID
database25 (www.gisaid.org/) contains genomes on nCOV-2019 from researchers across the
world since December 2019. Latest report by the GISAID database on June 2020 have shown 25
different variants of RBD from strains of nCOV-2019 collected from different countries along
with the number of occurrences in these regions which is listed below for the seven most
occurring mutations:
213x N439K (211 Scotland, England, Romania), 65x T478I in
England, 30x V483A (26 USA/WA, 2 USA/UN, USA/CT,
England), 10x G476S (8 USA/WA, USA/OR, Belgium), 7x S494P
(3 USA/MI, England, Spain, India, Sweden), 5x V483F (4x Spain,
England), 4x A475V (2 USA/AZ, USA/NY, Australia/NSW.
It is not known whether these mutations are linked to the severity of coronavirus in these
regions. The focus of this article is to elucidate the differences between the interface of SARSCOV and nCOV-2019 with ACE2 to understand with atomic resolution the interaction
mechanism and hotspot residues at the RBD/ACE2 interface using long-timescale molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation. An alanine-scanning mutagenesis in the RBM of nCOV-2019 helped
to identify the key residues in the interaction, which could be used as potential pharmacophores
for future drug development. Furthermore, we performed molecular simulations on the seven
most common mutations found from surveillance of RBD mutations N439K, T478I, V483A,

G476S, S494P, V483F and A475V. From an evolutionary perspective this study shows the
residues in which the virus might further evolve to be even more dangerous to human health.

Methods
Sequence comparison and mutant preparation
nCOV-2019 shares 76% sequence similarity with SARS-2002 spike protein, 73%
sequence identity for RBD and 50% for the RBM.1 Bat coronavirus RaTG13 seems to be the
closest relative of nCOV-2019 sharing about 93% sequence identity in the spike protein.6 The
sequence alignment of SARS-2002 (accession number: AFR58742), SARS-civet (accession
number: AY304486.1), Bat RaTG13 (accession number: MN996532.1) and nCOV-2019
(accession number: MN908947.1) are in Figure 2.26 To investigate the roles of critical mutations
on the complex stability of nCOV-2019 with ACE2, mCSM-PPI2 webserver27 was used to the
residues in nCOV-2019 that are at the interface with ACE2. This method uses a graph-based
signature framework and predicts the effect of alanine substitution at interface residues on the
binding energy of the complex. 21 different residues were identified to be in contact with ACE2
and were chosen to do further MD simulation. On the other hand, mutations are also observed in
RBD domain from full genome analysis of different nCOV-2019 variants collected from
different countries compiled in GISAID database.25 The mutations selected are listed in Table
S1 along with their location in RBD.

Molecular dynamics simulations
The crystal structure of nCOV-2019 in complex with hACE2 (pdb id:6M0J)28 as well as
SARS-COV complex with human ACE2 (pdb id: 6ACJ)29 were obtained from RCSB
(www.rcsb.org).30 The RBD domain of nCOV-2019 comprises of 194 residues (333-526) and
SARS-COV includes 190 residues (323-512). ACE2 protein contains 597 residues (19-615) in
the complex structure for both systems. All the structures including nCOV-2019, SARS-COV
and all 21 alanine substitutions of nCOV-2019 were prepared and solvated with the CHARMMGUI webserver.31 A TIP3P water model was used for the solvent and Param99SB-ILDN
AMBER force field (FF)32was used for all the complexes. POT ions were added to all systems to
neutralize the charges on the proteins. Each system contained about 260,000 atoms.
5000 steps of energy minimizations were done using the steepest descent algorithm. In all
steps the LINCS algorithm was used to constraint all bonds containing hydrogen atoms and a

time step of 2 fs was used as the integration time step.33 Equilibration of all systems were
performed in three steps. In the first step, 100,000 steps of simulation were performed using a
velocity-rescaling thermostat to maintain the temperature at 310K with a 0.1 ps coupling
constant in NVT ensemble under periodic boundary conditions and harmonic restraints on the
backbone and sidechain atoms of the complex.34 The velocity rescaling thermostat was used in
all other steps of simulation. In the next step, we performed 300,000 steps in the isothermalisobaric NPT ensemble at temperature of 310K and pressure of 1bar using a Berendsen
barostat.35 This was done by decreasing the force constant of the restraint on backbone and side
chain atoms of the complex from 1000 to 100 and finally to 10

. Berendsen barostat was

only used for the equilibration step due to usefulness in rapidly correcting density. In the next
step the restraints were removed, and the systems were subjected to 1,000,000 steps of MD
simulation under NPT ensemble.
In the production run, harmonic restraints were removed and all the systems were
simulated using a NPT ensemble where the pressure was maintained at 1bar using the ParrinelloRahman barostat36 with a compressibility of 4.5

and a coupling constant of 0.5ps.

It is important to note that all the Berendsen barostat was only used for the equilibration step as it
was shown that this barostat can cause unrealistic temperature gradients.37 The production run
lasted for 500ns for SARS-COV and nCOV-2019 complexes and 300ns for all the mutants using
with a 2fs timestep and the particle-mesh Ewald (PME)36 for long range electrostatic interactions
using GROMACS 2018.3 package.38 All mutant systems were constructed as described before
and all complexes ran for 300ns of production run.
Gibbs free energy and correlated motions. The last 400ns of simulation was used to explore the
dominant motions in SARS-COV, nCOV-2019 and last 200ns for all its mutants using principal
component analysis (PCA) as part of the quasiharmonic analysis method.39 For this method the
rotational and translational motions of RBD of all systems were eliminated by fitting to a
reference (crystal) structure. Next, 4,000 snapshots from the last 400ns of SARS-COV and
nCOV-2019 systems and 2,000 snapshots from last 200ns of all mutant systems were taken to
generate the covariance matrix between  atoms of RBD. Diagonalization of this matrix
resulted in a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors.38,40 The first
eigenvector which indicate the first principal component was used to visualize the dominant

global motions of all complexes through porcupine plots using the (PorcupinePlot.tcl) script in
vmd.
The principal components were used to calculate and plot the approximate free energy
landscape (aFEL). We refer to the free energy landscape produced by this approach to be
approximate in that the ensemble with respect to the first few PC’s (lowest frequency
quasiharmonic modes) is not close to convergence, but the analysis can still provide valuable
information and insight. g_sham, g_covar and g_anaeig functions in GROMACS41 were used to
obtain principal components and aFEL. In each aFEL the deep valleys represent the most stable
conformations separated by some intermediate states.
The dynamic cross-correlation maps (DCCM) were obtained using MD_TASK package
to identify the correlated motions of RBD residues.42 In DCCM the cross-correlation matrix 
is obtained from displacement of backbone  atoms in a time interval Δ. The DCCM was
constructed using the last 400ns of SARS-COV and nCOV-2019 systems and last 200ns of all
mutant systems with a 100ps time interval.
Binding free energy from MMPBSA method. The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann
Surface Area (MMPBSA) method was applied to calculate the binding energy between RBD and
ACE2 in all complexes.43,44 for SARS-COV and nCOV-2019 system, 200 snapshots of the last
400ns and for all other systems, 100 snapshots of the last 200ns simulation were used to for the
calculation of binding free energies with an interval of 2ns. The binding free energy of a ligandreceptor complex can be calculated as:

Results
Structural dynamics
To compute the RMSD of systems, the rotational and translational movements were
removed by first fitting the Cα atoms of the RBD to the crystal structure and then computing the
RMSD with respect to Cα atoms of RBD in each system.

Figure 3. The Cα RMSD plots for nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV and a few nCOV-2019 mutations.

Figure 3 shows the RMSD plot in the RBD of SARS-COV, nCOV-2019 and some of its
variants. Comparison of RMSD of SARS and nCOV-2019 RBD shows that SARS-COV has a
larger RMSD throughout the 500ns simulation. In nCOV-2019, RMSD is very stable with a
value of about 1.5 Å whereas in SARS-COV the RMSD increases up to ~4 Å after 100 ns and
then fluctuates between 3 and 4 Å. The change in RMSD of SARS is partially related to the
motion in the C-terminal which is a flexible loop.
The RMSD plots for the nCOV-2019 mutants show similar behaviors to nCOV-2019-wt.
In most of the variants, the RMSD is stable during the 300ns simulation. However, a few
mutations show some RMSD variance. In mutation Y489A, the RMSD increases from 1.82 $

100ns to a value to 1.98 $ 0.20 Å and decreased afterwards. RMSD for mutation N487A shows
an increasing behavior with a value of 2.10 $ 0.23 Å . In mutation Y473A, the RMSD is

and

V483F showed a stable RMSD of ~1.5 Å. For

mutations T478I, G476S, S494P and A475V RMSD increases up to ~2 Å. These variations in
the backbone RMSD show the involvement of these residues in the complex stability. RMSD
plots for other mutations are shown in Figure S1.
Since the extended loop (residues 449 to 510 shown in figure 1B from  to  ) of the
RBD makes all contacts with ACE2, the RMSD was computed by also fitting to the  atoms of
this region (Figure S2). The extended loop in nCOV-2019 is very stable with less deviation
(RMSD  0.86 $ 0.017 Å) from the crystal structure compared to SARS-COV having an RMSD
of 2.79 $ 0.05 Å. Few of the mutants show an increase in the loop RMSD during the simulation.
In mutants N487A and Y449A the loop RMSD jumps to a value of about 2.00 $ 0.04 Å and

1.63 $ 0.09 Å respectively after about 200 ns of simulation. Mutants G447A and E484A show a
loop RMSD values of 2.22 $ 0.03 Å and 1.96 $ 0.02 Å during the last 100ns of simulation. The
loop RMSD in mutations Y505A, Y473A and S494A is about 1.5 Å during simulation which is
higher than nCOV-2019. Other mutants showed a stable extended loop (observed in loop
RMSD) during simulation. The loop RMSD for some residues are high which indicates these
residues are involved in the stability of the extended loop region.
To characterize of the dynamic behavior for each amino acid in the RBD, we analyzed
the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of all systems. The RMSF plots for nCOV-2019,
SARS-COV and four other mutations are shown in Figure 4. nCOV-2019 shows less fluctuations
compared to SARS-COV. ( in nCOV-2019 corresponding to residues 476 to 487 (shown in red
in Figure 4) has smaller RMSF (1.5 Å) than SARS-COV ( residues 463 to 474.  in both
nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV (green) has small fluctuation (less than 1.5 Å). Moreover, the Cterminal residues of SARS-COV shows high fluctuation (Figure 4 shown in orange). Few
mutants show higher fluctuation in the  . Mutants Y505A and S494A had a RMSF of 2.5 Å and
mutation N487A has a RMSF of about 4 Å in the  . Mutation Y449A has a higher fluctuation

Principal component analysis (PCA) and approximate free energy landscape
To identify the dominant motions in the nCOV-2019, SARS-COV, and all the mutants, PCA
was performed. Most of the combined motions were captured by the first ten eigenvectors
generated from the last 400ns for SARS-COV and nCOV-2019 and the last 200ns for each
nCOV-2019 mutant. The percentage of the motions captured by the first three eigenvectors was
51% for nCOV-2019 and 68% for SARS-COV. In all mutations, more than 50% of the motions
were captured by the first three eigenvectors. The first few PC’s describe the highest motions in
a protein which are related to a functional motion such as binding or unbinding of protein from

receptor. The first three eigenvectors were used to calculate the approximate FEL (aFEL) using
the last 400ns of simulation for nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV shown in Figure 5, which displays
the variance in conformational motion. SARS-COV showed two distinct low free energy states
shown as blue separated by a metastable state. There is a clear separation between the two
regions by a free energy barrier of about 6-7.5 kcal/mol. These two states correspond to the loop
motions in the L3 as well as the motion in C-terminal residues of SARS-COV. The ( motion in
nCOV-2019 is stabilized by H-bond between N487 on RBD and Y83 on ACE2 as well as a -stacking interaction between F486 and Y83. It is evident that the nCOV-2019 is more stable than
SASR-COV and exist in one conformation whereas the SARS-COV interface fluctuates and the

The first two eigenvectors were used to calculate and plot the aFEL as a function of first two
principal components using the last 200ns of the simulation for mutant systems. aFEL for a few
mutants are shown in Figure 6 and the rest of them are shown in Figure S4. In some mutants
such as Q498A and Y453A the aFEL shows only one low energy state. However, aFEL for other
mutants such as E484A, G447A, Y449A and N487A separate into multiple regions divided by
metastable states. Mutations Y449A, G477A and E484A also showed high fluctutation in ( and

Figure 6. aFEL plots for nCOV-2019, SARS-COV and mutants by projecting onto the first two eigenvectors.

In each system, the first eigenvector was used to construct the porcupine plots to
visualize the most dominant movements (Figure 7). nCOV-2019 showed a small motion in L3
and the core region and the extended loop region is very rigid showing small cones in the
porcupine plot. The core structure of the RBD remains dormant as the cones are blue in most of
the regions. In SARS-COV, the C-terminal region shows large motions (Figure 7B). Mutation
N487A showed a large motion in  (Figure 7C). Mutations Y449A, G447A and E484A
demonstrate large motions in ( (Figure 7). Overall, these plots show the involvement of these
residues in dynamic stability of RBD/ACE2 complex.

 regions) shown in red rectangle in Figure 8, which is referred to here as correlation I. This
correlation showed the coordination of these regions for binding ACE2 effectively. Another
important correlation that appears in DCCM of nCOV-2019 is between residues 473-481 with
residues 482-491. These residues are in ( and  regions and their correlation in nCOV-2019 is
stronger than SARS-COV. This is due to the presence of  strand in nCOV-2019, whereas in
SARS-COV these residues all belong to ( . This indicates that ( in nCOV-2019 has evolved
from SARS-COV to adopt new a secondary structure, which causes strong correlation and make
the loop act as a recognition region for binding. The correlation in ( is shown as blue rectangle
in Figure 8. Some of the mutations disrupted the patterns of correlation and anti-correlation in
nCOV-2019-wt. Mutation N487A showed a stronger correlation in ( and  strand than the
wild-type RBD. In mutation E484A, correlation I is stronger than the nCOV-2019-wt. DCCM
for other mutants are shown in Figure S5. It is worth mentioning that mutation F486A disrupts
the DCCM of nCOV-2019 by introducing strong correlations in the core region of RBD as well
as the extended loop region. Residue F486A resides in ( and plays a crucial role in stabilizing
the recognition loop by making a --stacking interaction with residue Y83A on ACE2.

Binding free energies
The binding energetics between ACE2 and the RBD of SARS-COV, nCOV-2019 and all its
mutant complexes were investigated by the MMPBSA method.44 The binding energy was
partitioned into its individual components including: electrostatic, van der Waals, polar solvation
and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) to identify important factors affecting the interface
of RBD and ACE2 in all complexes. nCOV-2019 has a total binding energy of 50.22 $

that persist for >30%. Salt bridge is shown as bold.

The evolution of the coronavirus from SARS-COV to nCOV-2019 has reshaped the
interfacial hydrogen bonds with ACE2. G502 in nCOV-2019 has the most persistent H-bond
with residue K353 on ACE2. This residue was G488 in SARS-COV, which also makes H-bond
with K353 on ACE2. Q493 in nCOV-2019 makes H-bond with E35 and a less persistent H-bond
with K31 on ACE2. This residue was an N479 in SARS-COV, which only makes one H-bond
with K31 on ACE2 with 52% occupancy. An important mutation from SARS-COV to nCOV2019 is residue Q498, which was Y484 in SARS-COV. Q498 makes two H-bonds with residues
D38 and K353 on ACE2, whereas Y484 in SARS-COV does not make any H-bonds. Importantly
a salt bridge between K417 and D30 in nCOV-2019/ACE2 complex contributes to total binding

. This residue is V404 in SARS-COV which is not able to make

any salt-bridge and does not make H-bond with ACE2. Wang et al.47 used a free energy
perturbation (FEP) approach and showed that mutation V404 to K417 increases the binding
affinity of nCOV-2019 RBD to ACE2 by 2.2 $ 0.9




. A salt bridge between R426 on RBD

and E329 on ACE2 stabilizes the complex in SARS-COV/ACE2. This residue is N439 in nCOV2019 and is unable to make salt-bridge with ACE2 residue E329. One of the most observed
mutations in nCOV-2019 according to GISAID database25 is N439K which recovers some of the
electrostatic interactions with ACE2 at this position.
The evolution from SARS-COV to nCOV-2019 also has destabilized some specific
ACE2/RBD interactions. An important H-bond in SARS-COV is between Y436 on RBD and
D38 on ACE2. This residue is Y449 in nCOV-2019 and makes H-bond with D38 on ACE2 but
with a lower occupancy than SARS-COV. The unchanged T486 in SARS-COV corresponds to
T500 in nCOV-2019, both of which make consistent H-bonds with ACE2 residue D355.
Hydrophobic interactions also play an important role in stabilizing RBD/ACE2 complex
in nCOV-2019. An important interaction between nCOV-2019 RBD and ACE2 is the --stacking
interaction between F486 (RBD) and Y83 (ACE2). This interaction helps in stabilizing ( in
nCOV-2019 compared to SARS-COV where this residue is L472. It was observed by Wang et
al. that mutation Leu472 to Phe486 in nCOV-2019 results in a net change in binding free energy
of 1.2 $ 0.2




. Other interfacial residues in nCOV-2019 RBD that participate in

hydrophobic interaction with ACE2 are L455, F456, Y473, A475 and Y489. It is interesting to
note that all these residues except Y489 have mutated from SARS-COV. Spinello and coworkers48 performed long-timescale (1/0) simulation of nCOV-2019/ACE2 and SARS-COV
ACE2 and found that ( in nCOV-2019 is more stable due to presence of the  strand and
existence of two H-bonds in ( (H-bonds G485-C488 and Q474-G476). Importantly, an amino
acid insertion in ( makes this loop longer than ( in SARS-COV and enable it to act like a
recognition loop and make more persistent H-bonds with ACE2. L455 in nCOV-2019 RBD is
important for hydrophobic interaction with ACE2 and mutation L455A lowers the vdw
contribution of binding to 84.96 $ 0.56

The structural details discussed here are in agreement with other structural studies of nCOV2019 RBD/ACE2 complex.4,49,50
H-bond analysis was also performed for the mutant systems and the results for H-bonds
with more than 40% consistency are in Table S3. Few of the alanine substitutions increase the
number of interfacial H-bonds between nCOV-2019 RBD and ACE2. Interestingly, the alasubstitution at Y489A increased the number of H-bonds in the wild-type complex. Mutation in
some of the residues having consistent H-bonds in the wild type complex such as Q498A,
Q493A and T500A stunningly increased the persistence of H-bonds in the neighboring residues
and maintaining the number of H-bonds in the wild-type complex. This indicates that the RBM
of nCOV-2019 can reshape the network of H-bonds and strengthen the H-bonds upon mutation
in these locations. However, few mutations also decrease the number of H-bonds from the wildtype complex. Alanine substitution at residue G502 has a significant effect on the network of Hbonds between nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV. This residue locates at the end of  loop near two
other important residues Q498 and T500. This mutation breaks the H-bonds at these residues.
Mutation K417 decreases the number of H-bonds to only 5 where the H-bond at residue Q498 is
broken. This indicates the delicacy of H-bond from residue Q498 which can easily be broken
upon ala-substitution at other residues. Furthermore, mutation N487 also decreases the number
of H-bonds by breaking the H-bond at Q498.

Discussion
In this work, we preformed MD simulations to unveil the detailed molecular mechanism
for receptor binding of nCOV-2019 and comparing it with SARS-COV. The role of key residues
at the interface of nCOV-2019 with ACE2 were investigated by computational ala-scanning. A
rigorous 500ns MD simulation was performed for nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV as well as 300ns
MD simulation on each mutant. These simulations aiding in our understanding in the dynamic
role of RBD/ACE2 interface residues and estimating the binding free energy of these variants,
which shed light on crucial residues for the RBD/ACE2 complex stability. Moreover, numerous
mutations have been identified in the RBD of different nCOV-2019 strains from all over the
world not known to be critical for infection.51 The role of these mutations on the stability of
RBD/ACE2 complex were investigated to shed light on their role in the viral infection of
coronavirus.
Changes in RBD structure of nCOV-2019, SARS-COV and mutants from their crystal
structure were analyzed by RMSD and RMSF. nCOV-2019 showed a stable structure with a
RMSD=1.5 Å, whereas SARS-COV had a larger RMSD value between 3-4 Å during the
simulation. Most mutations of nCOV-2019 maintained similar stability to the wild-type.
However, in few nCOV-2019 mutations resulted in larger deviations (>2 Å), i.e., Y489A,
F456A, Y505A, N487A, K417A, Y473A, Y449A.. We further investigated the structure of the
extended loop domain (Figure 1B) and discovered that nCOV-2019 is stable with RMSD of less
than 1 Å, whereas the extended loop in SARS-COV shows an RMSD of about 3Å during
simulation (figure S2). Some mutants showed high RMSD in this region. Alanine-substitution at
residue N487 increased the extended loop RMSD to 2.5 Å. Other mutations that increased the
extended loop RMSD (>2 Å)include Y449A, G477A and E484A. The dynamic behavior of RBD

was further investigated by analyzing the RMSF of all systems. As shown in Figure 4, nCOV2019 shows less fluctuation in ( than SARS-COV. This is due to the presence of a 4-residue
motif (GQTQ) in nCOV-2019 ( , which forces the loop to adopt a compact structure by making
2 H-bonds (G485-C488 and Q474-G476) and thereby reducing the fluctuations in the loop.
Residues F486 and N487 play major roles in stabilizing the recognition loop by making -stacking and H-bond interactions with residue Y83 on ACE2. Alanine substitution at N487
introduced large RMSF to  . Mutation L472 to F486 was shown to favor binding by 1.2 $


0.2  using FEP.47 In addition, this mutation was shown to be among the five mutations that
produce a super affinity ACE2 binder based on SARS-COV RBD.6 Alanine mutations at
residues Y449, G447 and E484 increased the motion in ( characterized by large RMSF in this
region.
Using principal component analysis, the free energy landscape for nCOV-2019 and
SARS-COV demonstrated that the former occupies only one low energy state whereas the latter
forms two distinct low energy basins separated by a metastable state with a barrier of about 6-7.5



. This confirms that the level of binding for the RBD domain is weaker in SARS-COV due to

the presence of two basins. Similarly, alanine-substitution for a few residues ( Y489A, N487A,
Y449A and E484A) caused the free energy landscape to degenerate into separate multiple low
energy regions. Dominant motions in the RBD are visualized in Figure 7 using the first
eigenvector of the PCA. nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV did not show any strong motion in the
extended loop region. Porcupine plots of alanine-mutants demonstrated that mutant N487A
shows large motion in  region and Y449A, G447A and E484A showed large motions in ( .
To better characterize the functional motions of RBD, DCCM for all systems are
constructed and demonstrated in Figure 8. nCOV-2019 showed large correlation between the  -

 -  region. This correlation was stronger in SARS-COV and few mutants

extended loop region as well as core structure of RBD.
The details of hydrogen bond and salt-bridge pattern in nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV to
ACE2 (Table 1) are key to the virus attachment to the host. nCOV-2019 residues participate in
10 H-bonds/1 salt bridge with ACE2, whereas SARS-COV only has 5 H-bonds/1 salt bridge with
ACE2. This significantly contributes to the 31

difference in total binding free energy of

nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV. The binding energies calculated here for nCOV-2019 and SARSCOV (50.22 $ 1.93 and 18.79 $ 1.53

binding energies calculated using Generalized Born method (GB) by Spinello et al.52 Moreover,
the patterns of H-bonds between nCOV-2019 and ACE2 was also already characterized by other
groups47,52, which agrees with our work. An important H-bond between nCOV-2019 and ACE2
is between G502 on RBD and K353 of ACE2. G502 is in  region, which is populated by 5 Hbonds between RBD and ACE2. The contribution of this residue to the total binding energy is

lowest among all mutants. This mutation breaks the other H-bonds in  such as H-bonds from
residues Q498 and T500. This residue is preserved and corresponds to residue G488 in SARSCOV, which also makes a persistent H-bond with residue K353 on ACE2. Residue Q493 in
nCOV-2019 participates in binding ACE2 by making two H-bonds with residues E35 and K31
on ACE2. Q493 corresponds to residue N479 in SARS-COV, which only makes one H-bond
with residue Lys31 on ACE2 with low consistency (52%). This caused Q493 to have more

However, alanine substitution at Q493 did not have a large effect on total binding energy and

persistence of H-bonds in neighboring residues and maintains the number of persistent H-bonds
in the wild-type complex. Residues Q498 and T500 in nCOV-2019 are crucial for binding by
making H-bonds with ACE2 residues D38, D355 and K353. Residue Q498 corresponds to
residue Y484 in SARS-COV which does not make any H-bond in SARS-COV/ACE2 complex.

Y489 is the only residue that is conserved from SARS-COV. This shows the capacity of the
virus to evolve even further in the RBD to bind the receptor ACE2 with stronger affinity. Other
mutations that increase the binding energy are G446A, G447A, Y449A and T478I. Residues
G446, G447 and Y449 all reside in  and mutation to alanine can make  take a more rigid
form as shown in RMSF plot in Figure S3.
Important mutations found in naturally-occurring nCOV-2019 appear to influence to
some extent the binding to ACE2. Mutation T478I which is one of the highly seen mutations in
England according to GISAID database, increases the binding energy of nCOV-2019 to ACE2
by about 7

. Mutation N439K has the highest occurrence among all strains of coronavirus in

the GISAID database which demonstrated the highest electrostatic interaction among all studied
systems. This residue corresponds to R426 in SARS-COV which exerts a salt-bridge interaction
with E329 on ACE2. Mutation N439K recovers some of this ACE2 interaction. Mutant E484A
which is also one of the observed mutations in Spain based on GISAID database, demonstrates a
high electrostatic interaction with ACE2. E484 contributes to binding by 3.56 $

SARS-COV to ACE2 by 0.27 $ 0.01

. This residue is close to D30 on ACE2 and have

electrostatic repulsion with this residue. High electrostatic energy in mutations N439K and
E484A are compensated by a large polar solvation energy and these mutants show total binding
energies similar to wild-type complex. This could be due to the use of MMPBSA approach for
calculation of polar solvation and further studies are needed to study the effect of these mutations
on viral infectivity of coronavirus.
Additional sequence differences between nCOV-2019 and SARS-COV influence
RBD/ACE2 binding. Residue D480 in SARS-COV contributes negatively to total binding

) and mutation of this residue to S494 in nCOV-2019 lowers this

negative contribution to 1.17 $ 0.06



. D460 in SARS-COV is located in a region of high

negative charge from residues E35, E37 and D38 on ACE2. Electrostatic repulsion between
D480 on SARS-COV and the acidic residues on ACE2 is the reason for highly negative
contribution of this residue to binding of SARS-COV to ACE2. Mutation to S494 in this location
removes this highly negative contribution.

To our knowledge this is first detailed molecular simulation study on the effect of
mutations on binding of nCOV-2019 to ACE2. Previous computational studies have found that
nCOV-2019 binds to ACE2 with a total binding affinity which was about 30




stronger than

SARS-COV and is in fair agreement with the results here.52 The critical role of interface residues
and residues are computationally investigated here and in other articles and the results of all the
studies indicate the importance of these residues for the stability of the complex and finding hotspot residues for the interaction with receptor ACE2.47,52–54 It is interesting to note the role of (
in the stability of the RBD/ACE2 complex. The amino acid insertions in ( for nCOV-2019 has
converted as unessential part of RBD in SARS to a functional domain of the RBD. This loop
participates in binding ACE2 by making H-bond as well as --stacking interaction with ACE2,
which makes this region to act as a recognition loop. Previous studies on SARS-COV have
shown there is a correlation between higher binding affinity to receptor and higher infection rate
by coronavirus.55–58 High binding affinity for some mutants such as T478I could be the reason
for higher human-to-human transmission rate in regions where these mutations are found. It is
also alerting that mutations at other residues such as G446A, G449A, Y449A and Y489A
increase the binding affinity considerably and should be monitored. Mutations of nCOV-2019
RBD that do not change the binding affinity and complex stability, could have implications for
antibody design purposes since they could act antibody escape mutants. Escape from monoclonal
antibodies are observed for mutations of SARS-COV in 2002 and these mutations should be
considered for any antibody design endeavors against consider these escape mutations.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study unraveled key molecular traits underlying the higher affinity of
nCOV-2019 for ACE2 compared to SARS-COV and unveiled critical residues for the interaction
by in-silico alanine scanning mutations and binding free energy calculations. The higher affinity
of nCOV-2019 to binding with ACE2 correlates with higher human-to-human transmissibility of
nCOV-2019 compared to SARS-COV. Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the interface residues of
nCOV-2019 RBM has shed light on the crucial interface residues and helped obtain an atomic28

level understanding of the interaction between coronavirus and the receptor ACE2 on the host
cell. MD simulations on RBD mutations found in strains of nCOV-2019 from different countries
aiding in the understanding of how these mutations can play and importance to in viral infection
with ACE2 attachment. In addition to previously reported residues, it was found that residue
F486 locating in ( plays a crucial role in dynamic stability of the complex by a --stacking
interaction with ACE2. Per-residue free energy decomposition pinpoints the critical role of
residues K417, Y505, Q498, Q493 in binding ACE2. Alanine scanning of interface residues in
nCOV-2019 RBD showed that alanine substitution at some residues such as G502, K417 and
L455 can significantly decrease the binding affinity of the complex. Moreover, mutation T478I,
which is one of the most probable mutations in RBD of nCOV-2019 is found to binding ACE2
with about 7




higher affinity than wild-type. Other occurring mutations N439K and E484A

are found to increase the electrostatic interaction of RBD with ACE2. It is also alerting that some
of the alanine substitutions at residues G446, G447 and Y489 substantially increased the binding
affinity that may lead to a strongly RBD attachment to ACE2 and influence the infection
virulence. On the other hand, most mutations are found not to impact the binding affinity of RBD
with ACE2 in nCOV-2019 which could have implications for vaccine design endeavors as these
mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Receptor recognition is the first line of attack
for coronavirus and this study gives novel insights to key structural features of interface residues
for advancement of effective therapeutic strategies to stop the coronavirus pandemic.
