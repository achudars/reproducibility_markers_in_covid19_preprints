Abstract

16

Identifying the population structure of the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2

17

has significant potential to inform public health management and diagnosis. As SARS-

18

CoV-2 sequencing data is accruing rapidly, grouping them into clusters is important for

19

organizing the landscape of the population structure of the virus. Since we have little

20

prior information about the newly emerged coronavirus, we applied unsupervised

21

clustering algorithms to group 16,873 SARS-CoV-2 strains, which automatically

22

minimize intra-cluster distances and maximize inter-cluster distances. Six distinct

23

genomic clusters were identified, with mutation profiles as input features. The varied

24

proportions of the six clusters within different continents revealed specific geographical

25

distributions. Comprehensive analysis indicated that genetic factors and human

26

migration played an important role in shaping the specific geographical distribution of

27

population structure. This study provides a concrete framework for the use of clustering

28

methods in phylogenetic analysis to study the global population structure of SARS-

29

CoV-2. In addition, clustering methods can be used for future studies of variant

population structures in specific regions of these fast-growing viruses.

Introduction

33

COVID-19 pandemic was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

34

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1, 2). It is rapidly spreading throughout the world (3)

35

with over 24 million cases and 0.85 million deaths by the end of August 2020. In an

36

effort to understand the molecular characteristics of the virus, viral genomes have been

37

abundantly sequenced and presented at the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza

38

Data (GISAID) (4). To update, more than 70,000 genomes were collected and published.

39

As an emerging virus, it is important to understand the genetic diversity,

40

evolutionary trajectory and possible routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the

41

natural reservoir to humans. Most studies have looked into the aspects of real-world

42

SARS-CoV-2 evolution and strain diversification through phylogenetic trees (5-8).

43

Phylogenetic tree is a graph that shows the evolutionary relationships among various

44

biological entities based on their genetic closeness (9, 10). The distances from one

45

entity to the other entities indicate the degree of relationships. However, as population

46

genomic datasets grow in size, simply using pairwise genetic distances cannot present

47

an explicit structure of the total population in phylogenetic analysis. Grouping similar

48

entities into the same cluster and identifying the number of main subtypes (clusters)

49

makes it easier to understand the main characteristics of the population. Traditionally,

50

using the distance matrix and the bifurcations between branches of leaves on the

51

phylogenetic tree, entities can be grouped into clusters. However, when the number of

52

entities becomes large, it is not easy to directly and accurately partition the clades in

53

the phylogenetic tree.

54

In order to identify a better way to effectively group entities, clustering methods

55

emerge as more productive and robust solutions. The objective of clustering is

56

automatically minimizing intra-cluster distances and maximizing inter-cluster distances

57

(11). Accurate clustering helps to better understand the inner relationships between data

58

and inform downstream analysis. Clustering methods have been widely used as a good

supplemental tool in phylogenetic analysis, including phylogenetic tree construction

60

(12-14), ancestral relationship identification (15), evolutionary rate estimation (16, 17),

61

gene evolutionary mechanisms research (18) and population structure analysis (19).

62

In this study, to identify the population structure of the newly emerged coronavirus

63

SARS-CoV-2, we employed clustering methods to group a total of 16,873 strains. The

64

clustering results showed that there were six major clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In

65

particular, we found that the proportions of six clusters in each continent showed a

66

specific geographical distribution. Our analysis revealed that the unique geographical

67

distributions across the clusters are both influenced by intrinsic genetic factors and

68

migration of humans. This study provides a perspective of the SARS-CoV-2 population

69

structural analysis, helping to investigate the evolution and spread of the virus across

70

the human populations worldwide.

Materials and Methods

73

SARS-CoV-2 sample collection

74

A set of African, Asian, European, North American, Oceanian and South American

75

SARS-CoV-2 strains marked as ‚Äúhigh coverage‚Äù were downloaded from GISAID. The

76

‚Äúhigh coverage‚Äù was defined as strains with <1% Ns and <0.05% unique amino acid

77

mutations (not seen in other sequences in databases) and no insertion/deletion unless

78

verified by the submitter. In addition, all strains with a non-human host and all

79

assemblies of total genome length less than 29,000 bps were removed from our analysis.

80

Ultimately, our dataset consisted of 16,873 strains.

81
82

Mutation calls and phylogenetic reconstruction

83

All downloaded genomes were mapped to the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2

84

(GenBank Accession Number: NC_045512.2) following Nextstrain pipeline (20).

85

Multiple sequence alignments and pairwise alignments were constructed using

86

CLUSTALW 2.1 (21). Considering many putatively artefactual mutations and the gaps

87

in sequences are located at the beginning and end of the alignment, we masked the first

88

130 bps and last 50 bps in mutation calling following Nextstrain pipeline. We used

89

substitutions as features to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree using FastTree 2 (22). The

90

phylogeny is rooted following Nextstrain pipeline using FigTree v1.4.4 (23). The

91

phylogenetic trees were visualized using the online tool Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL

92

v5) (24).

93
94

Region analysis and data visualization

95

For each country with SARS-CoV-2 data available, clustering proportions were

96

calculated and plotted on the world map using the tool Tableau Desktop 2020.2. Other

97

figures and statistical analyses were generated by the ggplot2 library in R 3.6.1, the

98

seaborn package in Python 3.7.6 and GraphPad Prism 8.0.2.

99
100

Data clustering

101

In this study, we used K-means clustering (25), hierarchical clustering and BIRCH

102

(Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) (26, 27) clustering to

103

partition the SARS-CoV-2 strains. The models were implemented using the Python

104

package sklearn with the KMeans function, AgglomerativeClustering function and

105

Birch function, respectively.

106
107

Simpson's diversity index

108

Simpson's Diversity Index (D) is a measure of diversity that considers the number

109

of entities as well as their abundance. The index measures the probability that two

110

randomly selected individuals are the same. The formula to calculate the value of the

111

index is:

112

D=1‚àí

‚àëùëéùëôùëô ùë°ùëüùëéùëñùë°ùë† ùëõ(ùëõ ‚àí 1)
ùëÅ(ùëÅ ‚àí 1)

113

where ùëõ is the number of individuals displaying one trait and ùëÅ is the total number of

114

all individuals. The value of D ranges between 0 and 1. With this index, 1 represents

115

infinite diversity and 0 denotes no diversity.

117

Inferring positive/purifying selection of individual sites

118

To test which position was under selective pressure, we used a set of programs

119

available in HyPhy (28) to calculate nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS)

120

substitution rates on a per-site basis to infer pervasive selection. Fast Unconstrained

121

Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) (29) was applied to detect overall sites under

122

positive selection. The positively selected sites were identified using a probability larger

123

than 0.95 using the FUBAR method.

124
125

Pairwise mutation dependency score

126

Pairwise mutation dependency scores can measure the order in which genetic

127

mutations are acquired within a cluster. For two selected mutations X and Y, the score

128

S(X|Y) represents the proportion of strains that accumulated both X among the strains

129

that accumulated mutation Y. S(X|Y) and S(Y|X) can be calculated using the following

130

functions:

131

S(X|Y) =

‚àëùëéùëôùëô ùë†ùëéùëöùëùùëôùëíùë† ùëÜùëã = 1 & ùëÜùëå = 1
‚àëùëéùëôùëô ùë†ùëéùëöùëùùëôùëíùë† ùëÜùëå = 1

132

S(Y|X) =

‚àëùëéùëôùëô ùë†ùëéùëöùëùùëôùëíùë† ùëÜùëã = 1 & ùëÜùëå = 1
‚àëùëéùëôùëô ùë†ùëéùëöùëùùëôùëíùë† ùëÜùëã = 1

133

where ùëÜùëã = 1 denotes that the sequence has a mutation X. Pairwise mutation

134

dependency score displays the correlation and the timescale relationship of the two

135

mutations. The value of S(X|Y) and S(Y|X) ranges between 0 and 1. With this index,

136

S(X|Y) = 1 with S(Y|X) < 1 represents that mutation Y occurs after mutation X. In

137

contrast, S(X|Y) = 1 with S(Y|X) = 1 represents that the two mutations occur

138

simultaneously and are genetically linked. Statistical analyses and data presentations

139

were generated using Python 3.7.6.

Results

142

Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 indicates high diversity and rapidly proliferating

143

pattern of the virus

144

We obtained 16,873 (98 from Africa, 1324 from Asia, 9527 from Europe, 4765

145

from North America, 1040 from Oceania and 119 from South America) SARS-CoV-2

146

whole-genome sequencing data from GISAID, aligned the sequences, and identified

147

the genetic variants. A total of 7,970 substitutions were identified, including 4,908 non-

148

synonymous mutations, 2,748 synonymous mutations and 314 intronic mutations. The

149

average mutation count per genome was 6.99 (Figure S1). The frequency spectrum of

150

substitutions illustrated that more than half (54.05%) of the mutations were singletons

151

and 15.35% were doubletons. The proportion of the mutations below 0.01 was 99.28%

152

(Figure S2). The high percentage of these low-frequency mutations suggested that

153

SARS-CoV-2 occurred recently and displayed a rapidly proliferating pattern (30). In

154

addition, there were 8,706 unique strains across the 16,873 strains (Figure S3), and most

155

unique strains (7,078) were singletons, yielding high diversity of the virus. In particular,

156

Simpson‚Äôs diversity index of the strains was 0.8222, indicating that two random strains

157

would have a high probability of being genetically different. The frequency spectrum

158

of substitutions and high Simpson‚Äôs diversity index indicated high genetic diversity of

159

SARS-CoV-2.

160
161

Clustering of SARS-CoV-2 reveals six major clusters

162

To clarify the main population structure of the virus, grouping these strains into

163

clusters is necessary, as these clusters displayed the major types of the virus. However,

164

the genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed that there were 8,706 unique strains across

165

the 16,873 strains (Figure S3), it is not easy to directly and accurately partition the

166

strains. For this reason, we applied clustering techniques to measure similarities

167

between these strains and effectively group them.

168

Because SARS-CoV-2 exhibits limited number of SNPs per virus strains and little

169

ongoing horizontal gene exchange, making SNPs ideal clustering input features. We

170

first employed the most common and well-known method, K-means clustering (25),

171

to group the strains. The K-means algorithm requires one to pre-specify the number of

172

clusters (K), but we have little prior knowledge about the number of subtypes formed

173

by the heterogeneous SARS-CoV-2 genome. To determine the number of clusters, we

174

plotted the curves of the sum of squared errors (SSE) and Bayesian information

175

criterion (BIC) (31) under different cluster numbers ranging from 2 to 12 (Figure S4).

176

We used the elbow method and chose the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters

177

(32). This approach resulted in K=6 for both the SSE and BIC curves. We also

178

employed two other clustering methods: hierarchical clustering and BIRCH clustering

179

(26, 27) to group the strains. The confusion matrix indicated that the similarity of K-

180

means and BIRCH exceeded 99% (Figure 1A), whereas the similarity of K-means and

181

hierarchical clustering was 90% (Figure 1B). The differences between K-means and

182

hierarchical clustering results may be due to their different algorithms. The merges

183

and splits of hierarchical clustering are determined in a greedy manner. Each step of

184

the algorithm is based on local decisions, merging the most "compact" cluster

185

available (33). The compactness criterion (or how close together objects are) is

186

defined by the linkage criteria and proximity measure used. On the other hand, K-

187

means maximizes the objective that is a combination of cluster compactness and

188

cluster separation (34).

189

The objective of clustering is minimizing intra-cluster distances and maximizing

190

inter-cluster distances. To determine which method is performed best, we calculated

191

intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances. The average intra-cluster pairwise genetic

192

distances in K-means (4.886) was significantly lower than that in hierarchical clustering

193

(5.062, P-value < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and BIRCH (4.900, P-value < 0.001,

194

Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In addition, we aligned the partitions of the six clusters

195

against the phylogenetic tree for the three methods (Figure 1C). The differences

196

between the hierarchical clustering results and the two other clustering results were

197

mainly at the boundary of the clusters. Of the three methods, strains grouped by K-

198

means and BIRCH were more compact in the phylogenetic tree than those by

199

hierarchical clustering. For example, the strains in both K-means cluster D and BIRCH

200

cluster D were split into two clusters by hierarchical clustering. However, such a split

201

was not supported by the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1C). In general, K-means exhibited

202

the best performance in comparison to the other methods.

203

In the meantime, we used complementary approaches to validate the K-means

204

clustering results. First, we compared the pairwise genetic distances between intra-

205

cluster and inter-cluster. In all six clusters, the average number of intra-cluster genetic

206

distances was significantly lower (P-value < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Figure 1D)

207

than inter-cluster. Second, we applied T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-

208

SNE) to visualize the K-means clustering results. In the t-SNE plot, the strains were

209

well isolated between clusters (Figure 1E).

210
211

The varied proportions of the six clusters in different continents showed specific

212

geographical distributions.

213

Mapping the proportions of strains from each continent showed that the clusters

214

differed in their geographical distributions (Figure 2, Table S1). Of the six clusters,

215

cluster C spread globally. By contrast, cluster A and cluster F occurred at high

216

frequencies in specific regions. 81.92% of the strains in cluster A and 85.73% of the

217

strains in cluster F were from Europe. The geographical spread of each of the three

218

remaining clusters was intermediate. Cluster E occurred at higher frequencies in North

219

America and Europe, and lower frequencies in Asia and Oceania. Cluster D occurred

220

at higher frequencies in North America, and lower frequencies in Asia, Europe and

221

Oceania. The strains in cluster B were mainly in Asia and Europe and partially in North

222

America and Oceania.

223

However, due to the sampling bias of the SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S5), 85% of the

224

strains were collected from Europe and North America, making the proportion of the

225

continents in each cluster not informative. Therefore, we evaluated the proportion of

226

the clusters on each continent. In most continents, the distributions of the strains were

227

concentrated in one or two clusters, including Asia (49% in cluster B), Africa (66% in

228

cluster C), South America (78% in cluster C and F), North America (74% in cluster D

229

and E) and Europe (64% in cluster C and F), see Table S1. Strikingly, Oceania was the

230

only continent that was uniformly separated into the six clusters, indicating strains in

231

Oceania were more diverse than in the other continents.

232

The different geographical distributions for the six clusters could be due to intrinsic

233

genetic factors, extrinsic factors such as the migration of humans, or both. Hence, we

234

next aimed to explore the genomic characteristics of these clusters, as well as the

235

transmission and human migration of the virus across the globe.

236
237

The genetic variance analyses indicated high diversity between clusters

238

If the different geographical distributions for the six clusters were due to intrinsic

239

genetic factors, there would be high genetic variance between the clusters. The average

240

mutation counts for the six clusters were 6.38, 3.49, 6.57, 7.09, 7.89 and 8.96 (Figure

241

S6), respectively. Considering the different collection dates (Figure 3A) of the strains,

242

mutation rates as opposed to mutation counts were more effective for describing the

243

genetic variations between clusters. We defined the date when the reference strain was

244

collected as the index date. The average mutation rates for the six clusters were 25.55,

245

15.91, 25.44, 31.64, 30.99 and 34.12 substitutions per year, respectively. Specifically,

246

the average mutation rate in cluster B was significantly lower (P-value < 0.001,

247

Wilcoxon rank-sum test) than those in other clusters. In contrast, the average mutation

248

rate in cluster F was significantly higher (P-value < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test)

249

than those in other clusters. The Simpson‚Äôs diversity indexes for the six clusters were

250

0.7616, 0.7608, 0.8398, 0.8466, 0.8082 and 0.8502, respectively. Both the average

251

mutation rate and Simpson‚Äôs index were highest in cluster F, suggesting that the

252

diversity of cluster F was higher than the other clusters. The nucleotide diversity per

253

site for the six clusters was 0.0196%, 0.0222%, 0.0171%, 0.0256%, 0.0131% and

254

0.0132%. The high mutation rates but low nucleotide diversity in cluster E and cluster

255

F suggests that these two clusters may have more fixed mutations than the other clusters.

256

The nucleotide diversity of each gene across all clusters is displayed in Figure 3B-G.

257

Except for some short genes that are unlikely to be informative, the diversity of most

258

genes was close to the diversity of their genome-wide variants. Our analysis showed

259

that intra-cluster genetic diversity differed between clusters, suggesting that selective

260

pressures were different between clusters. These different selective pressures will affect

261

the geographical distribution of each cluster.

264

structure.

265

The high genetic diversity between clusters indicated that the frequencies of the

266

mutations across clusters were very different. In order to explore whether there are

267

mutations that affect the genetic structure within the clusters, we applied ANOVA to

268

identify the statistically significant mutations that were strongly associated with clusters.

269

Across the 7,970 substitutions, 26.27% (2,094 substitutions) of them achieved P-values

270

<0.05 (Figure S7). We found that some of these mutations were fixed in one or several

271

clusters. Cluster C, cluster E and cluster F shared four common fixed substitutions:

272

A23403G, C241T, C3037T and C14408T. Cluster E had two additional fixed

273

substitutions: C1059T and G25563T, and cluster F had three additional substitutions

274

from position 28,881 to position 28,883. For the remaining three clusters, there were

275

two fixed substitutions (C8782T, T28144C) and three fixed substitutions (G11083T,

276

G14805T and G26144T) in cluster A. It is noteworthy that the fixed mutation numbers

277

in cluster E (six) and cluster F (seven) were higher than in any of the other clusters,

278

which was consistent with our conclusion of the high mutation rates but low nucleotide

279

diversity in cluster E and cluster F.

280

We selected the 2% (42/2094) substitutions that achieved the lowest P-values

281

(Table 1) and analyzed their distributions in the clusters. Of the 42 substitutions, there

282

were 26 nonsynonymous mutations (mutation G28882A was in a trinucleotide mutation

283

from position 28881 to 28883 that spans two codons and results in an RG (arginine-

284

glycine) to KR (lysine-arginine) amino acid change). We focused on these

285

nonsynonymous mutations as these mutations may be under selection that affect the

286

population structure (35). Some of these substitutions were reported to impact the

287

evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (36-39). For example, mutation A23403G (D614G,

288

Asparticacid to Glycine) in the spike protein domains was reported to show significant

289

variation in cytopathic effects and viral load, and substantially change the pathogenicity

of SARS-CoV-2 (40). This mutation was accompanied by a mutation (T14408C) that

291

results in an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) amino acid change (41). In

292

addition, Tang et al (42) used mutation T28144C to define ‚ÄúL‚Äù type (defined as ‚ÄúL‚Äù

type because T28,144 is in the codon of Leucine) and ‚ÄúS‚Äù type (defined as ‚ÄúS‚Äù type

294

because C28,144 is in the codon of Serine) of SARS-CoV-2. They found that the ‚ÄúL‚Äù

295

type was more transmissible and aggressive than the ‚ÄúS‚Äù type.

296

Previous studies have reported that recombination is common in coronavirus (43-

297

45). Given that recombinations in SARS-CoV-2 may perturb the clustering, we used

298

Haploview (46) to analyze the linkage disequilibrium (LD) by calculating standardized

299

disequilibrium coefficients (D‚Äô) and squared allele-frequency correlations (r2) of the 42

300

substitutions. D‚Ä≤ is affected solely by recombination and not by differences in allele

301

frequencies between sites, and r2 is also affected by differences in allele frequencies at

302

the two sites (47). In the heatmap of D‚Äô (Figure S8) and r2 (Figure S9), no obvious LD

303

blocks were discovered, indicating that our clustering of SARS-CoV-2 strains using

304

substitutions was not distorted by recombination.

305

Selection usually affects the distribution of the mutations in the population.

306

Purifying selection tends to remove amino acid-altering mutations, while positive

307

selection tends to increase the frequency of the mutations. Considering the rapidly

308

proliferating pattern of SARS-CoV-2 that strengthened the power of drift relative to the

309

power of purifying selection (48-50), we mainly focused on the positive selective sites.

310

We applied HyPhy to infer the probabilities of the extracted 26 nonsynonymous

311

mutations that were under positive selection. There are nine mutations (asterisks in

312

Table 1) with a positive probability >0.95. In particular, mutations G2891A, G11083T,

313

C14408T, C17747T and A23403G (D614G) were reported as recurrent mutations (37,

314

51). The recurrence of these mutations agrees with the assumption that they may confer

315

selective advantages in the population. These possible positively selected mutations

316

may result in greater diversity among clusters with different population structures of

317

SARS-CoV-2 across geographical regions.

318
319

The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the unique geographical

320

distribution may also be influenced by the human migration

321

Regardless of the genetic factors, the travel of humans could also lead to unique

322

geographical distributions in today's highly globalized world. By analyzing the

323

frequencies of the extracted 42 mutations in each cluster (Figure 4A) and their collected

324

daily counts (Figure 4B), we can trace the dynamics of substitutions in the SARS-CoV-

325

2 genome. The four genetically linked mutations, A23403G (D614G), C241T, C3037T

326

and C14408T that were fixed across three clusters (C, E and F) had become the highest

327

frequency mutations in the world, with a high frequency on all continents in our

328

downloaded sequences, including South America (87%), Africa (86%), Europe (75%),

329

North America (65%), Oceania (55%) and Asia (32%). The earliest time when

330

sequences carrying these mutations was collected was in late January 2020. About a

331

month later, these mutations were discovered worldwide. Though the mutation

332

A23403G (D614G) has been reported and estimated to be a positive selective mutation,

333

it is almost impossible to spread to the world without human migration in such a short

334

time. Besides these high frequency mutations, some lower frequency mutations also

335

provided some evidence of human migration. We explored the geographical

336

distributions of mutations with global frequencies <0.05 in Table 1. Though most of

337

these low frequency mutations were mainly collected within a single continent, we still

338

find two mutations, T28688C and G1397A, were discovered in Asia, Europe and

339

Oceania with high proportion. In addition, the spatial geographical distributions of

340

some substitutions also provide the evidence that human migration may have

341

influenced the spread of the virus. For example, on the west coast of the USA, most

342

strains accumulated the mutations C8782T and T28144C (cluster D), and these

343

mutations were also found in high frequencies in east Asia. In contrast, on the east coast

344

of the USA, most strains accumulated the mutations A23403G, C241T, C3037T,

345

C14408T, C1059T and G25563T (cluster E), and the similar strains were mainly

346

discovered in Europe (Figure S10).

Discussion

349

Understanding the population structure of SARS-CoV-2 is important in evaluating

350

future risks of novel infections. To precisely analyze its population structure, we used

351

clustering methods in the phylogenetic analysis to group a total of 16,873 publicly

352

available SARS-CoV-2 strains. We employed three different clustering methods: two

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358; this version posted September 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this

perpetuity. It is made available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

353

of which (K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering) were widely used, and the third

354

one (BIRCH) was a much newer one and suggested to be applied to large datasets. By

355

comparing the distributions of the clustering results in the phylogenetic tree and intra-

356

cluster pairwise genetic distances across the three methods, we found that K-means

357

exhibited the best performance.

358

Our clustering results indicated six major clusters of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation

359

profile characterizing clusters of the viral sequences displayed specific geographical

360

distributions. Most continents were mainly concentrated in one or two clusters, but we

361

also found that in Oceania, the strains were uniformly separated across the six clusters.

362

To evaluate whether the geographical distributions for the clusters were due to genetic

363

factors or travel of humans. The varied intra-cluster genetic diversity across the clusters

364

suggested different selective pressures between clusters, which would affect the

365

geographical distributions across the clusters. By analyzing the statistically significant

366

mutations that were strongly associated with the clusters we identified that some

367

mutations might be under positive selection, indicating different geographical

368

distributions between the clusters were partially affected by these mutations. In addition,

369

the dynamics and the spatial geographical distributions of some substitutions suggested

370

that human migration may also have affected the different geographical distributions.

371

In general, our findings indicate that the geographical distributions for the clusters are

372

the result of both genetic factors and migration of humans.

373

It is noteworthy that our study is limited due to the sampling bias of SARS-CoV-2,

374

with more than 60% of the strains being from the United Kingdom and the USA. In

375

contrast, the overall proportion of strains from Africa and South America is less than 2%

376

(Figure S5). Sampling biases can lead to biased parameter estimation and affect the

377

clustering results we observed. For example, the frequency of mutation C15324T

378

reached 41.84% in Africa, but was only 2.21% outside Africa. The frequency of

379

mutation T29148C reached 15.13% in South America, but was only 0.12% outside

380

South America. Another mutation T27299C with frequency 10.92% in South America

381

was only found with frequency 0.08% in other regions. In fact, all three mutations were

382

mostly grouped in single clusters, indicating these mutations were highly concentrated.

383

However, due to the small proportion of the strains from these two continents, these

384

mutations were unable to affect the clustering of samples. To address this issue, more

385

strains were needed to be collected from these continents. In addition, we found that in

386

cluster B, there were no fixed mutations. We calculated the pairwise dependency scores

387

(see Materials and Methods) of all the mutations with frequencies >0.05 in cluster B

388

and discovered five main subclusters (Figure S11). Other than the mutation G11083T

389

that was discovered in two subclusters, there were no common mutations between either

390

of the five clusters. As shown in Figure 3A, these strains were grouped in one cluster

391

mainly because these strains had smaller mutation counts than strains in other clusters.

392

The genetic distance between two strains was still small, though they shared no

393

common mutations. To address this issue, another clustering can be used for more

394

further analyses.

395

Despite the limited number of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 genome sequences, our analysis of

396

population genetics is formative. Our discovery of high genetic diversity in SARS‚Äê

397

CoV‚Äê2 is consistent with an earlier study (52). The topology and the divergence of the

398

clusters in the phylogenetic tree illustrate a relatively recent common ancestor, similar

399

to the fact that the emergence and the spread of the virus was highly concentrated in a

400

short time (2, 53-55). Our work, as well as previous studies (56-58) that use clustering

401

techniques to study the population structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has proved to

402

be a valuable supplemental tool in phylogenetic analyses. In addition, clustering ideas

403

can be used for further study of variant population structures in specific regions of these

404

fast-growing viruses.

569

Hierarchical clustering (B). Each row corresponds to the results of K-means clustering

570

and each column corresponds to the clustering results of BIRCH (Hierarchical)

571

clustering. (C) Phylogenetic tree of 16,873 SARS-CoV-2 strains. Four colored panels

572

outside the phylogenetic tree are used to identify auxiliary information for each virus

573

strain. The inner panel represent the distributions of the continents in the three. The

574

outer three panels represent the partitions of the six clusters across the three clustering

575

methods in the tree. (D) Mean pairwise genetic distances for intra-clustered and inter-

576

clustered genetic distances. The blue bars represent mean pairwise genetic distances

577

between pairs of isolates within the clusters, and the red bars represent mean pairwise

578

genetic distances between pairs of isolates of outside the clusters. The error bar

579

represents the standard deviation. The mean distance between pairs of strains of intra-

580

clusters was significantly lower (P-value < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) than that of

581

inter-clusters. (E) The t-SNE plot of the K-means clustering results. Each dot represents

582

one strain and each color represents to the corresponding cluster.
