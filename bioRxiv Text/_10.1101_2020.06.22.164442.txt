Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 is having severe impact on public health at a global scale. Malayan
pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-2) is closely related to
SARS-CoV-2. We show that CT scans of virus-positive pangolins reveal bilateral
ground-glass opacities in lungs in similar manner to COVID-19 patients. The virus
infected multiple organs in pangolins, with the lungs being the major target.
Histological expression showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed with viral
RNA. Transcriptome analysis revealed an inadequate interferon response, with
different dysregulated chemokines and cytokines responses in pregnant and
non-pregnant adults and fetuses. Viral RNA and protein were detected in three fetuses
providing evidence for vertical virus transmission. In sum, our study identifies the
biological framework of SARSr-CoV-2 in pangolins, revealing striking similarities to
COVID-19 in humans.

The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 caused the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is
severely effecting global health (1-3). After SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to cause severe respiratory illness in humans
identified in the past two decades, although with a markedly lower infection fatality
ratio (4). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, sharing 79.5% overall
genome nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV and 96.2% with the bat-derived
SARS-related coronavirus RaTG13 to which it is most closely related at the level of
the whole genome (5). A better understanding of the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 is
critical for its control and the development of therapeutics. Several animal models are
being developed to assist in better understanding of the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.
These include the development of transduced or transgenic mouse models that express
human ACE2 and can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (6-8), and macaques that can be
infected and recapitulate moderate disease (9, 10).
We previously isolated a SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-2) in
Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2,
especially in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (11, 12).
Understanding the biology of SARSr-CoV-2 in pangolins will be important for
understanding key aspects of coronavirus disease.

Identifying SARSr-CoV-2 infection
Herein, we studied 28 Malayan pangolins that were confiscated in Guangdong
Province between March-August 2019 and initially sent to Guangzhou wildlife rescue

center. Notably, seven of these animals were pregnant. We used the viral S (spike)
gene to identify infection with the pangolin-derived SARSr-CoV-2, and found that 15
animals, including six pregnant females, naturally infected by the virus. Notably, the S
genes amplified from these individuals exhibited no changes in the consensus
sequence. Four samples were chosen for deep sequencing, enabling the de novo
assembly of four near complete coronavirus genomes (Figure S1). Analyses of these
genomes revealed that they exhibited 99.6-99.9% genetic identity with the pangolin
SARSr-CoV-2 reference genome (EPI_ISL_410721) and hence are indicative of a
localized outbreak due to a single source of infection (Figure S2).

Pathogenicity of SARSr-CoV-2 in Malayan pangolins
COVID-19 is characterized by a range of symptoms, but in most cases include
fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia (13). Bilateral opacities on x-ray or patchy
shadows and ground glass opacities visible in CT scans are the most common features
of severe COVID-19 cases (1, 14). Malayan pangolins that were positive for pangolin
SARSr-CoV-2 exhibited respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath
(11). Blood gas tests revealed elevated levels of PCO2 (58.2, and 60.25 mmHg),
HCO3 (29.9, and 34.6 mmol/L), and TCO2 (31.5 mmol/L) in the infected animals
(Table S1), indicative of dyspnea. CT scans in one virus positive pangolin showed a
diffused bilateral distribution of ground-glass opacities in the lungs (Figure 1A),
similar to early-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. The other virus-positive pangolin
exhibited air bronchogram, fibrotic streaks and a subpleural transparent line (Figure

1B), similar to the advanced phase of COVID-19 disease (15). Hence, pangolins
naturally infected with SARSr-CoV-2 show similar symptoms and CT features as
COVID-19 pneumonia in humans.
Necropsy showed pulmonary edema and congestion in lungs of virus-positive
pangolins (Figure S3). Lungs from six pangolins, including four were positive for
SARSr-CoV-2, were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological
examinations. Compared with virus-negative pangolins, lung tissues from the
virus-positive animals showed severe interstitial pneumonia, in which the interstitium
and the walls of the alveoli were thickened and displayed bronchiectasis (Figure 2A-C
and Figure S4). These features are consistent with breathing difficulties. Alveoli were
filled with desquamated epithelial cells and some macrophages with hemosiderin
pigments (Figure 2C).
To ensure that these lesions were associated with SARSr-CoV-2, we used
immunohistochemistry to detect and localize the nucleocapsid (N protein) of the virus.
Several alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes were found to be positive (Figure 2E).
qRT-PCR and western blot analysis further supported the presence of SARSr-CoV-2
infection in the lungs (Figure 2E, Figure 3A-B). These findings are similar to those of
SARS-CoV-2 in humans and are compatible with a similar pathological mechanism,
mainly by invading alveolar epithelial cells which results in respiratory symptoms
(13).

Tissue tropism of SARSr-CoV-2

Although respiratory symptoms dominate the clinical presentation of COVID-19,
SARS-CoV-2 is also associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (13).
Necropsy of virus-positive pangolins similarly revealed multiple organ injury (Figure
S1). We therefore used qRT-PCR to examine the tissue tropism of SARSr-CoV-2.
Viral RNA was mainly detected in the lungs, although other organs such as liver,
intestine, heart, kidney, spleen and muscle of some individuals also had detectable
levels of virus RNA (Figure 3A, Table S2). Western blotting further supported the
presence of viral infection in these tissues (Figure 3B).
The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors for entry into cells (5,
16), while TMPRSS2 mediates spike protein activation and facilitates viral entry (16,
17). Generally, virus-positive pangolins had much higher expression levels of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 in all tissues than virus-negative individuals (Figure 3C and D). In
humans, ACE2 is abundant in the epithelia of the lung, kidney, and small intestine
(18). In pangolins, lung, liver, and spleen had the highest levels of ACE2 and
TMPRSS expression compared to other tissues examined. SARSr-CoV-2 RNA was
also detected in the tissues expressing the highest levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS,
supporting the idea that cells that express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are most
susceptible to coronaviruses (19). However, SARSr-CoV-2 was also detected in
intestine and kidney, tissues that do not have high expression of these receptor genes
in the pangolins.

Potential vertical transmission of SARSr-CoV-2

As COVID-19 becomes a global pandemic, the potential risk of vertical
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has become a topic of concern (20, 21). The ACE2
receptor is widely expressed in the placenta during pregnancy (22). Hence, there is a
theoretical risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, both of
which use ACE2 as receptor. Although neonatal cases of COVID-19 infection and
antibodies in newborns have been found (23-25), testing was only performed in
newborns (rather than embryos), so that infection after birth, or transfer of antibodies
from the placenta and breast milk cannot be excluded. Whether vertical transmission
of this virus occurs in humans therefore remains unclear and will ultimately require
detection of the virus in embryos. We assessed the possibility of vertical virus
transmission in seven pregnant pangolins. Of the six virus-positive pregnant pangolins,
SARSr-CoV-2 RNA and N protein was detected in the intestine, spleen, and muscle of
three of their fetuses (Figure 3A-B, Table S2). Hence, these results demonstrate it is
possible that the vertical transmission of SARSr-CoV-2 can occur in utero.

SARS-CoV (26, 27), a gene enrichment analyses illustrated that SARSr-CoV-2
triggered a dysregulated immune system in pangolins (Figure 4). Notably,
non-pregnant adult, pregnant pangolins and fetuses had very different immune
responses to the virus (Figure 4). In spleen, virus-positive fetuses showed evidence of
the suppression of immune pathways: down-regulated DEGs were those associated
with lymphocyte activation, leukocyte activation, interferon-gamma production,
innate immune response, and cytokine production. For example, gene members of the
TNF-receptor superfamily, such as CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD6, CD7, CD8A; CD8B,
CD84, and CD247 were significantly down-regulated in spleen of fetuses. In contrast,
pregnant pangolins showed up-regulated genes directed toward the regulation of
humoral immune response, regulation of complement activation, inflammatory
responses, and humoral immune responses in spleen, while adult pangolins had
up-regulated genes enriched in negative regulation of type I interferon (IFN)
production. The fetal immune system is unique and immature (28). Fetuses had no
detectable virus RNA in lungs, and DEGs related to immune pathways were not
enriched in lungs (Figure 4D). In the spleen and intestine, where virus RNA was
detected in fetuses, down-regulated genes were related to immune pathways (Figure
4D and Figure S6).
After cellular detection of viral entry into a host cell, interferon induction of ISGs
is essential for the host antiviral response (29, 30). Similar to SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 (26, 31), we found only a small number of significant increases of ISGs
expression in virus-positive pangolins in all tissues, implying an inadequate interferon

response (Figure 4B, Figure S5B and S6B). For example, in lungs, IFIT2, ISG15,
ACOD1, BST2 and IKBKE are up-regulated in adults, while there were
down-regulated in fetuses and pregnant females. In spleen, BST2 and IFIT2 were
up-regulated in adults and pregnant females, ACOD1 was down-regulated in adults
and fetuses, but up-regulated in pregnant animals. ISG15 was up-regulated in muscle
of adults and pregnant females but down-regulated in fetuses, while AIM2 showed the
reverse trend (Figure S5). BST2 was significantly down-regulated in the intestine of
virus-positive fetuses (Figure S6). Some coding proteins of SARSr-CoV-2, such as N
and orf6, may therefore inhibit IFN1 by regulating IFN-β synthesis and signaling to
avoid the innate immune response in a similar manner to other coronaviruses (32-34).
Many of the transcriptomic profiling studies of COVID-19 have been conducted
using peripheral blood, often revealing the upregulation of chemokines and cytokines
(35). Transcriptomic profiles of virus-positive pangolins differed among lung, spleen,
muscle and intestine, while only the lung, the major target of infection, exhibited a
greater signals of both cytokine and chemokine activity (Figure 4, Figure S5 and S6).

(TNFSF) 4, TNFSF9, TNFSF10, TNFSF13, TNFSF14, TNFSF15 were up-regulated
in lungs in both adults and pregnant females. Innate immunity can lead to an
excessive inflammatory response and an over-exuberant cytokine response, with IL-6
having a direct association with the severe patient condition with SARS-CoV-2 and

SARS-CoV (36, 37). Expression of CXCL8 (IL-8) is an attractant for neutrophils and
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (26). Similarly, we found up-regulated
expression of IL-6 and CXCL8 genes in both adults and pregnant females.
In sum, we show that Malayan pangolins infected with SARSr-CoV-2 exhibit a
strikingly similar pathogenicity to human COVID-19 patients. For example, the host
response of pangolins to SARSr-CoV-2, reflected in a low level ISG response, is
similar to that seen in human COVID-19. Although the SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin
virus has a number of important genetic differences to SARS-CoV-2, we were able to
show that SARSr-CoV-2 was present in pangolin fetuses highlights the potential for in
utero virus transmission.

Materials and Methods
Samples
The Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) is classified as critically endangered in
accordance with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List
of Threatened Species R, and included in Appendix I of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES I). The 28
adult Malayan pangolins, seven of which were pregnant, used in this study were
confiscated by Customs and the Department of Forestry of Guangdong Province in
March-August 2019, and naturally infected by the virus. The fetuses of the seven
pregnant pangolins were also used. These animals were initially sent to Guangzhou
wildlife rescue center, during with time some pangolins presented with respiratory
symptoms. Computed tomographic (CT) scans were performed on two animals. For
comparison, CT scan of another pangolin without respiratory symptoms was also
performed. Unfortunately, despite exhaustive rescue efforts all of the pangolins
eventually died. Tissues, including lung, liver, spleen, muscle, kidney, intestine, and
heart were collected, and stored in -80℃ refrigerator. As these pangolins died in 2019,
prior to the emergence of COVID-19, the importance of these samples was not fully
realized at the time so that sample collection was incomplete. Available tissue samples
are shown in Table S2.

SARSr-CoV-2 viral RNA, as well as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcript levels, were
measured by real-time PCR using SYBR Green chemistry. Total RNA was isolated
using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the kit instructions. 5μg
of Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA in a 20 μL reaction volume using by
PrimeScript ™ IV 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Mix (Takara). For quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR), cDNA was used with ChamQTM Universal SYBR® qPCR Master
Mix

(vazyme)

System

(BIO-RAD). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was selected as a
host reference gene to normalize the relative viral loads, evaluated by calculating
-ΔΔCt values. Each quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate. The primers are
shown in Table S4.

Western blots
Protein was extracted with radio-immuno precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer
(50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS) and a protease inhibitor cocktail. 10mg of total protein was separated on
SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes using the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot
protein transfer system. The membrane was blocked at room temperature for 90 min
with 5% skim milk in 1 × TBST (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1%
Tween 20). After blocking, the membrane was incubated with SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Zhengli Shi, Wuhan Institute of
Virology), and Recombinant Anti-Actin antibody (Abcam) at 4ºC overnight, washed

three times with 1 × TBST, and incubated with corresponding peroxidase-conjugated
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) or fluorescently labeled (IRDye 680RD or 800CW: Li-Cor
Biosciences) secondary antibody. The membranes were washed three times with 1 ×
TBST, and then scanned on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor
Biosciences).

Histopathology and immunofluorescence
Lungs from six Malayan pangolins, including four that were positive for
SARSr-CoV-2, were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Tissues were then washed to
remove formalin, dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol, cleared with chloroform,
and embedded with molten paraffin wax in a template. The tissue blocks were
sectioned with a microtome, and sections were transferred onto grease-free glass
slides, deparaffinized, and rehydrated through descending grades of ethanol and
distilled water.
Sections were stained with a hematoxylin and eosin staining kit (Baso
Diagnostics Inc., Wuhan Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd.). Other sections were
incubated in 3% H2O2 solution in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity
after dewaxing in xylene and hydrating in different concentrations of ethanol (100%,
95%, 85%, 75% and 50%). Subsequently, sections were incubated in permeabilizing
solution containing 1% Triton X-100 (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co.,
Ltd) in PBS for one hour and then treated with microwaves for antigen retrieval and
washed with PBS. Sections were then blocked using 5% BSA at room temperature for

one hour and incubated overnight in a humidified chamber with primary antibody
against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (1:100, kindly provided by Dr. Zhengli Shi) at
4℃. Following washing three times in PBS, sections were incubated with Biotin-goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100, Concentrated DyLight 488-SABC kit, Boster
Biological Technology Co. Ltd, China) in a humidified chamber for 30 min at 37℃
and then incubated with DyLight 488-SABC (1:200, Concentrated DyLight
488-SABC kit, Boster Biological Technology Co. Ltd, China) for 30 min at 37℃.
After washing four times with PBS, sections were mounted with Antifade Mounting
Medium with DAPI (Beijing ZSGB Biotechnology Co., Ltd). Tissue fluorescence was
visualized using a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan).

RNA sequencing
TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used for the extraction of total RNA, with DNA digested
with DNase I before library construction. tRNA was also removed before library
preparation. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA
Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following the manufacturer’s
recommendations and index codes were added to attribute the sequences to each
sample. Sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform,
generating 150 bp paired-end reads. Approximately 12 Gb of raw data were generated
for each sample (Table S3). The raw sequencing data sets were submitted to NCBI
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) server (accession number PRJNA640246).

Bioinformatic analyses
Adaptor and low-quality sequences were trimmed using fastp (v0.19.7) (38). Viral
sequences were counted by mapping the clean reads to the pangolin SARSr-CoV-2
genome

(GIASID:

EPI_ISL_410721)

through

BWA-MEM

(v0.7.17)

(39).

Transcriptomes were de novo assembled using Megahit (v1.0.3) (40). The Malayan
pangolin genome (ManJav1.0) was used as the reference host genome. Sequence
alignments were undertaken using the program Hisat2 (41). Gene counts were
summarized using the featureCounts program (42) as part of the Subread package
release 2.0.0 (http://subread.sourceforge.net/). Differential expression analysis of two
groups was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.10.1) (43). The resulting
p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling
the false discovery rate. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were characterized for
each sample (|log2 foldchange| > 1, p-adjusted-value < 0.05).

The Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation of protein sequences were made on
the basis of a BLASTp (v2.7.1+) alignment against the Swissprot protein database.
The GO enrichment analysis of different expressed genes (DEGs) was performed
using the clusterProfiler R package (44). Heatmaps of gene expression levels were
constructing using pheatmap in R packages. Volcano plots and dolt plots were
constructed using ggplot2 (45). The heatmap of Type-I IFN responses was constructed
on genes with |log2 foldchange| > 1 belonging to the following GO annotations:
GO:0035457, GO:0035458, GO:0035455, GO:0035456, GO:0034340. The heatmap
