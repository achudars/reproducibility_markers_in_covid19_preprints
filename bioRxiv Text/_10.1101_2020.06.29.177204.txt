Abstract

29

Background: Since December 2019, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due

30

to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the

31

virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding

32

RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune

33

responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of

34

lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2

35

infected lung epithelial cells.

36

Results: Our analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are

37

broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment

38

analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed

39

protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L,

40

EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A,

41

host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular

42

signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been

43

known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified

44

9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block

45

their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host

46

defense and cell survival.

47

Conclusions: Our investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2

48

infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response,

49

ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel

50

RNA therapeutics as a treatment option.

57

Background

58

By mid-May 2020, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 have crossed 4 million (1), making it

59

one of the largest pandemics in modern times. Since the first reported case at Wuhan, China

60

in December 2019 (2), this viral disease has been responsible for more than 300,000 deaths

61

worldwide (1), and the number is steadily rising. The causative agent behind the disease is a

62

novel beta-coronavirus (3), which has been named SARS Coronavirus 2 i.e. SARS-CoV-2

63

due to its similarity to the earlier SARS-CoV first detected in 2002 (4). The rapid spread of

64

the virus, the ever-increasing death toll, and absence of a sufficient treatment strategy has

65

affected societies and economies all over the globe.

66

The molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is complex and interrelated with host

67

mechanisms, as is common with most pathogenic viruses (5). It is possible that infected lung

68

epithelial cells trigger innate immune pathways, leading to immune effector cells releasing

69

high levels chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines and resultant unconfined or

70

uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response leads to fatality (6, 7). Recent studies also

71

indicate the virus may cause viral sepsis (8) and infection can lead to deregulation in blood

72

coagulation (9, 10). But no one conjecture has been able to formulate a clear and concise

73

explanation of how the virus spreads so effectively and affects so profoundly. With

74

emergence of more and more data, new dimensions arise as possible modes of pathogenesis

75

and progression of infection.

76

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), RNAs that do not code for any proteins, are key players in the

77

regulation of gene expression and influence the interplay involved in host defense

78

mechanisms (11). Regulatory ncRNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding

79

RNAs (lncRNAs) act as important regulators of the cellular antiviral response. Consequently,

80

viruses have been found to utilize cellular ncRNA to evade immune response and exploit

81

cellular machinery to their advantage (12).

82

LncRNAs are a type of non-coding RNA having a size of more than 200 nts that can function

83

as primary or spliced transcripts (13). LncRNAs have become increasingly crucial in

84

explaining cellular processes and understanding molecular progression of diseases. They may

85

regulate gene expression through epigenetic modification of chromatin structure,

86

transcriptional control, regulation of gene transcription via direct binding or transcription

87

factor recruitment and post-transcriptional processing through protein-RNA interaction (14-

88

16). Additionally, lncRNAs may function as competing endogenous RNAs (17) to function as

89

regulators of microRNA targeting of genes involved in important pathways.

90

Previous studies have found lncRNAs to be involved in viral infection and subsequent host

91

response (18-20). A wide selection of lncRNAs get aberrantly modulated in many viral

92

infections like- HSV, Influenza, HIV, HSV etc (21). Upon viral infections, dysregulation of

93

cellular lncRNAs occur which in turn abnormally regulates several host processes resulting in

94

the progression of the viral infection (20). Apart from the general host routes, abnormalities

95

in the expression of lncRNAs mainly affect host’s different antiviral innate immune

96

responses, particularly interferon signaling and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (20, 21). Even in

97

SARS-CoV infection, Peng et al. showed that differential expression of lncRNAs could

98

aberrantly regulate several host responses along with the innate immune signaling (22),

99

which suggests a similar deregulation pattern of lncRNAs could also occur in SARS-CoV-2

100

infection.

101

Blanco-Melo et al. (23) investigated the host response to SARS-CoV-2 by infecting primary

102

human lung epithelium (NHBE) cells and A549 alveolar cell lines with the virus and

103

performing RNA-seq analysis to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes. But no such

104

study yet concluded the possible outcomes of the deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2. In

105

our present study we have identified lncRNAs that are differentially expressed in SARS-

106

CoV-2 infected cell’s transcriptome compared to uninfected cells, and then correlated the

107

putative effects of the deregulated lncRNAs in the tug-of-war between SARS-CoV-2 and the

108

host. We have also investigated the possible aftermaths of lncRNA deregulation in COVID-

109

19 disease pathobiology.

110

Results

111

lncRNAs differentially modulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection

112

To investigate the probable deregulation of lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection, firstly we

113

have analyzed the 24 hours post-infection transcriptome data of SARS-CoV-2 infected

114

NHBE cells. Analyzing the RNA-seq data led to identification of 687 DE genes and

115

intriguingly, amongst those DE genes, we discovered 21 lncRNA genes, 9 of them

116

upregulated while 12 were downregulated (Figure 1).

117

lncRNAs interact with several differentially modulated proteins in SARS-CoV-2

118

infected cells

119

We now sought to elucidate the putative effects of these deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-

120

CoV-2 infection. In order to achieve that, we built a network of the deregulated lncRNAs

121

along with their interacting protein coding target genes. Among the differentially expressed

122

protein-coding genes, 6 were found to interact with the DE lncRNAs which (Table 1). There

123

are direct RNA-RNA interactions for 4 genes, and RNA-protein interactions for the rest

124

(Figure 2). These lncRNA interacting protein coding genes have potential roles during the

125

viral infections (Table 1).

126

Upregulated ADAR interacts directly with downregulated KCNQ1OT1 and GAS6-AS1, and

127

upregulated MEG3 and INHBA-AS1 (Figure 2). ADAR also interacts with UPF1 and MOV10

128

- two proteins which were also interactors of other DE lncRNAs. EDN1 is found to be

129

upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which interacts directly with downregulated UGDH-

130

AS1 (Figure 2). EDN1 can also interact with PRKAR2A, a protein that interacted with

131

KCNQ1OT1. KYNU mRNA interacts directly with FAM230J, which was downregulated (24).

132

MALL gene was found upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. This mRNA interacts directly

133

with AC006058.1, which was also upregulated. Upregulated TLR2 interacts directly with

134

downregulated lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 (Figure 2). YWHAG protein interacts directly with

135

KCNQ1OT1, SNHG8, GAS6-AS1, all of which were downregulated (Figure 2).

136

Protein interactors of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins also interacted with DE lncRNAs

137

Gordon et al. investigated possible protein-protein interactions (PPI) between SARS-CoV-2

138

proteins and host proteins and identified 332 high-confidence interactions (25). We wanted to

139

stratify whether these interacting proteins can be also interact with the DE lncRNAs in

140

SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have constructed a network with the DE lncRNAs and their

141

interacting host proteins that also bind with viral proteins. Among these 332 proteins, we

142

found 10 such proteins to interact with the DE lncRNAs (Table 2). Among them, 7 proteins

143

interacted at protein-RNA level, whereas the rest were RNA-RNA interactions. SARS-CoV-2

144

proteins M (Membrane), N (Nucleocapsid), Nsp8, Nsp12, Nsp13, and ORF8 were found to

145

interact with these host proteins (Figure 3).

146

AKAP8L, an M protein interactor, protein interacts directly with downregulated KCNQ1OT1,

147

GAS6-AS1, SNHG8, AC048341.2 and upregulated AL109615.3 (Figure 3). Among N protein

148

interactors, UPF1 and MOV10 proteins interacted directly with DE lncRNAs, and interacted

149

with each other (Figure 3). UPF1 protein interacts with downregulated AC048341.2,

150

LINC00937, GAS6-AS1, KCNQ1OT1, UGDH-AS1, SNHG8, and AC087473.1 and

151

upregulated AL109615.3, INHBA-AS1, MEG3, LINC02015, MIR3142HG, AC006058.1 and

152

C1RL-AS1 (Figure 3). MOV10 protein interacts with LINC00504, AC048341.2, LINC00937,

153

GAS6-AS1, KCNQ1OT1, UGDH-AS1, SNHG8 and AC087473.1, which were downregulated,

154

and AL109615.3, INHBA-AS1, MEG3, and LINC02015, which were upregulated (Figure 3).

155

Both UPF1 and MOV10 proteins also interact with ADAR protein which can interact with

156

KCNQ1OT1, GAS6-AS1, MEG3, and INHBA-AS1 (Figure 3).MEG3 can stimulate expression

157

of GDF15 by enhancing p53 binding to the GDF15 gene promoter, while GDF15 can be

158

targeted by viral orf8 (Figure 3).

159

Among Nsp8 interactors, EXOSC5 and LARP7 proteins interact with KCNQ1OT1, and

160

SNHG8, both downregulated (Figure 3); HECTD1 mRNA interacts directly with KCNQ1OT1

161

(Figure 3). LARP7 also interacts with LARP4B protein, which interacts with viral Nsp12 and

162

host lncRNA SNHG8, and UGDH-AS1 (Figure 3). Among Nsp12 protein interactors,

163

LARP4B protein interacts with UGDH-AS1 and SNHG8, both downregulated (Figure 3). It

164

also interacts with LARP7, which interacts with viral Nsp8 and host SNHG8, and

165

KCNQ1OT1 (Figure 3). Among Nsp13 interactors, MIPOL1 and PRKAR2A both have RNA-

166

RNA interaction with KCNQ1OT1, which is downregulated. PRKAR2A also interacts with

167

EDN1, which interacts with UGDH-AS1 (Figure 3).

168

Upregulated targets of virally-induced microRNAs might be protected by competing

169

lncRNAs

170

Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis illustrates that lncRNAs and other RNA

171

molecules harboring microRNA (miRNA) response elements can suppress the expression and

172

biological function of each other by competing for miRNAs that can bind to the

173

complementary regions, thus regulating miRNA-mediated gene silencing of the target genes

174

(17, 26). Growing evidence indicates that the ceRNA regulation mechanism plays a role in

175

disease progression and drug efficiency (27-30).

176

To reveal if such networks exists in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, a list of miRNAs induced in

177

viral infection was curated from miRwayDB database (31), Girardi et al. (32), and Leon-

178

Icaza et al. (33). Among them, few were found to target upregulated genes, which were

179

apparently not targeted, as DE lncRNAs were targeted simultaneously (Figure 4). The names

180

and functions of all target genes of the selected miRNAs are provided in supplementary file

181

3.

182

In SARS-CoV-2 infection, miRNA let-7c might target 21 upregulated gene and can also

183

target MEG3, KCNQ1OT1, SNHG8 and FAM106A lncRNAs (Figure 4).The 21 upregulated

184

targets of let-7c-5p are significantly enriched for KEGG pathways like- Kaposi's sarcoma-

185

associated herpesvirus infection, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway (data not shown).

186

Among the target genes, PTGES2 protein was found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7

187

protein (Figure 4).

188

miRNA let-7f can target 20 of the upregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including

189

SOCS3. It might also target lncRNAs AC006058.1, AC007743.1, AC048341.2, C1RL-AS1,

190

FAM106A, INHBA-AS1, KCNQ1OT1, MEG3 and SNHG8 (Figure 4). The 20 upregulated

191

targets of the let-7f-5p are involved in pathways like- Kaposi's sarcoma-associated

192

herpesvirus infection related, JAK-STAT signaling and Hepatitis B related signaling (data not

193

shown).

194

miR-185-5p targets 17 upregulated genes, but also targets lncRNAs AC006058.1,

195

AC008760.2, C1RL-AS1, FAM106A, INHBA-AS1, KCNQ1OT1 and MEG3 (Figure 4).

196

Among the 17 upregulated targets of the miR-185-5p miRNA, most significantly enriched

197

KEGG pathways were MAPK signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway (data not

198

shown). miR-197-5p, miR-200c-5p, miR-222 and miR-223-5p target 5, 3, 6 and 6

199

upregulated genes, respectively. They all can target lncRNA MEG3 whilemiR-222 can

200

additionally target KCNQ1OT1 (Figure 4). The 6 upregulated targets of the miR-185-5p are

201

involved in phagosome, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (data not shown). miR-491-3p

202

targets upregulated NAMPT gene, but also targets MEG3 lncRNA (Figure 4). miR-574-5p

203

targets 10 upregulated genes, but also targets lncRNAs MEG3, KCNQ1OT1 and GAS6-AS1

204

(Figure 4). These 10 upregulated targets of the miR-574-5p are found significantly enriched

205

in biological process/pathways like-TGF-beta signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway,

206

and apoptotic process (data not shown).

207

Involvement of lncRNA may modulate important cellular pathways

208

Cell survival can be beneficial for continued viral replication and growth, but apoptosis is

209

also necessary for spread. Pathways related to cell survival are targeted by virally-induced

210

microRNAs. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signalling acts in favor of cell survival(34). Upregulation of

211

IL-6 during certain viral infections may promote virus survival and/or exacerbation of clinical

212

disease (35). Among let-7c-5p targets and let-7f-5p targets, four upregulated genes, IL6,

213

MYC, PDGFB and STAT2 belong to JAK-STAT signaling pathway. KCNQ1OT1 can act as a

214

sponge for MYC gene, a target of miR-185-5p along with these miRNAs (36) (Figure 4).

215

Also, both let-7c and let-7f target IL6, and absence of this interaction may lead to cell

216

transformation progressing from initial inflammation, implying cell survival (37).

217

Wnt signaling pathway is known to regulate apoptosis through a variety of mechanisms (38)

218

and it can respond to viral infections through modulation of β-catenin stabilization(39). MYC,

219

CSNK1E, and FOSL1 belong to Wnt signaling pathway and are targeted by miR-185-5p.

220

FOSL1 is also targeted by miR-574-5p (Figure 4).

221

Activation of PI3K-Akt signaling is a known viral strategy to delay apoptosis and prolong

222

viral replication, as seen in acute and persistent infection (40). Three upregulated genes,

223

EFNA1, MYC and VEGFA, targeted by miR-185-5p, and two upregulated genes targeted by

224

miR-222-5p, ITGA5 and TGFA, belong to PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (Figure 4). Also,

225

miR-185 was found to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by targeting VEGFA

226

directly in von Hippel-Lindau–inactivated clear cell renal cell carcinoma (41).

227

Cellular response to viral infection can make or break the progression of viral life cycle.

228

Virally-induced microRNAs are also involved in targeting pathways related with

229

inflammation and host defense. NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in upregulating various

230

pro-inflammatory genes that encode cytokines and chemokines (42). It is a major regulator of

231

antiviral response and NF-κB activation pathways are manipulated by viruses to avoid

232

cellular mechanisms that eliminate the infection (43, 44). Two upregulated gene targets of

233

let-7c-5p and let-7f-5p, CXCL8 and LYN, and two upregulated targets of miR-574-5p, TRAF3

234

and TGFBR2 is involved in NF-KappaB signaling pathway (Figure 4). MEG3 can act as a

235

sponge to promote upregulation of TRAF3 (45) and TGFBR2 (46). BCL3, a target of miR-

236

197-5p, is involved in regulation of cell proliferation and participates in NF-KappaB

237

signaling pathway (Figure 4).

238

MAPK pathway positively regulates virus replication in diverse group of viruses (47). 3

239

upregulated gene targets of let-7c-5p, MYC, PDGFB, and DUSP1, belong to MAPK signaling

240

pathway. LDLR, involved with cholesterol homeostasis, is targeted by miR-197-5p and miR-

241

223-5p (Figure 4).

Discussion

243

Long noncoding RNAs are regulators and modulators of complex cellular pathways and viral

244

infection is no exception (19, 20). Dysregulation of lncRNA expression and interaction,

245

either directly with viral RNA, or indirectly with host RNA, affect the progression of viral

246

infection (12). LncRNAs can work as a sponge for miRNA, bind protein as a competitive

247

inhibitor, inhibit protein-protein interaction, influence post-translational modification, or

248

affect the activity of target protein. They can modulate viral life cycle, regulate innate

249

immune response, or assist adaptive immunity (18, 48). In our exploration of the deregulated

250

lncRNA in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells, all of these functionalities come to fore. In

251

our study, lncRNA-interacting DE protein-coding genes and SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors

252

were involved in various pathways. Both RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions were

253

present, indicating a complex interplay between the components involved. We also looked for

254

possible lncRNAs exerting effects as competing endogenous RNAs to ensure a particular

255

miRNA does not downregulate a gene. In turn, the upregulated genes play a crucial role in

256

viral replication, disease progression, and immune response. Although some of these

257

miRNAs also target a few downregulated genes, their decrease in expression may be

258

controlled by separate mechanisms. Our findings shed light on the possible role of DE

259

lncRNAs in specific processes involved with viral infection, proliferation and cellular

260

response.

261

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7-Nsp8-Nsp12 proteins interact to form a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis

262

complex, where Nsp12 works as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. EXOSC5, interactor

263

of Nsp8 protein, is a non-catalytic component of the RNA exosome complex. RNA exosome

264

complex is involved in 3′ processing of various stable RNA species and is crucial for RNA

265

quality control in the nucleus (49), thus Nsp8 binding may be fundamental to diminishing the

266

capacity of exosome to act against viral mRNAs. Antiviral drug Remdesivir has been

267

predicted to target and disassemble this complex (50, 51). Interaction of EXOSC5 protein

268

with KCNQ1OT1 and SNHG8 can modulate this interaction. The putative RNA-RNA

269

interaction between upregulated AC006058.1 and MALL mRNA, a gene involved in

270

cholesterol homeostasis and membrane trafficking, can exert an influence in maturation of

271

SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped virus. FAM230J, which has no reported function, is

272

downregulated in the infected cells. Its absence may activate the upregulated KYNU, which is

273

involved in metabolite biosynthesis pathways, through lack of RNA-RNA interaction.

274

Host RNA-binding proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are involved in

275

regulating viral transcription and mRNA stability. SARS-CoV-2 N protein interacts with

276

UPF1 and MOV10. In case for murine hepatitis virus, a model coronavirus, the N protein

277

carries out this interaction to inhibit nonsense-mediated decay of viral mRNAs containing

278

multiple stop codons, thus favoring viral mRNA transcription. NMD pathways recognized

279

cytoplasmic viral mRNAs as a substrate for degradation, but viral replication induced the

280

inhibition of the NMD pathway through N protein (52). In human T-lymphotropic virus type

281

1 (HTLV-1)-infected cells, viral protein Tax bound to components of NMD pathways,

282

including UPF1, to inhibit the process (53). SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with

283

AKAP8L, which assists in viral infection progression through favoring transcription. Both

284

LARP7 (nsp8 interactor) and LARP4B (nsp12 interactor) are RNA-binding proteins involved

285

in RNA transcription regulation. Interaction of these RNA-binding proteins with the DE

286

lncRNAs may be crucial for viral mRNA transcription and stability against cellular defense.

287

ADAR can be regarded as the “Editor-in-Chief” of innate immunity against viral infection

288

(54), thus the protein’s interaction with both upregulated and downregulated lncRNAs may

289

hold crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. MEG3 was found to act as a biomarker

290

and regulate cell functions by targeting ADAR in colorectal cancer (CRC). The cells

291

overexpressing MEG3 exhibited increased ADAR expression, and downregulation of MEG3

292

was found in CRC tissues, cell lines and serum (55). In the infected cells, MEG3 upregulation

293

may lead to ADAR overexpression, which could have been favorable to the virus, as

294

evidenced in Influenza A (56). INHBA-AS1 upregulation in virus-infected cells may also

295

contribute to cell survival through interaction with ADAR, as evidenced in gastric cancer (57)

296

and oral squamous cell carcinoma (58).

297

Cell survival can be both beneficial to virus and be inhibitory. Viruses need the cell to

298

survive certain period to undergo replication, but they also need apoptosis to exit the cell and

299

infect others. Thus, cell survival and apoptosis becomes a key indicator of pathogenesis.

300

Among lncRNAs, downregulated SNHG8 has possible link to apoptosis and cell death (59),

301

as does KCNQ1OT1 (60-63). Unlike both, downregulation of GAS6-AS1 may be linked with

302

cell proliferation and survival (64, 65). All three interact with YWHAG, which is involved in

303

signal transduction. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling, Wnt signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt

304

signaling, involved in cell survival, are also protected by probable ceRNA function by

305

lncRNA.

306

Innate immune response against the infection is inevitable, but the complex interactions

307

underlying its activation and effect may have been the target of lncRNAs.HECTD1 is an E3

308

ubiquitin-protein ligase that interacts with Nsp8. As it is involved in class I MHC mediated

309

antigen processing and presentation and innate immune system, the binding may lead to

310

modulation of that response. In case of HECTD1 mRNA, absence of RNA-RNA interaction

311

with downregulated KCNQ1OT1 lncRNA can facilitate the response. PTGES2 gene was

312

upregulated and also found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7 protein. As it is involved in

313

innate immune system and signaling pathways, this binding may exert an indirect influence.

314

TLR2, as part of the innate immune response, has been connected to antiviral action against

315

multiple viral infections (66-69). KCNQ1OT1, the lncRNA having putative RNA-RNA

316

interation with TLR2, was found to attenuate sepsis-induced myocardial injury via regulating

317

miR-192-5p/XIAP axis. Downregulation of the lncRNA advanced cardiac injury by allowing

318

miR-192-5p to target XIAP(70). XIAP functions in the inhibition of apoptosis, whereas TLR2

319

is known to promote apoptosis. The downregulation of KCNQ1OT1 in infected cells thus will

320

promote apoptosis, in accordance with its interaction with overexpressed TLR2 mRNA.

321

Response by NF-κB signaling pathway against the viral infection is probably protected by

322

lncRNA against inhibition by virally-induced miRNAs.

323

DE lncRNAs also had probable involvement in regulating cellular processes, including

324

signaling. The downregulation of UGDH-AS1 can be related to EDN1 overexpression, which

325

can be crucial in vasoconstriction, leading to severe symptoms, as seen in SARS-CoV-2

326

infections (71). SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 protein works as a viral helicase, and interacts with

327

MIPOL1 and PRKAR2A. Function of MIPOL1 is unclear, whereas PRKAR2A is involved in

328

cAMP-mediated signaling, which is the probable target for modulation by Nsp13. The RNA-

329

RNA interactions of downregulated KCNQ1OT1 with the mRNAs of these two genes may

330

have implications on viral infection progression. Additionally, MAPK pathway is probably

331

regulated through lncRNA involvement.

332

From literature, it was confirmed that KCNQ1OT1 (72) and MEG3 (73) both can act as

333

probable ceRNA targets for miR-185-5p, whereas MEG3 can act as a ceRNA for let-7c-5p

334

(74). This proves the existence of an expanded role of these lncRNAs in infected cells.

336

Our findings explore the molecular footprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the lens of

337

lncRNAs. The integrated analysis has linked multiple actors in the complex interplay of

338

molecules in exacerbating the infection and identified possible drug targets. We trace the

339

involvement of lncRNAs with cellular behavior in this situation and illuminate their role in

340

cell survival, viral replicaion, and immune defense. The lethality and swift transmission of

341

this virus is entwined with the deregulated cellular environment, and lncRNA regulation is

342

crucial for understanding its parameters. Our results could provide insights for scheming

343

some novel RNA therapeutics during the lacking of effective cure option.

344

Methods

345

Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs

346

Illumina sequenced RNA-seq raw FastQ reads were extracted from GEO database accession:

347

GSE147507 (75). This data include independent biological triplicates of primary human lung

348

epithelium (NHBE) which were mock treated or infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 24hrs.

349

Mapping of reads was done with TopHat (tophat v2.1.1 with Bowtie v2.4.1) (76). Short reads

350

were uniquely aligned allowing at best two mismatches to the latest version human reference

351

genome from (GRCh38) as downloaded from USCS database (77). Sequence matched

352

exactly more than one place with equally quality were discarded to avoid bias (78). The reads

353

that were not mapped to the genome were utilized to map against the transcriptome (junctions

354

mapping). Latest version of Ensembl gene model (79) (version 99, as extracted from UCSC)

355

was used for this process. After mapping, we used SubRead package featureCount v2.21 (80)

356

to calculate absolute read abundance (read count, rc) for each transcript/gene associated to the

357

Ensembl genes. For differential expression (DE) analysis we used DESeq2 v1.26.0 with R

358

v3.6.2 (2019-07-05) (81) that uses a model based on the negative binomial distribution. To

359

avoid false positive, we considered only those transcripts where at least 10 reads were

360

annotated in at least one of the samples used in this study.

361

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction

362

From RNA-seq data analysis, identified differentially expressed 638 protein-coding genes

363

and recently reported 332 SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors by Gordon et al. (25) were used in

364

combination to build PPI network. Edge information for the network built with these proteins

365

were extracted from the STRING (82) database. Interactions with high confidence (score

366

>0.700) were selected and retrieved. A network file was prepared in SIF format to be

367

visualized using Cytoscape v3.7.2 (83).

368

Retrieval of RNA-RNA interactions and lncRNA functions

369

RNA-RNA interactions between the DE lncRNAs and other RNAs were retrieved from

370

NPInter v4.0 (84). The interacting RNAs were searched for identified DE protein-coding

371

genes and viral protein-interactor genes. Functions of the DE lncRNAs were retrieved from

372

LncBook (85). The viral proteins that bind to proteins with lncRNA interactors were also

373

identified.

374

Identification of virally-induced miRNAs

375

miRwayDB(31) was utilized to look for miRNAs involved in viral-mediated disease.

376

Additionally, host miRNAs involved in viral infection as identified by Girardi et al. (32) and

377

microRNAs in viral acute respiratory infections as described by Leon-Icaza et al. (33) were

378

retrieved. These miRNAs were manually curated for their involvement in viral pathogenesis

379

and possible connection to SARS-CoV-2.

380

Extraction of microRNA targets

381

Gene targets for the curated set of miRNAs were retrieved from experimentally validated

382

miRTarBase (86) and filtered for DE protein-coding genes. DIANA-LncBase v3 (87) was

383

used to retrieve miRNAs that target the DE lncRNAs, with high-confidence interactions

384

considered only. The lists were combined to identify the miRNAs that target both DE

385

protein-coding genes and lncRNAs. The set of upregulated target genes for each miRNA

386

were analyzed using NetworkAnalyst 3.0 (88) tools for functional overrepresentation and

387

network enrichment. miRNAs that mostly targeted upregulated genes were finally selected.

388

Construction of biological networks

389

Networks denoting the interactions between DE lncRNAs, DE genes, viral proteins, and

390

curated miRNAs were built using Cytoscape v3.7.2 (83).

ADAR

EDN1

Protein function
ADARworks as a regulator in RIG-I/MDA5 mediated
induction of IFN-alpha/beta pathways and controls
innate immune response against double-stranded RNA
in the cell (89, 90). It exerts an antiviral effect on
hepatitis C virus (HCV)(91), but works in favor of
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)(92), measles virus
(MV) (93, 94), hepatitis delta virus (HDV) (95), and
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (96, 97).
Endothelin-1, which is an endothelium-derived
vasoconstrictor peptide that belongs to the
endothelin/sarafotoxin family (98). The peptide works
as a potent vasoconstrictor and its cognate receptors are
therapeutic targets in the treatment of pulmonary arterial
hypertension (99). It is involved in downstream GPCRcontrolled signaling.

KYNU

MALL

TLR2

YWHAG

KYNU gene encodes Kynureninase enzyme, which
catalyzes the cleavage of L-kynurenine and L-3hydroxykynurenine into anthranilic acid and 3hydroxyanthranilic acid respectively (100, 101). Among
its functional pathways are NAD metabolism and
tryptophan utilization.
MALL gene encodes an element of the machinery for
raft-mediated trafficking in endothelial cells. The
encoded protein, a member of the MAL proteolipid
family, predominantly localizes in glycolipid- and
cholesterol-enriched membrane (GEM) rafts. It interacts
with caveolin-1 and is involved in cholesterol
homeostasis (102, 103).
TLR2 encodes the Toll-like receptor 2 protein, a
fundamental protein in the pathways involved with
pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity
(104). A cell-surface protein that can form heterodimers
with other TLR family members, it can recognize
conserved molecules derived from microorganisms
known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs). Activation of TLRs by PAMPs switches on
signaling pathways that modulate the host's
inflammatory response (105, 106). TLR2 acts via
MYD88 and TRAF6, leading to NF-kappa-B activation,
cytokine secretion and inflammatory response. This
gene may also promote apoptosis in response to
bacterial lipoproteins (107, 108).
YWHAG encodes the 14-3-3 protein gamma, anadapter
protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum
of both general and specialized signaling pathways. It is
induced by growth factors in human vascular smooth
muscle cells, and is also highly expressed in skeletal and
heart muscles, suggesting an important role for this
protein in muscle tissue (109, 110). Among its
interactors are RAF1 and protein kinase C, which link it
to various signal transduction pathways (111). The
protein is involved in apoptosis and PI3K-Akt signaling
pathway (112-114). YWHAG was identified as a direct
target of miR-181b-3p, a metastasis activator which
downregulated YWHAG to promote Snail-induced
epithelial-mesenchimal transformation (EMT) in breast
cancer cells (115). MiR-182 was found to suppress
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation
and metastasis via regulating YWHAG (116)

Gene
Name

AKAP8L

EXOSC5

GDF15

HECTD1

Protein function
AKAP8L (A-kinase anchor protein 8-like)
protein probably plays a role in constitutive
transport element (CTE)-mediated gene
expression by association with DHX9 by
increasing nuclear unspliced mRNA export
(117, 118). In EBV infected cells, it may
target PRKACA to EBNA-LP-containing
nuclear sites to modulate transcription from
specific promoters (119). In synergy with
DHX9, it can activate the CTE-mediated
gene expression of type D retroviruses
(118). In case of HIV-1 infection, it is
involved in the DHX9-promoted annealing
of host tRNA (Lys3) to viral genomic RNA
as a primer in reverse transcription (120).
EXOSC5 is a non-catalytic component of
the RNA exosome complex which has 3' to
5' exoribonuclease activity and participates
in a multitude of cellular RNA processing
and degradation events (121).
GDF15is a member of the Glial cell-derived
neurotropic factor (GDNF) family which
binds to GDNF family receptor α-like
(GFRAL) protein, a transmembrane
receptor exclusively expressed in the hind
brain (122). The protein is expressed in a
broad range of cell types, acts as a
pleiotropic cytokine and is involved in the
stress response program of cells after
cellular injury (123). Increased protein
levels are associated with disease states
such as tissue hypoxia, inflammation, acute
injury and oxidative stress (124, 125).
HECTD1 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase
which accepts ubiquitin from an E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of
a thioester and then directly transfers the
ubiquitin to targeted substrates and mediates
'Lys-63'-linked
polyubiquitination
of
HSP90AA1 which leads to its intracellular
localization and reduced secretion (126).
The protein is involved in class I MHC
mediated
antigen
processing
and
presentation and innate immune system.

LARP4B

LARP7

MIPOL1

UPF1

LARP4Bencodes a La-module containing
factor that can bind AU-rich RNA sequence
directly and promotes mRNA accumulation
and translation (127). It was deemed a
candidate tumor suppressor gene in glioma,
as it was consistently decreased in human
glioma stem cells and cell lines compared
with normal neural stem cells. LARP4B
overexpression strongly inhibited cell
proliferation by inducing mitotic arrest and
apoptosis andCDKN1A and BAX were
upregulated (128).
LARP7 works as a negative transcriptional
regulator of polymerase II genes, acting by
means of the 7SK RNP system (129). This
snRNP complex inhibits a cyclin-dependent
kinase, positive transcription elongation
factor b, which is required for paused RNA
polymerase II at a promoter to begin
transcription elongation (130).
MIPOL1 encodes a coiled-coil domaincontaining protein, which may function as a
tumor suppressor (131).
UPF1 protein, an RNA-dependent helicase
and ATPase, is required for nonsensemediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs
containing premature stop codons (132,
133). It is recruited to mRNAs upon
translation termination by release factors to
stalled ribosomes together with the SMG1C
protein kinase complex to form the transient
SURF (SMG1-UPF1-eRF1- eRF3) complex
(134).

MOV10

MOV10 is a 5' to 3' RNA helicase
contributing to UPF1 mRNA target
degradation by translocation along 3' UTRs
(135) and is involved in miRNA-mediated
gene silencing by the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) (136). It plays a
role for both miRNA-mediated translational
repression and miRNA-mediated cleavage
of complementary mRNAs by RISC (137,
138). UPF1-MOV10 is involved in antiviral
activity through both NMD pathway (139)
and IFN induction (140).
