Abstract:
Disrupted antiviral immune responses are associated with severe COVID-19, the disease caused
by SAR-CoV-2. Here, we show that the 73-amino-acid protein encoded by ORF9c of the viral
genome contains a putative transmembrane domain, interacts with membrane proteins in
multiple cellular compartments, and impairs antiviral processes in a lung epithelial cell line.
Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis,
revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon
signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling.
Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome
inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated
that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARSCoV-2 life cycle.

One-sentence summary:
SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c is the first human coronavirus protein localized to membrane, suppressing
antiviral response, resembling full viral infection.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single strand 29.9 kb RNA virus (1, 2) that causes
severe respiratory disease in humans (COVID-19). This coronavirus was first identified in
Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 (3). Due to its easy human-to-human transmission and the lack
of effective antiviral therapy, COVID-19 has caused a pandemic with more than 19 million cases
and over 740,000 deaths worldwide (https://covid19.who.int). Mechanistically, the host protein
ACE2 serves as the viral receptor and host cellular proteases, such as TMPRSS2, play key roles
in SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells (4-7). ACE2 expression is high in alveolar epithelial cells
(8), making the lung a highly vulnerable target for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a wide range of disease, from asymptomatic to mild disease to
severe disease that can lead to death (9). SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to the coronaviruses
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (10, 11). However, neither of those became a global pandemic.
Current therapies are primarily palliative and supportive (9). More than 2000 clinical trials are
currently in progress worldwide (12) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/who_table). Without effective
vaccines or treatments, there is an urgent need to understand the pathology of SARS-CoV-2
infection, the roles of each of the 29 proteins encoded within the viral genome in the life cycle,
virulence, and pathogenicity of the virus, and identify strategies for intervention or treatment.
Various therapeutic and vaccine strategies target viral entry mechanisms, such as vaccines or
antibodies targeting on the Spike (S) protein (13-16); others target viral replication or assembly
processes, such as the antiviral drug remdesivir, which interferes with RNA replication and has
emerged as superior to placebo in shortening recovery time in adults (17). Another strategy for
treatment is interfere with viral immune evasion mechanisms and thus enable the body’s natural

antiviral responses to be more effective at clearing the virus. Indeed, investigation of
mechanisms of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 is an active area of translational research with
immune evasion properties discovered for nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) (18).
The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 15 open reading frames (ORFs), which encode 29 viral
proteins (19-21). ORF1a and ORF1ab encode polyproteins that are cleaved into 16 nonstructural
proteins (Nsp1 – Nsp16) that comprise the replicase-transcriptase complex. Spike (S) is encoded
by ORF2, envelope (E) by ORF4, membrane (M) by ORF5, and nucleocapsid (N) by ORF9. An
additional 9 ORFs encode “accessory” proteins: ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8,
ORF9b, ORF9c, and ORF10.

Various studies have investigated the functions of the virally encoded proteins by performing
interactome analysis in cells expressing individual viral proteins (19) or by evaluating the
proteomic or transcriptomic changes associated with either viral infection (22-27). Others have
used computational approaches to investigate protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2
viral proteins and host proteins (28). The interactome and proteome studies identified cellular
processes affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection or specific viral proteins, notably innate immune
signaling (19, 20, 23, 28-30), ubiquitin ligase activities (19, 20, 23, 28-30), p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (19, 20, 23, 28-30). The transcriptomic studies
identified interferon signaling (24), cell death (27), interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, and chemokine
signaling (22).

Given the intense interest in catalytically active CoV-2 proteins (31-34), we examined the lessstudied group of ORFs encoding accessory proteins, which are largely thought to maintain viral

structural organization in replication organelles and within the viral particle (35, 36). Here, we
showed that expression of only ORF9c is sufficient to alter cellular networks in a manner that
resembles full SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c encodes an unstable protein with a putative transmembrane domain
Seven of the 29 CoV-2 proteins are ORFs that lack catalytic activity and, in some cases, lack a
known function (19). Each of these were tagged with Strep at the N terminus and expressed them
individually in the lung cancer epithelial cell line A549 in the presence or absence of the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1A). The protein encoded by ORF9c was particularly
unstable, with a profound increase in abundance evident in MG132-treated compared to that in
vehicle-treated A549 cells (Fig 1A).
ORF9c is present in previously characterized strains of SARS-CoV (37), a conservation
suggesting a function in coronavirus pathogenesis. Phylogenetic analysis and alignment of the
protein sequences showed that mutations are present in ORF9c among different coronavirus
strains with bat SARS-like coronavirus ORF14 as the closest ortholog sharing 94% sequence
identity and only 77% identity with ORF14 of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1B, fig. S1A). TMHMM
analysis (38) of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c predicted a transmembrane sequence in the C-terminal
domain, a motif not present in SARS-CoV-1 (or other human coronaviruses) ORF9c sequence
(Fig. 1B, fig. S1B). Additionally, a single nucleotide mutation in SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c altered a
termination codon, enabling the reading frame to extend by 3 amino acids (Fig. 1C).

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c interactome includes membrane-associated proteins distributed
throughout multiple cellular compartments
We assessed potential functions of ORF9c by performing transcriptome, interactome, and
proteome analysis of A549 lung cancer cells transfected with ORF9c tagged at the N terminus
with 2 copies of the Strep tag (19). To map the ORF9c interactome, we conducted liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of 2xStrep-tagged ORF9c compared
with control 2xStrep-tagged GFP) immunoprecipitated from A549 cells 24 h after transfection.
ORF9c interactome analysis revealed that most interacting proteins were classified as membrane
proteins (Fig. 1D, table S1) according to Gene Ontology Cellular Component. As a protein with a
transmembrane domain, this was not surprising. However, we were surprised to find that the
ORF9c interactome was distributed throughout the membrane-bound organelles (Fig. 1D),
including >30 proteins in the protein biosynthesis and transport systems of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and Golgi, >15 proteins in the mitochondria, and >30 other membrane-related
proteins. Given the instability of ORF9c, we were not surprised to identify a group of membraneassociated proteins that function with the proteasome. Comparison between ORF9c and ORF10,
both expressed using the Strep-tagged vector, confirmed that enrichment of membranal proteins
as part of the interactome was selectively seen for the ORF9c (fig. S1C).

Proteome analysis shows ORF9c downregulates proteins involved in interferon signaling and
antigen processing.
We conducted both label free quantification (LFQ) and tandem mass tag (TMT) mass
spectrometry analysis to identify changes in the cellular proteome in A549 cells expressing
ORF9c. We compared the proteomic changes associated with ORF9c expression in the presence

or absence of proteasomal inhibition with MG132, using DMSO as the vehicle control for
comparison in each set. Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed that ORF9c contributed to
major variance in all data sets (fig. S2A, S2B). Pairwise comparisons between ORF9c and
control untransfected samples identified differentially expressed proteins in both the DMSO and
MG132 groups (Fig 2A). In both the DMSO and MG132 datasets, most changes induced by
ORF9c were a reduction in protein abundance (downregulation) (Fig. 2A, table S1).
Downregulated proteins identified using both approaches consistently showed ~60% overlap,
while no overlap were identified among the upregulated proteins. Thus, to maximize the
discovery of ORF9c dysregulated proteins, results from both technologies were combined.
Including the differentially regulated proteins identified by both the TMT and LFQ analysis
revealed 14 proteins were upregulated in common by ORF9c expression in the presence or
absence of the proteasome inhibitor and 144 proteins were downregulated in common (Fig. 2B).
Using the downregulated proteins and upregulated proteins identified for either the DMSO or
MG132 condition separately, we performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to assess
signaling pathways deregulated in ORF9c-expressing cells. In both the DMSO and MG132
condition, interferon (IFN) signaling exhibited the greatest difference, both in terms of the
intensity of the downregulation and the number of proteins significantly associated with this
pathway, in response to ORF9c (Fig. 2C, table S1). Other pathways affected by ORF9c and of
particular importance to virulence were antigen presentation and innate immune response
pathways, such as IRF/cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. We further examined potential
upstream regulators of these pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for proteins that
exhibited a change in abundance in the ORF9c-expressing cells. This analysis revealed that
several components of the IFN machinery [interferons (IFNL1, IFNA), interferon responsive

transcription factors (IRF7, IRF1), and an interferon receptor (INFAR)] were reduced, consistent
with the impaired IFN signaling, and an increase in MAPK1 (also known as ERK2) abundance
(Fig. 2C, table S1).
To assess if there were notable differences in the intensity of the changes in protein abundance in
response to proteasome inhibition, we calculated relative changes in protein abundance between
control and ORF9c-expressing cells from both the DMSO and MG132 conditions for proteins
associated with IFN signaling or the ubiquitin proteasome (UBP) system and antigen
presentation (Fig. 2D). The intensity of the changes was similar in the presence or absence of
MG132, suggesting even small amounts of the unstable ORF9c are sufficient to induce cellular
changes including those that contribute to immune evasion.
Consistent with the IPA-based analysis (Fig. 2B), IFN signaling components, including IFI35,
multiple IFIT proteins, IRF9, ISG15, MX1, PSMB8, and STAT proteins, were downregulated in
ORF9c-expressing cells in both the presence and absence of MG132 (Fig. 2D, left). Indicative of
a decrease in antigen presentation capacity, multiple proteins involved in this process were
decreased, including proteins involved in antigen loading and display [HLA proteins, β2M, and
antigen transporters (TAP1 and TAP2)] and proteins involved in UBP [ubiquitin-conjugating
enzymes UBE2I and UBE2L6), deubiquitination enzymes (USP18 and UPS41), and proteasome
components (PSMB and PSME proteins)] (Fig 2D, right).
These changes in the proteome indicated that the expression of only ORF9c, even in the absence
of proteasomal inhibition to stabilize this protein, is sufficient to elicit effective inhibition of
IFN, immune recognition, and UBP components at the protein level. Such a response suggested
that ORF9c contributes to immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2.

ORF9c attenuates transcription of immune and stress signaling pathways.
We assessed transcriptional changes elicited by ORF9c expression in A549 cells using RNA-seq
analysis. PCA showed that changes induced by ORF9c in both DMSO- and MG132-treated cells
cluster in distinct experimental groups (Fig. S2C). In contrast to the proteomic results that
revealed predominant downregulation of proteins following ORF9c expression, RNA-seq
analysis showed a similar number of transcripts were increased or decreased in the presence or
absence of MG132 (Fig. 3A, table S2). Additionally, the number of differentially regulated
transcripts was higher than that for the differentially regulated proteins.
Using IPA, we identified the pathways significantly enriched in differentially regulated
transcripts. The same set of pathways were identified in the DMSO and MG132 conditions, and
similar to the proteomic results, most related to immune signaling (Fig. 3B, upper, table S2).
However, many of the specific pathways were different from those identified at proteomic level.
At the transcriptional level, we detected the greatest effects on the complement system and
several pathways involved in inflammatory signaling. Thus, some components of antigen
presentation and immune signaling pathways showed comparable changes at the protein and
mRNA levels; other changes elicited by ORF9c expression were unique to the transcriptional
level, such as induction of IL-6 signaling and p38 MAPK signaling, or the protein level, such as
impairment of IFN signaling.
We analyzed the ORF9c-regulated transcripts for those encoding upstream regulators of the
pathways altered at the transcriptional level by ORF9c. This analysis identified the classic
immune modulators tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1B, IFNg, transforming growth factor β
(TGFb), and NF-kB signaling components (Fig. 3B, lower, table S2).

We evaluated transcripts associated with the complement system or IL-6 signaling in detail. In
both the presence and absence of proteasome inhibition, complement system transcripts were
mostly downregulated by ORF9c expression in A549 cells (Fig. 3C, left). For IL-6 signaling, we
found some differences between the MG132 and DMSO conditions (Fig. 3C, right). For several
transcripts the intensity of the upregulation was greater in the absence of proteasome inhibition
(MAP3K14 and MAP2K3, IL6 and IL6R, SOCS1 and SOCS3); for others the presence of the
proteasome inhibitor resulted in a greater reduction in transcript abundance (IL1B, TNFAIP6,
CD14, IL1R2). Thus, these results suggested that ORF9c had a dose-dependent effect on some
transcripts.

Common proteome and transcriptome changes induced by ORF9c
We combined the results of the proteomic and transcriptomic (Fig. 4A), which revealed a small
set of commonly upregulated or downregulated genes by ORF9c at both the transcription and
protein levels (Fig. 4B). We performed IPA canonical pathway analysis and found commonly
altered pathways at both the transcript and protein levels (Fig. 4C, table S1, S2). The direction of
regulation (increased or decreased activity) was consistent between the transcripts and proteins.
However, the number of components significantly enriched in most of the pathways differed
between the protein and transcript levels.
We compared our findings at the transcriptome, proteome, and interactome levels with those
reported by Stukalov et al. (39) for proteins with altered ubiquitination (ubiquitinome) in
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549 cells. Within the top 10 enriched IPA canonical
pathways, we noticed enrichment across all 5 protein ubiquitination data sets, sirtuin signaling,
phagosome maturation, tight junction signaling, and caveolar-mediate endocytosis (Fig. 4D,

table S3). Seven of the 10 were common between the ubiquitinome data (39) and our proteomic
analyses by LFQ or TMT mass spectrometry.
We also compared the pathway enrichment across our transcriptomic data and those from
Blanco-Melo et al. (22) reporting transcriptomic changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in human
primary epithelial cells or ACE-expressing A549 cells and with those from Stukalov et al. (39)
reporting transcriptomic changes in ACE2-expressing A549 cells 12 and 24 hours after infection
(Fig. 4E, table S3). The changes in cellular pathways that we observed at the transcriptional level
in A549 cells expressing only ORF9c were remarkably similar to those observed in SARS-CoV2-infected primary lung cells with a few exceptions. We observed an increase in transcripts
associated with B cell signaling and IL-6 signaling in the ORF9c-expressing A549 cells. In
contrast, the other studies of ACE2-expressing A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed
similar pathway responses, but these were different from the infected primary lung epithelial
cells. To visualize how the transcript and protein level changes induced by ORF9c were related,
we used the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) algorithm, which uses physical
interactions among components, to construct interaction networks overlaid with the direction of
change in either the MG132 or DMSO condition used for mapping changes in transcript and
protein levels (Fig. 4A, 4F, table S1, S2). This analysis revealed a complement module, a
chemotaxis module, an interferon module, and an antigen presentation module, all of which were
mostly downregulated and often coordinately downregulated at both the transcript and protein
levels. Two modules appeared primarily induced at the transcript level, a histone acetylation
module and a module containing the stress responsive AP1 family members (FOSB, FOSL1,
CREB, and ATF3), suggesting that transcriptional repression may underlie some gene expression
changes elicited by ORF9c expression.

ERAD / proteasome inhibitors can partially reverse cellular changes elicited by SARS-CoV-2
ORF9c
In the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor, we observed substantial overlap (55 –
65%) in the ORF9c-downregulated proteins (Fig. 2A) and 54 – 72% overlap in ORF9cupregulated transcripts and 45 – 64% in the downregulated transcripts (Fig. 3A). Thus, despite
ORF9c increasing in MG132-treated A459 cells, the persistent changes in MG132-treated cells
suggested that even a low amount of ORF9c is sufficient to elicit its cellular effects. However,
some transcripts (399) and proteins (97) were downregulated by ORF9c in cells not treated with
MG132 and were upregulated in cells treated with MG132 (Fig. 5A).
Pathway analysis on the transcripts and proteins showed discordant regulation in DMSO- or
MG132-treated cells in response ORF9c. The most pronounced among all three datasets were
components of the UBP and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Fig. 5B, table S4). Changes in
events or pathways associated with the cell cycle was not surprising given the critical role UBP
plays in their regulation. We thus hypothesized that both the UBP and UPR were involved in
degradation of ORF9c. Finding that UPR signaling was also reversed upon MG132 treatment
(Fig 5B) is consistent with the role of UPR signaling in degradation of ORF9c.
To directly assess the importance of UBP and UPR components in ORF9c instability, we
performed an siRNA-based screen targeting over 1100 genes that encode components of both
machineries in A549 cells stably expressing Strep-tagged ORF9c (Fig. S3). The top hits
independently validated as blocking ORF9c degradation were siRNAs targeting VCP [also
known as p97, an ATPase involved in export of unfolded proteins from the ER for ER-associated
degradation (ERAD) and in ER to Golgi transport] (40, 41), the proteasomal subunit PSMD2,
and the proteasome maturation factor POMP (42), which has been also implicated in ERAD (43)

and in IFN-induced reorganization of proteasomes into immunoproteasomes (44) (Fig. 5C, Table
1).
To assess if interfering with ERAD affected the cellular effects induced by ORF9c, we compared
the transcript abundance for 6 genes (IFNGR1, IGS15, IRF9, SOCS1, PSMB8, TAP1) that were
downregulated by expression of ORF9c in DMSO-treated cells with their abundance in cells
treated with the VCP inhibitor MNS-873, the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor
geldanamycin, or the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Although the HSP90 inhibitor and the
proteasome inhibitor increased transcript abundance for some of the gens tested, VCP inhibition
was the most consistently effective at enabling expression of each of these transcripts in the
ORF9c-expressing cells (Fig. 5D). These observations suggested that ORF9c ability to attenuate
key cellular signaling involved in antiviral responses, including antigen presentation, immune,
and IFN pathways, requires the activity of VCP.

Discussion
The key to our ability to control spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is to understand its mechanism
of action and how the concerted action of its 29 encoded proteins subvert cellular regulatory
networks. One can divide viral “success” into two key phases: infection, which is the ability to
enter a given cell type, and multiplication that enables continuous infection through viral
replication and packaging, which exploits host cell machineries (45). A third aspect to viral
success is evasion from immune clearance. Disruption of either the infection or replication
phases should effectively inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Accordingly, many efforts focus on
neutralizing interaction of the viral S protein with ACE2 (4, 46). Other efforts strive to interfere

with the viral life cycle after it invades target cells, and many focus on catalytically active
proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome (47).
Here, we analyzed one small, unstable SARS-CoV-2 protein, ORF9c in the context of an
epithelial lung cancer cell line. Limited overlap between published studies of the ORF9c
interactome can be attributed to their use of different cell system (HEK293 compared with A549
lung cancer cells used here, as the use of different filtering criteria (19). However, many of the
cellular changes elicited by ORF9c in our study also occur following infection with full
replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus (22). Those phenotypes included changes in IFN and other
cytokine signaling, immune recognition (including antigen presentation; dendritic cell, T cell,
and acute immune responses; and pattern recognition), cell cycle, and the complement system,
all of which were downregulated by ORF9c. Additionally, similar to cells infected with the virus
or expressing ORF9c, IL-1, IL-6, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were upregulated. The
primary change identified in our analysis was deregulation of the IFN system, coupled with
changes in cytokines associated with TNF and STAT signaling and factors implicated in innate
immunity. In addition to mediating an antiviral response, aberrant IFN signaling is also critical
for numerous pathological indications linked to COVID-19 (48). Thus, we concluded that SARSCoV-2 ORF9c elicits pathologies not seen with previously characterized coronavirus prototypes,
primarily through effective modulation of IFN signaling. Our findings suggested that ORF9c
enables cells to escape from immune surveillance through by reducing HLA abundance and
antigen presentation, while also slowing cell replication, which could viral replication of infected
cells.
Strikingly, ORF9c is predicted have a transmembrane domain and we found that the ORF9c
interactome was mostly comprised of membrane-associated proteins in multiple organelles,

including ER, Golgi, mitochondria, cell surface membrane, and peroxisomes. Indeed, many of
the cellular changes that we observed following ORF9c expression are associated with
membrane proteins or pathways mediated by proteins that associate with the membranes of
various cellular compartments. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c is the first human coronavirus
ORF9c protein that has acquired this putative transmembrane sequence. Mutations have been
acquired along the course of evolution of ORF9c, although ~80% of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c
sequence is identical to the ortholog in other coronaviruses, although greater similarity was
identified with the bat SARS-CoV-2 sequence. The membranal anchoring capability identified in
SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c is novel feature that may mediate the effect on IFN signaling, antigen
presentation, and immune evasion phenotypes, characteristics that make SARS-CoV-2 much
more virulent and pathogenic than other coronaviruses. Notably, 0.7-1.4% of patients were found
to possess a mutation that is expected to impair transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c
(19) ; awaiting future assessment of clinical outcome, our data would predict a better clinical
outcome, distinguishing these patients from those harboring the transmembrane domain.
Correspondingly, the interactome for the less virulence and pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 ORF9c
(49) did not overlap with that for SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c.
A notable signature that we identified is the upregulation of histone and histone deacetylaserelated factors, which suggested that histone modification may underlie the transcriptional
repression. The increased transcription of AP1 family members (FOSB, FOSL1, CREB, and
ATF3), which participate in the cellular stress response, may reflect the response to stress
imposed by ORF9c, which, in turn, can limit immune-related signaling identified in our study.
Another remarkable signature of ORF9c expression in A459 cells was the association with UBP
components. Together with the observations on cellular immune pathways, this association with

the UBP suggested that ORF9c induces changes in UBP components that alter the stability of
cellular proteins implicated in cytokine signaling, antigen presentation, innate immunity, and the
cell cycle. Additionally, we identified UPR components as important for ORF9c instability,
suggesting that this protein is misfolded or at least recognized as a misfolded protein by the host
cell. In this scenario, we propose that misfolded ORF9c engages UPR (through VCP) and the
UBP, which clears this protein. By engaging the UBP, ORF9c promotes enhanced proteasome
activity as suggested by our proteome analysis.
Our analysis revealed that interfering with VCP activity blunted the transcriptional repressive
effects of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c on impact immune system components, such as IRF9, INFGR1,
ISG15, SOCS1 and TAP1. Proteasome inhibition with bortezomib was also effective, although
not as consistently effective as MNS-873, the VCP inhibitor. These findings suggested that
inhibition of VCP or the proteasome, which has inhibitors currently in clinical trials for cancer
(50, 51), may be considered among therapeutic measures to fight SARS-CoV-2 virulence and
pathologies. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that ORF9c stability and degradation
mechanisms differ based on cell type or the activity of other viral proteins in infected cells.
Another potential therapeutic opportunity involves targeting the membrane association of
ORF9c, because this is a unique feature of the protein in the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Thus,
identifying small molecules that could interfere with ORF9c localization to the membrane could
limit ORF9c function and impede the ability of the virus to evade the immune response and
reduce viral replication.
Given that ORF9c is expected to affect immune evasion, virulence and pathogenesis, additional
studies should assess the consequences of ORF9c inhibition in vivo, using primates and possibly
mouse models where SARS-CoV-2 shown to impact IFN signaling and immune response (48).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Corning) supplemented with
10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco, Life Technologies) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Corning)
and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Transfection
Ten million A549 cells were plated in p15 dishes and transfected using Jet Prime (Polyplus) with
15 μg of Strep-tagged expression ORF constructs or empty vector. Samples were harvested 24h
after transfection using Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline without calcium and magnesium
(D-PBS) and supplemented with 10 mM EDTA. Cell pellets were frozen and stored at -80°C. At
least three biological replicates were independently prepared for immunoprecipitation or MG132
treatment.
Immunoblotting
After 24h transfection, A549 were treated with 10µM MG132 (Selleck) during 4h. Whole cell
extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher) complemented with cOmplete mini
EDTA-free protease and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Following protein
quantification using Pierce’s BCA kit, 5x Laemmli buffer was added and the mix was boiled for
5 minutes. SDS-PAGE resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and
incubated with Strep-tag (Biolegend 688202), b-Tubulin (abcam ab6046) primary antibodies.
Secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000.
Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation of streptavidin-tagged CoV-2 ORFs was performed as previously described
(19). Briefly, frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice for 15-20 minutes and suspended in 1ml
Lysis Buffer with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4°C, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and
supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 Substitute, Complete mini EDTA-free protease and
PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Samples were centrifuged 10 minutes at 4°C
at 13,000g. Protein quantification was performed using Pierce’s BCA quantification kit as per

the manufacturer’s indications. Supernatants (1 mg protein) were incubated 2h at 4°C with
MagStrep “type3” beads (30 μl; IBA Lifesciences) that had been previously equilibrated twice
with 1 ml Wash Buffer (IP Buffer supplemented with 0.05% NP40). Beads were washed five
times with 1 ml Wash Buffer and then five times with 1 ml Ammonium Bicarbonate 50mM.
RNA-seq analysis
Raw FASTQ files were processed using cutadapt v1.18 (52) to remove adapters. RNA-Seq
sequencing reads were aligned using STAR aligner version 2.7 (53) based on human genome
version 38 and Ensemble gene annotation version 84. Gene expression quantification was
performed based on RSEM v1.3.1 (54). Gene differential expression was performed using
estimated read counts from RSEM by the R Bioconductor package DESeq2 following
generalized linear model based on negative binomial distribution (55). Genes with BenjaminiHochberg (BH) corrected p value< 0.05 and fold change >=2 or <=1/2 were selected as
significantly differentially expressed genes.
Pathway and network analysis
Significant differentially expressed genes and proteins were then analyzed using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, Redwood City, USA) using Canonical Pathways and Upstream
Regulators. Canonical Pathway analysis results with BH corrected P<0.1 and Upstream
Regulators with P<0.001 were shown in the Supplementary Tables. Differentially expressed
genes and differentially expressed proteins were further analyzed using Metascape for MCODE
network analysis (56). Subcellular locations of proteins were analyzed using DAVID based on
Gene Ontology Cellular Component category (57) and with the aid of Protein Atlas Protein
localization information. Because proteins targeted by ORF9c in interactome and ubiquitinome
and proteins targeted by MG132 were usually changed at smaller fold. Differentially expressed
genes in Figure 4D, Figure 5A and 5B were selected based on BH correct P <0.05 without fold
change cutoff. Differentially expressed proteins in Figure 4D, Figure 5A and 5B were selected
based on P <0.01 without fold change cutoff.

Sequence analysis of ORF9c protein
Protein sequences similar to SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c were retrieved through NCBI Blastp using the
nr database (58). Sequence alignment was performed using Clustalo (59). Phylogenetic tree was
built using PhyML algorithm by 100 times bootstrap, and visualized using Seaview (60) and
Geneious version 2020.2.2 (San Diego, CA). Transmembrane domain prediction was performed
using TMHMM web server v2.0 (38). Transmembrane domain was predicted based on TMHMM
posterior probability more than 0.5.
Statistical analysis

Supplemental Methods
Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry
Beads were resuspended in 8M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and cysteine disulfide
bonds were reduced with 10 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) at 30°C for 60 min.
Cysteines were then alkylated with 30 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in the dark at room temperature
for 30 min. Following alkylation, urea was diluted to 1 M urea, and proteins were digested
overnight with mass spec grade Trypsin/Lys-C mix (Promega, Madison, WI). Finally, beads
were pulled down and the peptide solution collected in a new tube. Affinity purification was
carried out in a Bravo AssayMap platform (Agilent) using AssayMap streptavidin cartridges
(Agilent). Digested peptides were then desalted in a Bravo AssayMap platform (Agilent) using
AssayMap C18 cartridges and dried down in a SpeedVac concentrator.
Prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, dried peptides were reconstituted with 2% ACN, 0.1% FA and
concentration was determined using a NanoDropTM spectrophometer (ThermoFisher). Samples
were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Proxeon EASY-nanoLC system (ThermoFisher)
coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides
were separated using an analytical C18 Aurora column (75µm x 250 mm, 1.6 µm particles;
IonOpticks) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min (60oC) using a 75-min gradient: 1% to 5% B in 1 min,
6% to 23% B in 44 min, 23% to 34% B in 28 min, and 34% to 48% B in 2 min (A= FA 0.1%;
B=80% ACN: 0.1% FA). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive data-dependent
acquisition mode. MS1 spectra were measured in the Orbitrap in a mass-to-charge (m/z) of 375 –
1500 with a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 200. Automatic gain control target was set to 4 x 105 with
a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The instrument was set to run in top speed mode with 2second cycles for the survey and MS/MS scans. After a survey scan, the most abundant
precursors (with charge state between +2 and +7) were isolated in the quadrupole with an
isolation window of 0.7 m/z and fragmented with HCD at 30% normalized collision energy.
Fragmented precursors were detected in the ion trap as rapid scan mode with automatic gain
control target set to 1 x 104 and a maximum injection time set at 35 ms. The dynamic exclusion
was set to 20 seconds with a 10 ppm mass tolerance around the precursor.

Statistical analysis of interactome data was carried out using in-house R script (version 3.5.1, 64bit), including R Bioconductor packages such as limma and MSstats. First, feature (a peptide
sequence with potential amino acid modifications) intensities were log2-transformed and loessnormalized within each ORF or control batch to account for systematic errors. Testing for
differential abundance was performed using MSstats bioconductor package based on a linear
mixed-effects model. Importantly, the log2FC and p-value of proteins missing completely in the
negative control (Strep-tagged GFP) were imputed as follows. The imputed log2FC was
calculated as the sum of protein intensity (i.e., sum of peptide intensities of a given protein
within a given sample) across replicates of the ORF pulldown and divided by 3.3. The imputed
p-value was calculated by dividing 0.05 by the number of replicates the protein was confidently
identified in the pulldown group. The PPI score is not used for filtering but to indicate
significance of different candidates in the list.
High confidence interacting proteins were selected using the following filtering criteria: log2FC
> 3.3 (10x) and a p-value <0.025 (to include the p-value of proteins detected in at least 2 ORF9c
pulldown replicates but not detected in the negative controls). We also considered the
‘crapomeScore’ < 0.5, which is the fraction of single affinity purification experiments a given
protein-interacting candidate receives in the Crapome database (crapome.org). A score of 1
means the candidate is identified in all experiments in that database.
Global proteome profiling
Cells were lysed in UAB buffer (8M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and
Benzonase 24U/100ml) with vigorous shaking (20 Hz for 10 min at room temperature using a
Retsch MM301 instrument). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000xg for 10 minutes to remove
cellular debris, and protein concentration in supernatants was determined using bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were reduced with 5 mM tris (2carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) at 30°C for 60 min, and subsequently alkylated with 15 mM
iodoacetamide (IAA) in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Urea was then diluted to 1 M
urea using 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and proteins digested overnight with mass spec grade
Trypsin/Lys-C mix (1:25 enzyme/substrate ratio). Samples then were acidified with formic acid
(FA) and desalted using AssayMap C18 cartridges mounted on an Agilent AssayMap BRAVO

liquid handling system. Cartridges were sequentially conditioned with 100% acetonitrile (ACN)
and 0.1% FA, and samples were loaded and washed with 0.1% FA, and peptides eluted with 60%
ACN, 0.1% FA. Finally, organic solvent was removed in a SpeedVac prior to LC-MS/MS
analysis.
For TMT sample preparation, total peptide amount was determined using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and 25 micrograms of sample was labeled with one
TMTpro tag according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The pooled TMT sample was
dried in a SpeedVac, resuspended in 0.1% FA and desalted using a C18 TopTip (PolyLC,
Columbia, MD) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Finally, organic solvent was
removed in a SpeedVac. The dried pooled sample was reconstituted in 20 mM ammonium
formate, pH ~10, and fractionated using a Waters Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1x 15 cm, 1.7
µm pore size) mounted on an M-Class Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC)
system (Waters). Peptides were separated using a 33-min gradient: 1% to 5% in 0.5 min, 5% to
23.5% B in 1 min, 23.5% to 40% B in 23 min, 40% to 45% B in 1.5 min, 45% to 60% B in 2
min, 60% to 70% B in 4 min, and 70%B to 90% in 1 min (A=20 mM ammonium formate, pH
10; B = 100% ACN). A total of 24 fractions were collected and pooled non-contiguously into 12
fractions (i.e., 1+13, 2+14, 3+15, etc.). Pooled fractions were dried to completeness in a
SpeedVac prior to mass spectrometry analysis.
For LC-MS/MS (TMT) analysis, dried peptide fractions were reconstituted with 2% ACN, 0.1%
FA and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Proxeon EASY nanoLC system (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Peptides were separated using an analytical C18 Aurora column (75µm x 250 mm, 1.6µm

6% to 23% B in 44 min, 23% to 34% B in 28 min, and 27% to 48% B in 2 min (A= FA 0.1%;
B=80% ACN: 0.1% FA). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive data-dependent
acquisition mode. MS1 spectra were measured in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 (AGC
target: 4e5; maximum injection time: 50 ms; mass range: from 350 to 1500 m/z). The instrument
was set to run in top speed mode with 3 s cycles for the survey and the MS/MS scans. After a
survey scan, tandem MS was performed in the Ion Routing Multipole HCD-Cell on the most
abundant precursors by isolating them in the quadrupole (Isolation window: 0.7 m/z; charge

resolution (First mass: 110 m/z; AGC target for MS/MS: 1e5; maximum injection time: 105 ms).
The dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s with a 10 ppm mass tolerance around the precursor and its
isotopes.
For TMT data processing, all mass spectra from were analyzed with MaxQuant software version
1.5.5.1. MS/MS spectra were searched against the Homo sapiens Uniprot protein sequence
database (downloaded January 2018) and GPM cRAP sequences (commonly known protein
contaminants). Reporter ion MS2 type was selected along with TMT 16plex option. Precursor
mass tolerance was set to 20ppm and 4.5ppm for the first search, where initial mass recalibration
was completed, and the main search, respectively. Product ions were searched with a mass
tolerance 0.5 Da. The maximum precursor ion charge state used for searching was 7.
Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was searched as a fixed modification, while oxidation of
methionine and acetylation of protein N-termini were searched as variable modifications. The
enzyme was set to trypsin in a specific mode and a maximum of two missed cleavages was
allowed for searching. The target-decoy-based false discovery rate (FDR) filter for spectrum and
protein identification was set to 1%.

siRNA screen
The 1141 Ubiquitome siRNA library was generated from the ON-TARGETplus®
SMARTpool® human siRNA genome library (a pool of 4 unique siRNAs, Dharmacon, Thermo
Scientific). siRNA was used at a final concentration of 10 nM with 0.01μl Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) reagent and 600 cells in a final volume of 50μl/well in black and clear
bottom CellCarrier-384 well plates (PerkinElmer). siRNAs were pre-spotted on a Bravo
automated liquid handling platform (Agilent), and all other liquid additions performed with a
Thermo/Matrix Wellmate. Plates were incubated at 37°C in 10% CO2 for 72h. For positive
controls, MG132 was added to wells 4 hours before fixation at a final concentration of 10uM.
Cells were then fixed (paraformaldehyde 3.7% in PBS, 10min), permeabilized (0.5% Triton X100 in PBS, 5 min), blocked (3% BSA in PBS, 1 h), and then incubated first with primary
antibody (anti-Strep-tag, Thermo Fisher, cat# MA5-17282,1:1000 in 3% BSA) and then with
secondary antibody(Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey-anti mouse antibody, Invitrogen, 1:1000 in 3%
BSA). Wash buffers were PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100. siRNAs pools containing 48 nontargeting siRNAs (Dharmacon) were used as a negative control.
High-content imaging analysis
Cells were imaged with an IC200 high-content screening system (Vala Sciences) using a 20X
objective to visualize Strep-ORF9c proteins (Alexa 488) and nuclei (DAPI). Four images were
obtained from different fields in each well for 384-well plates. Images were analyzed with
Acapella high-content imaging and analysis software for valid cell numbers per field and to
determine average Alexa 488 intensity per cell. A549 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 StrepORF9c were treated with DMSO or MG132 (10uM) served as negative and positive imaging
controls, respectively. Plate-to-plate variability was normalized using a control-based method;
associated control samples were aggregated, and the mean and variance across wells were
determined. The Alexa488 mean intensity for all wells with siRNA knockdown was normalized
using unique non-targeting siRNAs included in each plate as reference data points. The top 36
scoring hits were obtained using a threshold of > 1.46-fold increase in average intensity from
duplicates (p-value <0.05). Ten of the 36 siRNA pools were selected for confirmation in a
secondary deconvolution screen. For that screen, quantification data were converted to a Z-score,

and the average Z-score from data in triplicate plates was determined. Genes were defined as
confirmed screen hits if they had 3 or more individual positive siRNA score (cut-off of >3 SD).
qPCR and primers
A549 cells were transfected with CoV-2 ORFs plasmids and samples harvested at 24h, 48 and 72
h. Total RNA was extracted using RNAeasy (Qiagen) and transcribed into cDNA by cDNA
Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Expression of
CoV-2 ORFs accessory protein transcripts was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) using the following primers: IFNGR1 F AGCAGGAAGTCGATTATGATCCC, R
CTGGCACTGAATCTCGTCACA; ISG15 F CGCAGATCACCCAGAAGATCG, R
TTCGTCGCATTTGTCCACCA; PSMB8 F GGTCCTACATTAGTGCCTTACGG, R
CGCAGATAGTACAGCCTGCATT; SOCS1 F TTTTCGCCCTTAGCGTGAAGA, R
GAGGCAGTCGAAGCTCTCG; TAP1 F GCAAGACGACTTACTCTGGGT, R
GGATCTGACACCACTGGACC. Cycle threshold values were determined and normalized to
the housekeeping gene GAPDH for each experiment. Relative gene expression was calculated by
the 2−ΔΔCt method. Results are expressed as means ± SDs of 3 independent experiments.
Statistical analysis was performed using Student′s t-test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

samples by contributing to 15 – 20% of total variance. C. PCA showing ORF9c expression as the
major factor contributing to 33% of sample variance. MG132 treatment also distinguished samples
by contributing to 13% of total variance.
Figure S3. Schematic outline for the siRNA screen performed to identify UBP components
that can halt ORF9c degradation. Outlined is the approach we used for siRNA screen of A549
cells that stably express strep-ORF9c using reverse transfection of over 1,100 genes from the UBP
library. Microscopy-based screen enabled the identification of siRNA of select UBP components
that prevented the degradation of ORF9c.
