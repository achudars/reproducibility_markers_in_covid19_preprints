ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that
causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends
on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
on S-protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently, COVID19 has been declared pandemic
by World Health Organization (WHO) yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been
seen. We provide evidences to explain these population-level differences. One of the key factors of entry of
the virus in host cells presumably is because of differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins
due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that a higher expression of ACE2 is
facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), with different frequencies
in different populations. We suggest that high expression of ACE2 results in homo-dimerization, proving
disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2; whereas, the monomeric ACE2 has higher
preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in
TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming
of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of the Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest that several key
host genes, like SLC6A19, ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as
Cathepsins, might have a critical role. To conclude, understanding population specific differences in these
genes may help in developing appropriate management strategies for COVID19 with better therapeutic
interventions.

Introduction
The recent emergence of corona virus disease (COVID19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >4.1
Million infections and >285 thousands deaths worldwide so far, and the numbers are increasing exponentially
[https://covid19.who.int/]. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be originated in bats (Zhou et al., 2020) and transmitted
to humans via unknown intermediate host. However, its origin is still being questioned time and again. With
the declaration of SARS-CoV-2 as pandemic by WHO, extensive research worldwide has been carried out. It
has been established that Human ACE2 mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells through its Spike (S) Protein,
which primarily makes entry to host body through respiratory tract with

nasal epithelial cells as potential

initial infection site (Sungnak et al., 2020). ACE2 is a functional receptor on human cells for this newly
originated coronavirus (Walls et al., 2020) with a higher affinity than the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) originated in 2002 (Wan et al., 2020). However, no substantial evidence exists
about the higher expression of ACE2 being primarily associated with the degree of infection (Kuster et al.,
2020). Additionally, COVID19 lethality is mostly driven by the extent of underlying lung injury; whereas, a
negative correlation has been reported between ACE2 expression and lung injury (Imai et al., 2005). A recent
report also suggests an inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by human recombinant soluble (hrs) ACE2 (Monteil et al.,
2020), making it an interesting question to explore.
High differences in clinical outcomes across countries have been [https://covid19.who.int/] noted which
demonstrate that neither all people who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 develop infection nor all infected patients
end up in severe respiratory illness (Guan et al., 2020), which cannot be explained by immunity alone (Shi et
al., 2020) . This leads one to hypothesize about differential genetic susceptibility to COVID19 and virulence
of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations (Kaiser, 2020). Efforts are being made to gain a better understanding
of this disease and even propose prophylactic-hypothetical role of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine,
a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB), for reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID19 in
human population (Miller et al., 2020) . Due to extensive contemporary research, evidences in favour (Stawiski
et al., 2020) as well as against (Cao et al., 2020) the existence of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein bindingresistant ACE2 natural variants, in different populations, have been found recently. In addition, studies
highlighting role of eQTLs in ACE2 expression, resulting in potential differential COVID19 fatality (Cao et
al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a), are pouring in. Where most such studies are targeting only natural variations in
ACE2 gene as SARS-CoV-2 differential susceptibility factor, recent evidences suggest that additional host
proteins like cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 act as co-factors and are critical for efficient cellular infection
by SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Further, it is equally important to consider that rare functional
variants, with uncertain consequences, may not explain large-scale population level differential clinical
outcomes.

This highlights the importance of identification of other potential co-factors and underlying mechanisms these
genes could be involved in. At the same time, understanding the interactions of these host proteins with SARSCoV-2 along with ACE2 may explain many of the unanswered questions. Further evaluation of these host
genes, and exploring their natural occurring variants , along with their expression patterns, may also shed some
light on better conceptual framework of differential susceptibility to COVID19 and the virulence of SARSCoV-2. In the present study, we have tried to exploit existing literature to understand mechanisms of
correlations, of several relevant host genes, including ACE2, which interact specifically with some prominent
viral proteins, using in-silico approaches to understand the role of these as factors responsible for population
level differences.
Methodology
As SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory pathogen, the present study was conducted to understand
mechanisms of its entry to cells in lungs, and we believe it could be extrapolated to other respiratory tract
tissues, to explore potential factors that are responsible for differential outcomes in respiratory illness. To
begin with, we started with the most studied host protein ACE2 and tried to understand its interaction with
SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein followed by adding other interacting proteins. We further added layers of other
methods to have a better understanding of the potential causes and outcomes.
Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
Recently submitted experimental structure (6M17.pdb) of ACE2 dimer bound to two B0AT1 (coded by
SLC6A19) and two receptor-binding domains (RBD) of S1 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein), with
overall resolution of 2.90 Angstrom and SARS-CoV2 Spike Glycoprotein with RBD domain in Up
conformation (6VSB.pdb) were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank for structural visualization and
dynamics analysis (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan and Zhang, 2020). This structure was corrected for missing amino
acids, side chains, missing hydrogen atoms, disulphide bonds etc. It was also optimized for pKa corresponding
to physiological pH 7.2 and energy minimized to correct steric clashes using the Protein Preparation Wizard
of Schrodinger Maestro (Madhavi Sastry et al., 2013). Predefined solvation model TIP3P was used and overall
neutrality of the system was maintained by addition of Na+ and Cl- counter ions (Mark and Nilsson, 2001).
Physiological salt concentration of 0.15 Molar was generated through addition of NaCl. Periodic boundary
condition of 10 Angstrom was set using the System Builder Tool of Desmond software(2006). Total two MD
simulations, each 10 nanosecond long, were conducted. In one of the simulations, six chains i.e. ACE2 dimer
with each monomer bound to a B0AT1 and RBD domain was simulated, where the resulting solvated system
consisted of 424,847 atoms. For the other simulation, monomeric ACE2 bound to viral RBD consisted of
174,900 atoms. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and principal component analysis were done through
R based BIO3D module (Grant et al., 2006). MMGBSA free energy of binding between proteins was

images were traced using pyMOL and VMD (Jacobson et al., 2002) (Humphrey et al., 1996).
Gene Expression in Alternate Transcripts and Regulation Analyses
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal at https://gtexportal.org/ was used to explore various gene
expression profiles. By Tissue, Multigene Query as well as transcript browser was used to understand
expression of splice variants and exons in Lungs. eQTLs were viewed by GTEx IGV Browser as well as GTEx
Locus Browser was used to plot gene specific eQTLs. eQTLs and other gene regulatory information, splice
variants, and ESTs were also explored through UCSC genome browser, https://genome.ucsc.edu/ with build
GRCh37/hg19. Table browser was used to interact with various datasets to look for overlaps and filter
outcomes. Retrieved information was saved in files as well as plotted on UCSC browser as custom tracks.
Comparison of RNA expression and Protein expression, mainly in lungs, was done at the Human Protein Atlas

LDproxy tools of LDlink 4.0.3 web-based suite (https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/) was used to map proxy variants in
strong LD and with putatively functional role. LDpop tool of the LDlink 4.0.3 was used for geographically
annotating allele frequencies in 1000G populations ; alternatively also done by a web-based tool Data wrapper
(https://www.datawrapper.de/ ) in some of the figures.
Computational structural analysis on SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and TMPRSS2
TMPRSS2 has been recently characterized as a critical component for cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann
et al., 2020). To understand its interactions, the protein sequence of surface glycoprotein (YP_009724390.1)
of SARS CoV-2 and two transcripts of TMPRSS2 (NP_005647.3 and NP_001128571.1) protein of homo
sapiens, were retrieved from the NCBI-Protein database. Pairwise sequence alignment of TMPRSS2 isoforms
was carried out by Clustal Omega tool (Sievers et al., 2011). The protein domain information and transcript
variation were retrieved from UniProt (UniProt, 2019), Prosite (Sigrist et al., 2013), Pfam (El-Gebali et al.,
2019) and ENSEMBL (Chen et al., 2010), respectively. The homology model of the S-protein and TMPRSS2
were constructed using Swiss model (Waterhouse et al., 2018), whereas 3D structure of the ACE2 was
retrieved from the PDB database (PDB ID: 6M17). These structures were energy minimized by the Chiron
energy minimization server (Ramachandran et al., 2011). The binding site residues of the proteins retrieved
from Uniport and literature. The mutant structure of the TMPRSS2 protein was generated using WHATIF
server (Chinea et al., 1995) and energy minimized. The effect of the mutant was analysed using HOPE
(Venselaar et al., 2010) and I-mutant (Capriotti et al., 2006). The I-mutant method allows to predict stability
of the protein due to mutation. The docking studies for wild and mutant TMPRSS2 with S-protein and ACE2
were carried out using HADDOCK (Dominguez et al., 2003).
Network analysis on SARS-CoV-2 with Human Proteins
We downloaded the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Accession number: MT121215) from the NCBI database. In order
to find the Host-Pathogen Interactions (HPIs), the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were subjected to HostPathogen Interaction Database (HPIDB 3.0) (Ammari et al., 2016; Kumar and Nanduri, 2010). In addition to
other host genes, we added two more proteins (TMPRSS2 and SLC6A19) which were found to have an
important role in the mechanism of viral entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020). The protein-protein interaction (PPI)
and transcription factor regulation of human proteins were retrieved from GeneMANIA (Warde-Farley et al.,
2010) and literature (Barros et al., 2012; David et al., 2010; Maitland et al., 2011; Tumer et al., 2013; Yu et
al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2009), respectively. The Host Pathogen Interaction Network (HPIN) was visualized
using Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) which includes the information collected from HPIDB, PPIs and TFs.
Modules were defined as the set of statistics and functionally significant interacting genes (Reichardt and
Bornholdt, 2006) which was constructed by using MCODE (Bader and Hogue, 2003). Further, Hubs were
identified using Network analyzer (Assenov et al., 2008), the plugin of Cytoscape v3.2.1. We also studied the
hub proteins’ association with diseases, using DisGeNET (Menche et al., 2015).

The topological properties of the network and their functional significance was studied within the formalism
of network theory which could predict important organizational and regulatory candidates in the network. We
used network theoretical concepts, namely probability of degree distribution, clustering coefficient and
average neighborhood connectivity, to characterize the structural and organizational features of the network
(Details in supplementary Information). Removal of high degree nodes (hubs) in biological networks may
cause lethality to the corresponding organism; the phenomenon has been referred to as the centrality–lethality
rule (Jeong et al., 2001), verified by various genomic investigations. This idea of understanding enabled us to
determine the topological features of the network architecture, important functionally related modules and
hubs (Malik et al., 2019; Nafis et al., 2016). The topological properties were calculated after each subsequent
removal, using the Network Analyzer plugin in Cytoscape version 3.7.1. The calculated topological properties
of knock-out experiment were compared with those of the main network and the change in the properties
helped in understanding the role of leading hubs in the network.
Results and Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 for entry, and its S-protein priming by the serine protease TMPRSS2 is a key factor.
Despite the availability of other proteases, like cathepsin B and L, in the host cells, yet only TMPRSS2
activity is essential for pathogenesis and spread (Hoffmann et al., 2020).
Dynamics and binding analysis of ACE2 with SARS CoV-2 RBD in dimeric and monomeric state
Mutagenesis experiments have reported the importance of Arginine and Lysine residues in ACE2, positioned
between 697 to 716 as an important recognition site for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage (Figure S1a) of ACE2.
Mapping these residues on the recently resolved structure (61M7.pdb) suggests that this region lies in
symmetric dimerization interface between ACE2 homodimer; and is also masked from outside by two BoAT1
in an overall 1:2:1 hetero-tetramer of B0AT1 and ACE2 (Figure S1a) (Yan and Zhang, 2020). In a recently
reported study, the overexpression of ACE2 has been reported to have an overall protective role in viral
infection among patients(Vaduganathan et al., 2020). Increased density of ACE2 on the cell surface has been
observed to protect from lung injury (Imai et al., 2005); also observed in many other instances(Kuster et al.,
2020). We propose that an increased expression of ACE2 due to various factors, including naturally occurring
variations influencing expression of the gene, may increase collisions and hence result in homo-dimerization
of this protein. Binding of B0AT1 to ACE2 is not dependent on ACE2 homodimerization, but its presence
along with dimerised ACE2 effectively shields the latter from interaction with TMPRSS2, with a possible
prevention or reduction in its efficiency to cleave ACE2, a hypothesis based on visualization of the available
experimentally resolved structure 61M7.PDB (Yan and Zhang, 2020). This observation is significant since the
cleaved ACE2 interacts more efficiently with the SARS CoV-2 RBD domain.

Additionally, we also explored if the protease domains (PD) of each of the homodimerized ACE2 could
independently bind with whole of the Spike Glycoprotein without affecting each other or any steric hindrance
(Yan and Zhang, 2020). In the absence of any experimentally resolved structure available in literature with
ACE2 homodimer and complete SARS-CoV2 Spike Glycoproteins binding to these, we aligned the RBD
domains of the 6M17.pdb with the prefusion SARS-CoV2 Spike Glycoprotein in the optimal ACE2 binding
conformation (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan and Zhang, 2020) with “up CTD1” and “open S1 subunit” (Song et al.,
2018) (Figure 1’). Both Spike Glycoproteins (6VSB.pdb) aligned well with viral RBD of (6M17.pdb). Further
these were also observed without any steric clash with the ACE2 or partner Spike Glycoprotein in modelled
structure. Both of these protruded radially outward from ACE2 binding site at PDs but inwards, at anchorage
sites on virus membrane, with distance of approximately 27 nanometers (nm) (Figure 1’). However,
considering the reported inter spike distance, between 13-15 nm (Neuman et al., 2006) and relative positions
of Spike proteins on the viral shell, given almost similar sizes of SARS-CoV (Goldsmith et al., 2004; Neuman
et al., 2006) and SARS-CoV-2 (Chen et al., 2020b), these are anticipated to be either parallel or protruding
radially outwards from its anchorage site, contrasting to the findings in modelled structure (Figure 1). With
this finding of inverse orientation of the Spike protein from virus shell in modelled structure, we propose that
in case of ACE2 dimerization, only one of the dimerized ACE2 can bind with the Spike protein due to steric
hinderances. Thus, the other unbound ACE2 partner may participate in its physiological role and continue to
protect from lung injury.
To understand the mechanistic effect of dimerization, we conceived and simulated two situations: one, where
ACE2 dimer is bound to two B0AT1 and two RBD domains of SARS CoV-2; and second, where only
monomeric ACE2 is bound to one viral RBD. From the RMSF analysis of the simulated trajectories, we
observed a higher order fluctuation in monomeric ACE2 homo-dimerization interface; while the rest of the
ACE2 displayed a similar fluctuation profile, including residues interacting with RBD (Figure S1’’). PCA
analysis and amino acid residue loadings on the PCs (PC1 in this case) reported slightly higher away ward
conformational dynamics w.r.t RBD in dimeric ACE2 (Figure S1’’). This contrasting essential dynamics in
dimeric ACE2 is explained well through the MM-GBSA based free energy of binding calculation between the
10th nanosecond final conformation of ACE2-RBD complex. From both simulations through MM-GBSA
method, 1.5 fold strong binding of monomeric ACE2-RBD complex compared to dimeric ACE2-RBD, was
observed (i.e. ΔG=-75.58 for Dimeric ACE2-RBD vs ΔG=-116.98 for Monomeric ACE2-RBD Complex).
This observation further explains the protective role of overexpressed ACE2, resulting in its dimerization and
reduced affinity for the RBD domain of SARS CoV-2 S1 protein. However, we are also not clear whether the
presence of B0AT1 has any allosteric effect on this observation, in addition to already observed masking of
ACE2 from TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage. Additionally, another metalloprotease ADAM17 has been reported
to compete with the TMPRSS2 and cleave ACE2 in a way that only cleavage by TMPRSS2 was reported to
drive the SARS CoV entry inside the cell (Heurich et al., 2014), which is yet to be explored in relation to

SARS CoV-2. Recent literature also indicates the potential role of other proteases, like cathepsin B/L that can
functionally replace TMPRSS2, which needs to be evaluated extensively. (Sungnak et al., 2020) All these
hypotheses warrant further in-silico analyses with better computational resources, as well as experimental
study designs; and for these we are open to seek collaborations.
Yet, the observations made are of high importance and emphasise on evaluation of expression of the ACE2
and BoAT1 along with TMPRSS2 among patients with varied clinical response to SARS CoV-2 infection,
differential outcomes, and correlation with observed mortality. Therefore, a differential expression of these
genes among patients displaying varied responses from asymptomatic to acute symptoms is worth an
exploration, which may act as biomarkers if proven to predict severity and susceptibility to COVID19.

Differential Genomics backgrounds derived expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
The observations, from our MD analyses (Figures S1’’) show that higher expression of ACE2 gene may
promote ACE2 homo-dimerization, rendering less binding affinity to SARS CoV-2 RBD as well as masking
TMPRSS2 cleavage site (Figure 1). Based on evidences appearing in literature of eQTLs and ACE2 higher
expression in East Asians (Chen et al., 2020a) as well as reported protective role of ACE2 in lung injury (Imai
et al., 2005; Kuster et al., 2020; Vaduganathan et al., 2020), we explored more about ACE2 expression and
its differential genomic backgrounds in different population groups of the world.
ACE2 Expression and functional SNPs related to its expression
Tissue Specific evaluation of ACE2 gene in GTEx portal indicated low level expression of the ACE2 in Lungs
(Figure S2a and S3). Further, it was observed that not all the transcripts and exons of the gene express in
Lungs (Figure S2b and c). As expression of ACE2 is less in Lungs thus, GTEx portal did not return ciseQTLs for ACE2 gene in lungs, in all probabilities. However, eQTLs for the gene were found in other tissues
(Figure 2a and b) in GTEx portal. These eQTLs remained the same across tissue sets and showed similar
effect in expression patterns (Figure 2b). Yet to corelate the expression of the gene with genomic variations,
regions of the gene were explored for potential regulatory elements and overlapped with common variations
through table browser tool of UCSC genome browser with an assumption that the variants having population
level effect should be common variants (Figure S2d and S4). Variations data was retrieved from 1000
Genomes Phase 3 dataset and filtered for variants with at least 10% frequency of the alternate allele in global
population. Overlapping the variants from both the exercises resulted in shortlisting of 2 SNPs rs1978124 and
rs2106809, which were observed with differential frequency distribution in different populations of the world
(Figure S5) at both super-population group and sub-population group level. Interestingly, EAS and EUR sub
population groups were observed to show relatively uniform frequency distribution within group. However,
in AFR, AMR and SAS sub population groups, intra population group differences were observed to be higher,

indicating diversity in the gene pool of population groups. HaploReg annotations indicated that these SNPs
are in a region with Enhancer histone marks and DNAase activity. The same were observed through multiple
regulatory elements tracks in UCSC Genome browser (Figure S2d and S4) including GH0XJ015596
enhancer marked by GeneHancer database. (Fishilevich et al., 2017) Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) values as
(r2) with other putative proxy functional variants were also explored and mapped with UCSC genome browser.
Interestingly, it was observed that SNPs rs1978124 and rs2106809 have a strong LD block of >100kb with
various SNPs in absolute LD but upstream of ACE2 gene across population groups (Figure S6). This indicates
a strong enhancer activity from the region that may affect higher expression of ACE2 gene in lungs, which
may facilitate ACE2 homo-dimerization (Figure 1). However, it also requires experimental validation.

TMPRSS2 Expression and functional SNPs in the gene with potential effect
GTEx portal indicated relatively high levels of TMPRSS2 expression in Lungs (Figure S2a and S7c),
differential transcription (Figure S7c) but no protein expression in lungs (Figure S7a). Evaluation of the
Protein atlas portal, source of Figure S7a, indicated that both antibodies used for detection TMPRSS2 (not
shown in Ms) were restricted to target near N terminal of the protein (either cytoplasmic domain or proximal
extracellular domain near membrane). Evaluation of the GTEx portal for cis-eQTLs for TMPRSS2 gene in
lungs, returned a large number of eQTLs but with a peculiar feature (Figure 3a and b). The eQTLs in lungs
were different as compared to other tissues and had following features: found to be concentrated in region of
the gene with potential alternate transcripts (Figure a,b and S8), towards end of the gene in relatively high
expressing exons (Figure 4b) and coding for the amino acid sequence that has putative functional role in
protein as serine protease domain (Figure 4a) critical for ACE2 cleavage and SARS CoV-2 S-Protein priming.
Variations data was retrieved from 1000 Genomes Phase 3 dataset and filtered for variants with at least 10%
frequency of the alternate allele in global population and overlapped with cis-eQTLs data, resulting in 10
SNPs (rs463727, rs55964536, rs4818239, rs734056, rs4290734, rs2276205, rs34783969, rs11702475,
rs62217531 and rs383510). Annotation of the SNPs indicated that all the SNPs clustered together and were
in strong LD block (Figure S8 and S9a). HaploReg annotations indicated Enhancer histone marks and
DNAase activity in the regions overlapping these SNPs. Amongst these, rs4818239 showed a prominent
putative functional role (Figure S9b) which requires experimental validation. However, the frequency
distribution of the variant rs4818239 in different populations groups of 1000G showed an interesting
differential pattern (Figure S9c). We also explored if there were any alternate functional variations, yet
common in populations, by screening TMPRSS2 gene through genomAD browser and filtered for only
missense variations. The search returned rs75603675 (NP_001128571.1:p.Gly8Val or G8V) and rs12329760
(NP_001128571.1:p.Val197Met or V197M), also observed with differential frequency distribution in 1000G
populations (Figure S9d and e). The observations indicate TMPRSS2 variants may influence interaction with
ACE2 as well as SARS CoV-2 (Figure 1) resulting in population specific differential outcomes.

The variation in TMPRSS2 could inhibit the ingress of SARS-CoV-2
We further opted to explore the structure and function of TMPRSS2 protein. Pairwise sequence alignment of
two isoforms of TMPRSS2 suggested that Isoform-2 lacked 37 residues at N-terminal compared to Isoform1, which was the longest transcript and coded for 529 amino acids (Figure S10). Since the human TMPRSS2
protein structure was not available in the PDB database, we generated a computational protein model. The
model was built using Serine protease hepsin (PDB ID: 5CE1) of homo sapiens. The protein 3D structure
modelled from 146-491 residues of TMPRSS2 with sequence identity, GMQE and QMEAN of 33.82%, 0.53
and -1.43 values, respectively. It showed that the model was constructed with high confidence and best quality.
In a similar manner 3D structure of S-Protein of SARS-CoV-2 was built with sequence identity, GMQE and
QMEAN of 99.26%, 0.72 and -2.81 values, respectively. The protein stability analysis showed that
rs12329760 ( p.Val197Met or V197M) (Isoform-1) variation could decrease the stability of TMPRSS2 protein
with ∆∆G value of -1.51 kcal/mol. The HOPE results suggested, V197M variation is located within a domain,
SRCR (GO Term: Scavenger Receptor Activity as annotated in UniProt) and introduces an amino acid with
different properties, which could disturb this domain and abolish its function. Analyses of another variation
rs75603675 (p.Gly8Val or G8V) showed that wild-type residue, glycine, providing flexibility might be
necessary for the protein function and an alteration in this position could abolish this function, as the observed
torsion angles for this residue were unusual. It could be speculated that only glycine was flexible enough to
make these torsion angles, and a change at the location into another residue would force the local backbone
into an incorrect conformation, disturbing the local structure. The variant residue was also observed to be
more hydrophobic than the wild-type residue. Since sequence similarity search did not find any significant
template at the N-terminal of this protein, we could not generate a quality model for isoform-2, which contains
G8V variation; hence we carried out sequence-based stability analysis. The results suggested that G8V
variation could increase the stability of the TMPRSS2 protein with ∆∆G value of -0.10 kcal/mol. Further, it is
known that Arginine and lysine residues within amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for efficient ACE2
cleavage by TMPRSS2 (Heurich et al., 2014) and recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2
for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S-protein priming. Based on information from previous studies,
we docked the TMPRSS2 p.Val197Met wild-type and variant protein with ACE2 and S-protein of SARSCoV-2. The docking results suggest that the variant V197M protein could promote the binding to ACE2 and
inhibit the binding with S-protein (Figure S11). However, these observations need critical revaluation as well
as experimental work to understand these interactions better.
SLC6A19 (B0AT1) expression naturally in Lungs and other respiratory tract cells, may provide
protection.

One of the interesting gene, SLC6A19, that codes for protein B0AT1, expresses in a very limited number of
tissues and is reported to be absent in Lungs (Figure S2a and S12a,b,c). Our findings indicated its protective
role with competitive hinderance in binding to TMPRSS2. As its expression was observed to be very low in
Lungs, we resolved to look for indirect signatures that may have putative role in providing differential
susceptibility. We noticed several variations clustering together in a potential enhancer region (Figure S12d
and e) and with differential frequencies in different populations. eQTL analyses at GTEx portal also showed
a huge list of potential SNPs upregulating or down regulating SLC6A19 expression in Pancreas, liver, and
whole blood cells,

overlapping with potential Transcription factor binding sites (Figure S12f). We

hypothesize a potential chance of some natural occurring variation/s that could induce expression of BoAT1
in respiratory tract thus, providing a protective role in this scenario (Figure 1). However, this requires
extensive computational exploration as well as experiential validations.
Host-Pathogen Interaction Modelling
We also believed that there are additional genes and factors which might be playing an additional role in
providing differential susceptibility to COVID19. Thus, we carried out a systems biology study to identify
the novel key regulators that may influence the Human and SARS CoV-2 interaction. A detailed Host Pathogen
Interaction Network (HPIN) was created. The constructed HPIN contained 163 interactions, involving 31
nodes, which included 4 viral proteins, 27 human proteins and 8 Transcription Factors (TF) (Figure 5a). From
the HPIN, we identified hubs, namely RPS6, NACA, HNRNPA1, BTF3 and SUMO1 with 19, 18, 17, 16 & 12
degrees, respectively in the network (Figure 5a). This indicated the affinity to attract a large number of low
degree nodes towards each hub, which is a strong evidence of controlling the topological properties of the
network by these few hubs (Good et al., 2011). Interestingly, out of five significant hubs, four hubs (RPS6,
NACA, HNRNPA1 and BTF3) present in module (Nodes: 16, Edges: 118, Score: 15.73) and one hub SUMO1
was present at motif level which is considered one of the most important regulating motif of biological network
at a fundamental level (Figure 5b). From our prediction; we found, four viral proteins (S, N, ORF1a &
ORF1ab) target five host protein groups (ACE2, SUMO1, HNRNPA1, RPS6 & ATP6V1G1). SUMO1 &
HNRNPA1 are targeted by same viral proteins (N). The hub protein, RPS6 (highest degree) directly interacted
with one of the important protein TMPRSS2 which further propagated the signal to ACE2 & SLC6A19. The
Transcription factor HIF1A and BCL6, STAT5, YBX1 inhibits ACE2 and SUMO1; whereas MYC, AR and
HNF4a, HNF1a activates HNRNPA1, TMPRSS2 and SLC6A19 respectively. From the gene diseases
association study few diseases were highly associated with these important hub proteins (Figure S13a);
HNRNPA1 (36%) followed by RPS6 (25%), SUMO1 (21%), BTF3 (9%) and NACA (9%) (Figure S13b).
Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms, Anoxia, fatigue, heart failure etc could
be associated with these hub proteins, mainly HNRNPA1& SUMO1.
By hub removal methodology; we tried to understand the effect of hub removal and calculated the topological
properties of the HPIN as a control. The probability of degree distribution (P(k)), Clustering coefficient (C(k))

and Neighbourhood connectivity (CN(k)) showed that the HPIN followed a power law scaling behavior. The
power law behaviour was also checked and confirmed by using statistical test for power law fitting (p-value ≥
0.1) (Clauset et al., 2009) in the hub-removal process. The removal of RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA &
BTF3 from the HPIN brings significant variations in the topological properties of the HPIN where, degree
distribution (α and β) change significantly (Figure S14a). Similarly, the variations in the measurements of the
exponents of clustering coefficient and neighbourhood connectivity (λ and µ) also showed significant (Figure
S14a). The knockout experiment of hub could able to highlight the local perturbations driven by these hubs
and their effect on global network properties. The result suggest removal of NACA and RPS6 hubs could turn
down the degree distribution, so it could be crucial for communicating the signals (Figure S14b). In case of
clustering coefficient, perturbation of BFT3 shows minimum γ, indicating removal of BFT3 makes the network
less compact, which may lead to the delay in flow of signal. The HPIN perturbation increases in case of BTF3
hub removal. In Neighbourhood connectivity increase in µ indicates that the information processing in the
network becomes faster when SUMO1 hubs are removed, which means that local perturbations due to removal
of hubs are strong enough to cause significant change in global scenario (Canright and Engø-Monsen, 2004)
(Figure S14b). This indicates hubs are not robust, but it helps in the stability of the network.
Overall network analysis showed ACE2 is not only the key molecule for entry and survival of SARS-CoV-2
virus, the hub proteins like RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA & BTF3 might also play a vital role. Analysing
these interactions could provide further important understanding for the underlying biological mechanism of
SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and identifying putative drug targets.
To conclude (Figure 1), higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations with different
frequencies in different populations and is functionally associated with expression of the gene. The higher
expression of ACE2 facilitates homo-dimerization resulting in hindrance to TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of
ACE2. It becomes more difficult in presence of B0AT1 that usually does not express in Lungs. We also
propose that the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its
dimerized counterpart. Further, natural variations in TMPRSS2, with potential functional role, and their
differential frequencies may also result in differential outcomes towards interaction with ACE2 or priming of
viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of virus in host cells. In addition, we have identified some other potential
key host genes like ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA and BTF3, that might have a critical role.
With all this background, it is anticipated that in populations like Indian populations, with highly diverse gene
pool, a great variation in clinical outcomes is expected and that could be population/region specific, but
primarily due to gene pool structure of the region, despite similar exposure levels to SARS CoV-2 and
resources. Understanding these population specific differences may help in developing appropriate
management strategies.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. The overall interaction of host proteins and SARS-CoV-2 entry to cell
The figure summarises various factors involved that can influence the entry of Virus in host cell. It depicts
brief mechanisms that may arise due to natural occurring variations influencing expression of host genes or
structural changes affecting interactions within host proteins or viral proteins resulting in effect on efficiency
of virus entry in host cells which could be key factor is providing differential clinical outcomes in different
population groups. The figure depicts, higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations with
different frequencies in different populations and functionally associated with expression of the gene. The
higher expression of ACE2 facilitates homo-dimerization resulting in hindrance to TMPRSS2 mediated
cleavage of ACE2. Monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis
its dimerized counterpart. It becomes more difficult in presence of B0AT1 that usually does not express in
Lungs. Further, natural variations in TMPRSS2, with potential functional role, and their differential
frequencies may also result in differential outcomes towards interaction with ACE2 or priming of viral Sprotein, a critical step for entry of Virus in host cells. In addition, other potential key host genes like ADAM17,
RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA and BTF3 might have a critical role.

Additional information about knock-out experiment in Network analysis

Perturbation by leading hub removal analysis
Degree Distribution (P(k)): Degree k is the number of interaction a node in the HPIN. P(k) is the probability
of randomly chosen node to have k interaction with the neighbour. The probability of degree distribution
(P(k)) of the network is calculated by:
! (# ) =

&'
(

where, nk is equal to the number of nodes with degree k and N is equal to the size of the network (Albert and
Barabási, 2002; Barabasi and Albert, 1999).
Clustering Coefficient (C(k)): Clustering coefficient defines how strongly the nodes in a network tend to
cluster together. Clustering coefficient of the ith node in undirected network can be obtained by:
) (# * ) =

2,*
# * (# * − 1)

where, ei is the number of connected pairs of the nearest-neighbour of the i-th node and ki denotes the degree
of the respective node (Ravasz and Barabasi, 2003; Ravasz, et al., 2002).
Neighborhood Connectivity (CN(k)): Neighbourhood connectivity of a node is defined as the connectivity
of all the neighbours of the node (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002). The average connectivity of the nearest
neighbours of a node is given by:
)/ (#) = 0 1! (1|#)
3

where, P(q|k) denotes the conditional probability that a link belonging to a node with connectivity k points
to a node with connectivity q.
For scale free network, CN(k) is constant while it follows power law CN(k)= c

–µ

for hierarchical network

with µ approximately equal to 0.5 (Pastor-Satorras, et al., 2001). The positive and negative signs in µ
indicates the assortivity or disassortivity of network respectively (Barrat, et al., 2004).

proportion of variance
Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) plots of ACE2 protein from monomeric ACE2-RBD viral complex
and dimeric ACE2(single chain)-RBD complex are shown. The localized fluctuation profile of the amino
acids across the protein were similar for both simulation conditions except higher fluctuation in the region
that constitutes the ACE2 dimerization interface and following C terminal helix which interacts with B0AT1
(B0AT1 was deleted in the monomeric ACE2-RBD simulation [a]. The contribution of the amino acids to
the principal component (PC) 1 and 2 (black and red respectively) along with the scree plot reporting the
proportion of variance by each PC are shown [b and c]. It can be observed that the N terminal amino acids
consisting of the ACE2-RBD binding site contributed more to the overall essential dynamics in dimeric
