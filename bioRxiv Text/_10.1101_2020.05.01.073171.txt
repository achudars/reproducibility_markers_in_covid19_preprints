ABSTRACT

8
9

In response to the ongoing global pandemic, progress has been made in understanding the molecular-level host interactions

10

of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. However, when the virus enters the body it interacts not

11

only with the host but also with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome

12

interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. With this aim we carry out a

13

functional analysis of previously published RNA sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 patients,

14

twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The resulting microbiome functional profiles

15

and their top differentiating features clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the functional features in connection with their

16

associated metabolic pathways, differentially abundant pathways are indicated, compared to both the community-acquired

17

pneumonia and healthy cohorts. From this analysis, distinguishing signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are

18

identified, including decreased lipid and glycan metabolism pathways, and increased carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Here

19

we present a framework for comparative functional analysis of microbiomes, the results from which can lead to new hypotheses

20

on the host-microbiome interactions in healthy versus afflicted cohorts. The findings from this analysis call for further research

21

on microbial functions and host-microbiome interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

22

Introduction

23

An impressive number of scientific studies have rapidly been published on the genomics and molecular-level host interactions

24

of the new coronavirus SARS-Cov-21 of reported bat origin,2 responsible for the COVID-19 disease pandemic. Additionally,

25

understanding changes in the microenvironment within the host can yield insights into related biological processes perturbed

26

by the virus. An increase in opportunistic organisms and an enhanced capacity for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis

27

and carbohydrate metabolism has been associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 presence in fecal microbiomes.3 It has been

28

suggested that gut microbiota could contribute to the pathology of the gut-lung axis during COVID-19.4 The respiratory

29

microbiome members during the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been studied.1, 5–7 Previous studies on

30

the respiratory tract microbiome during other pathogen infections have examined its predictivity of clinical outcomes, and

31

associated potential probiotic interventions.8–12

32

To better understand the role of the respiratory microbiome in COVID-19, we introduce a functional analysis, as opposed to

33

taxonomic naming, of recently published metatranscriptomes5 from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients,

34

healthy subjects, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. While Shen et al.5 focused on the SARS-Cov-2 genomes

35

and taxonomic profiling of the microbiomes, here we perform global functional profiling to characterize altered biological

36

processes the respiratory tract microbiomes. Our protein domain focused amino acid matching approach supports the profiling

37

of functions performed by known and potentially unknown organisms yet to be characterized.13 The robust comparative

38

analysis presented here was designed to highlight consistent differences in COVID-19 patient microbiomes compared to both

39

community-acquired pneumonia and healthy control samples.

40

Results

41

Functional profiling framework

42

The overall analysis workflow is depicted in Fig. 1A. The total RNA sequencing reads were first trimmed and filtered, followed

43

by translation and functional classification with PRROMenade14 against a vast amino acid sequence collection of 21 million

44

bacterial and viral protein domains from the IBM Functional Genomics Platform,15 annotated with KEGG enzyme codes

45

(EC) from a corresponding functional hierarchy16 (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for filtering results). Post-processing and robust

46

rank-based RoDEO17 projection onto a unified scale was performed to make the resulting functional profiles comparable.

47

Microbiome functional profiles cluster by cohort

48

While the individual functional profiles vary, a robust comparative analysis reveals specific functions that are consistently

49

altered between cohorts (Supplementary File S1 shows a Krona18 visualization of each sample). The read counts assigned at

50

various functional hierarchy levels (Supplementary Fig. S2) were pushed down to the leaf level, and very low abundant features

51

were removed for subsequent analyses (see Methods).

52

Multi-dimensional scaling of pairwise Spearman distances between the samples separates the COVID-19 cohort, while CAP

53

samples are located between healthy and COVID-19 samples (Fig. 1B). A significant difference between the functional profiles

54

was observed between the COVID-19, CAP, and healthy control cohorts according to the PERMANOVA test (p ≤ 0.0001).

55

Functional profiling separated the cohorts with a similar score as taxonomic profiling (functional profiling R2 = 0.06 vs.

56

taxonomic profiling by Shen et al5 R2 = 0.07).

57

Differentially abundant features distinguish COVID-19 samples

58

The RNA sequencing data had varying total number of reads and human content per sample (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore

59

we used RoDEO17 to project the functional profiles onto a robust uniform scale. To examine the most differentiating features

60

for COVID-19 versus the other cohorts, we extracted 30 top-ranked features from the COVID vs. CAP comparison and from

61

the COVID vs. healthy controls comparison. We then considered the union of the feature sets, resulting in 44 EC features.

62

When clustering the samples using the top differentiating features, the COVID-19 samples are grouped together and separate

63

from the other cohorts, except for sample 4 (Fig. 2). While the examined 44 features were selected as those differentiating

64

COVID-19 from CAP and healthy controls, they also separate the healthy control samples from all others; the healthy controls

65

cluster tightly together. The results also demonstrate that the samples do not merely cluster by the total number of input reads or

66

the fraction of functionally annotated microbial reads, since those measures vary within cohorts (Supplementary Fig. S1). The

67

CAP patient samples were collected from different hospital sources, prior to the current pandemic, and represent pneumonia

68

cases with various viruses detected in the sequencing data5 (e.g. enterovirus, influenza virus, rhinovirus), possibly contributing

69

to the greater variability between their microbiome functional profiles.

70

The COVID-19 samples have more abundant EC features including (see bottom left feature cluster in Fig. 2) 1.2.4.1

71

"Pyruvate dehydrogenase", 4.1.1.20 "Diaminopimelate decarboxylase", 1.17.4.1 "Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase",

72

1.8.1.4 "Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase", 3.6.3.25 "Sulfate-transporting ATPase", and 4.2.3.5 "Chorismate synthase", linked to

73

various amino acid, carbohydrate, energy, and nucleotide metabolism pathways. EC 4.1.1.20 was also detected as increased in a

74

metaproteome study of COVID-19 respiratory microbiomes.19 Supplementary Fig. S3 includes a scatter plot of the average

75

change per EC in COVID-19 compared to CAP and healthy cohorts, highlighting outliers.

76

Altered lung microbiome pathways indicated in COVID-19

77

In order to systematically examine the detected features against functional pathways, all the EC features were considered

78

against their corresponding pathways from the KEGG metabolic pathway mapping.16 Pathway scores (mean abundance change

79

in COVID-19) were computed using all the detected EC features per pathway, see Fig. 3. To identify outlying pathway scores

80

(high or low compared to the observed distribution), median absolute deviation (MAD),20 a robust measure of dispersion was

81

utilized. The most differential pathways are shown in Table 1.

82

Among the pathways that were lower in COVID-19 (Table 1) several are related to glycan biosynthesis and metabolism

83

(e.g. other glycan degradation) and lipid metabolism (e.g. sphingolipid metabolism). Sphingolipids are important components

84

of biomembranes, mediating signal transduction and immune activation processes, and they have been shown to decrease

85

in COVID-19 patient sera.21 The feature 3.2.1.22 alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) is lower in COVID-19 and is linked to

86

several of the lower abundance pathways in Table 1: glycosphingolipid biosynth. - globo and isoglobo series, sphingolipid

87

metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. It has recently been hypothesized that dysbacteriosis observed in COVID-19 patients

88

is linked to the reduction in the microbiota of alpha-gal containing commensal bacteria, or alternatively individuals with higher

89

alpha-gal content in the microbiota may be less susceptible to COVID-19, supported by detected negative correlation between

90

anti-alpha-gal antibody titers and COVID-19 disease severity.22 Elsewhere, raising anti-alpha-gal titers in the population by

91

immunizing against inactivated harmless bacteria that harbor alpha-gal epitopes has been suggested.23 Here we additionally

92

identify glycosaminoglycan degradation as decreased in COVID-19 samples (Fig. 3), while a connection between decreased

93

presence of host glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate modifying bacteria and increased COVID-19 susceptibility has been

94

suggested.24

95

Among the pathways higher in COVID-19 are several related to carbohydrate metabolism, e.g. glycolysis/gluconeogenesis

96

(Table 1). Enhanced microbial capacity for carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis II from fructose-6-phosphate) has previously

97

been indicated in fecal samples with a signature of high SARS-Cov-2 infectivity, along with decreased abundance of short-chain

98

fatty acid producing bacteria.3

99

Discussion

100

Analyzing COVID-19 respiratory tract metatranscriptomes from a functional perspective offers an additional view into their

101

differences from healthy controls and from subjects with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The comparative approach

102

taken here aims to mitigate possible experimental variation and resulting biases within individual samples, by focusing on

103

detecting robust and consistent differences in the detected microbial functions. The framework presented here includes

104

read filtering, functional annotation with a protein domain database and enzyme hierachy, feature abundance projection to

105

a comparable scale, and finally metabolic pathway scoring to indicate differentially abundant functionalities in COVID-19

106

microbiomes compared to healthy and CAP samples. As a result, we identified both enzyme code features and metabolic

107

pathways that differentiate COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes. The resulting functional profiles distinguish COVID-19

108

samples from others, similarly to the original taxonomy-based analysis of the community members.5

109

The differentially abundant functions and pathways identified here match findings from previous reports, relating to

110

decreased lipid and glycan metabolism,21 increased carbohydrate metabolism,3 and other characteristics of the microbiome

111

linked to COVID-19.22–24 The remaining findings can suggest novel host-microbiome interactions to be examined further.

112

Limitations of the study include small sample size and lack of clinical data, hence possible connections between administered

113

therapies and the microbiome remain elusive. The findings from this analysis call for further in-depth research on microbial

114

functions and host-microbiome interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Examining metatranscriptome sequencing reads

115

with this comparative functional annotation framework could yield additional insights into microbiome alterations also in other

116

diseases.

Sequence data and functional database

The recently published bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) metatranscriptomic sequencing data5 of 8 COVID-19 patients, 20

120

healthy controls (HC), and 25 cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were obtained from the National Genomics Data

121

Center (accession PRJCA002202).25 Pre-processing included TrimGalore26 adapter and quality trimming (–length 50 –trim-n

122

–max_n 10), and poly-A trimming performed with BBduk27 (trimpolya=10, minlength=50). The reads were filtered against

123

human (GCF_000001405.39), the PhiX sequencing control (GCF_000819615.1), and the SARS-CoV-2 virus (NC_045512.2)

124

with BBsplit27 (ambiguous=random, ambiguous2=split). The paired reads were processed separately, individual reads that

125

did not match the human, PhiX, or SARS-CoV-2 genomes (278k to 50.7M reads per sample) were retained for the microbial

126

community functional annotation (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for the filtering results).

127

The KEGG Enzyme Nomenclature (EC) reference hierarchy16 was used as the functional annotation tree. The EC numbers

128

define a four-level hierarchy. For example, 1.5.1.3. = "Dihydrofolate reductase" is a fourth (leaf) level code linked to top

129

level code 1 = “Oxidoreductases”, via 1.5. = “Acting on the CH-NH group of donors" and 1.5.1 = “With NAD+ or NADP+

130

as acceptor”. A PRROMenade14 database search index was constructed using the KEGG hierarchy and a total of 21.2M

131

bacterial and 53k viral annotated protein domain sequences (of minimum length 5 AA), obtained on June 6, 2020 from the IBM

132

Functional Genomics Platform15 (previously known as OMXWare). An earlier release of the bacterial domain data has been

133

discussed previously in conjunction with PRROMenade indexing.14

134

Functional annotation and analysis

135

Metatranscriptomic sequencing reads were annotated with PRROMenade by locating the maximal length exact match for each

136

read, and processed as described previously.14 Minimum match length cutoff of 11 AA (corresponding to 33 nt) was employed.

137

Classified (non-root) read counts (6.8k to 11.5M per sample, see Supplementary Fig. S1–S2) were post-processed to summarize

138

the counts at the leaf level of the functional hierarchy. Leaf nodes contributing ≥ 0.05% of total annotated reads in at least one

139

sample were retained, resulting in 633 leaf nodes to include as the features of the functional profiles. Multidimensional scaling

140

(Matlab function cmdscale, p = 2) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (f_permanova, iter = 100, 000, from the

141

Fathom toolbox28 for Matlab) were applied on pairwise Spearman’s distances (Fig. 1B).

142

Subsequently, the profiles were processed with RoDEO17 (P = 10, I = 100, R = 107 ) for robust comparability. The

143

per-sample parameter P0 was determined according to the number of annotated reads as previously described (in Supplementary

144

File 2 by Klaas et al.29 ). A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (kstest2 in Matlab) was applied to identify differentially

145

abundant features between COVID-19 samples and CAP, healthy control samples. Features were ordered by p-value and top

146

features selected for average linkage hierarchical clustering using the Euclidean distance (Fig. 2).

147

Pathway analysis

148

The KEGG16 metabolic pathway maps were utilized to link functions with pathways, and the pathways were analyzed for

149

changes between COVID-19 and CAP, HC. The pathways were evaluated for average abundance change as follows. Let ai

150

be the mean RoDEO abundance of EC feature i for COVID-19 samples, bi for CAP samples, and ci for HC samples. The

151

feature score is defined as f si = ((ai − bi ) + (ai − ci ))/2, positive values indicating higher abundance in COVID-19. Pathway

152

score ps j = mean{ f sEC j (1) , f sEC j (2) , ..., f sEC j (k) } was computed using the set of features, EC j , that map to the pathway j

153

(considering only pathways with k ≥ 2). The pathway score distribution was normalized to have mean zero for visualization.

154

Median absolute deviation (MAD)20 , a robust measure of dispersion, was used to identify outliers from the observed

155

pathway score distribution (isoutlier in Matlab with the parameter median). With the default parameters, an outlier is defined as

Figure 2. Clustering with top differentiating functional features. RoDEO processed EC abundance values (10 denotes
highest possible value), for 44 features differentiating COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia and healthy controls.
Columns and rows are ordered independently by hierarchical clustering of features and samples. The colors attached to the
dendrogram on top reflect the cohort labels: red = COVID-19, blue = CAP, green = healthy control.

Figure 3. Pathway changes in COVID-19 samples. For each pathway (row), there are as many entries as there are detected
EC features. The color of the entries indicate the average of COVID-19 vs. CAP and COVID-19 vs. HC changes. The entries
on each row are ordered from low to high values. The background value (dark blue) indicates no data; some pathways have
more detected features than others (only pathways with at least two EC features detected are considered). The rightmost
column indicates the pathway score, the pathways are ordered accordingly from top (higher in COVID-19) to bottom (lower in
COVID-19).

Figure 4. Pathway score distribution. The histogram of observed pathway scores is shown. The score thresholds for
determining outliers according to median absolute deviation (MAD) is also marked (red dashed lines, three scaled median
deviations away from the median).
