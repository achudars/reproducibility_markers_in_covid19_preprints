Abstract

19

Background: This is a comprehensive analysis of 46 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available from

20

the NCBI and GISAID repository during early 2020. Evolutionary dynamics, gene-specific phylogeny and

21

emergence of the novel co-evolving mutations in nine structural and non-structural genes among circulating

22

SARS-CoV-2 strains in ten states of India have been assessed.

23

Materials and methods: 46 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were downloaded from

24

the GISAID (39/46) or from NCBI (7/46) database. Phylogenetic study and analyses of mutation were based on

25

the nine structural and non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Secondary structure of RdRP/NSP12

26

protein was predicted with respect to the novel A97V mutation.

27

Results: Phylogenetic analyses revealed the evolution of “genome-type clusters” and adaptive selection of “L”

28

type SARS-CoV-2 strains with genetic closeness to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses than pangolin or MERS-

29

CoVs. With regards to the novel co-evolving mutations, 2 groups are seen to circulate in India at present: the

30

“major group” (52.2%) and the “minor group” (30.4%), harboring four and five co-existing mutations,

31

respectively. The “major group” mutations fall in the A2a clade. All the minor group mutations, except

32

11083G>T (L37F, NSP6) were unique to the Indian isolates.

33

Conclusion: The study highlights rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and co-circulation of multiple clades

34

and sub-clades, driving this pandemic worldwide. This comprehensive study is a potential resource for

35

monitoring the novel mutations in the viral genome, changes in viral pathogenesis, for designing vaccines and

36

other therapeutics.

1. Introduction

40

COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 initially reported from Wuhan, China in

41

December 2019, spread across the world within 3 months [1]. As of 23 rd May 2020, more than 5.3 million have

42

tested positive with death toll of approximately 340,411 deaths in more than 210 countries. Phylogenetic

43

analyses reveal that SARS-CoV-2 clusters within the subgenus Sarbecovirus under the genus Betacoronavirus,

44

and has probably undergone zoonotic transmission from the bats through the possible intermediate host

45

Malayan pangolins, culminating among humans [2]. The positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome of

46

SARS-CoV-2 is continuously mutating resulting in circulation of multiple clades within short span of time

47

(December’2019-May’2020). Thus dissecting the evolutionary characteristics, nature of variations in different

48

strains and understanding the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the SARS CoV-2 virus is the need of the

49

hour. Previous reports on genetic and evolutionary dynamics have tried to deduce transmission dynamics

50

through which virus made its way into human from bats during early phase of pandemic, but many questions

51

remain unanswered even though more sequence data is made available. Studying the heterogeneous genomic

52

constellations within specific geographical settings would help to understand its complex epidemiology and

53

formulate region specific strategies.

54

The first three cases from India were reported in Kerala during January 2020 having travel history to Wuhan

55

[3]; subsequently 69,597 active cases, 51,783 recovered cases and 3720 deaths have been officially recorded in

56

India as on 23rd May, 2020, 08:00 IST GMT+5:30 [4]. Inspite of high population density, poor hygiene

57

conditions and overburdened health care system, death rate due to SARS-COV-2 is lower in India compared to

58

USA or European countries [5]. Thus to understand the phylodynamics of circulating strains in India, this study

59

was initiated to analyze the complete viral genome sequences submitted in NCBI GenBank and Global

60

Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [6], from 46 SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating across 10

61

differentially affected states within India. In order to elucidate the possible ancestry, gene-wise phylogeny of

62

the Indian strains has been deciphered with respect to other isolates reported from Europe, USA and China

63

along with Coronavirus strains belonging to other genera infecting humans and other animal hosts. The novel

64

co-evolving mutations among the Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains have also been analyzed.

65

Through this genome-analyses and phylogenetic approach we would throw light on the natural evolution of

66

SARS-CoV-2 from its existing ancestors in zoonotic reservoirs. Furthermore, analyzing the novel mutations

67

accumulated in the viral genome over the period of time with reference to Wuhan strains (clade O) may shed

68

light on their impact on protein structure and function.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Sequence mining

71

46 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were downloaded either from the GISAID (39/46)

72

or from NCBI (7/46) database for phylogenetic analyses. Several other reference gene sequences of SARS-

73

CoV-2 as well as other types of Coronaviruses were downloaded from NCBI submitted from other countries,

74

for dendrogram construction and further lineage analyses. 7 sequences from Karnataka (India) were excluded

75

for RdRP/NSP12 gene analysis due to low nucleotide sequence coverage.

76

2.2. Phylogenetic analyses and screening of mutations

77

Nine phylogenetic dendrograms were constructed with respect to 2 structural genes (Spike and Nucleocapsid)

78

and 7 non-structural genes (NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP7, NSP8, and NSP12). Multiple sequence

79

alignment for all the respective set of gene sequences was done using MUSCLE v3.8.31. Amino acid sequences

80

were deduced through TRANSEQ (Transeq Nucleotide to Protein Sequence Conversion Tool, EMBL-EBI,

81

Cambridgeshire, UK). Phylogenetic dendrograms were constructed by MEGA, version X (Molecular

82

Evolutionary Genetics Analysis), using the maximum-likelihood statistical method (at 1000 bootstrap

83

replicates), using the best fit nucleotide substitution models for each dendrogram. The best fit models were

84

determined through model testing parameter of MEGAX. Various novel mutations analyzed among the Indian

3. Results
3.1. Phylogenetic Analysis of the Structural and Non-Structural Genes
3.1.1. Spike gene (S)

93

The phylogenetic dendrogram for S gene revealed that the 46 Indian study isolates clustered among themselves

94

within the same lineage of betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in eight different sub-clusters (a-h), while one strain

95

from Telangana (EPI ISL 431101) extruded out singly. Sub-cluster a (5 strains), b (6 strains), c (6 strains), d (5

96

strains), e (5 strains), f (7 strains), g (5 strains), were close to clade specific strains A5, B1, A3, A2, A1a and

97

A2a, respectively; while cluster h (6 strains) was close to A1, B2, B4-1 and B4-2 clade-specific strains

98

(Fig.1A). The sub-cluster b strains grouped with SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a Tiger in New York zoo; while h-

99

strains clustered with another carnivorous mammal Mink SARS-CoV-2. All the representative Indian strains

100

had 99-100% nucleotide sequence homology among themselves. The prototype SARS-CoV-2 strain belonging

101

to the O clade (MN908947.3/SARS-COV-2/HUMAN/CHN/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019) was present in the same

102

lineage with the Indian strains in between sub-cluster g and h (>99% identity). The Indian strains had 92.8-93%

103

and 83.5% homology with Bat (EPI_ISL_402131/COV/BAT/YUNNAN/RATG13/2013) and Pangolin

104

coronavirus (EPI_ISL_410540/COV/PANGOLIN/GUANGXI/ P5L/2017), respectively. Homology was much

strainsfrom Telangana (EPI ISL 431101), Karnataka (MT396245.1) and Delhi (EPI ISL 435111) extruded out

114

separately, close to sub-cluster b strains. Sub-cluster a (5 strains) were exclusively from Delhi. All the clade-

specific strains (A1, A1a, A2, A2a, A3, A5, B2, B1,B4-1 and B4-2) as well as the prototype SARS-CoV-2

116

strains); while the major sub-cluster b (29 strains) were distant to any of the clade-specific strains (Fig.1B). All

118

the representative Indian strains had >99.8% nucleotide identity among themselves as well as with the different

119

clade-specific strains. The Indian strains had 91-97% sequence identity with Bat coronaviruses

132

strains) were close to clade-specific strains A2a and A2, respectively (Fig.1C). All the Indian strains had

133

>99.8% nucleotide identity among themselves as well as the different clade-specific strains. The prototype

134

SARS-CoV-2 strain-O clade (MN908947.3/SARS-COV-2/HUMAN/CHN/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019) was distant to

158

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions 8,782 (NSP4 gene) and 28,144 (ORF 8) showed

159

complete linkage among the Indian isolates under study. At these two sites, 44 strains showed a “CT” haplotype

160

(designated as “L” type as T28,144 falls inLeucine codon); while only 2 strains (one from Kerala,

161

EPI_ISL_413523 and other from Delhi, EPI_ISL_435111) revealed a “TC” haplotype (called as “S” type as

162

164

3.3. Analyses of Synonymous and Non-Synonymous Mutations
3.3.1. The common mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates

165

In order to explore the mutationsamong the 46 SARS-CoV-2 strains, we performed intricate sequence analyses

166

both at the genome level and corresponding amino acid level in different proteins, especially Spike glycoprotein

167

(S), Nucleocapsid protein (N), Non-structural protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP7, NSP8 and RNA-

168

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP/NSP12) with reference to the prototype SARS-CoV-2 strain

169

(MN908947.3/SARS-COV-2/HUMAN/CHN/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019). 4 out of 46 samples (8.69%) lacked any

170

significant mutations: one collected from a patient with unknown travel history (EPI_ISL_435111), one with

171

travel history to Dubai (EPI_ISL_431101) and two patients with travel history to China (EPI_ISL_413522 and

172

EPI_ISL_413523). Mutational analysis of remaining 42 strains revealed circulation of two predominant

173

“groups”, namely the “major group” and the “minor group”, in India. The “major group” which comprised of 24

174

isolates (24/46, 52.17%), revealed four co-existing SNPs; 241C>T in the 5-UTR (Table 5), 3037C>T (F106F)

175

in the NSP3 gene (Table 5), 14408C>T (P323L) in NSP12 gene (Table 3, Mutation 2) and 23403A>G (D614G)

176

in the S gene (Table 1, Mutation 2). This “major group” of SARS-CoV-2 was predominantly found to circulate

177

in Delhi, West Bengal, Telangana and Gujarat. Rest 18 samples (18/46, 39.13%) were seen to have three co-

178

existing mutations; 23929C>T (Y789Y) in the S gene (Table 5), 28311C>T (P13L) in the N gene (Table 2,

179

Mutation 1) and 6312C>A (T1198K) in the NSP3 gene (Table 4, Mutation 2). Out of these 18 isolates, 14

180

samples (14/46, 30.43%) that represent the “minor group”had two additional co-existing mutations; 11083G>T

181

(L37F) in the NSP6 gene (Table 3, Mutation 1, marked with *) and 13730C>T (A97V) in the NSP12/RdRP

182

gene (Table 3, Mutation 1, marked with ¶). Needless to say, the five co-existing mutations of the “minor group”

183

and the four co-existing mutations of the “major group” were not overlapping among the same SARS-CoV-2

184

isolate. The “minor group” of SARS-CoV-2 predominated in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and

185

Maharashtra.

186

3.3.2. The unique mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates

187

In addition to 23403A>G (D614G), three uncommon mutations 23374A>G (Q271R) (Table 1, Mutation 1),

188

24933G>T (G1124V) (Table 1, Mutation 3) and 22444C>T (D294D) (Table 5) were also observed in the S

189

gene of “major group”. 16 out of the 24 isolates revealed three novel mutations 28854C>T (S194L) (5 samples),

190

28881-28883GGG>AAC (R203K and G204R) (9 samples) and 29451C>T (T393I) (2 samples) in the N gene

191

(Table 2, Mutation 2, 3 and 4 respectively), whereas two isolates of the “minor group”had 28396G>A (R41R)

192

change in the N gene (Table 5). Intriguingly, 28854C>T (S194L) in N gene was found to co-evolve with

193

22444C>T (D294D) mutation inthe S gene. We also observed 1059T>A (T85I) change within the NSP2 (Table

194

4) and, 6310C>A (S1197R), 7392C>T (P1558L) (Table 4) and 6466A>G (K1249K) (Table 5)change in the

195

NSP3 gene. No mutations were found within the NSP7 and NSP8 genes.

196

3.3.3. Effect of missense mutation A97V on the secondary structure of NSP12/RdRP

197

Being the crucial enzyme for viral RNA replication and maintaining the genomic fidelity, any significant

198

change in RdRP structure could affect its functions, thereby increasing the rate of mutagenesis in the genome.

199

We have identified two missense mutations in the RdRP protein; P323L associated with the “major group”

200

isolates and A97V associated with the “minor group” isolates. The effect of P323L on the secondary structure

201

of RdRP has already been described [8]. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of novel mutation A97V on the

202

secondary structure of RdRP by using CFSSP server. A97V mutation resulted in substitution of α-helixes at

203

positions 94, 95 and 96 with the β-sheets in the RdRP secondary structure which might alter its tertiary

204

conformation, resulting in significant functional implications (Fig.2).

Molecular and genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic strains worldwide has been studied by several

207

scientific groups based on whole-genome sequencing [9,10]. Through this comprehensive analysis we aimed to

208

closely analyze the ancestry, evolutionary dynamics, accumulation of rapid mutations and cross-genetic translation

209

among the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains across India. As depicted through the different phylogenetic

210

dendrograms in our study, a monophyletic clade of all SARS-CoV-2 strains was seen with the prototype strain

211

(Wuhan IME-WH01/2019) clustering along with the Indian isolates. Rapid accumulation of several point

212

mutations across the genome of SARS-CoV-2 since its origin is a prime driving force behind the evolution of

213

different monophyletic clades. Clustering of all the India isolates with other SARS-CoV-2 strains reported

214

worldwide (99.8-100% nucleotide sequence identity) suggests forward introduction of this virus in India from

215

several countries. Clustering of the prototype strain from Wuhan underscores the fact that China might have served

216

as the origin of this zoonotic virus, which has been eventually transmitted to worldwide [11-13].

217

The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 is still a debatable issue but identification of its intermediate host is much needed

218

to prevent further dissemination and interspecies transmission in near future. Hence, we initiated this study as one

219

of the first in India to decipher the gene-wise phylogenetics of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in this endemic

220

setting. The results depicted genome type clusters of the 46 Indian isolates, for the structural genes S and N and the

221

non-structural gene RdRP/NSP12. Clustering of the study isolates with different clade-specific strains for different

222

gene establishes the development of genome type clustering. Though variations in DNA homology exists with

223

respect to each gene, nevertheless a very recent bifurcation of these Indian strains from the bat and Malayan-

224

pangolin derived SARS-like coronaviruses is supposed to have occurred, with a subsequent zoonotic transmission

225

to humans, as depicted through all the nine dendrograms. However, SARS-CoV-2 strains were distant to MERS-

226

CoV and other human coronaviruses. This conclusion goes at par with other phylogenetic studies establishing bat

227

and pangolins as the proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 [14-16].

228

Our study highlighted low sequence similarity of spike gene with some bat derived strains like bat-SL-CoVZC45

229

and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, while maximum homology was noticed with bat SARS-like Coronavirus (SARSr-

230

CoV/RaTG13). In contrast to a study by Zhang et.al, the pangolin-derived coronavirus revealed very low sequence

231

homology to all the Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains than the bat RaTG13 [2]. The RNA Binding Domain (RBD)

232

within the S1 subunit of Spike gene of all Indian SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-derived strains were found to be

233

evolutionarily conserved and phylogenetically much closer than bat RaTG13, underscoring familiar mode of

234

pathogenesis between the two. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates too possess a polybasic cleavage site (RRAR;

235

amino acid position 682-685) at the junction of S1 and S2 subunits of Spike protein as reported by Andersen et.al.,

236

2020 [14]. SARS-CoV2 strains have been categorized into two major groups/types characterized by two SNPs at

237

positions 8782 (NSP4 gene) and 28,144 (ORF8) that reveal complete linkage [17]. Among our Indian study

238

isolates, frequency of the L-type (CT haplotype) was much higher (44/46, 95.7%) to the S-type (TC haplotype)

239

(2/46, 4.3%), indicating the L-type to predominate over S-type in this geographical region.

240

Convoluted mutational analysis also revealed co-circulation of two groups of mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains in

241

India. The “major group” of SARS-CoV-2 strains (52.2%) represents a modified A2a clade reported previously

242

from Africa, South America, Oceania and South and West Asia comprising of strains with co-evolving

243

mutations like 241 C>T (5’ UTR), 3037 C>T (F106F, NSP3), 14403 C>T (P323L, RdRP/ NSP12) and 23403

244

A>G (D614G, S glycoprotein) [18-20]. Certain strains in the “major group” displayed 22374A>G (Q271R),

245

24933G>T (G1124V) and 22444C>T (D294D) changes in the S gene which are unique to India. Missense

246

mutations Q271R and G1124V in S protein reside around the N-linked glycosylation sites 282 and 1134

247

respectively and these might affect the protein function [21]. It was not surprising to observe the triple site

248

mutation 28881-28883 GGG>AAC (R203K and G204R) in the N gene of 9 SARS-CoV-2 strains of the “major

249

group”. This has previously been reported from Mexico, South America, Australia, New Zealand and few Asian

250

countries as well [22]. The 203/204 region is part of the SR dipeptide domain of N protein

251

(SRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTSPARMA) and changes in Arg203 to Lys203 and Gly204 to Arg204 resulted in the

252

insertion of a lysine residue between serine and arginine (SRNSSRNSTPGSSKRTSPARMA) which might

253

interfere with the phosphorylation at serine residue required for normal functioning of the N protein [23]. This

254

mutation demands particular attention as reduced pathogenicity has been observed in SARS-CoV on deletion of

255

the SR domain [24]. Mutations observed in the NSP3 gene at positions 6310 C>A (S1197R), 7392 C>T

256

(P1558L) and 6466 A>G (K1249K) were completely unique to Indian strains. Few infrequent mutations at

257

position 1059 T>A (T85I) in NSP2 and 8782 C>T (S76S) in NSP4 have also been reported to be prevalent in

258

other countries [19, 22, 25].

259

The “minor group” of Indian SARS-CoV-2 (30.4%), comprised of strains with five co-evolving mutations:

260

13730C>T (A97V, RdRP/NSP12), 23929C>T (Y789Y, S), 28311C>T (P13L, N), 6312C>A (T1198K, NSP3)

261

and 11083G>T (L37F, NSP6). All the “minor group” mutations were novel among the Indian isolates, except

262

11083G>T (L37F, NSP6) which was previously reported as infrequent mutation from Australia, Japan,

263

Netherlands and some other European countries [18,26]. The L37F mutation strongly implies positive selection

264

towards evolution of betacoronaviruses, indicating a possible origin of the “minor group” out of this positive

265

selection and subsequent acquisition of mutations among the strains already harboring the 11083G>T change

266

[25,26]. The interaction of NSP6 with NSP3 and NSP4 has been described to be essential for the formation of

267

double membrane vesicles [25,26]. Hence, it is very interesting to note the presence of a co-existing mutation

268

6312 C>A (T1198K) in NSP3 of the “minor group” strains, though the significance of this co-existence (L37F

269

and T1198K) in context toNSP6-NSP3 interaction can only be confirmed through association studies. The

270

fidelity of RdRP is challenged due to the presence of 13730 C>T (A97V) change, which was predicted to have

271

significant effect on the secondary structure of RdRP. A97V was found to be located in the nidovirus RdRP-

272

associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain whose function remains unknown [27]. The P13L mutation

273

is located in the intrinsically disordered region of the N protein and might affect RND-binding activity of N-

274

terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of the N protein [28, 29].

275

Any significant mutation in the RdRP/NSP12 protein might alter replication machinery, thereby compromising

276

the fidelity of viral RNA replication and subsequent accumulation of plausiblenovel mutations. The missense

277

mutation 14408C>T (P323L) in RdRP was first observed in Italy (Lombardy) in February, 2020. The study by

278

Pachetti et al. has shown emergence of 3037C>T (F106F, NSP3 protein), 23403A>G (D614G) and 28881-

279

28883GGG>AAC (R203K and G204R, N protein) in SARS-CoV-2 having 14408C>T (P323L) in RdRP gene

280

February, 2020 in Europe and North America, suggesting a probable association of 14408C>T (P323L) and the

281

emergence of other new mutations [30]. Therefore, we can assume that two the mutations: 14408C>T (P323L)

282

and 13730C>T (A97V), which were found to have significant influence on the secondary structure of RdRP,

283

could play key roles in the simultaneous establishment of “two groups” of SARS-CoV-2 with characteristic

284

“co-evolving mutations” in India. However, this needs to be validated experimentally. Owing to lack of patient

285

metadata, we could not determine whether these two distinct groups of strains varied in their virulence and

286

pathogenicity.

287

This study adds up few initial observations on the available Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences like ancestry,

288

evolutionary dynamics, clade specific genetic variations as well as development of unique co-evolving

289

mutations and their possible effect on protein secondary structure. The ongoing deadly pandemic demands an

290

urgent need to record complete patient metadata along with full genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 strain in

291

varied epidemiological settings for better understanding of pathogenesis of disease and its correlation with

292

accumulated mutation in viral genome.
