Abstract
Knowledge of the origin and reservoir of the coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic is still fragmentary. To date, the closest relatives to SARS-CoV-2 have been detected
in Rhinolophus bats sampled in the Yunnan province, China. Here we describe the identification
of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses in two Rhinolophus shameli bats sampled in Cambodia in
2010. Metagenomic sequencing identified nearly identical viruses sharing 92.6% nucleotide
identity with SARS-CoV-2. Most genomic regions are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, with the

exception of a small region corresponding to the spike N terminal domain. The discovery of these
viruses in a bat species not found in China indicates that SARS-CoV-2 related viruses have a
much wider geographic distribution than previously understood, and suggests that Southeast Asia
represents a key area to consider in the ongoing search for the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and in
future surveillance for coronaviruses.

Main Text
Over a year has passed since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2)1, responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
However, information on the origin, reservoir, diversity, and extent of circulation of ancestors to
SARS-CoV-2 remains scarce. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are believed to be the main
natural reservoir of SARS-related coronaviruses also named Sarbecoviruses2. Indeed, a high
diversity of coronavirus species have been found in Rhinolophus bats collected in several
provinces of China3. To date, the closest relatives to SARS-CoV-2 were identified from bats
sampled in the Yunnan province, southern China1,4. RaTG13 was isolated from a Rhinolophus
affinis horseshoe bat in 2013, and RmYN02 from a Rhinolophus malayanus bats in 2019. Two
viruses were also detected in Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in two provinces of
southern China5. More distant and highly mosaic recombinant viruses were also sampled from
bats in the Zhejiang province, in eastern China in 2015 and 2017.
Southeast Asia is considered a hotspot for emerging diseases6, and more than 25% of the worlds
bat diversity is found in there7. Following the emergence of COVID-19, to search for putative
SARS-CoV-2-like betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs), 430 archived samples from 6 bat families and
2 carnivorous mammal families, including 162 oral swabs and 268 rectal swabs, were
retrospectively tested with a pan-coronavirus (pan-CoV) hemi-nested RT-PCR8 (Supplementary
table 1). Sixteen out of 430 (3.72%) samples tested positive for CoV by pan-CoV hemi-nested
PCR. Eleven were classified as alphacoronaviruses and 5 as betaCoV. Two of the 5 betaCoV
samples further tested positive using a RT-qPCR targeting the RdRp gene of sarbecoviruses9.
Both samples came from Shamel’s horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus shameli) sampled in December
2010 in the Steung Treng province in northeastern Cambodia.
RNA samples were then processed for next-generation metagenomic sequencing, using a
ribosomal RNA depletion approach and randomly primed cDNA synthesis10. Read assembly
reconstructed two nearly identical near full-length coronavirus genomes, named BetaCoV/
Cambodia/RShSTT182/2010
(RshSTT182)
and
BetaCoV/Cambodia/RShSTT200/2010
(RshSTT200), respectively. The two sequences are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, exhibiting
92.6% nucleotide identity across the genome (Supplementary table 2) and identical genomic
organization. Phylogenetic analysis using full genome sequences shows that RshSTT182 and
RshSTT200 represent a new sublineage of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, despite the geographic
distance of isolation (Figure 1). Genetic similarity with SARS-CoV-2 is maintained across the
genome, with the exception of a portion corresponding to the spike N terminal domain (NTD;
Figure 2 and suppl 2). In several sections of the genome, including the region spanning nsp4 to
nsp8 within orf1a, and orf8, RshSTT182 and RshSTT200 are genetically closer to SARS-CoV-2
than the any other closely related viruses discovered to date. Similarity is further evidenced when
inferring phylogeny based on the sequence coding for these proteins.
Extensive evidence exists on numerous recombination events in the evolutionary history of the
sarbecoviruses11-13. Consistent with this, we found that both RshSTT182 and RshSTT200 are
also mosaic viruses (Figure 2 and supplementary figure 2); however, most regions identified as
recombinant in origin appear to have involved close relatives within the SARS-CoV-2 sublineage.

Only a region encompassing the Spike N terminal domain (NTD) is closer to more distantly related
betaCoVs. In all other regions of the genome, the viruses detected in Cambodia consistently
branch as a sister clade to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, with minor swaps in the subtree topology.
Interestingly, both regions showing high similarity to SARS-CoV02 (nsp4 to 8 within orf1a and
orf8) overlap with regions identified as recombinant. All these elements suggest a co-circulation
of ancestors to these viral sublineages with both a wider geographic area and more distinct bat
species than those previously identified. Of note, the current geographic distribution of R. shameli
bats does not include China (Supplementary Figure 4)14. However, the distribution of R. affinis
and R. malayanus overlap with R. shameli distribution area in Southeast Asia, and extend into
China, including the Yunnan province where the other two viruses closely related to SARS-CoV2 were sampled. In addition, the haplotype network of R. shameli CO1 sequences shows a typical
star-like pattern, suggesting that populations of R. shameli found between northern Cambodia
and northern Laos are not genetically isolated. Some bat species are believed to be migratory,
and distinct species of bats often share habitats, and even co-roost, if only transiently. Finally, R.
affinis and R. malayanus bats were concomitantly captured in the same northeastern karst region
where these R. shameli bats were sampled.
Further risk assessment is needed to understand the host range (including Humans) and
pathogenesis associated with this novel sublineage. Homology modeling suggests that the
external subdomain of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) structure is highly similar to
SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). We note the shortening of a loop at the beginning of the receptor binding
motif and the presence of a conserved disulfide bond. Importantly, five of the six amino acid
residues reported to be major determinants of efficient receptor binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the
human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 15 are conserved. Finally, the poly-basic
(furin) site present in SARS-CoV-2 is absent in both RshSTT182 and RshSTT200.
The data presented here indicates that SARS-CoV-2 related viruses have a much wider
geographic distribution than previously understood, and likely circulate via multiple Rhinolophus
species. Our current understanding of the geographic distribution of the SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 lineages11 possibly reflects a lack of sampling in Southeast Asia, or at least along the
Greater Mekong Subregion, which encompasses Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and
Vietnam, as well as the Yunnan and Guanxi provinces of China, linking the sampling area of the
closest viruses to SARS-CoV-2 identified to date. Finally, pangolins, as well as members of order
Carnivora, especially the Viverridae5, Mustelidae6, and Felidae7 families are readily susceptible
to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and might represent intermediary hosts for transmission to humans.
Viruses of the SARS-CoV-2 sublineage, with one exhibiting strong sequence similarity to SARSCoV-2 in the RBD, were recently detected in distinct groups of pangolins seized during antismuggling operations in southeast China5. While it is not possible to know where these animals
became infected, it is important to note that the natural geographic range of the pangolin species
involved (Manis javanica) also corresponds to Southeast Asia and not China.
Southeast Asia, which hosts a high diversity of wildlife and where exists extensive trade in and
human contact with wild hosts of SARS-like coronaviruses, may represent a key area to consider
in the ongoing search for the origins of SARS-CoV-216, and certainly in broader coronavirus
surveillance efforts. The region is undergoing dramatic land-use changes such as infrastructure

between bats and humans. Continued surveillance of bats and other key wild animals in
Southeast Asia is thus crucial, not only to find the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, but to also be better
prepared for the next pandemic.

Methods
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the General Directorate of Animal Health and Production and Forest
Administration department of the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries in Cambodia.
Sampling was conducted under a University of California, Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee approved protocol (UC Davis IACUC Protocol No. 19300). The bat capture and
sampling in 2010 was authorized by UNESCO and the National Authority of Preah Vihear.
Sampling
Testing was performed on archived samples from several programs and field missions
(Supplementary Table 1). In 2010, the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (MNHN, Paris,
France) was mandated by UNESCO and the National Authority of Preah Vihear to conduct a
mammal survey in northern Cambodia. During this mission, bats were captured using mist nets
and harp traps in two provinces, Preah Vihear and Ratanakiri, to compare bat diversity on the two
sides of the Mekong River. A site of bat capture located at the border between Preah Vihear and
Stung Treng provinces was later identified as from a cave in the Stung Treng province using GPS
data. Bats were morphologically identified at the species level by AH and VTT.
More recent sampling efforts were supported by the USAID-funded PREDICT projects which
aimed to strengthen global capacity for detection and discovery of viruses with pandemic potential
that can move between animals and people. In missions in 2012 to 2018, samples from bats and
carnivorans were collected from free-ranging animals, private animal collection, restaurant, or
hunted animals in Battambang, Kampong Cham, Mondulkiri, Preah Vihear, Pursat, Ratanakiri
and Stung Treng. Mist nets were used to catch bats. Oral and rectal swabs were collected from
live animals which were released after sampling.
The samples from the two sampling missions were stored in viral transport medium solution (VTM;
containing tryptose phosphate Broth 2.95%, 145 mM of NaCl, 5% gelatin, 54 mM Amphotericin
B, 106 U of penicillin-streptomycin per liter, 80 mg of gentamycin per liter [Sigma-Aldrich, Irvine,
UK]) and were held in liquid nitrogen in dewars for transport to the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge
where they were stored at −80 °C prior to testing.
The samples were selected and tested for SAS-CoV-2 related virus in the current work as a result
of an effort to look at previously-collected samples that had not been initially prioritized for testing
or not been tested with RT-PCR assays capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 related viruses due
to resource constraints.
The two bats positive for viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and collected during the MNHN
mission were morphologically identified as Rhinolophus shameli and their taxonomic status were
further confirmed by analyzing the sequences of the cytb gene and the subunit 1 of the
cytochrome c oxidase gene (CO1) (Supplementary figure 5).
RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR
RNA from rectal swabs was extracted using QIAamp® Viral RNA kits. The samples were tested
with a pan-coronavirus (pan-CoV) hemi-nested RT-PCR8 and by a RT-qPCR known to detect

sarbecoviruses9, including SARS-CoV-2. A large fraction of these samples has been previously
tested with another pan-CoV RT-PCR17, which does not detect SARS-CoV-2 like viruses. Both
oral swab from the same shameli bats described here tested negative for the presence of betaCoV
RNA, despite the high proportion of reads matching the coronavirus (23%) in the rectal swab of
RshSTT200. Initial viral isolation attempts were unsuccessful but further isolation is being
attempted in several bat cell lines.
Next generation sequencing
Extracted RNA was treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion) followed by purification using SPRI beads
(Agencourt RNA clean XP, Beckman Coulter). We used a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion
approach based on RNAse H and targeting human rRNA10. The RNA from the selective depletion
was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript IV (Invitrogen) and random primers, followed by
second-strand synthesis. Libraries were prepared using a Nextera XT kit (Illumina) and
sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 (2x75 cycles).
Genome assembly
Raw reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.39 18 to remove adaptors and low-quality reads.
We assembled reads using the metaspades option of SPAdes/3.14.0 19 and megahit v1.2.920 with
default parameters. Scaffolds were queried against the NCBI non-redundant protein database 21
using DIAMOND v2.0.4 22. Among other putative viruses (hits summarized in Supplementary
Table 2), the Sarbecovirus genomes identified were verified and corrected by iterative mapping
using CLC Assembly Cell v5.1.0 (QIAGEN). Aligned reads were manually inspected using
Geneious prime v2020.1.2 (2020) (https://www.geneious.com/), and consensus sequences were
generated using a minimum of 3X read-depth coverage to make a base call. The genomes are
nearly identical, presenting 3 nucleotides difference between them: g12196a; c20040t; and
t24572c). We used Ivar23 to estimate the frequency of minor variants (iSNV) from the coronavirus
reads. Coverage depth and iSNVs are reported in Supplementary Figure 1.
Dataset
Complete genome sequence data and metadata of representative SARS-like viruses were
retrieved from GenBank, ViPR24 and GISAID. Sequences were aligned by MAFTT v.7.467 25, and
the alignment checked for accuracy using MEGA v7 26. Accession numbers of all 37 sequences
are available in Supplementary Table 4. Separate alignments were generated for the main ORFs.
The nucleotide similarities shown in SimPlot27 analysis were generated by using a Kimura 2
parameter distance model with a 500-nt sliding window moved along the sequence in 50-nt
increments.
Recombination analysis
We used a combination of 6 methods implemented in RDP528 (RDP, GENECONV, MaxChi,
Bootscan, SisScan and 3SEQ) to detect potential recombination events, and conservatively
considered recombination signal detected by at least 5 methods. The beginning and end of
breakpoints identified with RDP5 were used to split the genome into regions for further
phylogenetic analysis.

Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies were inferred using IQ-TREE v2.0.6 29 and branch support
was calculated using ultrafast bootstrap approximation with 1,000 replicates 30. Prior to the tree
reconstruction, the ModelFinder application 31, as implemented in IQ-TREE, was used to select
the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model.
Bayesian phylogenies were inferred using MrBayes v3.2.732, using the GTR substitution model.
Ten million steps were run and parameters were sampled every 1000 steps.
Structure modelling
The three-dimensional structure of the RBD of RshSTT200 was modeled using the SWISSMODEL program33, using SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6yla.1) structure as it was the best hit for the
RshSTT200 amino acid sequence input.
Data availability
Sequence data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in the European
Nucleotide Archive (Samples ERS5578105 and ERS5578106). The consensus sequences of
RshSTT182 and RshSTT200 are also available at the GISAID34 with accession numbers:
EPI_ISL_852604 and EPI_ISL_852605.
