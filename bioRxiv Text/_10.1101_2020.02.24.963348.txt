Abstract
The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes an epidemic of
acute respiratory syndrome in humans. 2019-nCoV rapidly spread to national regions
and multiple other countries, thus, pose a serious threat to public health. Recent
studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same
host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into
host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2
binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more
readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be
significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can
positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread,
thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging
infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.

Introduction
The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei,
China. According to the World Health Organization on February 24th 16, about
77,269 viral infected patients and at least 2596 deaths were confirmed globally.
2019-nCoV genome shows high similarity some bat coronaviruses as well as severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which has caused two large-scale pandemics in
the last two decades (Zhou et al., 2020). They all belong to betacoronavirus genus,
which is a type of positive-stranded RNA viruses (Wu et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020).
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV can spread from the human to human
and cause fever, severe respiratory illness, and a series of unidentified pneumonia
disease (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).
Comparing with SARS-CoV and MERS, 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily
transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple countries and regions and
leading to the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b).

Coronaviruses utility the spike (S) proteins to select and enter target cells.
SARS-CoV S protein and 2019-nCoV S protein engages angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their entry receptor (Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2020; Wrapp et
al., 2020). ACE2 is the cellular entry receptor of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, which
plays an indispensable role for SARS-CoV infection (Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al.,

2020). ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed in the lung, heart, kidney, and
intestine (Zhang et al., 2020). Enhanced expression of ACE2 accelerates SARS-CoV
infection and spread, while silencing of ACE2 blocks its entry into cells (Li et al.,
2003). Organs and tissues with high ACE2 abundance like the lung, kidney and small
intestine are the infection targets of 2019-nCoV (Zhang et al., 2020). Taken together,
these findings reveal that the expression level of ACE2 is extremely important for the
successful infection of SARS-nCoV and 2019-nCoV. Here we analyzed the various
microarray database of virus infected- or inflammatory stimulated-animals and cells,
and clearly show that virus infection including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can
obviously upregulate ACE2 expression, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may use
similar strategies to augment its infection and spread.

Virus Infection
VSV-GFP infection was described in our previous publications (Wang et al.,
2018). Briefly, target cells were washed twice with 37°C DMEM medium, then virus
that diluted in serum-free medium were added to the cells. Virus-medium complexes
were incubated with cells in normal culture condition. 1-2 hrs later, virus-medium
complexes were discarded and replaced with culture medium containing 10% FBS.

Statistical Analysis
Three independent experiments are performed in all studies. Two-tailed unpaired
Student's t test by GraphPad Prism 7.0 was used to perform statistical analysis. P <
0.05 was considered as statistically significant in all experiments.

Results

Transfection of Poly (I:C) Induces ACE2 Expression
poly (I:C) is mimics of virus RNA. When delivered into HEK293 cell, human
ACE2 mRNA expression level is significantly enhanced by RT-qPCR study (Figure 1).
poly (I:C) mimics virus RNA and activate immune signaling pathways which lead to
interferons (IFN) and inflammatory cytokine production, so next we explored whether
RNA virus infection can induce ACE2 expression. As an RNA virus, VSV-eGFP can
slightly induce ACE2 mRNA upregulation in HEK293 cells (Figure 2).

Activation of RNA-sensing Pathway Induces ACE2 production
Because both poly (I:C) and RNA virus induce ACE2 expression, so next we
evaluate whether RNA-sensing pathway have effect on ACE expression.
Overexpression of TBK1, downstream of both TLR3 and RIG-I-like receptor
signaling pathway, can strongly upregulate ACE2 mRNA level (Figure 3). TRIF, an
adaptor protein of TLR3 pathway, also induce the expression of ACE2 in HEK293
cells (Figure 3).

Virus Infection Induces ACE2 Upregulation
We retried microarray database submitted in NCBI and analysis ACE2 expression
levels during virus infection. In lungs from C57Bl/6 mouse infected with 102 PFU
SARS-CoV, ACE2 mRNA is significantly increased comparing with the mock group

(Figure 4) (Gralinski et al., 2018; Totura et al., 2015). In primary human airway
epithelial cells, MERS-CoV infection can obviously increase ACE mRNA levels at 24,
36 and 48 hours post infection (Figure 5). These results clearly reveal that ACE can be
upregulated by infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Next, we evaluated ACE
expression after other RNA virus infection. Data from microarray shows that the
ACE2 mRNA level can also be strongly induced in human airway epithelial cells
from 4 donors responses to rhinovirus (Figure 5) (Proud et al., 2012). In wild-type
H1N1 influenza-infected human bronchial epithelial cells, ACE2 can dramatically
increase to about 5-folds higher than the control group (Figure 7) (Shapira et al.,
2009). These pieces of evidence indicate that ACE2 is a virus infection responsive
gene and its expression can be stimulated by various viruses. Overall, ACE2
expression can be upregulated by virus infection.

Inflammatory Cytokines Stimulate ACE2 Expression
We suppose that ACE2 induction by viruses is caused by virus infection-induced
inflammatory cytokines. From the microarray database, we observed that ACE2
expression can also be stimulated by type I IFNs including IFNα and IFNβ and type
III IFN such as IFNγ. In human bronchial epithelial cells stimulated by IFNβ
(1000U/ml), ACE2 is significantly upregulated at 6, 8, 12, and 18 hours post
treatment, especially at 18 hours (Figure 7), ACE2 is increased more than 4-folds
comparing with the mock group (Shapira et al., 2009). We also found that ACE2 can
be significantly induced by IFNγ treatment in human primary keratinocytes (Figure 8)

Discussion
2019-nCoV infection causes a direful transmit speed and a much unidentified
pathological phenomenon. 2019-nCoV utilizes cell membrane receptor for entering
into cells and causes infection diseases. Although it is believed that lung is the target
organ of 2019-nCoV, lots of non-respiratory symptoms have subsequently been
reported, suggesting the involvements of other organs during the disease (Wei et al.
2020). These organs and tissues commonly have high ACE2 expression level such as
kidney and small intestine. SARS-nCoV infects multiple cell types in several organs;
immune cells and pulmonary epithelium are also the main sites of injury (Gu et al.,
2005). Acute kidney injury is a predictor of high mortality in SARS patients (Chu et
al., 2005). In the lung, human ACE2 is primarily existed in type II and type I alveolar
epithelial cells. ACE2 is mainly expressed in AT2 cells and also detected in AT1 cells,
airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages (Wei et al.
2020).

As the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and 2019-CoV, ACE2 plays an essential
role during these virus infections (Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2020). The ACE2 level
is the decisive factor for 2019-nCoV infection (Zhou et al., 2020). These observations
drive us to explore whether ACE2 is a virus infection responsive gene. Here we
analyzed the database of virus infected- or inflammatory cytokine-stimulated cells or
tissues and clearly show that ACE2 can be upregulated by virus infection and
inflammatory cytokine-stimulation. However, whether the upregulation by ACE2 by

the virus is achieved by virus infection-induced inflammatory cytokinesis is currently
unknown. We already notice that the promoter region of ACE2 exists several immuneand cytokine-responsive transcript factor binding sites such as JUN. Next, we will
evaluate whether ACE2 is upregulated by JNK signaling cascades. Importantly, the
inducibility of ACE2 by inflammatory cytokines also implies that “cytokine storm”
caused by 2019-nCoV not only damage host tissues but also may accelerate virus
spread (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020).

Overall, this study provides the first evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and
maybe 2019-nCoV can upregulate its cellular receptor ACE2 to facilitate their
infection and spread. Thus, reducing ACE2 expression by siRNA or other drugs may
be a direction for drug development. Because this cluster of viruses uses the same
cellular receptor ACE for entering, thus preparation drugs which can reduce ACE2
expression may be useful for the future emerging infectious diseases. Our study also
suggests that people infected by other viruses such as influenza or with high
inflammatory cytokines may more susceptible to 2019-nCoV. This study also
indicated that targeting the expression of ACE2 is a direction for drug development
and infection control.
