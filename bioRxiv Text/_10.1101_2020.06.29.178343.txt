SUMMARY
SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense, 30-kilobase
RNA genome responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there are no
antiviral drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy, and development of these treatments are
hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the virus.
Like many other RNA viruses, RNA structures in coronaviruses regulate gene expression
and are crucial for viral replication. Although genome and transcriptome data were
recently reported, there is to date little experimental data on predicted RNA structures in
SARS-CoV-2 and most putative regulatory sequences are uncharacterized. Here we
report the secondary structure of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells at
single nucleotide resolution using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing
(DMS-MaPseq). Our results reveal previously undescribed structures within critical
regulatory elements such as the genomic transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs).
Contrary to previous studies, our in-cell data show that the structure of the frameshift
element, which is a major drug target, is drastically different from prevailing in vitro models.
The genomic structure detailed here lays the groundwork for coronavirus RNA biology
and will guide the design of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-based therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent
of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), recently declared a global pandemic
by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus belonging
to the genus betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for
the 2003 SARS outbreak, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), the virus responsible for the 2012 MERS outbreak. Despite the devastating effects
these viruses have had on public health and the economy, currently no effective antivirals
treatment or vaccines exist. There is therefore an urgent need to understand their unique
RNA biology and develop new therapeutics against this class of viruses.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) have single-stranded and positive-sense genomes that are the
largest of all known RNA viruses (27 – 32 kb) (Masters, 2006). Previous studies on
coronavirus structures have focused on several conserved regions that are important for
viral replication. For several of these regions, such as the 5’ UTR, the 3’ UTR, and the
frameshift element (FSE), structures have been predicted computationally with supportive
experimental data from RNase probing and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy (Plant et al., 2005; Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). Functional studies have
revealed the importance of their secondary structures for viral transcription and replication
(Brierley, Digard and Inglis, 1989; Liu et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008; Yang and Leibowitz,
2015).
The FSE is located near the boundary of ORF1a and ORF1b and causes the ribosome
to “slip” and shift register by -1 nt in order to bypass a canonical stop codon at the end of
ORF1a and translate the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and other
proteins in ORF1b (Brierley et al., 1987; Plant et al., 2005). Studies on multiple viruses
have shown that an optimal frameshifting rate is critical, and small differences in
percentage of frameshifting lead to dramatic differences in genomic RNA production and
infection dose (Plant et al., 2010). Therefore, the FSE has emerged as a major drug target
for binding of small molecules that can influence the rate of ribosome slippage and be
used as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The structure of the FSE of SARS-CoV (whose sequence differs from the SARS-CoV-2
FSE by just one nucleotide), was solved by NMR to be a 3-stem pseudoknot (Plant et al.,
2005; Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020). The prevailing mechanism is that the 3-stem
pseudoknot causes the ribosome to pause at the slippery sequence and backtrack by 1
nt to release mechanical tension (Plant and Dinman, 2008). However, the frameshifting
rate of SARS-CoV-2 during infection is unknown, and none of the RNA structure models
for the FSE has been validated in cells.
Furthermore, the structures of many physiologically important elements of coronavirus
genomes remain uncharacterized, including most of the transcription-regulating
sequences (TRSs). The TRSs are short sequences that are critical for the transcription
of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs), from which all proteins not encoded by ORF1ab are
translated (Sola et al., 2015). The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains ten TRSs: one “leader

TRS” (TRS-L) located in the 5’ UTR, and nine “body TRSs” (TRS-B), one preceding each
open reading frame other than ORF1ab (Kim et al., 2020).
The nine TRS-Bs give rise to nine sgRNAs via discontinuous transcription (Sola et al.,
2015). In this process, transcription of a minus-strand sgRNA begins at the 3’ end of the
genomic RNA. When transcription reaches one of the TRS-Bs, the nascent transcript
dissociates from the TRS-B and re-anneals to the TRS-L. Transcription resumes at the
TRS-L and finishes at the 5’ end of the genomic RNA. Thus, each sgRNA contains a short
5’ “leader” sequence (69 nt from the 5’ end of the genome to TRS-L) followed by the TRSB and the portion of the genome downstream of the TRS-B.
Nine of the ten TRSs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome contain the same core sequence (CS)
of 6 nt (ACGAAC) flanked by short sequences that vary among the TRSs (Kim et al.,
2020). The one exception is the TRS of ORF7b, whose CS is AAGAAC. Interestingly,
while the CSs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are identical, the sequence differs
substantially from the CSs of other closely related coronaviruses (Yount et al., 2003).
Since the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome became available, several groups have
computationally predicted structures at multiple genomic regions (Andrews et al., 2020;
Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020). This work provided important first insights into the
secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 using algorithms such as RNAz (Gruber et al., 2010)
and Contrafold (Do, Woods and Batzoglou, 2006). However, these algorithms are limited
by “breaking up” the full-length RNA into small windows (~120 nt) and folding each
window independently of the rest of the genomic sequence. This strategy makes the final
structure model sensitive to the choice of the exact start and end of each independent
window. Further, in silico generated models cannot account for the physiological context
in which an RNA folds within cells.
Over the past ten years, the drawbacks of in silico models have been largely overcome
by the development of genome-wide strategies to chemically probe RNA structure in cells.
The most popular chemical probes are dimethyl sulfate (DMS) (Rouskin et al., 2014),
SHAPE (Siegfried et al., 2014), and icSHAPE (Spitale et al., 2015), all of which provide
critical in vivo measurements that are used by computational algorithms to generate
accurate models of RNA structures in vivo.
In this study, we perform DMS mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq)
(Zubradt et al., 2016) on infected Vero cells to generate the first experimentally
determined genome-wide secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2. Our results reveal major
differences with in silico predictions and highlight the physiological structures of known
functional elements. Our work provides experimental data on the structural biology of
RNA viruses and will inform efforts in the development of RNA-based diagnostics and
therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTS
The genome-wide structure of SARS-CoV-2 in cells
To determine the intracellular genome-wide structure of SARS-CoV-2, we added dimethyl
sulfate (DMS) to infected Vero cells and performed mutational profiling with sequencing
(DMS-MapSeq) (Zubradt et al., 2016) (FIGURE 1A). DMS rapidly and specifically
modifies unpaired adenines and cytosines in vivo at their Watson-Crick faces. Our results
were highly reproducible between independent biological replicates ( r = 0.89; Figure 1B).
Combined, a total of ~1.58 million paired reads mapped to the coronavirus genome
(Figure 1C), representing ~40% of total cellular RNA (post ribosomal RNA depletion).
This large fraction of coronavirus reads from total intracellular RNA is consistent with
previous literature using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells (Kim et al., 2020). DMS treated
samples had high signal to noise ratio, with adenines and cytosines having a mutation
rate ~9-fold higher than the background (guanines and uracils). In contrast, in untreated
samples the mutation rate on all four bases (0.10%) was slightly lower than previously
reported average sequencing error rates of 0.24% (Pfeiffer et al., 2018) (Figure 1D).
We used the DMS-MaPseq data as constraints in RNAstructure (Mathews, 2004) to fold
the entire SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (Supplementary Figure 1). We first examined the
results at the 265 nt 5’ UTR (Figure 1E), one of the best studied regions in the coronavirus
genome (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015; Madhugiri et al., 2018). The 5’ UTRs of multiple
coronaviruses have been characterized extensively in terms of their structures and roles
in viral replication. In agreement with previously published structures of this highly
conserved region (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015; Madhugiri et al., 2018), we found five stem
loops (SL1 – 5) within the SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR and three stem loops (SL6 – 8) near the
beginning of ORF1a.
Stem loop 1 (SL1) is vital for viral replication. A previous study on murine hepatitis virus
(MHV) found that mutations that destabilize the upper portion (near the loop) of SL1 or
stabilize the lower portion (near the base) prevent viral replication (Li et al., 2008). In
addition, viable viruses with a single-base deletion in the lower portion also had mutations
in the 3’ UTR. Together, these observations suggested that the lower portion of SL1 must
be able to unfold and likely interacts with the 3’ UTR to assist in sgRNA transcription (Li
et al., 2008). In our structure, the lower portion of SL1 has low DMS reactivity, consistent
with a pairing between these bases either within the stem or with the 3’ UTR. Further work
is needed to test a potential alternative structure for SL1 that would involve long range
interactions between the 5’ and the 3’ UTRs of SARS-CoV-2.
The most evolutionarily conserved secondary structure in the 5’ UTR is stem loop 2 (SL2)
and the structure of the MHV SL2 has been solved by NMR (Liu et al., 2009). The
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and MHV SL2 are identical, and our in-cell model of SL2 is
consistent with the NMR structure, with every base in the stem showing low DMS
reactivity. Although C50 within the loop of SL2 has low reactivity, this is explained by the
NMR structure, in which C50 and G53 (as numbered here) are paired. Interestingly, the
secondary structure but not the sequence of the stem was shown to be essential for

replication: in a previous study, disruption of SL2 by three mutations on either side of the
stem prevented MHV-A59 replication, but compensatory mutations restored nearly wildtype growth (Liu et al., 2007). Mutants of MHV-A59 with non-functional SL2 were able to
transcribe minus-strand genomic RNA in cells but not minus-strand subgenomic RNAs,
suggesting that SL2 plays a role in discontinuous transcription. Disruption of SL2 also
reduced the rate of in vitro translation of a downstream luciferase reporter (Liu et al.,
2007). To the best of our knowledge, the precise mechanism through which SL2 is
required for viral replication remains unknown.
Stem loop 3 (SL3) contains the leader TRS (TRS-L) involved in discontinuous
transcription (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015), the structure and function of which will be
discussed in Figure 3.
Stem loop 4 (SL4) is a bulged stem loop downstream of TRS-L. A previous study in MHV
found that SL4 was required for sgRNA synthesis and that deleting the entire SL4 was
lethal (Yang et al., 2011). However, mutation or deletion of either the lower (SL4a) or
upper (SL4b) part of SL4 merely impairs replication, with disruption of SL4a causing
greater impairment (Yang et al., 2011). In addition, replacing the entire SL4 with a shorter,
unrelated sequence that was predicted to fold into a stable stem loop impaired MHV
growth but was not lethal (Yang et al., 2011). Based on these results, Yang et al. proposed
that discontinuous transcription requires proper spacing between the stem loops
upstream and downstream of the TRS, and SL4 maintains this space (Yang et al., 2011).
SL4 also contains the start codon of a short open reading frame (nine codons in SARSCoV-2) known as the “upstream” ORF (uORF) (Madhugiri et al., 2014). In a study on MHV,
disruption of the uORF start codon increased translation of ORF1a and modestly
decreased viral replication (Madhugiri et al., 2014).
Stem loop 5 (SL5) contains four branches (SL5, SL5A, SL5B, SL5C), and its structure in
MHV-A59 was predicted using chemical probing with SHAPE (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015).
Disruption of SL5C has been shown to prevent replication of viral defective interfering
particles (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015) but not of whole MHV (Yang et al., 2015). SL5
contains the start codon of ORF1a, although in different coronaviruses the start codon
can be located in SL5A, SL5B, or the stem 3’ of SL5C (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). Our
data support a three-branched SL5 for SARS-CoV-2, similar to previous models of SARSCoV (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015) and SARS-CoV-2 (Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020)
in which the start codon is located in the main SL5 stem, just downstream of SL5C.
Stem loops 6, 7, and 8 (SL6 – 8) lie downstream of the 5’ UTR, within the coding sequence
of nsp1. The structures of these stem loops vary among betacoronaviruses, with SARSCoV predicted to have all three stem loops, MHV only SL6 and SL7, and bovine
coronavirus (BCoV) a structure in which SL6 and SL7 are branches of another stem (Yang
et al., 2015). As predicted for SARS-CoV, our model also has all three stem loops, though
this contrasts with an in silico model of SARS-CoV-2 that features three short stem loops
in place of SL8 (Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020). Mutations of SL6 that disrupt its
secondary structure but preserve the amino acid sequence of nsp1 were not lethal in
MHV, suggesting that SL6 is not essential (Yang et al., 2015)

Structured and accessible regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
To broadly locate regions of potential interest in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we identified
all structured and accessible regions, which we define as stretches of at least 10
consecutive paired bases or 14 consecutive unpaired bases, respectively (Figure 2A).
Structured regions could be functional elements of the genome that are potential targets
of therapeutics. We identify 215 structured regions covering a total of 2,359 bases (8.5%
of the genome). These regions include structures with known functions, such as SL5 in
the 5’ UTR and a bulged stem loop in the 3’ UTR (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015), as well as
many structures whose functions are unknown. The longest stretch of consecutive paired
bases is 25 nt (positions 11,306 - 11,330) and falls within a previously uncharacterized
set of two bulged stem loops in ORF1a. These results provide a starting point for
characterizing additional functional structures in the viral life cycle.
Accessible regions in viral genomes are potential targets of antisense oligonucleotide
therapeutics (Eckardt, Romby and Sczakiel, 1997; Ding, 2001; Rangan, Zheludev and
Das, 2020) through the mechanism of RNA interference (Wilson and Doudna, 2013). We
identify 261 accessible regions covering 6,305 bases (21% of the entire genome). As
there are 11 such regions within ORF-N, which is present in every sgRNA, every sgRNA
may be targetable with antisense oligos. Additionally, every open reading frame except
ORF-E contains at least one of these predicted accessible regions, raising the possibility
of targeting individual sgRNAs.
At a more stringent threshold of 25 consecutive nucleotides predicted to be unpaired, we
find 78 accessible regions, one of which is located within ORF-N (34 nt, positions 28,721
- 28,754) and hence in every genomic and subgenomic RNA. The two longest stretches
of consecutive predicted unpaired bases are both 122 nt long and occupy positions 9,602
- 9,723 (within ORF1a) and 21,573 - 21,694 (within ORF-S). These regions may offer
multiple binding sites for antisense oligonucleotides.
Transcription-Regulating Sequences (TRSs) lie within stem loops
As the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) are necessary for the synthesis of
sgRNAs, we analyzed our structural models of the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the nine body
TRSs (TRS-B). The leader TRS (TRS-L) is the central component of the 5’ UTR involved
in discontinuous transcription (Sola et al., 2015). In silico models for several alpha and
betacoronaviruses variously place TRS-L in stem loop 3 (SL3) or in an unpaired stretch
of nucleotides (Liu et al., 2007; Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). The TRS-L of SARS-CoV and

of SARS-CoV-2 was predicted to lie in the 3’ side of the stem of SL3, which is consistent with our
in-cell model (Liu et al., 2007; Yang and Leibowitz, 2015; Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020). In
our data, the stem of SL3 contains two bases with medium reactivity (Figure 2B), which suggests
that SL3 transitions between folded and unfolded states, as is hypothesized for the alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Madhugiri et al., 2018).
Of the nine body TRSs, we find that seven (all but the TRSs of ORF7a and ORF7b) lie within a
stem loop. Of these, all but one TRS (N) place the core sequence on the 5’ side of the stem. Four
body TRSs (M, ORF6, ORF8, and N) are predicted to lie in stem loops with two or three bulges,
with the core sequence spanning one of the internal bulges. The other three structured body
TRSs (S, ORF3a, and E) lie in stem loops without bulges, with the final paired base in the 5’ side
of the stem contained in the core sequence. Strikingly, the entire core sequence is paired in two
body TRSs (S and M), and partially exposed in a loop or bulge in the other five (Figure 2B).

Figure 2: Structured and unstructured regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. (A)
Locations of highly structured and unstructured regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Highly structured regions are
defined are stretches of at least 10 consecutive paired bases; unstructured regions shown are stretches of at least 14
consecutive unpaired bases. The thickness of each bar is proportional to the number of consecutive paired (blue) or
unpaired (orange) bases. The data is plotted over a schematic of the genome, highlighting the organization of open
reading frames (ORFs) and the transcription regulatory sequences (TRS). (B) In-cell model of each of the eight TRSs
predicted to lie within a stem loop. The core sequence (CS) of each TRS is outlined in black. Models are arranged in
genomic order from top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
In-cell data-derived model differs from previous in silico predictions
We evaluated the robustness of our in-cell data derived genome-wide model by varying
two critical RNA folding parameters used by RNAstructure: 1) the maximum allowed
distance for base pairing and 2) the threshold for DMS signal normalization.
A previous in silico approach for folding RNA found that limiting base pairs to be 100 to
150 nt apart was optimal to avoid overpredicting structured regions (Lange et al., 2012).
However, some RNA viruses contain known essential structures wherein bases over 300
nt apart are paired (e.g. the Rev response element in HIV-1 spans approximately 350 nt
(Watts et al., 2009)). We therefore varied the maximum distance (md) allowed for base
pairing from 120 nt to 350 nt. We computed the agreement between the resulting
structures using a modified version of the Fowlkes-Mallows index (Fowlkes and Mallows,
1983) that compares base pairing partners as well as unpaired bases (Methods). Overall,
there was high agreement while varying the md from 120 nt to 350 nt, suggesting that
long-distance (i.e. >120 nt) interactions across the SARS-CoV-2 RNA have a small effect
on the identity of local structures. The genome structure folded with an md of 120 nt was
97.5% identical to the structure with an md of 350 nt, and in the latter structure only 3.8%
of base pairs spanned >120 nt. Next, we proceeded with the md limit of 350 nt and tested
two different DMS signal thresholds that normalize reactivity to either the median of the
top 5 % or top 10% of the most reactive bases. We found that the structure models
produced with the two normalization approaches were highly similar, with 93.6% identity
(Figure 3A). Thus, within the ranges that we tested, our genome-wide data-derived model
was robust to variation in the parameters of RNAstructure (Mathews, 2004).
We proceeded with the whole genome structure modelled with a md of 350 nt and a DMS
signal normalization of 5% for further analysis (Supplementary Figure). Previous studies
that computationally predicted genome-wide SARS-Cov-2 RNA structures used 1) RNAz,
a thermodynamic-based model that additionally takes sequence alignment and considers
base pairing conservation (Gruber et al., 2010; Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020), and
2) Contrafold, which predicts RNA secondary structures without physics-based models
and instead uses learned parameters based on known structures (Do, Woods and
Batzoglou, 2006). These recent studies predicted 228 structures with RNAz with lengths
ranging from 90 to 120 nt, and 79 structures with Contrafold with lengths ranging from 55
to 111 nt (Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020). For each of these structures, we computed
the agreement between the different models (Figure 3B). We report the agreement using
the mFMI while either excluding external bases pairs or including these pairs (Methods).
As expected, agreement with the structures from purely computational prediction is higher
when excluding external base pairs (average 76.3% for RNAz, 69.3% for Contrafold) than

when including them (average 71.2% for RNAz, 54.0% for Contrafold). Since our goal is to compare the overall similarity of two structures, we chose the inclusion of external base pairs as the
more accurate metric for comparing the structures. Our predictions overall agreed more with
those from RNAz (mean 71.2%, median 75.2%) than Contrafold (mean 54.0%, median 54.4%).
We report the agreement between our structure and the RNAz structures across the entire
genome (Figure 3C). Most structures are 60 to 80% identical, with several short regions that
disagree substantially.

In addition, we computed the similarity of our model compared to the structures with the
three highest P-values predicted with RNAz that do not overlap known structures in the
Rfam database (Kalvari et al., 2018; Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020) (Figure 3D). We
noted that in all three cases, the structure at the center of the window was nearly identical
to ours, and most of the disagreements arose at the edges, presumably due to the effects
of the windows from RNAz being limited to 120 nt. Of the five structures predicted with
Contrafold that had the largest maximum expected accuracies, our agreement ranged
from 66.0% to 86.1%, well above the genome-wide mean (54.0%), suggesting that these
structures are indeed more accurate than the average Contrafold structure (Figure 3E).
Finally, we compared the structures at the TRS elements to those predicted by RNAz
(Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020) (Figure 3F). To remove the effects of external base
pairs, we focused only on the complete structural element (e.g. a stem loop) in which the
TRS was located. RNAz predicted structure for four TRSs. Our model for TRS-L was
identical to the first predicted window from RNAz but differed significantly (35.3%
agreement) from the next prediction of the same TRS-L element within a different folding
window, indicating that the choice of folding window can have a large effect on the RNAz
structure model. For the other three TRS elements for which RNAz predicted at least one
structure for, our agreement ranges from 74.4% to 96.8%, above the genome-wide
average of 71.2%, lending support to both models.
Uncovering an unexpected structure at Frameshift Element (FSE)
The frameshift element (FSE) causes the ribosome to slip and shift register by -1 nt in
order to bypass a canonical stop codon and translate the viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP) (Plant and Dinman, 2008). Previous studies on coronaviruses and
other viruses have shown that an optimal frameshifting rate is critical and small
differences in percentage of frameshifting lead to dramatic differences in genomic RNA
production and infection dose (Plant et al., 2010). Therefore, the FSE has emerged as a
major drug target for small molecule binding that could influence the rate of frameshifting
and be used as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2. To date, there is little experimental
data on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 FSE and the prevailing model is a 3-stem
pseudoknot forming downstream of the slippery site, which is thought to pause the
ribosome and allow frameshifting to occur (Plant and Dinman, 2008).
To closely examine the FSE structure in cells, we used DMS-MaPseq target specific
protocol (Zubradt et al., 2016). We designed primers targeting 283 nt surrounding the
FSE and amplified this region from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 that were treated with
DMS. Our analysis revealed a strikingly different structure than the prevailing model
(Plant et al., 2005; Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020) (Figure 4A). Our in-cell model does
not include the expected pseudoknot formation downstream of the slippery sequence.
Instead, half of the canonical stem 1 (Figure 4A, purple) finds an alternative pairing
partner (pink) driven by 10 complementary bases upstream of the slippery site (Figure
4A, pink). We call this pairing Alternative Stem 1 (AS1).

The prevailing model of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE is based on previous studies of the SARSCoV FSE, as they only differ in sequence by a single nucleotide located in a putative loop
(Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020). Nuclease mapping and Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) analysis of the SARS-CoV FSE solved the structure of an in vitro
refolded, truncated 85 nt region starting at the slippery site (Plant et al., 2005). This
structure did not include the sequence upstream of the slippery site and formed a 3-stem
pseudoknot.
Interestingly, in silico predictions of the RNA structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome using
RNAz (Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020) and ScanFold (Andrews et al., 2020) do not
find the 3-stem pseudoknot but instead support our in-cell model of Alternative Stem 1.
In SARS-CoV-2, ScanFold not only predicted the AS1 but also found that it was more
stable relative to random sequences than any other structure in the entire frameshift
element (Andrews et al., 2020). Indeed, three conceptually varied methods (DMSMaPseq, RNAz, and ScanFold) aimed at identifying functional structures, run
independently by different research groups all converge on the Alternative Stem 1 as a
central structure at the FSE.
In order to directly compare our in-cell findings with the reports of the 3-stem pseudoknot,
we in vitro-transcribed, refolded, and DMS-probed the same 85 nt sequence as analyzed
by NMR (Plant et al., 2005). Our in vitro-data driven model agrees well with the NMR
model (87.1% identical) and finds all three canonical stems, including the pseudoknot.
FSE structure is dependent on the sequence context
The major differences we observed in the structure of the FSE in cells vs. in vitro could
either be due to 1) length of the in vitro refolded viral RNA or 2) factors in the cellular
environment that are absent in vitro. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we
re-folded the FSE in the context of longer native sequences.
We found that as we increased the length of the in vitro re-folded construct by including
more of its native sequence, from 85 nt to 283 nt to 30 kb, the DMS reactivity patterns
became progressively more similar to the pattern we observed in cells (Figure 4B). Indeed,
in the context of the full ~30 kb genomic RNA, the structure of the FSE is nearly identical
to the structure in physiological conditions during SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells (r = 0.94).
These results indicate that the length of the entire RNA molecule is important for correctly
folding the FSE. Strikingly, at a length of 283 nt and above, the main structure forming is
Alternative Stem 1 rather than the 3-stem pseudoknot. Our data indicate that given the
full range of pairing possibilities in the genome, AS1 is more favorable and the
predominant structure in cells.
Alternative Stem 1 pairing sequence is conserved across sarbecoviruses
To determine if other coronaviruses may have a similar alternative structure of the
frameshift element, we searched for the sequence that pairs with canonical stem 1 in a
set of curated coronaviruses (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020). This set contains 53 isolates of
SARS-CoV-2, 12 other sarbecoviruses (including the SARS-CoV reference genome), and

2 merbecoviruses. The 10 nt complement (CCGCGAACCC) to a sequence overlapping
canonical stem 1 of the FSE (GGGUUUGCGG) was perfectly conserved in all 12 of the
sarbecoviruses, six of which were isolated from bats (Figure 4C). However, the 10 nt
complement was not present in either merbecovirus. Aligning the sequences of all 20
betacoronaviruses with complete genomes in RefSeq revealed that the 10 nt complement
was conserved in all of and only the three sarbecoviruses in RefSeq: SARS-CoV, SARSCoV-2, and BtCoV BM48-31 (data not shown). These results suggest that AS1 is unique
to the sarbecoviruses.
The Frameshift Element (FSE) forms two distinct structures in cells
In the past, RNA structures based on experimental data have been limited to a population
average structure which assumes that every individual molecule are in folded in the same
conformation. However, previous studies have identified the existence of biologically
relevant alternative structures in viral genomic RNA that play vital roles in the viruses’ life
cycles. An example of this is the HIV-1 Rev responsive element (RRE) and 5′ untranslated
region (UTR) which regulate viral RNA export and packaging. As aforementioned, the
rate of frameshifting in coronaviruses is critical for the virus and set at a specific
percentage. While the mechanism of how this frameshifting rate is maintained remains
unidentified, studies have proposed that alternative RNA structure may play a role in
promoting frameshifting.
To determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 FSE forms alternative structures, we applied the
“detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation-maximization” (DREEM)
algorithm on our in-cell DMS-MaPseq data (Tomezsko et al., 2020). In brief, the DREEM
algorithm groups DMS reactivities into distinct clusters by considering the likelihood of the
co-occurrence of reactive bases. (i.e. if two bases are highly mutated in the population
average but never mutated together on a single read, we can assume that at least two
conformations are present). DREEM directly clusters experimental data without relying
on generating a thermodynamic based model, thus enabling the discovery of new RNA
structures based purely on chemical probing data from cells.
We analyzed modified intracellular RNA of a 283 nt region surrounding the FSE
specifically amplified from two biological replicates. We found two distinct patterns of DMS
reactivities (Figure 5A), suggesting that the RNA folds into at least two distinct
conformations in this region. In both biological replicates, clusters 1 and 2 (corresponding
to Structure 1 and 2) separate at a reproducible ratio (~55% vs. 45%) where Structure 1
is significantly different from Structure 2 (r = 0.46) but highly similar to the corresponding
cluster in biological replicates (r = 0.99) (Figure 5B). Both structures have the Alternative
Stem 1 pairing spanning the slippery sequence. However, Structure 2 forms a large 75 nt
stem immediately downstream of Alternative Stem 1 whereas Structure 1 does not
(Figure 5C). Further studies measuring frameshifting efficiency are needed to determine
whether this 75 nt stem specifically promotes frameshifting by stalling the ribosome right

DISCUSSION
Here we present, to our knowledge, the first secondary structure of the entire RNA genome of
SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells, based on chemical probing with DMS-MaPseq. Importantly, we find
that many genomic regions fold differently than in silico-based predictions. We attribute these
differences in large parts to the sequence context used for folding (how much native sequence is
taken upstream and downstream for a given region of interest). Our data underscore the contribution of the full-length RNA molecule towards structure formation at local regions.
Of particular note, our in-cell data reveal an alternative conformation for the frameshift element
(FSE) in which the 5’ side of stem 1 of the canonical pseudoknot is paired to a complementary 10
nt sequence that lies shortly upstream. We find that this Alternative Stem 1 (AS1) predominates
to the extent that we are not able to detect the canonical pseudoknot. In previous work (Tomezsko
et al., 2020), we estimated our limit of detection for minor conformations at 6%, suggesting two
potential models for frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2. In the first model, the pseudoknot structure
causes frameshifting and forms at a level below our limit of detection. AS1 provides a means to
downregulate the rate of frameshifting by sequestering the 5’ side of the canonical stem 1. In the
second model, frameshifting is stimulated by a large 75 nt stem loop immediately downstream of
AS1 that blocks the ribosome and causes it to slip. An alternative structure without the 75 nt stem
loop does not cause ribosome pausing at the slippery site. These alternative genomic conformations enable SARS-CoV-2 to regulate translation of ORF1ab (Figure 6). If the second model is
true, then in sarbecoviruses the ability to form a pseudoknot may be vestigial, as the FSE
sequence is highly conserved among coronaviruses (Plant et al., 2005).

When genomic RNA folds into Alternative Structure 1 (top), the slippery site resides within a loop in the middle of a long stem-loop.
As the ribosome starts to unwind the RNA, it may pause at the base of the stem, but this pause is far from the slippery site. By the
time the ribosome reaches the slippery site, the structure in front of it has been unwound. As the ribosome continues it will reach
the upstream stop codon and terminate translation. In contrast, Alternative Structure 2 (bottom) forms a 75 nt stem loop right in
front of the slippery site. This stem loop can cause the ribosome to pause, frameshift -1 nt and bypass the upstream stop codon
to continue translation.

Previous functional studies on SARS-CoV report that the pseudoknot increases
frameshifting but do not contradict our model of Alternative Stem 1 (Baranov et al., 2005;
Plant et al., 2005; Su et al., 2005). Functional assays use short reporter constructs that
are likely to fold into a structure with a pseudoknot, similar to what we observed for the
85 nt construct refolded in vitro. Indeed, a large body of literature shows that different
types of pseudoknots or stable stems placed shortly after the slippery site increase
frameshifting rates in reporter assays (Brierley, Digard and Inglis, 1989; Baranov et al.,
2005). However, much work is needed to understand which structures play a major role
during active infection. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of
mutations and measured the translation efficiency of ORF1ab in cells infected with a
sarbecovirus.
Our data reveal additional structures in the genome that may be involved in regulating
gene expression. For example, previous work in MHV and SARS-CoV suggests that the
N protein binds to and unwinds TRS structures to regulate sub genomic gene expression
(Grossoehme et al., 2009). Importantly, there is evidence that the stability of the TRS
structure can affect its affinity for the N protein. All together, these results indicate that
small molecules or antisense oligoes that alter the stability of the TRS structures will
disrupt the expression of subgenomic RNAs and can serve as therapeutic strategies.
So far, we have not identified any structures of minus-strand RNAs. Of our 1.58 million
paired reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2, only 4,955 (0.31%) came from minus-strand RNA,
insufficient coverage to obtain reliable DMS signals. However, as minus-strand RNAs
must be transcribed to positive-strand genomic and subgenomic RNAs, they may contain
structures that are important for this process and potentially druggable. Higher-throughput
genome-wide sequencing or PCR amplification of a targeted region of the minus strand
would enable us to discover structures in the minus strands.
In this study we obtained structures of RNA in infected Vero cells. We were limited to
studying population average RNA structures, with no temporal resolution or measure of
heterogeneity. Our models of stable structures across the genome represent prominent
conformers forming in cells. However, it is possible that some of the open regions we
identify, which have evenly distributed DMS signal, are in fact composites of alternative
structures (Tomezsko et al., 2020). Deeper sequencing data is needed to determine the
degree of structure heterogeneity access the coronavirus genome. Further studies will
determine how RNA structures change from the time a virion enters a cell to the time
when new virions are released.
We show that in vitro RNA-refolding of the full-length 30 kb genome can recapitulate the
structures formed at the FSE in cells. These results provide evidence that some of the
structures we find in cells are largely driven by intrinsic RNA thermodynamics. We expect
such structures will remain the same between different cell types, although more work is
needed to establish the extent of structure changes as a function of the abundance of
various cellular and viral protein factors.

Our in-cell data-derived model of SARS-CoV-2 presents major RNA structures across the
entire genome and provides the foundation for further studies. In particular, we propose
a new model for the FSE in which the predominant structure forms an Alternative Stem
1. Future work will involve determining by what mechanism and to what extent the
alternative structures of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE regulate translation of ORF1ab, as well as
whether the FSE can fold into a pseudoknot in cells. Better understanding of the
structures and mechanisms of elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome will enable the
design of targeted therapeutics.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Vero cells infection and DMS modification
SARS-CoV-2 total viral RNA was extracted from Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) cultured in
DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) plated into 100 mm dishes and
infected at a MOI of 0.01 with 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 (Passage 6). Infected cells
were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and harvested 2 days post infection either with or
without DMS treatment. Infected cell pellets were centrifuged at 5000xg for 5 min at 4 °C
and resuspended in Trizol (Ambion).
DMS modification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected cells
200 μl DMS (or 2% v/v) was added dropwise to the plated Vero cells 48 h post SARSCoV-2 infection and incubated for 4 min at 37 °C. DMS was neutralized by adding 15 ml
PBS (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 30% β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were centrifuged
at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice by resuspending the pellet with
15 ml PBS with 30% β-mercaptoethanol and centrifugation to pellet then just once with
15 ml PBS. After washes, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml Trizol (ThermoFisher
Scientific) and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s specifications. Total RNA
was purified using RNA Clean and Concentrator -25 kit (Zymo).
DMS modification of in vitro-transcribed RNA
gBlocks were obtained from IDT for the SARS-CoV-2 85nt and 283nt FSE which
corresponds to nucleotides 13460-13546 and nucleotides 13,342-13,624 based on 2019nCoV/USA-WA1/2020. The regions of interest were amplified by PCR with a forward
primer that contained the T7 promoter sequence (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTT).
The PCR product was used for T7 Megascript in vitro transcription (ThermoFisher
Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions with a 16 h incubation time at 37 °C.
Subsequently, 1 μl Turbo DNase I (ThermoFisher Scientific) was added to the reaction
and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The RNA was purified using RNA Clean and
Concentrator -5 kit (Zymo). 10 μg of RNA in 10 μl H2O was denatured at 95 °C for 1 min
then placed on ice. On the basis of the DMS concentration used in the next step, 300 mM
sodium cacodylate buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with 6 mM MgCl2+ (refolding
buffer) was added so that the final volume was 100 μl. (e.g. for 2.5% final DMS
concentration: add 87.5 μl refolding buffer and 2.5 μl DMS) Then, 2.5 μl was added and

neutralized by adding 60 μl β-mercaptoethanol (Millipore-Sigma). The RNA was purified
using RNA Clean and Concentrator -5 kit.
DMS modification of full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA in vitro
Full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from the supernatant of infected Vero cells
(as described above), resuspended in 1 ml Trizol (ThermoFisher Scientific) and RNA was
extracted following the manufacturer’s specifications. The RNA was purified using RNA
Clean and Concentrator -5 kit (Zymo) and DMS modified as described above.
Human rRNA subtraction of total cellular RNA
15 μg of total RNA per reaction was used as the input for rRNA subtraction. First, 1 μl
rRNA subtraction mix (15 μg/μl) and 2 μl 5× hybridization buffer (end concentration: 200
mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) were added to each reaction, and final volume was
then adjusted with water to 10 μl. The samples were denatured at 95 °C for 2 min and
then temperature was reduced by 0.1 °C/s until the reaction was at 45 °C. Next, 10 μl
RNase H buffer and 2 μl hybridase thermostable RNase H (Lucigen) preheated to 45 °
were added. The samples were incubated at 45 °C for 30 min. The RNA was cleaned with
RNA Clean and Concentrator -5, following the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in
45 μl water. Then, 5 μl Turbo DNase buffer and 3 μl Turbo DNase (ThermoFisher
Scientific) were added to each reaction and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The RNA was
purified with RNA Clean and Concentrator -5 (Zymo) following instructions.
RT–PCR and sequencing of DMS-modified RNA
For reverse transcription, 1.5 μg of rRNA subtracted total RNA or 10 μg of in vitrotranscribed RNA was added to 4 μl 5× first strand buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific), 1 μl
10μM reverse primer, 1 μl dNTP, 1 μl 0.1M DTT, 1 μl RNaseOUT and 1 μl TGIRT-III
(Ingex). The reverse-transcription reaction was incubated at 60 °C for 1.5 h. 1 μl 4M NaOH
was then added and incubated at 95 °C for 3 min to degrade the RNA. The cDNA was
purified with Oligo Clean and Concentrator -5 (Zymo) following instructions. PCR
amplification was done using Advantage HF 2 DNA polymerase (Takara) for 30 cycles
according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The PCR product was purified by DNA
Clean and Concentrator -5 (Zymo) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq library
for 150 bp insert size was constructed following the manufacturer’s instruction (NEBNext
Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit). The library was loaded on ISEQ-100 Sequencing flow
cell with ISEQ-100 High-throughput Sequencing Kit and the library was run on ISEQ-100
(paired-end run,151 x 151 cycles).
Library generation with DMS-modified SARS-CoV-2 RNA
After rRNA subtraction (described above), extracted DMS-modified RNA from SARSCoV-2 infected Vero cells was fragmented using the RNA Fragmentation kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific). 1.5 μg of rRNA subtracted total RNA was fragmented at 70 °C
for 2.5 min. The fragmented RNA was mixed with an equal volume 2× Novex TBE-urea

sample buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and run on a 10% TBE-urea gel (ThermoFisher
Scientific) at 200V for 1 h 15 min for size selection of RNA that is ~150nt. To
dephosphorylate and repair the ends of randomly fragmented RNA, 2 μl 10x CutSmart
buffer (New England Biolabs), 10 μl shrimp alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs),
2 μl RNaseOUT (ThermoFisher Scientific) and water were added to a final volume of 20
μl and 37 °C for 1 h. Next, 4 μl 50% PEG-800 (New England Biolabs), 4 μl 10× T4 RNA
ligase buffer (New England Biolabs), 4 μl T4 RNA ligase, truncated KQ (England Biolabs)
and 2 μl linker were added to the reaction and incubated for 18 h at 22 °C. The RNA was
purified with RNA Clean and Concentrator -5, following the manufacturer’s instructions
for recovery of all fragments and eluted in 10 μl water. Excess linker was degraded by
adding 2 μl 10× RecJ buffer (Lucigen), 1 μl RecJ exonuclease (Lucigen), 1 μl 5′
deadenylase (New England Biolabs) and 1 μl RNaseOUT, then incubating for 1 h at 30 °C.
The RNA was purified with RNA Clean and Concentrator -5, following the manufacturer’s
instructions and eluted in 11 μl water.
For reverse transcription, 1.5 μg of rRNA subtracted total RNA or 10 μg of in vitrotranscribed RNA was added to 4 μl 5× first strand buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific), 1 μl
10μM reverse primer, 1 μl dNTP, 1 μl 0.1M DTT, 1 μl RNaseOUT and 1 μl TGIRT-III
(Ingex). The reverse-transcription reaction was incubated at 60 °C for 1.5 h. 1 μl 4M NaOH
was then added and incubated at 95 °C for 3 min to degrade the RNA. The reversetranscription product was mixed with an equal volume 2× Novex TBE-urea sample buffer
(ThermoFisher Scientific) and run on a 10% TBE-urea gel (ThermoFisher Scientific) at
200V for 1 h 15 min for size selection of cDNA that is ~250nt. The size-selected and
purified cDNA was circularized using CircLigase ssDNA ligase kit (Lucigen) following
manufacture’s protocol. 2 μl of the circularized product was then used for PCR
amplification using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) for a maximum of 16
cycles. The PCR product was run on an 8% TBE gel at 180V for 1 h and size-selected
for products ~300 nt. The product was then sequenced with iSeq100 (Illumina) to produce
either 150×150-nt paired-end reads.
Mapping and quantification of mutations
Fastq files were trimmed using TrimGalore (github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore) to
remove Illumina adapters. Trimmed paired reads were mapped to the genome of SARSCoV-2 isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/USA-WA1/2020 (GenBank: MN985325.1)
(Harcourt et al., 2020) using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with the following
parameters: --local --no-unal --no-discordant --no-mixed -L 12 -X 1000. Reads aligning
equally well to more than one location were discarded. SAM files from Bowtie2 were
converted
into
BAM
files
using
Picard
Tools
SamFormatConverter
(broadinstitute.github.io/picard).
For each pair of aligned reads, a bit vector the length of the reference sequence was
generated using DREEM (Tomezsko et al., 2020). Bit vectors contained a 0 at every
position in the reference sequence where the reference sequence matched the read, a 1
at every base at which there was a mismatch or deletion in the read, and no information
for every base that was either not in the read or had a Phred score <20. We refer to

positions in a bit vector with a 0 or 1 as “informative bits” and all other positions as
“uninformative bits.”
For each position in the reference sequence, the number of bit vectors covering the
position and the number of reads with mismatches and deletions at the position were
counted using DREEM. The ratio of mismatches plus deletions to total coverage at each
position was calculated to obtain the population average mutation rate for each position.
Filtering bit vectors
In cases indicated below, bit vectors were discarded if they had two mutations closer than
4 bases apart, had a mutation next to an uninformative bit, or had more than an allowed
total number of mutations (greater than 10% of the length of the bit vector and greater
than three standard deviations above the median number of mutations among all bit
vectors). The average mutation rate for each position was computed from the filtered bit
vectors in the same way as described above.
Normalizing the mutation rates
The mutation rates for all of the bases in the RNA molecule were sorted in numerical
order. The greatest 5% or 10% of mutation rates (specified where relevant in the main
text) were chosen for normalization. The median among these signals was calculated. All
mutation rates were divided by this median to compute the normalized mutation rates.
Normalized rates greater than 1.0 were winsorized by setting them to 1.0 (Dixon, 1960).
Computing genome coverage and mutation rates
Genome-wide coverage (Figure 1C) was computed by counting the number of unfiltered
bit vectors from the in-cell library that contained an informative bit (0 or 1) at each position.
Signal and noise plots (Figure 1D) were generated from the unfiltered population average
mutation rate. A total of 103 (0.34%) positions across the genome were discarded for
having a noise mutation rate greater than 1% in the untreated sample (likely due to
endogenous modifications or “hotspot” reverse transcription errors). The signal and noise
were computed every 100 nt, starting at nucleotide 51. For each of these nucleotides, the
average mutation rate was computed over the 100 nt window starting 50 bases upstream
and ending 49 bases downstream. The “signal” was defined as the average mutation rate
of A and C, while the “noise” was defined as the average mutation rate of G and U.
The correlation of mutation rates between biological replicates genome-wide (Figure 1B)
was computed using the unfiltered bit vectors. The correlation of mutation rates between
different conditions of the FSE (Figure 4B) was computed using the filtered bit vectors.
The correlation of mutation rates between clusters and biological replicates for the FSE
(Figure 5B) was computed using the filtered bit vectors after clustering into two clusters.
For all correlation plots, the Pearson correlation coefficient is given. A total of 6 (0.02%)
outliers with >30% mutation rate were removed to prevent inflating the Pearson
correlation coefficients.

Folding the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome
The unfiltered population average mutation rate was obtained from the in-cell library reads.
The 29,882 nt genome of SARS-CoV-2 was divided into ten segments, each roughly 3
kb the boundaries of which are predicted to be open and accessible by RNAz (Rangan,
Zheludev and Das, 2020). For each segment, the population average mutation rate was
normalized. The segment was then folded using the Fold algorithm from RNAstructure
(Mathews, 2004) with parameters -m 3 to generate the top three structures, -md to specify
a maximum base pair distance, and -dms to use the normalized mutation rates as
constraints in folding. All mutation rates on G and U bases were set to -999 (unavailable
constraints). Connectivity Table files output from Fold were converted to dot bracket
format using ct2dot from RNAstructure (Mathews, 2004). The ten dot bracket structures
were concatenated into a single genome-wide structure.
The modified Fowlkes-Mallows index
Given two RNA structures of the same length (L) in dot-bracket notation, all base pairs in
each structure were identified. Each base pair was represented as a tuple of (position of
5’ base, position of 3’ base). The number of base pairs common to both structures (P12)
as well as the number of base pairs unique to the first structure (P1) and to the second
structure (P2) were computed. Given these quantities, the Fowlkes-Mallows index (a
measure of similarity between two binary classifiers) is defined as FMI =
𝑃!" ⁄"(𝑃!" + 𝑃! )(𝑃!" + 𝑃" ) (Fowlkes and Mallows, 1983). In the case that (𝑃!" + 𝑃! )(𝑃!" +
𝑃" ) = 0, we let FMI = 0.
As the Fowlkes-Mallows index does not consider positions at which the structures agree
on bases that are unpaired, the index needed to be modified; otherwise regions with few
base pairs would tend to score too low. Thus, the number of positions at which both
sequences contained an unpaired base (U) was computed. Two variations of the modified
Fowlkes-Mallows index (mFMI) were tested that differed in their treatment of externally
paired bases, defined as bases paired to another base outside of the region of the
structure being compared. The version of mFMI excluding external base pairs counted all
externally paired bases as unpaired when computing U. The number of positions
containing a paired base (P) was computed as P = L – U. In this case, mFMI was defined
as mFMI = 𝑈⁄𝐿 + 𝑃⁄𝐿 × FMI, which weights the Fowlkes-Mallows index by the fraction of
paired bases and adds the fraction of unpaired bases (U/L), as the structures agree at all
unpaired positions.
To include external base pairs, any position containing an externally paired base was not
counted in U. The number of positions at which both structures contained an externally
paired base with the same orientation (i.e. both facing in the 5’ or 3’ direction) was
computed as the number E. The number of positions at which at least one structure
contained a base that was paired, but not externally, was computed as P. Then, the mFMI
was defined as mFMI = 𝑈⁄𝐿 + 𝐸⁄𝐿 + 𝑃⁄𝐿 × FMI, which weights the Fowlkes-Mallows
index by the fraction of positions containing a paired base and considers positions in

which both bases are unpaired as in agreement, but only counts externally paired bases
as agreeing if both structures contain an externally paired base at the same position and
the base pairs have the same orientation.
Comparisons to previous in silico predictions
Excel files from the supplemental material of (Rangan, Zheludev and Das, 2020) were
parsed to obtain the coordinates and predicted structures. For each predicted structure,
agreement with the region of our structure with the same coordinates was computed using
the mFMI, either including or excluding external base pairs (as specified in the text). Box
plots of the agreement for each window (Figure 3B) show the minimum, first quartile,
median, third quartile, and maximum; data lying more than 1.5 times the interquartile
range from the nearest quartile are considered outliers and are plotted as individual points.
The numbers of points in each box plot are given in the Results section for Figure 3B.
Folding the frameshift element
Reads from RT-PCR of a 283 nt segment of in-cell RNA spanning the FSE (nucleotides
13,342 - 13,624) were used to generate bit vectors. The bit vectors were filtered as
described above, and the filtered average mutation rates were normalized. The RNA was
folded using the ShapeKnots algorithm from RNAstructure (Hajdin et al., 2013) with
parameters -m 3 to generate three structures and -dms to use the normalized mutation
rates as constraints in folding. All signals on G and U bases were set to -999
(unavailable constraints). Connectivity Table files output from ShapeKnots were
converted to dot bracket format using ct2dot from RNAstructure (Mathews, 2004).
Coronavirus sequence alignments
Accession numbers of curated sarbecovirus and merbecovrus genomes were obtained
from (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020) and downloaded from NCBI. The sequences were
aligned using the MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) web service with default parameters. The
region of the multiple sequence alignment spanning the two sides of Alternative Stem 1
was located and the sequence conservation computed using custom Python scripts.
For the alignment of all betacoronaviruses with genomes in NCBI RefSeq (O’Leary et al.,
2016), all reference genomes of betacoronaviruses were downloaded from RefSeq using
the query “betacoronavirus[organism] AND complete genome” with the RefSeq source
database as a filter. The sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) web
service with default parameters. The subgenus of betacoronavirus to which each virus
belonged was obtained from the NCBI taxonomy database (Sayers et al., 2009).
Detecting alternative structures of the FSE
The filtered bit vectors (the same used to fold the frameshift element) were clustered
using the expectation maximization algorithm of DREEM to allow detection of a maximum
of two alternative structures (Tomezsko et al., 2020).

Quantification of minus-strand reads
Mapped reads from the in-cell library were classified as minus-strand using a custom
Python script if they had the following SAM flags (Li et al., 2009): PAIRED and
PROPER_PAIR and ({READ1 and MREVERSE and not REVERSE} or {READ2 and
REVERSE and not MREVERSE}) and not (UNMAP or MUNMAP or SECONDARY or
QCFAIL or DUP or SUPPLEMENTARY).
Visualizing RNA structures
RNA structures were drawn using VARNA (Darty, Denise and Ponty, 2009). The bases
were colored using the normalized DMS signals.
