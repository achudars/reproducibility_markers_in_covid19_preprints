Abstract:
Airborne transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via airconditioning systems poses a significant threat for the continued escalation of the current
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 cannot tolerate
temperatures above 70 °C, here we designed and fabricated efficient air disinfection systems based
on heated nickel (Ni) foam to catch and kill SARS-CoV-2. Virus test results revealed that 99.8%

of the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 was caught and killed by a single pass through a Ni-foam-based
filter when heated up to 200 ℃. Additionally, the same filter was also used to catch and kill 99.9%
of Bacillus anthracis, an airborne spore. This study paves the way for preventing transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 and other highly infectious airborne agents in closed environments.

One Sentence Summary:
Heated Ni-foam filters are capable of effectively catching and killing airborne SARS-CoV-2 and
Bacillus anthracis spores.

Main Text:
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a rapidly spreading pandemic that is severely threatening public
health all over the world (1-6). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of June
11, 2020, there have been more than 7.4 million confirmed cases in 216 countries, areas, or
territories, leading to at least 418,294 deaths (7). The rapid spread of COVID-19 is related to
SARS-CoV-2 carriers being highly infectious while asymptomatic and the high capability of the
virus to survive in various environmental conditions (8-10). The most probable SARS-CoV-2
transmission route is human-to-human (11-13), which may explain why cluster spread was the
main reason for the quickly increasing cases of COVID-19 in early February 2020 in Wuhan,
China (14). Additionally, the consensus among scientists is that the virus is also noticeable when
it is transmitted through aerosols and droplets that are released into the air by a carrier, especially
when the person coughs, sneezes, or even talks forcefully in a closed environment (15, 16). A
recent study compared simulated SARS-CoV-2 aerosols to those of SARS-CoV-1 (17), its most
closely related viral strain and the cause of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia, and showed that,

comparable to the case of SARS-CoV-1, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 can remain in the air
for about 3 hours, although their viral load continually diminishes during that time. In the same
study it was also found that the virus contained in droplets that settled on various surfaces can
remain viable for several days.
Having confirmed airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, a mode of transmission that is
relevant to several previously known respiratory viruses, including influenza, scientists are now
questioning whether the virus can travel even greater distances through the air by becoming lodged
in other airborne particles such as condensed water vapor or even dust. Such a mode of
transmission would be extremely concerning and would call into question the adequacy of
measures that are mostly designed to address issues related to proximity to an infectious individual,
such as wearing masks, washing hands and surfaces, and general social distancing. One of the
earliest studies addressing this subject indicated that such transmission may be possible for SARSCoV-2 (18). The study looked at certain indicators of airborne viral spread in a Wuhan hospital
where patients with COVID-19 were kept in isolation. With all available precautions in place to
prevent viral spread through personnel or equipment, viral RNA was still detected in areas of the
hospital that it could only have reached through the atmosphere or the ventilation system (18).
Currently, with increasing numbers of people returning to the workplace, the chances of infection
resulting from aerosol transmission through central air-conditioning systems are increasing. Thus,
determining how to stop the virus from spreading in air-conditioned spaces is extremely urgent.
Simple filtration cannot completely stop the spread. Fortunately, most viruses, including SARSCoV-2, are not resistant to high temperature (19, 20). It has been demonstrated that the time needed
for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation is reduced to 5 minutes when the incubation temperature is increased
to 70 ℃ (21). Therefore, if a filter in an air conditioner can be heated to a high temperature (e.g.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.13.150243; this version posted June 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

up to 250 ℃), any SARS-CoV-2 in the cycling air can be efficiently killed in a very short time.
An even more challenging task is to prevent the transmission of other airborne highly infectious
agents that have been used for bioterrorism, such as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) spores. Bacillus
anthracis is a large (1-1.5 µm × 3-10 μm in size), aerobic, gram-positive, spore that has long been
considered a biological warfare agent (22).
Traditional air-conditioner filters based on fiberglass or aluminum (Al) mesh are difficult
to heat or have large pores (about 1 centimeter in size), so they cannot effectively catch and kill
the virus contained in aerosols (generally smaller than 5 µm in size) (23) or other airborne highly
infectious agents, such as anthrax spores. An ideal filter should be self-heated rather than have an
external heat source that would surely cause a very large rise in air temperature, which requires
that the filter itself be electrically conductive. Commercial nickel (Ni) foam is electrically
conductive and mechanically strong and it exhibits good flexibility, properties that have prompted
its wide use in energy conversion and storage applications (24-26). More importantly, Ni foam is
highly porous with randomly located pores that are between 50 and 500 µm in size and that
meander from one side of the foam to the other, resulting in a very large surface area that can
effectively catch particles in the air passing through the filter due to van der Waals forces. The
self-heated filter has the additional advantage that the heating is localized on the Ni foam and heat
transfer to the passing air is minimal due to the short time of contact between the air and the Ni
foam and also the very low thermal conductivity of air (0.02 W m-1 K-1). Therefore, Ni foam may
act as a good filter for catching and killing SARS-CoV-2 or anthrax spores in air-conditioning
systems. However, it is extremely challenging to design such a filter since the resistivity of Ni
foam is too small to achieve heating at a sufficiently high temperature. In order to realize a filter
for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and anthrax spores, here we designed and fabricated a

filter device consisting of folded pieces of Ni foam in multiple compartments connected
electrically in series to efficiently increase the resistance to a manageable level so that a
temperature up to 250 ℃ was able to be achieved, and found that the filter device exhibits almost
100% ability to catch and kill aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 and anthrax spores in air passed once
through the Ni foam heated up to 200 ℃ (temperature optimization will be addressed in a future
study). Our study demonstrates the possibility of applying commercial Ni foam as an airconditioner filter for use in airplanes, airports, hospitals, schools, office buildings, restaurants,
hotels, cruise ships, etc. for 100% removal of SARS-CoV-2 in cycling air, thus slowing the spread
of COVID-19, as well as to prevent transmission of other airborne highly infectious agents like
anthrax spores.
The optical image in Fig. 1A shows that commercial Ni foam has typical metal luster, and
it is highly flexible, so it can be easily molded into different shapes like the accordion folds shown
in Fig. 1B. Due to its high porosity of ≥95% (Fig. S1A), Ni foam also exhibits very high air
permeability, as indicated by the clear observation of light passing through Ni foam under the glare
of a fluorescent lamp (Fig. 1C). The Ni foam pore size is in the range of ~50 to 500 μm, and the
diameter of a single Ni wire is about 65 μm, as seen in the scanning electron microscope (SEM)
images in Figs. 1D, E, respectively. The cross-section SEM (Fig. 1F) and optical (Fig. S1B) images
further reveal that the thickness of the Ni foam is around 1.6 mm and that the Ni wires in the foam
are randomly interconnected with one another, creating a three-dimensional (3D) network
structure with many non-straight channels. Therefore, although the aerosols containing SARSCoV-2 or anthrax spores are smaller than the pores in the Ni foam, it remains highly probable that
the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 and anthrax spores will be captured by the heated Ni wires due to

the meandering path, in contrast to the straight path resulting from the well-organized wires in an
Al mesh. It should be noted that the thickness, pore size, and porosity of Ni foam can all be easily
controlled during the manufacturing process in case different pore sizes are required for different
sizes of viruses or other infectious agents. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. 1G

demonstrates the pure phase of Ni with strong diffraction peaks from the (111), (200), and (220)
planes. We then calculated the electrical resistivity (ρ) of a strip of commercial Ni foam 250 mm
× 10 mm × 1.6 mm in size. From the slope of the current (I)-voltage (V) curve shown in Fig. 1H,
the resistance (R) of the Ni foam is about 0.178 Ω at near room temperature, so the ρ is calculated
to be around 1.42 × 10-5 Ω m, indicating good conductivity. Thus, we can electrically heat a piece
of Ni foam to the required temperature under a certain input power. As shown in Fig. 1I, the
temperature of the Ni foam increases very quickly under increasing input power, and it reaches to
about 119 ℃ when the input power is ~6.6 W.
For use in air conditioners, we must also consider the temperature of the air after it passes
through the heated Ni foam; if the air temperature becomes too high, the heated Ni foam would
not be suitable for large-scale application. To test this, we blew high-purity nitrogen (N2) gas
toward one side of the heated Ni foam and measured the air temperature at different distances away
from its opposite side. The distance between the N2 gas source and the heated Ni foam was ~3.5
cm and the room temperature was about 21.7 ℃. From the results shown in Fig. S2, we can see
that the air temperature decreases very quickly after passing through the heated Ni foam. Even for
the Ni foam with a high temperature of 115.3 ℃, the air temperature is close to room temperature
at 4 cm away. Therefore, we do not need to be concerned about the air temperature becoming too
high after passing through the hot Ni-foam filter. It should be noted that the resulting air
temperature inside ductwork may be slightly higher than in an open environment as we tested.
Due to the very low resistivity of Ni foam, it is not possible to simply use a single piece of
Ni foam as a filter that satisfies both the size requirement for heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems and the U.S. residential voltage requirement (110 V). Considering
the flexibility of Ni foam, we designed a folded structure (Fig. 2A) that exhibits much larger

resistance due to its significantly increased length, ideally addressing both of the above
requirements. In addition, compared with a flat Ni-foam filter, the folded one has two other
advantages. First, as illustrated in Fig. 2B, if the thickness of the Ni foam is 1.6 mm, the distance
for catching and killing viruses or other infectious agents is only 1.6 mm when it is flat. However,
after folding, the effective distance can be much longer, e.g., 10 times that for the flat Ni foam if
considering a bending length of 1.6 cm, since the gaps within the folds retain sufficiently high
temperature to kill viruses and other infectious agents efficiently. It should be noted that the
bending length can be easily controlled, and the longer the bending length, the higher the
temperature. Second, compared to the flat Ni foam with two main sides exposed to the air, the
folded Ni foam has a much smaller surface area exposed to the incoming and outgoing air, which
minimizes the heat loss so that the temperature of the Ni foam increases much more quickly and
can reach a much higher value at the same power consumption. As shown in Fig. 2C, under the
same voltage of 1.0 V, the temperature of the folded Ni foam is 114.9 ℃, which is more than twice
that of the flat Ni foam (55.8 ℃).
Finally, we fabricated filters (Fig. 2D) that each use six pieces of folded Ni foam connected
electrically in series, which effectively increases the total resistance to a manageable level so that
regular-gauge electrical wires can be used. To enhance the efficiency for catching and killing
SARS-CoV-2 and anthrax spores, two filters were parallelly assembled inside a closed device (Fig.
S3). We first studied the I-V and temperature (T)-resistance (R) curves for the filter. As the results
in Fig. 2E show, the Ni foam filter exhibits a typical metal property, in which the resistance
increases with increasing temperature. We further investigated the influence of air flow on the
temperature of the filter, and the results are shown in Fig. 2F. Clearly, with an air flow rate of 10

L min-1, the temperature of the filter shows a slight decrease of about 10 ℃ under the same input
power relative to that without air flow.

The prototype device was tested using aerosolized actual SARS-CoV-2, isolated from
humans, and encouragingly demonstrated 99.8% viral load reduction from upstream to
downstream in the device using a single passthrough when the filter was heated up to 200 ℃
(temperature optimization is currently being studied). As shown in Fig. 3A, by using the median

tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) method for determining viral titer reduction, we confirmed
that, compared to the control without a filter, the heated filter significantly reduced the viral titers
of SARS-CoV-2 through a single pass in this prototype device. A 2.7-fold log reduction was noted
when the Ni-foam filter was heated to ~200 ℃ (Fig. 3B). Note that the reduction shown by the
unheated filters is also effective but the virus is not killed by the unheated filters, which poses a
health threat to those who later change the filters. Therefore, the preferred mode is to heat the filter

so that the virus is completely caught and killed, leaving no potential future concern. After the
successful demonstration of catching and killing almost 100% of the SARS-CoV-2, we designed
similar experiments for testing the elimination of Bacillus anthracis (anthrax spores) in a separate
prototype device. The heated Ni-foam filter was found to catch and kill 99.9% of the anthrax spores
through a single pass in the prototype device (Fig. 3A) and a 3.23-fold log reduction (Fig. 3C) was
achieved when the Ni-foam filter was heated.
The deployment of these novel filter and purification units stands to have a dramatic impact
on both essential workers and the general public in the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as
reducing the risk of exposure to other airborne highly infectious agents, both known and unknown.
With a phased roll-out, beginning with high-priority venues where essential workers are at elevated
risk of exposure (particularly hospitals and healthcare facilities, as well as public transit environs
such as airplanes), this innovative technology will (a) improve the safety for frontline workers in
essential industries by minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, (b) make it possible for nonessential workers to safely return to public work spaces by reducing their risk of exposure, and (c)
allow for the general public to more safely re-engage with their own communities through the
creation of mobile air-purification devices that can be carried on one’s person in order to maintain
clean personal air space. These outcomes will enable resilience in the battle against COVID-19, in
which the front lines are everywhere and rapidly changing. This technology will also provide for
safe bioagent protection gear to eliminate future bioterrorism threats from airborne infectious
agents such as anthrax. The air purification and disinfection system derived from this Ni-foambased heated filter, in conjunction with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, will be a useful addition
in the armamentarium of technologies available to combat future pandemics.
