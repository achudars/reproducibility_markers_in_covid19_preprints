Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive societal
and economic burden. ​Recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, known as B.1.1.7, was first
detected in the United Kingdom and is spreading in several other countries, heightening public
health concern and raising questions as to the resulting effectiveness of vaccines and
therapeutic interventions. ​We and others previously identified host-directed therapies with
antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Less prone to the development of therapy
resistance, host-directed drugs represent promising therapeutic options to combat emerging
viral variants as host genes possess a lower propensity to mutate compared to viral genes.
Here, in the first study of the full-length B.1.1.7 variant virus​, we find two host-directed drugs,
plitidepsin (aplidin; inhibits translation elongation factor eEF1A) and ​ralimetinib (inhibits p38
MAP kinase cascade), as well as remdesivir, to possess similar antiviral activity against both the
early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 variant, evaluated in both human gastrointestinal
and lung epithelial cell lines. We find that plitidepsin is over an order of magnitude more potent
than remdesivir against both viruses. These results highlight the importance of continued
development of host-directed therapeutics to combat current and future coronavirus variant
outbreaks.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread throughout the world causing millions of
deaths and massive societal and economic disruption. In September 2020, a novel variant of
SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the United Kingdom (UK), known as lineage B.1.1.7. This variant
has rapidly spread since November 2020 around the UK and now comprises up to 40% of
COVID-19 new cases in the South East of England (Public Health England, 3rd technical
briefing). Critically, B.1.1.7 has also been detected in numerous countries around the world,
including the United States, Europe, and Canada. Rapidly increasing numbers of B.1.1.7
infections and B.1.1.7 displacement of earlier lineages in the UK ​exemplify constant changes in
circulating viral strains and​ intensify the challenge of containing viral spread.
Sequencing of the B.1.1.7 variant revealed 23 mutations (Rambaut et al., 2020); 17
protein-coding mutations (14 non-synonymous mutations and 3 deletions) and 6 synonymous
mutations (Figure 1). The majority of the protein-coding mutations (8) were observed within the
viral Spike protein, which facilitates viral entry through its interaction with the human ACE2
receptor. Recent reports have suggested that changes in Spike, especially in the receptor
binding domain (RBD), found in new SARS-CoV-2 variants may alter antibody neutralization
sensitivity and possibly vaccine efficacy ​(Collier et al., 2021; ​Reese-Spear et. al, 2021), though
this does not appear to be true for Spike RBD mutation N501Y of the B.1.1.7 variant (Muik et
al., 2021; Rathnasinghe et al, 2021) . The other non-synonymous mutations are located in Nsp3
(3), Nsp6 (1), Orf8 (3), and N (2) protein. The impact of these mutations on viral replication,
transmission and pathogenesis are still not well understood. It is paramount to investigate the
impact of these mutations on the viral life cycle and evaluate the efficacy of previously identified
candidate antiviral treatments for COVID-19 on this new SARS-CoV-2 variant.
Currently, only immunosuppressive interventions such as dexamethasone have been
successful in reducing mortality in severe COVID-19 cases ​(RECOVERY Collaborative Group et
al., 2020)​. There remains an urgent need to test and develop new therapeutic interventions for
clinical treatment that target both viral replication and immunopathology associated with poor
prognosis. Host-directed therapies offer advantages over those directly targeting the virus, as
host genes possess a lower propensity to mutate, and present a higher barrier to viral
adaptation ​involving interactions with essential host co-factors. ​Moreover, druggable host
targets often play roles in other diseases, providing the opportunity to repurpose FDA-approved
drugs and expedite drug development timelines.
Previously, we and others have identified several host factors that directly interact with
SARS-CoV-2 proteins ​(Gordon, Hiatt, et al., 2020; Gordon, Jang, et al., 2020)​, or are impacted
during the course of viral infection ​(Bouhaddou et al., 2020)​. Many of these host factors are
targeted by FDA-approved drugs, investigational new drugs (INDs), or preclinical compounds,
and demonstrated strong antiviral effects. ​For example, we uncovered that the eukaryotic
translation factor eIF4H interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 and identified inhibitors of the
eukaryotic translation machinery as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2, including zotatafin
(inhibitor of eIF4A) and ternatin-4 (inhibitor of eEF1A), a molecular derivative of plitidepsin
(aplidin) ​(Gordon, Jang, et al., 2020)​. Plitidepsin, another eEF1A inhibitor clinically approved in
some countries to treat multiple myeloma ​(Leisch et al., 2019)​, possessed potent antiviral
activity in several cell lines, primary cells, and mouse models (White et al., 2021). Furthermore,
pharmacological inhibition of p38 signaling using ralimetinib and other p38 inhibitors
demonstrated strong antiviral activity, consistent with a marked increase in p38-MAP kinase
activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection ​(Bouhaddou et al., 2020)​. ​Here, we show that plitidepsin,

ralimetinib, and remdesivir (a widely-used broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside analog approved
for use in several countries for treatment of COVID-19) ​possess antiviral efficacy against the
B.1.1.7 virus variant.

Results/Discussion
We first treated intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells with a range of concentrations of plitidepsin,
ralimetinib,
or
remdesivir
prior
to
infection
with

early-lineage
BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 (VIC) or the B.1.1.7 variant (SARS-CoV-2 England/ATACCC
174/2020 isolate) for 24 hours. Plitidepsin potently suppressed viral replication of both
SARS-CoV-2 strains in the nanomolar range, measured by intracellular nucleocapsid protein
positive cells (% N+ cells) by flow cytometry (Fig. 2 A) as well as viral RNA replication measured
by accumulation of genomic and subgenomic E RNA by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2 B). Inhibition of viral
replication was also observed with the p38-targeting inhibitor ralimetinib, with antiviral effects
manifesting at µM drug concentrations (Fig. 2 D and E). We observed no cytotoxicity over the
range of concentrations used for each inhibitor by MTT assay (Fig. 2 C and F). Remdesivir, a
polymerase inhibitor (Kovic, 2020), was used as a positive control and also inhibited replication
of both viruses in a dose-dependent manner in the µM range (Fig.2H), as observed elsewhere

against the early and more recent SARS-CoV-2 lineages at concentrations over an order of
magnitude lower than remdesivir.

To confirm that both host-targeted drugs retained activities in innate-sensing competent cells,
we tested their effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells. This cell
line is highly permissible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while mounting a robust inflammatory innate
immune response (Thorne et al 2020) similar to that observed in primary human airway cells
(Ravindra et al. 2020). We tested the highest non-toxic concentration (>75% cell viability) of
each drug (Fig. 3 A, D, G), 6nM plitidepsin, 6.7µM ralimetinib and 1.1µM remdesivir, against
both SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Similar to what we observed in Caco-2 cells, plitidepsin retained

Taken together, the host-directed drugs plitidepsin and ​ralimetinib, as well as remdesivir
possess antiviral efficacy against both the SARS-CoV-2 early-lineage (VIC) and the B.1.1.7
virus variant. ​Plitidepsin is a clinical-approved therapeutic for multiple myeloma ​(Leisch et al.,
2019) and is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial for treatment of COVID-19 in Spain
(​https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04382066​), due to its antiviral properties in cell culture
and animal models of disease. Consistent with the data above, we have recently shown that

plitidepsin is 27.5-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 early-lineage than remdesivir and
exerts antiviral activity with an IC​50 of approximately 1 nM (White et al., 2021). Plitidepsin is an
antagonist of eEF1A, which is part of the ​eukaryotic translation elongation 1 complex ​and
commonly used by RNA viruses for mRNA translation ​(Li et al., 2013)​. Therefore, treatment with
plitidepsin can successfully interfere with viral replication and might be extended to other viral
infections as a broad-acting antiviral, which would be consistent with previous reports
suggesting that viruses are more susceptible to regulators of proteostasis than their cellular
hosts (Heaton et al., 2016).
Ralimetinib, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, was initially developed for the
treatment of patients with advanced cancer ​(Patnaik et al., 2016; Vergote et al., 2020)​. p38 is
involved in different cellular processes including protein translation, cell cycle, inflammation and
cell death ​(Zarubin & Jiahuai, 2005)​. We previously reported that p38-MAPK is strongly
upregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection and drugs targeting these pathways showed antiviral
activity ​in vitro​, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 relies on p38 activation for viral replication. Similar
findings have been reported for SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, where activation of p38 is
observed during viral infection and inhibition of this pathway can limit viral replication ​(Kono et
al., 2008; Mizutani et al., 2004)​. Moreover, we have demonstrated that blocking p38 activation
significantly reduces cytokine expression ​(Bouhaddou et al., 2020)​, suggesting that targeting
this pathway can be beneficial in severe cases of COVID-19, where immune dysregulation and
tissue damage are associated with poor disease outcome.
While mutations in the Spike protein in the B.1.1.7 variant could potentially contribute to
increased transmissibility, mutations in other viral proteins could also be playing a role. It will be
interesting to determine if and how these mutations alter the SARS-CoV-2-human
protein-protein interaction landscape ​(Gordon, Hiatt, et al., 2020; Gordon, Jang, et al., 2020​).
Also, analysis of cellular changes in the host during infection with the different lineages,
including monitoring alterations in signaling networks via post-translational modifications (i.e.
phosphorylation ​(Bouhaddou et al., 2020) and ubiquitination) as well as host genetic
dependencies ​(Daniloski et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021)​, may help to
understand these and future variants.
This study builds on our prior characterization of host-directed drugs as antivirals for
SARS-CoV-2 infection ​(Gordon, Hiatt, et al., 2020; Gordon, Jang, et al., 2020​; Bouhaddou et al.,
2020; White et al., 2021) and demonstrate the advantages of repurposing drugs that are
clinically approved with known pharmacokinetics and safety profiles, as they can quickly
transition into clinical trials. Furthermore, our data encourage the continued pre-clinical and
clinical development of host-directed antiviral therapies for COVID-19, as targeting essential
host-factors required for viral replication provides a strategy to retain efficacy against emerging
SARS-CoV-2 variants. Importantly, as these drugs inhibit cellular processes commonly
employed by different viruses to ensure infection, these and other host-directed therapies could
be used to rapidly respond to future viral outbreaks.

Methods
Cells culture and drugs
Calu-3 cells (ATCC HTB-55) and Caco-2 cells were a kind gift Dr Dalan Bailey (Pirbright
Institute). VeroE6 cells were provided by NIBSC. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Labtech), 100U/ml
penicillin/streptomycin, with the addition of 1% Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco) and 1% Glutamax for
Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells. All cells were passaged at 80% confluence. For infections, adherent
cells were trypsinized, washed once in fresh medium and passed through a 70 µm cell strainer
before seeding at 0.2x10^6 cells/ml into tissue-culture plates. Calu-3 cells were grown to
60-80% confluence prior to infection as described previously (Thorne et al 2020). Plitidepsin
(aplidin) (PharmaMar), ralimetinib (SelleckChem), remdesivir (SelleckChem) were reconstituted
in sterile DMSO.
Viruses
SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 (NIBSC) and SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (SARS
CoV 2 England/ATACCC 174/2020) strain were propagated by infecting Caco-2 cells at MOI
0.01 TCID50/cell, in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS at 37°C. Virus was harvested at 72
hours post infection (hpi) and clarified by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to
remove any cellular debris. Virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Virus titres were
determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) on Vero.E6 cells. In brief, 96 well
plates were seeded at 1x10^4 cells/well in 100 µl. Eight ten-fold serial dilutions of each virus
stock or supernatant were prepared and 50 µl added to 4 replicate wells. Cytopathic effect
(CPE) was scored at 5 days post infection, and TCID50/ml was calculated using the Reed &
Muench method ​(Reed & Muench, 1938)​, and an Excel spreadsheet created by Dr. Brett D.
Lindenbach was used for calculating TCID50/mL values ​(Lindenbach, 2009)​.
Infection and drug assays
Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells were pre-treated with remdesivir, plitidepsin or ralimetinib at the
indicated concentrations or DMSO control at an equivalent dilution for 2 h before SARS-CoV-2
infection. Caco-2 cells were infected at 4.8x10^3 E copies per cell, equivalent to an MOI of 0.04
TCID50 per cell (as titred on Vero.E6), and Calu-3 cells were infected at 1.2x10^3 E copies per
cell, equivalent to an MOI of 0.01 TCID50 per cell, in the presence of the indicated inhibitor
concentrations, and incubated for 2h at 37 °C. After 2h, the inoculum was removed and fresh
culture medium was added containing the inhibitors, which were maintained throughout
infection. Cells were harvested after 24h for analysis and viral infection measured by
quantification of E genomic and subgenomic RNA copies by RT-qPCR and intracellular
detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein by flow cytometry. Tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay was
performed to verify cell viability. 10 % v/v MTT was added to the cell media and cells were
incubated for 2 h at 37ºC. Cells were lysed with 10% SDS, 0.01M HCl and the formation of
purple formazan was measured at 620nm.
RT-qPCR
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kits (Qiagen) and residual genomic DNA was removed
from RNA samples by on-column DNAse I treatment (Qiagen). Both steps were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III with
random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). RT-qPCR was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master
Mix (Thermo Fisher) for host gene expression or TaqMan Master mix (Thermo Fisher) for viral
RNA quantification, and reactions performed on the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR systems
(Thermo Fisher). Viral RNA copies were deduced by a standard curve, using primers and a

Flow cytometry
For flow cytometry analysis, adherent cells were recovered by trypsinization and washed in PBS
with 2mM EDTA (PBS/EDTA). Cells were stained with fixable Zombie UV Live/Dead dye
(Biolegend) for 6 min at room temperature. Excess stain was quenched with
FBS-complemented DMEM. Unbound antibody was washed off thoroughly and cells were fixed
in 4% PFA prior to intracellular staining. For intracellular detection of SARS-CoV-2
nucleoprotein, cells were permeabilized for 15 min with Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer
(BioLegend). Cells were then incubated with 1μg/ml CR3009 SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive
antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Laura McCoy) in permeabilization buffer for 30 min at room
temperature, washed once and incubated with secondary Alexa Fluor 488-Donkey-anti-Human
IgG (Jackson Labs). All samples were acquired on a BD Fortessa X20 using BD FACSDiva
software. Data was analyzed using FlowJo v10 (Tree Star).
