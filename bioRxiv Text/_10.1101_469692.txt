Summary

11

Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is the controlled slippage of the translating ribosome to an

12

alternative frame. This tightly regulated process is widely employed by human viruses such as HIV

13

and SARS coronavirus and is critical for their life cycle and virulence. It is also utilized from yeast to

14

human to implement a feedback control mechanism to regulate polyamine levels. Here, we developed

15

a high-throughput, fluorescence-based approach to assess the frameshifting potential of a sequence.

16

We designed and tested >12,000 sequences based on 15 viral and human frameshifting events,

17

allowing us to elucidate the rules governing ribosomal frameshifting in a systematic way and to

18

discover novel regulatory inputs based on amino acid properties and tRNA availability. We assessed

19

the natural variation in HIV gag-pol frameshifting rates by testing >500 clinical isolates and identified

20

subtype-specific differences as well as associations between viral load in patients and the optimality

21

of gag-pol frameshifting rates. We further devised computational models that accurately predict

22

frameshifting potential (up to auROC=0.93) and frameshifting rates (up to Pearson r=0.81) of novel

23

variants, including subtle differences between HIV clinical isolates (r=0.60). Taken together, this

24

systematic approach can contribute to the development of antiviral agents acting on programmed

25

ribosomal frameshifting.

Introduction

27

Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), i.e. controlled slippage of the ribosome, is a mechanism

28

by which two proteins with alternative C termini can be generated from the same mRNA. It allows for

29

an expansion of the proteome but also constitutes an additional regulatory layer to fine-tune gene

30

expression (Advani and Dinman, 2016; Dinman, 2012; Ketteler, 2012). This mechanism is widespread

31

and indispensable in viruses, which often utilize controlled slippage of the ribosome to an alternative

32

frame to regulate the production of key enzymes, such as in the case of the gag-pol frameshift in HIV

33

and other retroviruses. Utilizing alternative frames increases the amount of genetic information that

34

can be encoded in a given sequence and constitutes another level of gene regulation, which might

35

explain why especially RNA viruses – with their compact genomes and lack of regulation of their

36

genes on the transcriptional level - utilize PRF for crucial regulatory switches (Firth and Brierley,

37

2012). The importance of maintaining the stoichiometry between structural proteins encoded by the

38

gag gene and enzymes encoded by the pol gene for viral replicative success make the gag-pol

39

frameshifting event a promising antiviral drug target (Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012; Hung et al., 1998).

40

Cases of functionally important programmed frameshifting have also been discovered in humans

41

(Belew et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2007; Ivanov et al., 1998; Matsufuji et al., 1995; Rom and Kahana,

42

1994; Tosaka et al., 2000; Wills et al., 2006). Discovering PRF events in the human genome has been

43

hampered by the limited amenability of PRF to proteome-wide methods due to the generally low

44

abundance of the frameshifted protein relative to the canonical protein or inherent instability of the

45

frameshifting product. Most human cases known to date were found serendipitously or through

46

homologous genes. A striking example of regulatory conservation is the case of ornithine

47

decarboxylase antizyme (OAZ), which is produced through polyamine-stimulated +1 frameshifting

48

and inhibits polyamine production (Matsufuji et al., 1995; Rom and Kahana, 1994). This negative

49

feedback loop is used by virtually all organisms from yeast to humans to control polyamine levels

50

(Ivanov et al., 2000), attesting to the evolutionary success of PRF as a regulatory mechanism.

51

Fameshifting is generally believed to happen at defined positions consisting of a slippery sequence

52

and a downstream roadblock, most commonly a stable secondary RNA structure like a pseudoknot

53

or an extensive stem-loop structure (Caliskan et al., 2015; Dinman, 2012). Most presently known -1

54

slippery sites follow the pattern X XXY YYZ, with the shift happening from codons XXY and YYZ to

55

XXX and YYY. Some known slippery sites in -1 PRF show divergence from this pattern, e.g. in the

56

NSA2 gene of west nile virus with the slippery site sequence UCCUUUU (Firth and Atkins, 2009;

57

Melian et al., 2010). At +1 frameshifting sites like OAZ ribosomal translocation happens at a very

58

distinct motif (e.g. UCCUGA). Many case studies have contributed to an understanding of the

59

molecular events happening during frameshifting (e.g. Belew et al., 2014; Caliskan et al., 2015; Kurian

60

et al., 2011; Ritchie et al., 2017; Tholstrup et al., 2012), but the general, overarching regulatory

61

principles that determine if and to what extent PRF occurs remain largely unknown.

62

Here, we developed a massively parallel reporter assay that allows for high-throughput quantification

63

of ribosomal frameshifting in human cells. We designed and tested 13,390 oligonucleotides containing

64

rationally designed variants of known frameshifting signals. We systematically deciphered

65

determinants of PRF efficiency across frameshifting events and assayed natural variation in HIV gag-

66

pol frameshifting, providing the first systematic large-scale investigation of ribosomal frameshifting.

69

A massively parallel reporter assay for programmed ribosomal frameshifting

70

To assay PRF in a comprehensive manner we designed a synthetic oligonucleotide library containing

71

12809 variants with systematic sequence manipulations of previously reported PRF sites

72

(Supplementary Data 1, “main set”) and 581 sequences of gag-pol frameshifting sites in HIV clinical

73

isolates (collated from http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/, see Methods for selection criteria of HIV variants) (Fig

74

1A).

75

The oligonucleotides comprising library-specific common primers, a unique barcode and a 162 nt long

76

variable region containing a potential frameshifting site (Fig 1A, bottom) were synthesized on an

77

Agilent microarray, amplified and cloned in between mcherry and gfp coding sequences such that the

78

gfp coding frame was shifted by +1 or -1 relative to the original, mCherry-encoding frame (Fig 1B). If

79

the corresponding frameshift occurs, GFP is made into protein, and GFP fluorescence intensity thus

80

serves as a measure for frameshifting efficiency. We introduced this construct in the AAVS1 locus in

81

the human K562 cell line using zinc finger nucleases, such that every cell has one frameshifting

82

reporter construct from the library and all the variants have the same genomic environment (Methods).

83

For both, the -1 and +1 reporter libraries, we selected a narrow mCherry-positive population to

84

minimize effects coming from the influence of the variable region on overall expression levels (Fig

85

S1AB, Methods). We sorted this population corresponding to a single integration of the reporter

86

transgene using flow cytometry into 16 bins according to their GFP fluorescence intensity (Fig S1CD)

87

and sequenced genomic DNA from all the bins to determine the distribution of each variant across

88

bins. We previously demonstrated that similar approaches are highly accurate and reproducible (Mikl

89

et al., 2019; Vainberg Slutskin et al., 2018; Weingarten-Gabbay et al., 2016, 2019), and the consistent

90

bin profiles for many barcode control groups with identical variable region (Fig S1E, Methods)

91

corroborate the low technical noise we are able to achieve.

92

The distribution of mean GFP expression of all library variants showed a clear peak corresponding to

93

background green fluorescence (Fig S2AB). We set the lowest mean GFP fluorescence we observed

94

to 0% and the highest – coming from variants with GFP in frame with mCherry – to 100%. Accordingly,

95

we assigned a percentage to every variant that passed filtering for read number, bin profile and

frameshifting efficiencies across PRF events. We thereby obtained measurements for 8972 (67%)

and 5922 (44%) sequences cloned into the -1 PRF and +1 PRF reporter, respectively.

102

To test the possibility that the signal in our assay comes from internal translation initiation downstream

103

of mCherry (which might lead to GFP expression independently of ribosomal frameshifting in between

104

the mCherry and gfp coding region) we cloned our library in a modified reporter construct containing

105

a stop codon after the mCherry coding region (Fig S2C top). GFP fluorescence coming from a

106

frameshifting event would in this case be lost. We subjected this library to the same experimental

107

pipeline and obtained green fluorescence measurements for 10561 variants (79% of the library, 82%

108

and 83% of variants for which we obtained -1 and +1 PRF readouts, resp.; Fig S2C). Green

109

fluorescence was almost exclusively at background levels, showing that the overwhelming majority of

110

tested sequences cannot drive GFP expression on their own.

111

Another potential source of GFP expression is the removal of cryptic introns in the variable region that

112

would lead to gfp being in frame with mCherry in the resulting mature mRNA. To test if this is a source

113

of false positives in our assay, we performed RNA sequencing on the whole library, covering the entire

114

variable region and its surroundings (Fig S2D). We mapped the full length reads to the library variants

115

to detect splicing events and obtained an RNA readout (at least 100 reads mapped) for 10666 variants

116

(80% of the library, 94% of the variants with readout in the -1 frame and 96% of the variants with

117

readout in the +1 frame). Even without any filtering, only 2.95% of the variants showed gaps in the

118

mapping of at least 20 nt which could represent events of cryptic splicing (Fig S2EF; 0.95% introducing

119

a shift to frame +1 and 0.64% to frame -1). Missing stretches can also come from synthesis or cloning

120

errors (and are therefore present and filtered out on the DNA level. Considering only those cases that

121

had a potential (degenerate, cryptic) donor or acceptor splice site in the area of the gap further

122

reduced the fraction of variants for which we cannot rule out a relevant splicing event to 36 (0.55%;

123

Fig S2EF, red; 0.22% introducing a shift to frame +1 and 0.14% to frame -1). Importantly, even for

124

these cases there was no correlation between the fraction of potentially spliced reads and GFP

125

expression (Pearson r=0.01, p=0.21 for -1 PRF and r=0.02, p=0.09 for +1 PRF), indicating that cryptic

126

splicing events do not constitute a common source for false positive signal in our assay.

127

During oligonucleotide synthesis errors can occur that can introduce a point mutation or an

128

insertion/deletion. For assaying ribosomal frameshifting, especially the latter type would be

129

detrimental, and therefore we perform full-length DNA sequencing in our assay and consider only

130

reads that exhibit perfect alignment along the length of the variable region covered by sequencing

131

reads (approximately 20 nt in the center of the variable region cannot be covered due to the read

132

length (150 nt from either side)). These synthesis errors, however, also further enrich our synthetic

133

library, as they add additional variants to the collection of sequences tested. Especially single

134

nucleotide deletions or insertions constitute a great internal control, as they differ only in one position

135

from the designed variant. Cases where we obtained enough reads (after filtering, Methods) for the

136

intended variant (Fig S2G top, “wild-type”), a single nucleotide deletion abolishing the signal coming

137

from -1 PRF (Fig S2G middle) and a single nucleotide insertion leading to gfp being in frame (Fig S2G

138

bottom) constitute a proof of principle. They also provide additional evidence that the signal that we

139

measure stems from a (reading frame-sensitive) ribosomal frameshifting event. Looking at the

140

distribution of all single nucleotide deletion and insertion variants from the library reveals the expected

141

peaks at minimal and maximal GFP expression (Fig Fig S2HI), with a small group of variants being

142

misclassified due to the fact that our reads cover only approximately 90% of the variable region.

143

Based on the distribution of all library variants with a stop codon cassette integrated immediately after

144

the mcherry coding sequence we assigned a noise threshold (95th percentile of the stop-vector library

145

distribution, corresponding to 1.3% of the maximal GFP fluorescence; Fig S2C) imposed by

146

autofluorescence of the cells. The contribution of autofluorescence coming from cellular components

147

and metabolites such as NADH and flavins is negligible when methods for signal amplification are

148

used (e.g. in Luciferase assays commonly used for the quantification of PRF). It does, however,

149

constitute a limitation for detection of GFP-fusion proteins made from a single gene copy and present

150

at low copy number in the cell owing to the fact that the PRF event responsible for its expression

151

happens in only a few percent of translation events. This entails a higher detection limit of our assay

152

compared to for example Luciferase assays, which is a necessary compromise to enable high-

153

throughput testing.

154

Based on the distribution of GFP intensities of variants with a mutation leading to GFP being in frame

155

with mCherry (Fig S2I) we also excluded variants exhibiting a dominant peak with mean GFP

156

fluorescence above 212 (25% of maximal GFP fluorescence). This value corresponds to the 5th

157

percentile of the distribution of variants with a single nucleotide insertion (above threshold). We

158

thereby aim to rule out biases stemming from DNA frameshifts occurring as synthesis or cloning errors

159

that our mapping strategy might have missed (Methods).

160

We tested previously reported frameshifting sites (with or without experimental validation,

161

Supplementary Data 1, based on Moon et al., 2007 and our own survey of the literature) with multiple

162

different barcodes in our assay and could reproducibly detect GFP fluorescence in the expected frame

163

for many of the previously reported PRF events (Fig 1CD, Fig S3A-D). For example, the previously

164

reported PRF sites in HIV-1 (Jacks et al., 1988a), SARS coronavirus (Thiel et al., 2003), HERV-K10

165

(Ono et al., 1986; Wang et al., 2002), simian retrovirus (ten Dam et al., 1994), SIVmac239

166

(Marcheschi et al., 2007; Pollom et al., 2013), human T cell lymphotropic virus (Nam et al., 1993) and

167

OAZ (Matsufuji et al., 1995; Rom and Kahana, 1994) yielded a fluorescent signal between 1.4% and

168

18% of maximal GFP fluorescence detected in our assay. These values do not necessarily denote

169

the percentage of translation events, in which frameshifting happens, in absolute terms, and are not

170

directly comparable with percentages reported in other studies.

171

PRF events tested in our assay typically gave a signal over threshold only in either the -1 or +1 PRF

172

reporter, but not in both (Fig 1E). In cases where the native sequence contained stop codons in any

173

frame downstream of the frameshifting site, we also tested variants with all stop codons mutated

174

(Methods). These typically either did not affect or led to a substantially reduced frameshifting signal

175

(Fig S4A). Moving the slippery site by one to three nucleotides typically abolished the signal, e.g. in

176

the case of SARS (Fig S4B, Methods).

177

Some previously reported PRF events failed to yield a signal above threshold in our assay. Several

178

reasons like sensitivity to the larger context of the reporter construct or a general effect of the tested

179

sequence on expression could be possible explanations. In the case of the PRF site in Rous sarcoma

180

virus (Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Fig S4C), a construct containing 124 nt of sequence downstream to

181

the position of frameshifting was able to induce frameshifting, but shorter versions were not (Jacks et

182

al., 1988b). A sequence motif (termed PK4) at the end of this downstream region was shown to be

183

important for maintaining wild-type frameshifting ability, potentially by creating a pseudoknot-like

184

structure through basepairing with a complementary sequence in the loop of the main stem-loop

185

structure (Marczinke et al., 1998; Nikolic et al., 2012). Our construct (including 120 nt of downstream

186

sequence) does contain the PK4 motif, but it is located at the very 3’ end of the native sequence

187

included in the reporter construct. The sequence context of PK4 was shown to be important for proper

188

folding (Marczinke et al., 1998), and therefore the specific context created by our reporter construct

189

might explain the lack of signal.

190

We also failed to detect a frameshifting signal for CCR5 (Belew et al., 2014; Fig S4C). In addition to

191

potential sensitivity to the larger context of the reporter construct and a specific miRNA that is required

192

for maximal frameshifting efficiency (Belew et al., 2014), the lack of signal might be due to a potential

193

effect of the PRF site on overall expression levels on the RNA or protein level, as has been suggested

194

for cellular frameshifting sites in general (Advani and Dinman, 2016). We select for a narrow range of

195

mCherry levels and therefore expression levels (Methods, Fig S1AB), which leads to filtering out

196

variants that strongly affect overall expression levels. In the case of CCR5 only 29% of variants with

197

the wild-type sequence passed filtering (Fig S4D; as opposed to 45-97% for other PRF events), which

198

could hint at an effect of the included sequence on expression at the RNA or protein level. Estimating

199

steady state RNA levels did not show systematic differences between PRF events yielding a signal

200

above threshold in our assay and those that failed to do so (Fig S4E), but indicated that specifically

201

RNA from variants containing the PRRSV PRF site was present at reduced levels.

202

Some of the frameshifting signals tested showed variability between variants with identical variants,

203

but different barcodes (Fig S4C, right). In the case of west nile virus, the majority of sequences tested

204

resulted in a fluorescent signal above threshold, leading to it being classified as “frameshifting” in our

205

assay (p=0.027 for the difference between wild-type and stop control; Fig 1C); in the case of PEG10

206

(Clark et al., 2007; Manktelow et al., 2005) the majority of sequences failed to yield a signal (after

207

filtering). This points at an instability of the signal in this context, and therefore our assay might not be

208

suitable for investigating these specific events. PEG10 is thought to have a relatively extensive

209

downstream region necessary for frameshifting (~80 nt according to estimates from in vitro testing of

210

truncated regions (Manktelow et al., 2005)). Our library includes 120 nt of downstream sequence, but

211

the more extensive the downstream sequence, the higher the sensibility to the context and

212

experimental conditions might be. This is in line with our observation for SARS and HERV-K10, for

213

example (see below). In addition, the required context might be larger in the in vivo situation compared

214

to in vitro.

215

This instability of the signal might be affected by small sequence changes: For some library

216

sequences measurements of a large number of variants with sequence alterations introduced during

217

synthesis and cloning are available. In the case of PEG10, all the synthesis variants containing a

218

specific mutation (C-to-G at position 7 after the slippery site) show a -1 PRF signal above background

219

(Fig S4F). Likewise, a fraction of the designed sequence alterations introduced in the PEG10 context

220

triggered frameshifting (Fig S4G), especially mutations in the upstream region (Fig S4G left). This

221

shows that minimal sequence changes can have far-reaching (and consistent) consequences for the

222

potential of a sequence to yield a frameshifting signal in the context of our high-throughput assay and

223

probably in any experimental setup.

224
225

Slippery sites are optimized for the respective frameshifting event

226

While previous investigations of frameshifting focused on individual examples, we aimed to identify

227

commonalities and differences between frameshifting sites. To this end we introduced systematic

228

sequence alterations (such as point mutations, synonymous substitutions, altering and mimicking

229

endogenous secondary structure, etc.; Fig 1A; Methods) in all contexts and measured the effect on

230

frameshifting in large scale using our FACS based assay. Individual PRF events exhibited

231

characteristic sensitivities to sequence alterations (Fig 2A). The HIV-1 gag-pol PRF site (Jacks et al.,

232

1988a) was particularly sensitive to changes in or immediately around the slippery site (any sequence

233

change in this region led to a median PRF signal of 25% of the wild-type), while changes in the

234

upstream or downstream region led to PRF signal of – on average – 97% (upstream) and 70%

235

(downstream; Fig 2A, Fig S5A) of the corresponding wild-type. A similar pattern could be observed

236

for SIVmac239. The HERV-K10 (Ono et al., 1986; Wang et al., 2002), SARS (Thiel et al., 2003) and

237

SRV1 (ten Dam et al., 1994) PRF sites were highly sensitive to changes in both the slippery site and

238

the downstream region and in the case of HERV-K10 and SRV1 also showed a significant (p=0.0004

239

and 0.0023, resp.; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) reduction following changes in the upstream region (Fig

240

2A, Fig S5B). It is noteworthy that the clustering of effects (although done on percent of wild-type PRF

242

SARS and SRV1) showing the highest and broadest sensitivity to sequence alterations.

243

Comparing per position the median PRF signal for variants in which this position was changed reveals

244

a sensitivity profile around the PRF site (Fig 2B, Fig S5C), recapitulating these context specific

245

characteristics. Across all -1 PRF events tested positive in our assay, not only mutations at the

246

slippery site (marked in grey) and downstream of it, but also mutations immediately upstream of the

247

slippery site negatively affect PRF efficiency. Other -1 PRF events reported in the literature, but not

yielding a signal above background in our assay, tend to show substantially increased signal upon

249

mutations in the areas upstream (PEG10) and downstream (PEG10, CCR5, Rous sarcoma virus) of

250

the slippery site (Fig S5D). Like the specific examples of frameshifting PEG10 variants described

251

above (Fig S4EF), this points at a strong sensitivity of these PRF events to the context in which they

252

are tested.

253

Most single point mutations within the slippery sequence abrogated frameshifting and resulted in

254

green fluorescence at background levels, both for -1 and +1 frameshifting sites (Fig 2C, Fig S5E),

255

demonstrating that we indeed measure frameshifting at the expected site. Replacing the last position

256

in the canonical slippery site X XXY YYZ had – on average – a less severe effect on PRF efficiency,

257

due to the fact that it is the wobble position in the original frame and therefore has larger flexibility (Fig

258

2C). In high efficiency PRF sites also this position showed strong and PRF site-specific preferences:

259

In the case of SRV1 (GGGAAAC) replacing the Z position with other options than the endogenous C

260

led to a drastic decrease (U, A) or complete loss (G) of -1 PRF signal (Fig S4E), while in the case of

261

SARS (UUUAAAU) all other nucleotides apart from the endogenous U at the Z position almost

262

completely abolished the signal. To determine whether there is a universally optimal slippery site, we

263

replaced the slippery sequence in our set of -1 PRF events with all possible variations of the pattern

264

XXXYYYZ (Fig 2D, Fig S4F). This revealed preferences for specific combinations common in known

265

PRF sites (Fig 2D), like UUUUUUZ (HIV, SIVmac239) and XXXAAAC (HERV-K10, HTLV, PEG10,

266

SARS), but no universally optimal combination of bases that would lead to maximal frameshifting

267

efficiency and consequently GFP fluorescence across contexts (Fig S5F). Notably, PRF sites showed

268

a high degree of optimization when it comes to the identity of the bases, with any substitution (although

269

preserving the canonical XXXYYYZ pattern) typically leading to a more or less severe drop in PRF

270

signal (Fig 2E, Fig S5EF).

271

Replacing the first or second codon of the OAZ slippery site (UCC UGA) revealed a very limited

272

tolerance to sequence alterations, consistent with earlier results (Matsufuji et al., 1995). Replacing

273

the second codon (UGA), the only variants leading to a +1 PRF signal over background where the

274

other two stop codons (UAA and UAG; Fig 2F, right), reaching approximately 50% of wild-type

275

frameshifting rates, confirming that a translation termination signal is required for frameshifting (Rom

276

and Kahana, 1994). At the first codon position, UUU was the only codon leading to +1 PRF signal

277

similar to wild-type (Fig 2F, left), maybe due to the creation of a stretch of four Us and thereby

278

facilitating re-pairing of the tRNA in the +1 frame. Indeed, UUU is the second most widely used codon

279

found in that position in the OAZ frameshifting site in other species, e.g. certain funghi and nematodes

280

(Ivanov and Atkins, 2007).

281

Some reported -1 PRF sites deviate from the canonical slippery site pattern (XXXYYYZ). To test the

282

ability of the alternative patterns to induce frameshifting across sequence contexts we replaced the

283

slippery site in a set of PRF events with all combinations of nucleotides following the pattern found in

284

west nile virus (XYYZZZZ, Fig 2G; Melian et al., 2014; Moomau et al., 2016). In general, the ability of

285

alternative slippery site patterns to cause frameshifting was limited to their native sequence contexts.

286

In this context, however, several different nucleotide combinations following the respective pattern

287

were tolerated. The only exception to this rule was human T-lymphotropic virus (Fig 2G, endogenous

288

slippery site UUUAAAC), which gave a robust -1 PRF signal corresponding to wild-type levels across

289

many variants following the (west nile virus) pattern XYYZZZZ. In summary, our data suggest that in

290

most cases a slippery site not following the canonical pattern requires a specific sequence context in

291

order to trigger frameshifting, in accordance with earlier results comparing west nile virus strains with

292

canonical or non-canonical slippery sites (Moomau et al., 2016).

293
294

Downstream sequence and structure affect PRF efficiency in a context-dependent manner

295

The region downstream of the slippery site is thought to be crucial for PRF, typically because it creates

296

a roadblock for the translating ribosome by folding into a stable secondary structure like a hairpin or

297

a pseudoknot (Brierley and Pennell, 2001; Brierley et al., 1989; Parkin et al., 1992; Tu et al., 1992).

298

To get an estimate of the size of the relevant downstream region in different PRF events, we replaced

299

native regions with a constant sequence, leaving stretches of different length after the slippery site

300

unchanged (Fig 3A, top; Methods). While in the case of SARS almost the entire downstream region

301

included in our reporter construct (120 nt) was crucial for frameshifting, in the HIV and SIVmac239

302

PRF sites only a comparatively small region (<24 nt) was required to achieve PRF signal >50% of

303

wild type (Fig 3B). The shortness of the necessary downstream sequence in these cases was striking,

304

but in line with earlier evidence demonstrating that base pairing at the first 3-4 positions of the HIV

305

downstream stem-loop structure shows the strongest association with PRF efficiency (Mouzakis et

306

al., 2013).

307

To identify specific positions crucial for PRF we performed scanning mutagenesis of regions ranging

308

from 7 to 36 nt downstream of the slippery site (Fig 3A, bottom). This revealed large differences in

309

the fraction of relevant downstream positions (Fig 3C), ranging from 6% of single point mutations

310

reducing -1 PRF efficiency by more than half in the case of SIVmac239 to 53% in the case of SARS

311

(46% for +1 PRF at the OAZ1 site). The HIV gag-pol PRF site (among others) shows remarkable

312

resilience to point mutations (Fig 3C, Fig S6A), in line with the high degree of genetic variability in

313

HIV. Specific mutations affecting PRF typically disrupt base-pairing (e.g. positions 11, 12, 29 and 30

314

in HIV and positions 8-13 and 18-26 in SRV1; Fig S6A) and therefore change the (predicted)

315

secondary structure. In the case of HIV only mutations in the middle of the stem are detrimental,

316

suggesting that a reduced stem is still able to drive PRF at wild-type levels, and only forcing a

317

complete change in the structure affects frameshifting.

319

We tested if we can detect these mutational signatures of secondary structure also on the scale of

320

the entire library and compared the median PRF signal between all variants of a PRF event, in which

321

this position is predicted to be paired or unpaired (Fig 3D). Preferences for downstream positions to

322

be paired or unpaired reveal the architecture of structural elements downstream of the PRF site.

323

Groups of frameshifting events show remarkable concordance between these preferences (e.g. HIV

324

and SARS, HERV-K10 and SRV1), but length and position of the optimal downstream secondary

325

structures differ between groups (Fig 3D, upper vs. lower panel).

326

Replacing the endogenous downstream region with elements that have different primary sequence,

327

but are predicted to fold into the same secondary structure (Fig 3E, top) abolished frameshifting in

328

most cases, regardless of whether pseudoknots were included or not (Vienna RNA vs. pKiss to

329

determine the structure that served as the input for antaRNA (Kleinkauf et al., 2015a, 2015b); Fig 3F).

330

Introducing variants of the SRV1 and the HIV downstream structure (without preserving the original

331

sequence, Fig 3E, bottom; Methods) had the ability to trigger frameshifting in some cases (Fig 3G),

332

including ones where the wild-type sequence did not yield a frameshifting signal in the context of our

333

assay (CCR5 and PEG10). Strikingly, events associated with higher wild-type frameshifting rates

334

could not be “rescued” by introducing a secondary structure variant from a different PRF event (Fig

335

3H), indicating that more efficient frameshifting sites like SARS seem to be highly optimized, but less

336

tolerant to changes in the type of downstream secondary structure.

337

Changes in secondary structure (minimum free energy) induced by point mutations downstream of

338

the slippery site showed strong correlation with most, but not all frameshifting events (Fig 3I left

339

column, Fig S7 left panels). Surprisingly, this correlation between predicted minimum free energy of

340

secondary structure variants of the native downstream region and GFP fluorescence of -1 PRF

341

reporters was lost when replacing the downstream region with structural variants (more) different from

342

the native sequence (Fig 3I middle column, Fig S7 middle panels; these structures generally had the

343

potential to induce frameshifting in certain contexts; Fig 3G). Likewise when testing for correlation

344

across all variants of a PRF site (Fig 3I right column, Fig S7 right panels), there was no association

345

of lower minimum free energy (MFE) with higher PRF rates.

346

Many stimulatory downstream sequences are thought to fold into a pseudoknot (e.g. SRV-1 (ten Dam

347

et al., 1994; Du et al., 1997), west nile virus (Firth and Atkins, 2009) and coronaviruses (Brierley et

348

al., 1989; Plant et al., 2005)), a more complex folding pattern that is not covered by many secondary

349

structure predictions including the Vienna RNA package (Hofacker et al., 2004; Lorenz et al., 2011).

350

We therefore repeated the analyses using pKiss (Janssen and Giegerich, 2015), an algorithm that

351

can detect certain classes of pseudoknots (see Supplementary Data 2 for pKiss-predicted structures

352

of library variants with systematic sequence changes in the downstream region). MFE calculated

353

using Vienna RNAfold and pKiss, respectively, show good correlation (Fig S6B). We repeated the

354

above analysis and observed the same pattern as with RNAfold, namely widespread association

355

between secondary structure (low MFE) and higher PRF signal for small deviations from the native

356

sequence (Fig 3J left column, Fig S8 left panels), but not otherwise (Fig 3J middle and right column,

357

Fig S8 middle and right panels). This is in line with the fact that we do not see systematic differences

358

between PRF events whose downstream sequence was shown to fold into a hairpin structure (e.g.

359

HIV-1 (Parkin et al., 1992; Staple and Butcher, 2003) and SIVmac239 (Marcheschi et al., 2007)) or a

360

pseudoknot (e.g. SRV-1 (ten Dam et al., 1994; Du et al., 1997) and SARS (Brierley et al., 1989; Plant

361

et al., 2005)).

362

This observation does not imply a (counterintuitive) tendency for more open secondary structure to

363

promote frameshifting. As we do not find evidence for an effect of MFE on overall RNA levels (Fig S7,

364

S8, S9; e.g. through triggering No-Go decay (Belew et al., 2011)), we suggest that this reflects a

365

strong preference for downstream secondary structure rigidity to be close to that of the wild-type

366

sequence (in particular for SARS, SRV1 and HERV-K10, Fig S7, S8, right panels). Although present

367

secondary structure prediction algorithms might not be sufficiently accurate for this task, especially in

368

the case of pseudoknots, our results support a view according to which not only the structure, but also

369

the sequence downstream of a slippery site is critical for triggering frameshifting.

370
371

Additional regulatory elements contribute to PRF

372

The distance between the slippery site and the downstream secondary structure has been shown to

373

be important for efficient frameshifting (Brierley et al., 1989; Kollmus et al., 1994; Lin et al., 2012),

374

probably to position the paused ribosome at the slippery site (Brierley and Pennell, 2001). To test

375

whether this is generally true or if there are PRF event-specific differences, we introduced between

376

one and nine nucleotides from different constant sequences or deleted between one and six, mutating

377

downstream stop codons as required (Fig 4A top). Most insertions or deletions led to substantially

378

reduced frameshifting signal (Fig 4B), no matter what the context and if the original downstream

379

coding frame was preserved or not, suggesting that the exact position of the downstream regulatory

380

elements is important across PRF events. This is in contrast to an earlier study reporting unchanged

381

or even dramatically increased -1 frameshifting efficiency at the HIV site upon reducing spacer

382

lengths, which the authors attribute to a change in local secondary structure triggered by the specific

383

deletion introduced in their construct (Mouzakis et al., 2013). Overall, our results are in line with the

384

regulatory elements being in optimal distance from one another and the downstream secondary

385

structure creating a roadblock that causes the ribosome to pause exactly at the slippery site (Brierley

386

and Pennell, 2001; Tu et al., 1992).

387

While mutations in the slippery site and the downstream region typically have a negative effect on

388

frameshifting efficiency (Fig 2A), changes in the upstream region have the potential to lead to higher

sites, probably creating a balance to ensure that frameshift promoting signals like a rigid downstream

392

secondary structure do not lead to a complete inhibition of translation and potentially degradation of

393

the mRNA. To test for effects of upstream secondary structure on PRF, we replaced the region

394

upstream of the slippery site with a recoded version (encoding the same amino acid sequence), a

395

sequence predicted to fold into the same secondary structure as the wild-type, a sequence lacking

396

any strong predictable secondary structure or a hairpin at the 5’ or 3’ end. Specifically in the case of

397

PEG10, a hairpin at the 5’ end of the upstream region or a lack of secondary structure resulted in a

398

frameshifting signal above threshold (2-8% GFP fluorescence; Fig 4C) as opposed to the wild-type

399

sequence (Fig 1C, see our discussion of potential reasons above).

400

The upstream region of OAZ1 is thought to harbor signals enhancing frameshifting (cf. Ivanov et al.,

401

2006). By testing variants in which increasing portions of the upstream region have been replaced

402

with constant sequences, we find these PRF-promoting signals to be located in the 20 nucleotides

403

before the slippery site (Fig 4D, decrease of PRF signal on average to 31.3% of wild-type, p=0.0077,

404

Wilcoxon signed-rank test, effect on region further upstream not significant). In contrast to the other -

405

1 PRF sites, HIV frameshifting rates show an increase upon mutation of the corresponding upstream

406

region (Fig 4D, mean increase of PRF signal to 128.2% of wild-type, p=0.013, Wilcoxon signed-rank

407

test, effect on region further upstream not significant), indicating the presence of an inhibitory element

408

in this region.

409

We expanded our search for properties affecting PRF efficiency and examined the effect of the codons

410

preceding the slippery site. We found that the presence of a charged amino acid immediately

411

upstream of the slippery site significantly reduced frameshifting signal, even when the sequence of

412

the slippery site was unchanged (Fig 4E, p<0.0015, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). We examined also

413

the influence of decoding efficiency as measured by the tRNA adaptation index (tAI) on PRF and

414

detected an increasingly negative correlation between tAI and PRF signal in the 0 frame codons

415

leading up to the site of ribosome slippage (Fig 4F). This observation might indicate that progressive

416

slowing down of the ribosome by limited tRNA availability might contribute to stalling at the slippery

417

site and frameshifting.

418

To not limit our analysis to endogenous frameshifting events, we designed completely synthetic

419

regions corresponding to a slippery site and the upstream and downstream region with different

420

sequence and structural properties. Some fully designed sequences were able to trigger frameshifting

421

and resulted in a -1 PRF signal of up to 11% GFP fluorescence, approximately corresponding to the

422

wild-type frameshifting rate of the most efficient event tested here (SARS coronavirus). We tested all

423

different downstream regions with synthetic slippery sequences resembling common types of -1 PRF

424

sites and found pronounced differences in combinatorial preferences (Fig 4G), showing that also fully

425

synthetic frameshifting events exhibit the combinatorial preferences and context-dependent

426

peculiarities observed for native PRF events.

428

Prediction of frameshifting potential and efficiency

429

Having accurate quantitative measurements for large collections of frameshifting sites, we aimed to

430

predict frameshifting efficiency using machine learning approaches. Based on previous studies and

431

our own findings, we used the identity of slippery site positions, tAI of codons around the frameshifting

432

site, amino acid class, minimum free energy and pairedness of positions downstream of the

433

frameshifting site (see Methods), alone and combined, as features and built computational models

434

based on Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016); Fig 5A and

435

Methods). These models were either estimating whether a sequence has the ability to induce

436

frameshifting (i.e. yield a fluorescent signal above threshold (1.3%, see Figure S2A-C); classification)

437

or quantitatively predicting PRF efficiency (approximated by GFP fluorescence intensity in our assay;

438

regression). We achieved high accuracy (up to an area under the receiver operating characteristic

439

curve (ROC AUC)=0.93 for the classification of a sequence as yielding a PRF signal or not, and

440

Pearson r=0.81 for the comparison between measured and predicted frameshifting signal (% GFP

441

fluorescence)) when training our model on variants of specific frameshifting events and predicting

442

unseen variants from the same event (Fig 5BC). Despite the differences in the regulatory

443

characteristics between individual PRF events, we could predict frameshifting ability (Fig 5D, Fig

444

S10A, ROC AUC=0.89; area under the Precision-Recall-Curve=0.8) and frameshifting signal (% GFP

445

fluorescence; Fig 5E, Pearson r=0.53) also for a pool of all sequence variants tested, no matter

446

whether they yielded a detectable frameshifting signal in our assay or not (Fig 5BC, Fig S10A; “-1

447

PRF events” vs. ”all library variants”).

448

To determine to what extent a model trained on one PRF event could predict frameshifting potential

449

and -1 PRF signal in a different context, we trained our model (based on the full set of features) on

450

sequence variants derived from one event and predicted on variants of another event (Fig 5F, Fig

451

S10B). While performance is usually best for variants of the same PRF event, this approach revealed

452

functional similarities that allowed relatively accurate prediction on “foreign” PRF events (ROC AUC

453

up to 0.94, Pearson r up to 0.69). There is considerable overlap with other attempts of functional

454

clustering, e.g. based on sensitivities to mutations (Fig 2A), with SRV1 and HERV-K10 PRF sites

455

from any retroviral PRF event (HIV, SIVmac239 and SRV1; Fig 5F). The SARS PRF event, however,

457

is not amenable to prediction based on models trained on data from other PRF events. Prediction

458

accuracy also reflects the specific components of particular importance for a PRF event, e.g. the

slippery site for HIV (Fig S10C) and the downstream region for SRV1 (Fig S10D). In these cases,

Interpretation of the prediction models provides an additional approach to identify the most important

properties of a (potential) PRF site. Here, we used Shapely (SHAP) values for determining the

contribution of each feature to the prediction result of every sample (Fig S11A; Lundberg et al., 2020).

466

effect of specific sequence properties on the readout (Fig S11A), e.g. recapitulating earlier

467

observations that XXXCCCZ (“Y=C”) and XXXGGGZ (“Y=G”) slippery sites are disfavored (Fig S11A

468

upper left, cf. Fig 2D). For a model trained on the MFE of different lengths of downstream region,

469

stronger secondary structure not always led to prediction of higher PRF efficiency (Fig S11A lower

470

left). When taking into account regions of e.g. 60 nt after the slippery site (“dg60”), a lower feature

471

value favored prediction of PRF (Fig S11B).). While the positive effect of strong secondary structure

472

(low MFE) in the first 60 nt on PRF prediction was strongly enhanced if also the downstream region

473

as a whole showed low MFE (Fig S11B), in general we find strong secondary structure of the entire

474

downstream region (120 nt) to be associated with prediction of no PRF (Fig S11A). This could either

475

be explained through an effect on frameshifting efficiency or on RNA stability and overall expression

476

levels. The latter option is unlikely to explain the effect in full as we do not observe a correlation

477

between MFE of the downstream region and steady-state RNA levels (Fig S11C).

478
479

HIV clinical isolates exhibit subtype-specific differences in frameshifting efficiency and associations

480

with viral load in patients

481

The HIV gag-pol frameshifting site is arguably one of the most intensely studied examples of PRF

482

and – due to its critical importance for the viral replication cycle – has been repeatedly suggested as

483

an antiviral drug target (Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012; Hung et al., 1998). To assess the natural

484

variation in frameshifting rates in HIV1 we assembled a set of 581 sequences from clinical isolates

485

between 1976 and 2014 (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/, Methods), which differ in the sequence surrounding

486

the frameshifting site, but not in the slippery site itself (Fig S12A). Frameshifting rates of the variants

487

are distributed around the rate observed for the lab strain HXB2 (Fig 6A). This constitutes actual

488

differences in frameshifting rates and not only experimental variability, as isolated clones show

489

remarkably good correlation given the small differences in PRF signal we are measuring (Fig 6B).

490

Secondary structure showed the best correlation with frameshifting rates when considering the first

491

30 nucleotides after the frameshifting site (Fig S12B), matching the region of high sequence

492

conservation (Fig S12A). We grouped the HIV variants based on subtype and found significant

493

differences between the groups (Fig 6C, p<8*10-11, one-way ANOVA), most notably higher

494

frameshifting rates in subtype C (p<6*10-12 for the difference between C and B), in contrast to an

495

earlier report (Baril et al., 2003). HIV subtypes show distinct geographical distributions (Hemelaar et

496

al., 2006), and consequently we also observed differences between countries of origin (Fig S12C,

497

p<2*10-4), but no change in frameshifting rates over time (Fig S12D, p=0.4).

498

Optimal gag-pol frameshifting rates have been proposed to be critical for virulence (Dinman and

499

Wickner, 1992; Felsenstein and Goff, 1988). In order to link the frameshifting rate measured in our

500

reporter assay with the replicative success of the corresponding HIV isolate we compared the viral

501

load in patients (where available) to frameshifting rates of the causal HIV isolate (Fig 6D). Although

502

viral load is influenced by many factors, we nevertheless observed a clear trend for patients with high

503

viral load to have frameshifting rates close to ”wild type” (the lab strain HXB2). These data present

504

optimality of frameshifting rates as a hallmark of HIV infection and as being associated with infectious

505

success, underscoring the potential for drugs altering the efficiency of gag-pol frameshifting.

506

In order to predict frameshifting efficiency of naturally occurring variants of the HIV gag-pol

507

frameshifting site, we built a model based on the feature sets described above. Despite eliminating

508

the most important feature of the HIV gag-pol PRF site (the slippery sequence) by restricting our

509

analysis to clinical isolates with no sequence alterations in and around the canonical UUUUUUA and

510

despite the narrow range of frameshifting rates (Fig 6A), we could accurately predict frameshifting

511

rates of unseen variants (Pearson r=0.6; Fig 6E, left). Interestingly, removing the features based on

512

pairedness of downstream positions and minimum free energy led to similar agreement between

513

measured and predicted values (Fig 6E, right). This is in line with the limited importance of the exact

514

downstream structure in comparison to other PRF events tested. Including designed HIV variants in

515

the training set yielded similar prediction accuracy (Fig S12E), indicating that our model can learn the

516

relevant rules from our set of natural variants alone. Taken together, these results show that a model

517

based on data from our assay is sensitive enough to detect even subtle differences between HIV

518

variants and allows prediction of frameshifting rates with an accuracy of clinical relevance.

519
520

Discussion

521

Here, we combined fluorescent frameshifting reporters with rational design of DNA sequences and

522

high-throughput testing to systematically decipher the rules governing PRF. Our approach aims at a

523

systematic and comparative assessment of the commonalities and peculiarities in the regulation of

524

frameshifting efficiency across PRF events. It is complementary to in-depth analyses of individual

525

frameshifting sites yielding detailed structural or kinetic insights (Caliskan et al., 2014, 2017; Chen et

526

al., 2014; Choi et al., 2020; Lyon et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2015). The high-throughput nature of our

527

approach entails particular limitations. While we show that our assay is highly sensitive to changes in

528

the PRF signal (e.g. in the testing of natural isolates of HIV) and therefore able to identify even subtle

529

effects of sequence alterations on frameshifting, our detection limit is higher than in assays using

530

amplification methods and/or overexpression of the reporter.

531

Prediction of PRF events has up to now been largely limited to identifying sequences matching the

532

canonical pattern for slippery sites, followed by a downstream secondary structure (Belew et al., 2008;

533

Theis et al., 2008). To the best of our knowledge, no attempts at quantitatively predicting the effect of

534

sequence variation exist to date. We used our measurements of frameshifting signal of thousands of

535

variants of known PRF sites to build a computational model based on known and novel sequence

536

features affecting frameshifting, leading to accurate prediction of frameshifting potential (up to ROC

537

AUC=0.93) and frameshifting rates (up to Pearson r=0.81). In many cases sequence properties other

538

than slippery site identity or downstream secondary structure rigidity yielded high prediction scores,

539

emphasizing the importance to include additional features such as amino acid properties and tRNA

540

availability in the investigation of PRF regulation.

541

By controlled sequence and structure manipulations in multiple contexts we aimed to dissect and

542

directly compare the regulatory architecture of 15 frameshifting events, revealing a great diversity in

543

regulatory strategies involving upstream and downstream sequence and structural elements and

544

amino acid properties. We demonstrate a high degree of optimization and specialization of regulatory

545

mechanisms. For example, no universally optimal slippery site exists, but in each of the PRF events

546

tested the native slippery site was found to be optimal given the sequence context.

547

A correlation between secondary structure rigidity and PRF efficiency has been shown previously

548

(Bidou et al., 1997; Garcia-Miranda et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018), while also other properties of

549

secondary structures like their plasticity have been reported to be associated with frameshifting rates

550

(Halma et al., 2019; Ritchie et al., 2012). Our results corroborate the functional link between minimum

551

free energy of downstream structures and show that this is true for most PRF events tested. However,

552

this correlation generally depended on the length of the downstream region taken into account, in

553

agreement with the specific association between PRF efficiency and thermodynamic stability of the

554

start of the HIV stem loop structure reported earlier (Mouzakis et al., 2013). Furthermore, the

555

correlation between PRF signal and MFE only held true when testing small variations of the native

556

sequence and structure; when sequences and structures different from the native one were tested,

557

this correlation was lost.

558

Slippery site and a downstream stimulatory signal are central – and therefore intensely studied –

559

regulatory elements present in all known PRF events. Here, we expanded the repertoire of regulatory

560

inputs and demonstrated that both tRNA availability as well as amino acid properties can affect PRF

561

efficiencies across native sequence contexts.

562

Ribosome stalling due to limited tRNA availability has the potential to lead to slippage of the ribosome

563

(Gallant and Lindsley, 1992; Weiss et al., 1988) and contributes to non-programmed frameshifting in

564

huntingtin (Girstmair et al., 2013). Availability of tRNAs decoding slippery site codons have been

565

shown to influence HIV gag-pol frameshifting efficiency (Korniy et al., 2019) and HIV-1 itself has the

566

ability to modulate the tRNA pool of the host cell (van Weringh et al., 2011). Our observation that

567

limited tRNA availability in the codons leading up to the slippery site progressively contributes to PRF

568

efficiency is in line with these data and expands the notion of an influence of the tRNA pool on

569

frameshifting beyond the slippery site codons and individual PRF events.

570

In addition, our analyses highlighted amino acid properties around the frameshifting sites as another

571

factor influencing PRF efficiency. Specifically, a charged amino acid at the last position before the

572

slippery site was associated with reduced frameshifting rate. Together with reports of a frameshift-

573

promoting effect of specific amino-acid sequences upstream of the frameshifting site in the case of

574

+1 PRF in fungal OAZ genes (Yordanova et al., 2015) and the copA gene of Escherichia coli (Meydan

575

et al., 2017), this observation provides additional evidence for a role of the nascent peptide in

576

regulating ribosomal frameshifting.

577

In general, our results reveal functional groups of PRF events that exhibit greater similarity in terms

578

of their sensitivities to mutations in regulatory regions and congruence in the preferences for

579

secondary structure. These functional groups also manifest themselves in a higher prediction

580

accuracy within these groups. The groups resemble similarities also according to other criteria, e.g.

581

in their native secondary structure. PRF events, whose downstream stimulatory sequence has been

582

shown to be a stem loop (e.g. HIV-1 (Parkin et al., 1992; Staple and Butcher, 2003) and SIVmac239

583

(Marcheschi et al., 2007)) tend to be more resilient and less affected by small sequence changes than

584

those with a downstream pseudoknot (e.g. SRV-1 (ten Dam et al., 1994; Du et al., 1997) as well as
22

585

SARS and other coronaviruses (Brierley et al., 1989; Plant et al., 2005)). Typically, these cases exhibit

586

higher fluorescence signal in our assay (Fig 1C), but greater sensitivities to even small sequence

587

changes (Fig 2B, 3C, S4AB, S5A) and requirements for a more extensive downstream region. This

588

might also entail a greater sensitivity to the experimental context and therefore explain the lack of

589

signal (above the noise threshold) for previously reported cases depending on a pseudoknot as

590

frameshift stimulatory signal like Rous sarcoma virus (Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Marczinke et al.,

591

1998). In other cases, low wild-type rates of frameshifting, requirements for additional trans-acting

592

factors or an effect on overall expression levels might explain the lack of signal in our assay.

593

Comparing the HIV gag-pol site with other PRF events shows the remarkable robustness and

594

exceptional tolerance for various non-native downstream stimulatory signals. More than in other

595

cases, maintaining the wild-type slippery site UUUUUUA is crucial for frameshifting, and tends to be

596

absolutely invariable across otherwise diverse natural isolates (Biswas et al., 2004). The quantitative

597

nature of our assay allows us nevertheless to accurately quantify the effect of sequence variation

598

away from the slippery site, revealing sub-type specific differences. Furthermore, we devised a

599

machine learning model that is able to predict the natural variation in HIV frameshifting rates for novel

600

variants (Pearson r=0.60). Precise stoichiometry of frameshifted and non-frameshifted product is

601

crucial for HIV virulence, and the ability to predict frameshifting rates of naturally occurring variants of

602

the gag-pol PRF site therefore has important clinical implications, both in the case of HIV as well as

603

in the case of PRF events in other viruses.

604

This high-throughput investigation of PRF also constitutes an addition to the experimental toolbox for

605

studying translational recoding and highlights many starting points for further investigations into the

606

regulatory basis and functional importance of frameshifting. In addition to deciphering the effect of cis-

607

regulatory elements, regulation by trans-acting factors like the recently discovered case of the

608

frameshift repressor shiftless (Wang et al., 2019) constitutes another area where a systematic

609

approach like the one presented here can yield novel insights into the mode of action and its

610

specificity. Libraries of frameshifting reporters provide a platform for screening putative modifiers of

611

ribosomal frameshifting, offering a powerful tool to identify ways to generally or selectively control

612

frameshifting and opening new possibilities for interfering with viral replication and for controlling

613

cellular processes depending on translational frameshifting.

Methods

617

Synthetic library design

618

General design notes

619

Oligonucleotides were designed to maintain a constant length of 210 nt. Restriction sites used for

620

cloning were excluded from the design. All the variants were composed of an 18 nt forward primer,

621

12 nt barcode sequence, 162 nt variable region and 18 nt reverse primer sequences. DNA barcodes

622

were designed to differ from any other barcode in the library in at least 3 nt.

623
624

Selection of frameshifting sites for systematic sequence manipulations

625

60 PRF events reported previously or listed in FSDB (Moon et al., 2007) were included in the library

626

design. Sequences were aligned in a way that the site of frameshifting would be at the same position

627

in all variants (slippery site ending at position 42). In case there were stop codons downstream of the

628

PRF site in any of the three frames, additional versions with stop codons mutated (changed to TGG)

629

were included for testing only. Out of these, 15 were selected for systematic sequence manipulations

630

based on the amount of experimental evidence supporting them, lack of stop codons in the relevant

631

reading frames, biological significance and mechanistic diversity (i.e. covering +1, -1 and -2

632

frameshifting sites). The HIV and OAZ frameshifting sites were tested beforehand in isolation to

633

confirm that our experimental setup is able to reproduce well established cases of -1 as well as +1

634

PRF.

635
636

Design of individual rationally designed subsets

637

For each of the subsets in the libraries, systematic sequence manipulations were performed on the

638

set of 15 previously reported frameshifting sites. Design of subsets was carried out in Python.

639

Multiple barcode controls: We added multiple variants to the library that contained the same variable

640

region, but different barcodes, in order to gauge potential effects of the barcode and the technical

641

noise of our assay.

642

Slippery site: We tested all possible variations of the different slippery site patterns found in previously

643

reported frameshifting events (XXXYYYZ, XYYZZZZ, influenza, OAZ (for +1 PRF)). In the case of

644

OAZ, both the first and the second codon in the slippery site UCC UGA were replaced with all other

645

codons. In addition, we created all possible point mutations in -1 PRF slippery sites that would not

646

give rise to a stop codon.

aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

647

Immediate downstream region/”spacer”: We created all possible point mutations in the six nucleotides

648

downstream of PRF slippery sites that would not give rise to a stop codon. In addition, we removed

649

up to 6 bps immediately downstream (in 1 or 3 bp increments, depending on the presence of stop

650

codons in downstream reading frames) or introduced up to 12 bps from five different constant

651

sequences (in 1 or 3 bp increments, depending on the presence of stop codons in downstream

652

reading frames).

653

Immediate upstream region: The first two codons preceding the slippery site (in the original frame)

654

were replaced with all other codons (except stop codons).

655

Upstream region: The upstream region (excluding the last two codons before the slippery site) was

656

randomly recoded five times. Moreover, variants were added for all 15 PRF events in which the same

657

part of the upstream region was replaced by four different constant sequences in increments of six

658

bps, starting from the beginning of the variable region. In addition, we included the following structural

659

variations in the design: We designed sequences 30 nt in length predicted (using ViennaRNA 2.0

660

(Lorenz et al., 2011) and antaRNA (Kleinkauf et al., 2015a, 2015b)) to fold into the respective native

661

structure (but having a different primary sequence or to have no secondary structure, a 9 bp long

662

stem-loop at the 5’ or at the 3’ end (6 sequences per set) and replaced the endogenous region in all

663

15 PRF events.

664

Downstream region: Variants were added for all 15 PRF events in which the same part of the

665

downstream region was replaced by three different constant sequences (different sets were used for

666

predicted +1 and -1 PRF sites to avoid stop codons in the relevant frames) in increments of six bps,

667

starting from the end of the variable region. For scanning mutagenesis, 30 positions (leaving the first

668

6 bp after the slippery site unchanged) were replaced with either A or C (G and T were avoided as

669

they often give rise to stop codons in one of the frames). In addition, we included the following

670

structural variations in the design: We used ViennaRNA 2.0 or pKiss (Janssen and Giegerich, 2015)

671

(which also predicts pseudoknots) to determine the native secondary structure of each of the 15 PRF

672

events. We then created for each PRF event two sets of ten sequences each (using antaRNA) that

673

are predicted to fold into the downstream secondary structure as determined using ViennaRNA and

674

pKiss, respectively. Furthermore we designed variants of the predicted HIV, SRV1 and nsp2F

675

(PRRSV) downstream secondary structure, e.g. by extending or reducing the length of hairpins, and

676

completely synthetic secondary structures and again used antaRNA to create sets of corresponding

677

sequences that we used to replace the native downstream structure in all 15 PRF events.

678

Completely synthetic variants: We designed a set of four upstream regions, three potential slippery

679

sites (resembling previously reported cases of the patterns XXXYYYZ, XYYZZZZ and XXYYYYY),

680

and created all possible combinations with a set of 57 artificial downstream sequences.

681

Frameshifts: We created variants in which the slippery site was moved by one, two or three positions

682

in the 5’ or 3’ direction in order to verify the frame-dependence of the effect.

683

Combinatorial variants: Upstream, slippery site and downstream regions from the whole set of 15

PRF sites were recombined, either preserving the original sequence fully or replacing potential stop

685

codons in all frames with TGG.

gag-pol frameshifting sites from HIV clinical isolates

688

We retrieved >30,000 full length sequences of the HIV genome from clinical isolates

689

(http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/) and selected gag-pol frameshifting sites which had the canonical sequence

690

around the slippery site (TAATTTTTTA), but differed in at least one position in the 30 nucleotides

691

upstream or the 120 nucleotides downstream. We chose to exclude variability in the slippery site to

692

screen for more subtle differences in frameshifting rates across clinical isolates.

Experimental procedures

K562 cells were acquired from ATCC. Cells were grown in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco Medium

697

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin solution

698

(SIGMA). The cells were split when reaching a concentration of ~106 cells/ml. The cells were grown

in an incubator at 37oC and 5% CO2. Cells were frozen in batches of 4×106 cells in growth medium

Construction of the master plasmid

703

Master plasmids for library insertion were constructed by amplifying parts from existing vectors and

704

cloning the parts sequentially into pZDonor 3.1. The master plasmid contained the EF1alpha

705

promoter, mCherry, a designed multiple cloning site containing restriction sites for library cloning

706

(RsrII and AscI), gfp and the SV40 terminator sequence. In the case of the master plasmid for cloning

707

the stop-vector library, two complementary DNA oligonucleotides (GACTGATAGCTGACTAGTCG

708

and GTCCGACTAGTCAGCTATCAG) were synthesized (IDT), annealed and introduced into the

709

vector described above (cut with RsrII) such that the mCherry-proximal RsrII site was destroyed and

710

the downstream RsrII site (after the inserted stop cassette) was subsequently used for inserting the

711

library.

713

Synthetic library cloning

714

The cloning steps were performed essentially as described previously (Vainberg Slutskin et al., 2018).

715

We used Agilent oligo library synthesis technology to produce a pool of 17,809 different fully designed

716

single-stranded 210-oligomers (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), which was provided as a

717

single pool of oligonucleotides (10 pmol). The two subsets of this pool corresponding to the designed

718

and native libraries tested here were defined by unique amplification primers. The reverse primer

719

contained a spacer of either 4 or 5 nucleotides to create the offset in the gfp reading frame. The oligo

720

pool was dissolved in 200 μl Tris-ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (Tris-EDTA) and then diluted 1:50

721

with Tris-EDTA, which was used as template for PCR. We amplified each of the four libraries by

722

performing 8 PCR reactions, each of which contained 19 μl of water, 5 μl of DNA, 10 μl of 5× Herculase

723

II reaction buffer, 5 μl of 2.5 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) each, 5 μl of 10 μM forward

724

primer, 5 μl of 10 μM reverse primer, and 1 μl Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent

725

Technologies). The parameters for PCR were 95°C for 1 min, 14 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, and 68°C

726

for 1 min, each, and finally one cycle of 68°C for 4 min. The oligonucleotides were amplified using

727

library-specific common primers in the length of 35 nt, which have 18-nt complementary sequence to

728

the single-stranded 210-mers and a tail of 17 nt containing RsrII (forward primer) and AscI (reverse

729

primer) restriction sites. The PCR products were concentrated using Amicon Ultra, 0.5 ml 30K

730

centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore). The concentrated DNA was then purified using a PCR mini-elute

731

purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified library DNA (540 ng total)

732

was cut with the unique restriction enzymes RsrII and AscI (Fermentas FastDigest) for 2 hours at

733

37°C in two 40-μl reactions containing 4 μl fast digest (FD) buffer, 1 μl RsrII enzyme, 1 μl AscI enzyme,

734

18 μl DNA (15 ng/μl) and 16 μl water, followed by heat inactivation for 20 min at 65°C. Digested DNA

735

was separated from smaller fragments and uncut PCR products by electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose

736

gel stained with GelStar (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland). Fragments were cut from the gel and

737

eluted using electroelution Midi GeBAflex tubes (GeBA, Kfar Hanagid, Israel). Eluted DNA was

738

precipitated using sodium acetate–isopropanol. The master plasmid was cut with RsrII and AscI

739

(Fermentas FastDigest) in a reaction mixture containing 6 μl FD buffer, 3 μl of each enzyme and 3.5

740

μg of the plasmid in a total volume of 60 μl. After incubation for 2.5 hours at 37°C, 3 μl FD buffer, 3 μl

741

alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas) and 24 μl water were added and the reactions were incubated for

742

an additional 30 mins at 37°C followed by 20 min at 65°C. Digested DNA was purified using a PCR

743

purification kit (Qiagen). The digested plasmid and DNA library were ligated for 30 min at room

744

temperature in a 10 μl reactions, containing 150 ng plasmid and the library in a molar ratio of 1:1, 1

745

μl CloneDirect 10× ligation buffer, and 1 μl CloneSmart DNA ligase (Lucigen Corporation), followed

746

by heat inactivation for 15 min at 70°C. Ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli 10G

747

electrocompetent cells (Lucigen) divided into aliquots (23 µl each, plus 2 μl of the ligation mix), which

748

were then plated on 4 Luria broth (LB) agar (200 mg/ml amp) 15-cm plates per transformation reaction

749

(25 μl). The rationally designed (12,809 variants) and the native (5000 variants) parts of the library

750

were cloned separately. For the rationally designed and the native library we collected around 10 6 and

751

4x105 colonies, respectively, for each frame the day after transformation by scraping the plates into

752

LB medium. Library-pooled plasmids were purified using a NucleoBond Xtra maxi kit (Macherey

753

Nagel). To ensure that the collected plasmids contain only a single insert of the right size, we

754

performed colony PCR (at least 48 random colonies per library).

755
756

Transfection into K562 cells and genomic integration

757

The purified plasmid libraries were transfected into K562 cells and genomically integrated using the

758

Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) system for site-specific integration and the CompoZr® Targeted

759

Integration Kit - AAVS1 (SIGMA). Transfections were carried out using Amaxa® Cell Line

760

Nucleofector® Kit V (LONZA). To ensure library representation we performed 15 nucleofections of

761

the purified plasmid library for each rationally designed library (frame -1 and frame +1) and 5 for each

762

native library. For each nucleofection, 4×106 cells were centrifuged and washed twice with 20 ml of

763

Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, SIGMA). Cells were resuspended in 100 μl solution (warmed

764

to room temperature) composed of 82 μl solution V and 19 μl supplement (Amaxa® Cell Line

765

Nucleofector® Kit V). Next, the cells were mixed with 2.75 μg of donor plasmid and 0.6 μg ZFN mRNA

766

(prepared in-house) just prior to transfection. Nucleofection was carried out using program T-16 on

767

the NucleofectorTM device, immediately mixed with ~0.5 ml of pre-cultured growth medium and

768

transferred to a 6 well plate with additional 1.5 ml of pre-cultured growth medium. A purified plasmid

769

library was also transfected without the addition of ZFN and served as a control to determine when

770

cells lost non-integrated plasmids.

771
772

Sorting the library by FACS

773

K562 cells were grown for at least 14 days to ensure that non-integrated plasmid DNA was eliminated.

774

A day prior to sorting, cells were split to ~0.25×106 cells/ml. On the day of sorting, cells were

775

centrifuged, resuspended in sterile PBS and filtered using cell-strainer capped tubes (Becton

776

Dickinson (BD) Falcon). Sorting was performed with BD FACSAria II SORP (special-order research

777

product) at low sample flow rate and a sorting speed of ~18000 cells/s. To sort cells that integrated

778

the reporter construct successfully and in a single copy (~4% of the population), we determined a

779

gate according to mCherry fluorescence so that only mCherry-expressing cells corresponding to a

780

single copy of the construct were sorted (mCherry single population). We collected around 350

781

cells/variant on average for each library in order to ensure adequate library representation.

782

Cells sorted for single integration of the transgene were grown for a week before we sorted the

783

population (combined rationally designed and native library, but separately for -1 PRF reporters, +1

784

PRF reporters and the stop-vector control) into 16 (in the case of the stop-vector 12) bins according

785

to GFP fluorescence, after gating for a narrow range of mCherry expression to avoid effects coming

786

from the influence of the variable region on overall expression level. This resulted in the loss of a

787

significant fraction of variants (as only around 50% of the cells fell into the narrow range of mCherry

788

fluorescence) but ensured that the subsequent sorting by GFP fluorescence was not biased by

789

expression level. Each bin was defined to span a range of GFP fluorescence values such that it

790

contains between 1-10% of the cell population. We collected around 1000 cells/variant on average in

791

order to ensure adequate library representation. Cells from each bin were grown separately for

792

freezing and purification of genomic DNA.

793
794

Genomic DNA purification, amplification and sample preparation

795

For each of the bins we purified genomic DNA by centrifuging 5×106 cells, washing them with 1 ml

796

PBS and purifying DNA using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s

797

protocol. In order to maintain the complexity of the library amplified from gDNA, PCR reactions were

798

carried out on a gDNA amount calculated to contain a minimum average of 200 copies of each oligo

799

included in the sample. For each of the 16 bins, we used 15 µg of gDNA as template in a two-step

800

nested PCR. In the first step, three reactions were performed and each reaction contained 5 μg gDNA,

801

25 μl Kapa Hifi ready mix X2 (KAPA Biosystems), 2.5 μl 10 μM 5′ primer, and 2.5 μl of 10 μM 3′ primer.

802

The parameters for the first PCR were 95oC for 5 min, 18 cycles of 94oC for 30s, 65oC for 30s, and

803

72oC for 60s, each, and one cycle of 72oC for 5min. In the second PCR step, each reaction contained

804

2.5 μl of the first PCR product, 25 μl of Kapa Hifi ready mix X2 (KAPA Biosystems), 2.5 μl 10 μM 5′

805

primer, and 2.5 μl 10 μM 3′ primer. The PCR program was 95oC for 5 min, 24 cycles of 94oC for 30s

806

and 72oC for 30s, each, and one cycle of 72oC for 5min. Specific primers corresponding to the constant

807

region of the plasmid were used. The 5′ primer contained a unique upstream 8-nt bin barcode

808

sequence, and three different barcodes were used for each bin. The 3′ primer was common to all bins.

809

Multiple PCR reaction products of each bin were combined. The concentration of the PCR samples

810

was measured using a monochromator (Tecan i-control), and the samples were mixed in ratios

811

corresponding to their ratio in the population, as defined when sorting the cells into the 16 bins.

812

Sample preparation including gel elution and purification were performed as described above for

813

amplicons from cDNA.

816

For the cell population sorted for single integration of the reporter construct we performed RNA

817

purification by centrifuging 107 cells, washing them with PBS, splitting into two tubes and purifying

818

RNA using NucleoSpin RNA II kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

819

We prepared cDNA in 2 reverse transcription reaction for each replicate using SuperScript® III First-

820

Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with random hexamer primers and 5 μg of input

821

RNA (per reaction) according to the manufacturer protocol. For amplification of the library variants, 3

822

PCR reactions of 50 ul total volume were performed. Each reaction contained 5 ul cDNA, 25 μl of

823

Kapa Hifi ready mix X2 (KAPA Biosystems), 2.5 μl 10 μM 5′ primer, and 2.5 μl 10 μM 3′ primer. The

824

PCR program was 95◦C for 5 min, 20 cycles of 94◦C for 30s and 72◦C for 30s, each, and one cycle

825

of 72◦C for 5min. Specific primers corresponding to the constant region upstream and downstream of

826

the splice sites were used. The PCR products were separated from potential unspecific fragments by

827

electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with EtBr, cut from the gel, and cleaned in 2 steps: gel

828

extraction kit (Qiagen) and SPRI beads (Agencourt AMPure XP). The sample was assessed for size

829

and purity at the Tapestation, using high sensitivity D1K screenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa

830

Clara, California). We used 20 ng library DNA for library preparation for NGS; specific Illumina

831

adaptors were added, and DNA was amplified using 14 amplification cycles. The sample was

832

reanalyzed using Tapestation.

833

For RT-PCR analysis we performed RNA purification on 5 million cells from individually constructed

834

and integrated reporter constructs, followed by cDNA synthesis as described above (one reaction).

835

PCR was performed using primers within the mCherry and GFP coding region, yielding a PCR product

836

of about 1000 bp length. 40 cycles of PCR were used to obtain a strong signal even for less prominent

837

bands. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel.

838
839

Computational analyses

840

Mapping next generation sequencing reads

841

To unambiguously identify the variant of origin, a unique 12-mer barcode sequence was placed at the

842

5' end of each variable region. DNA was sequenced on a NextSeq-500 sequencer. We determined

843

for each read (PE150) its bin barcode and its variant barcode and discarded all the reads that could

844

not be assigned to a bin and a library variant of origin. In a second step, for each variant the mapped

845

reads (paired-end, 150 bases for each mate) were aligned to the designed sequence (in the context

846

of the reporter) and only those ones were counted that mapped without a mismatch over the whole

847

length (disregarding the last 5 bases). Reads showing a mismatch, in particular a single nucleotide

848

deletion or insertion, were quantified separately and if they passed the same threshold applied to

849

correct library variants a PRF readout (% GFP fluorescence) was calculated for them. These

850

additional variants were only used in comparisons with the original designed variant and not

851

incorporated in the general pool of library variants considered for the analyses. For all three libraries

852

(-1 PRF reporters, +1 PRF reporters and the stop-vector control) around 40 milllion successfully

853

mapped reads were used for subsequent analysis. In addition, we sequenced the entire cell

854

population using greater read lengths (PE300) to cover the entire length of the variable region and to

855

obtain a measure of the fraction of reads per variant containing a synthesis or cloning error. Mapping

856

was performed using custom-made Python scripts.

857
858

Computing a measure of frameshifting efficiency (% GFP fluorescence) and related readouts

859

We applied a number of filters to the raw sequencing data to reduce experimental noise. First, variants

860

with less than 20 reads (perfect matches along the whole length) mapped across bins were removed.

861

Second, for bins with a read count of less than three, the bin value was set to zero. Third, for each

862

variant we set to zero bins surrounded by zero values as these constituted isolated bins unlikely to

863

come from the actual distribution. Forth, to reduce bias coming from the “open end”-bins at the

864

extreme values, we set their count to match their neighbor’s if it was higher, as these bins are defined

865

as containing the tails of the distribution of variants with no GFP fluorescence and maximal GFP

866

expression, respectively, and peaks in these extreme bins are considered experimental noise. For

867

each variant, we normalized the values across the 16 bins by dividing the filtered read counts for each

868

bin by the sum of all filtered read counts. To determine whether a distribution is unimodal we applied

869

a Savitzky-Golay filter for smoothing the data and removing local maxima introduced by experimental

870

noise. We detected peaks in the smoothed distribution by a simple approach in which a point is

871

considered a maximum peak if it has the maximal value, and was preceded by a value lower by 5%.

872

Variants without detectable peaks (due to the read number not reaching the threshold) were excluded

873

at this stage. Variants with more than one peak were filtered out at the level of analysis. For each bin,

874

we calculated the median of the log2 of GFP fluorescence intensity as measured by FACS for all the

875

cells sorted into that bin and used this as the GFP fluorescence value associated with this bin. For

876

each variant with one peak after smoothing, we calculated the weighted average for the distribution

877

of reads across bins (using unsmoothed read counts normalized for each variant and the GFP

878

fluorescence value for the bins, as described above), resulting in what is referred to in the main text

879

and figures as the “GFP fluorescence” (in log2).

880

As described in the main text and illustrated in Figure S2A-C, we set the lowest value obtained (the

881

variant with the lowest weighted average of the distribution) to 0% GFP fluorescence and the highest

882

value obtained (the variant with the highest weighted average of the distribution) to 100% GFP

883

fluorescence. Accordingly, a percentage was assigned to each variant based on the GFP

884

fluorescence (log2 of the weighted average of the reads distribution) of a variant as follows:

887

889

of variant X

– min([GFP fluorescence]all

variants))

/

* 100As a measure for steady state RNA expression levels, we computed the log ratio of

892
893

Machine learning approaches

894

Machine learning procedures were carried out using the python scikit-learn (version 0.18.2) and

895

XGBoost package. Initially, from all duplicated sequences (e.g. barcode control sets), which passed

896

filtering, a single variant was randomly chosen for all subsequent steps to avoid biases resulting from

897

having duplicated sequences. We created sets of variants corresponding either to the full rationally

898

designed library (“full library”), the -1 PRF sites from the main set of events tested positive in our

899

assay combined (“frameshifting events”) or to all variants based on one of these PRF events in

900

isolation. 10% of the variants in the individual sets (20% in case of the HIV variants) were put aside

901

and used only for evaluation of models built using the other 90% (80%). We chose Gradient Boosting

902

Decision Trees (XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016)) as the prediction algorithm because it can

903

capture non-linear interactions between features, allows combining different types of continuous and

904

categorical features and has proven to be a powerful approach in predicting the effect of regulatory

905

regions (Mikl et al., 2019; Vainberg Slutskin et al., 2018).

906

For predictions based on secondary structure we used the fold function from the Vienna RNA package

907

2.0 and extracted both the minimal free energy (“dg”; calculated for different lengths of downstream

908

(10-120 nt) regions) and the predicted pairedness for each position (“sec”; for each position in the

909

downstream region this set of features contains the information whether the position is predicted

910

(Vienna RNAfold) to be paired or not (0 or 1)).

911

For predictions based on tRNA adaptation index (tAI), we computed (based on Waldman et al., 2010)

912

the tAI of codons in the original and -1 frame as well as the (per position) difference between frame -

913

1 and frame 0 and used the information for 14 starting from the first codon in the slippery site (in the

914

case of the canonical -1 pattern XXXYYYZ, XXY in frame 0 and XXX in frame -1) as features.

915

For predictions based on amino acid identity, information on the type of amino acids around the

916

slippery site (from position -3 relative to the site of frameshifting until the end of the slippery site) was

917

used (“unpolar”, “polar” or “charged”).

918

Different hyperparameter settings for learning rate, n_estimators and max_depth were tested in a

919

systematic and combinatorial fashion using 10-fold cross-validation for each set of variants and

920

features independently. Typically around 100 tests were performed and the best set of

921

hyperparameters used for subsequent steps.

922

At the end, the model was tested by training it on the entire training set (90% of all relevant unique

923

library variants, 80% in the case of HIV clinical isolates) and scoring the correlation (Pearson) of

924

predicted vs. measured values based on the held-out test set (10% of relevant unique library variants

925

from the relevant set, 20% in the case of HIV clinical isolates), which had not been used at any stage

926

during development of the model. This approach was used for each of the features sets in isolation

927

as well as all of the features combined.

928

For classification, the same pipeline was used. Here, XGBClassifier was trained and the performance

929

scored on the test set, reporting the area under the ROC curve as a metric.

930

Feature importance and effect on the model was determined using SHAP analysis (Lundberg et al.,

931

2020).

933

935

scikit-learn 0.18.2 and shap 0.28.5. Confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping (1000
