ABSTRACT

23

The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of

24

international concern on March 11th, 2020, and the pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide.

25

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via

26

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to

27

computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and

28

small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small

29

intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and

30

testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung. Single cell RNA-Seq data

31

from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types

32

including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-

33

expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and

34

goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin

35

system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis.

36

Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several

37

putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene. Our results also

38

confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression

39

in the lung.

IMPORTANCE

42

Vaccines and new medicines are urgently needed to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, reduce

43

the symptoms, shorten the duration of disease, prevent virus spread in the body, and most

44

importantly to save lives. One of the key drug targets could be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

45

(ACE2), which is a crucial receptor for the corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). It is known that SARS

46

coronavirus infections lead to worse outcome in the elderly and in males. Therefore, one aim of the

present study was to investigate whether age or sex could contribute to the regulation of ACE2

48

expression. We also decided to explore the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 gene expression.

49

Since data on ACE2 distribution is still conflicting, we aimed to get a more comprehensive view of

50

the cell types expressing the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we studied the coexpression of

51

ACE2 with other genes and explored its putative functions using gene ontology enrichment

52

analysis.

INTRODUCTION

54

A zinc metalloenzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was discovered 64 years ago and

55

first named as a hypertension-converting enzyme [1]. Classically, ACE is well known for its roles

56

in the regulation of arterial pressure through conversion of angiotensin I to active angiotensin II and

57

cleavage of bradykinin and neurotensin [2]. As a zinc metalloenzyme, ACE belongs to a large

58

cluster of zinc-binding proteins. The first zinc metalloenzyme, carbonic anhydrase was discovered

59

in 1932 by Meldrum and Roughton [3] and thereafter thousands of such metalloenzymes have been

60

reported in different species of all phyla [4, 5].

61

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was first discovered in 2000 when a novel homologue of

62

ACE was cloned [2, 6, 7]. Although ACE and ACE2 share significant sequence similarity in their

63

catalytic domains, they appear to act on different peptide substrates of angiotensins [8, 9]. Previous

64

studies identified ACE2 as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus

65

1 (SARS-CoV-1) which led to an outbreak of SARS infection in 2003 [10]. ACE2 is also a crucial

66

receptor for the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused a large global outbreak of

67

COVID-19 infection with rapidly growing numbers of patients (5,488,825 confirmed cases as of

68

May 27th, 2020, https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). A recent

69

report suggested that soluble ACE2 fused to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin can neutralize

70

SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [11]. This result was further confirmed by showing that human recombinant

71

soluble ACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection on cultured Vero-E6 cells in a dose dependent

72

manner [12]. Therefore, ACE2 also holds promise for treating patients with coronavirus infection.

73

The structural key for target cell infection by coronavirus is the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-

74

CoV. ACE2 acts as a locking device for the virus, whereby the binding of the surface unit S1

75

facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells [13]. The cellular serine protease

76

(TMPRSS2) promotes SARS-CoV entry via a dual mechanism. It cleaves both the SARS-CoV S

77

protein and the virus receptor, ACE2, promoting both the viral uptake and the viral and cellular

membrane fusion events [13-15]. The critical residues contributing to the receptor-spike protein

79

interaction were first determined for SARS-CoV-1 [16] and recently in three independent studies

80

for SARS-CoV-2 [17-19]. It has been proposed by biolayer interferometry studies that the receptor-

81

binding domains of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins bind with comparable affinities to

82

human ACE2 [20]. In contrast, a modelling study suggested that binding of SARS-CoV-2 is

83

stronger [21], which was convincingly confirmed by structural and biochemical data [17, 18].

84

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection have recently been described based on data from

85

1,099 patients from mainland China [22]. It was found that the clinical characteristics of COVID-19

86

mimic those of SARS-CoV-1 infection. The most dominant symptoms include fever, cough,

87

fatigue, and sputum production, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms are less common. In laboratory

88

parameters, lymphopenia was detected in 83.2% of patients on admission. According to another

89

recent survey of 278 patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, fever was the most common

90

symptom, followed by cough [23]. Bilateral pneumonia has been detected by computed tomography

91

scans in 67.0% of patients [24]. A recent study from Wuhan, China listed the most common clinical

92

complications determined in critically ill COVID-19 patients [25]. The complications during

93

clinical worsening included acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute

94

cardiac injury, and heart failure.

95

Data on the localization of virus receptors can provide insight into mechanisms of virus entry, tissue

96

tropism, and pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, it is of particular interest to correlate COVID-

97

19 symptoms with the distribution pattern of ACE2. The first studies performed by northern

98

blotting indicated that ACE2 is located in the human heart, kidney, and testis [2]. By

99

immunohistochemistry, the expression of the ACE2 protein was identified in the human lung

100

alveolar epithelial cells (type I and II pneumocytes), enterocytes of the small intestine, the brush

101

border of the renal proximal tubules, and the endothelial cells of arteries and veins and arterial

102

smooth muscle cells in several organs [26]. It was proposed that this distribution pattern of ACE2

103

could explain the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-1 for the lung, small intestine, and kidney [27]. On

104

the other hand, the symptoms of COVID-19, in contrast to SARS-CoV-1 infection, are not

105

associated to the same extent with the gastrointestinal tract in spite of the high expression of ACE2

106

in the intestinal enterocytes [28]. In COVID-19, diarrhea has been reported in just 3.8% of patients,

107

in contrast to 40-70% in SARS-CoV-1 infection [22, 29]. A recent preprint report indicated diarrhea

108

in 18.1% of 254 COVID-19 patients [30].

109

There are conflicting reports on the expression of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract [29].

110

Hamming and coworkers found that only the basal layer of nonkeratinized airway squamous

111

epithelium shows positive signal [26], whereas Sims and colleagues demonstrated ACE2 expression

112

on the luminal surface of ciliated cells in freshly excised human nasal and tracheobronchial tissue

113

[31]. Ren and coworkers showed weak ACE2-positive signal in the epithelial cells of trachea and

114

main bronchus [32]. Although lymphopenia is a typical feature of SARS [22, 29], ACE2 is not

115

highly expressed on T or B cells or macrophages in the spleen or lymphoid organs [26].

116

It is known that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to worse outcome in the elderly

117

[29, 33]. Therefore, one aim of the present study was to investigate whether age could contribute to

118

the regulation of ACE2 expression. We also decided to explore the transcriptional regulation of

119

ACE2 gene expression using a novel computational tool recently developed by the first author of

120

this article. Notably, data on ACE2 distribution is still conflicting, and thus we aimed to get a more

121

comprehensive view of the cell types expressing the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we studied

122

the coexpression of ACE2 with other genes and explored its putative functions using a gene

123

ontology enrichment analysis.

RESULTS

125

ACE2 is weakly expressed in the lung

126

The first aim of our study was to investigate different human tissues using publicly available

127

datasets for the distribution of ACE2 mRNA and protein. In the FANTOM5 dataset, the highest

128

values for ACE2 mRNA, ranked according to signal intensity, were seen for the small intestine,

129

dura mater, colon, testis, thalamus, and rectum (Fig. 1).

130

Figure 2 shows the expression of ACE2 protein in selected human tissues. Representative example

131

images of the ACE2 immunostaining were prepared from tissue specimens of the Human Protein

132

Atlas database (https://www.proteinatlas.org/). The results indicate a strong signal for ACE2 protein

133

in the brush border of small intestinal enterocytes. In the kidney, prominent immunostaining

134

reactions were present in the epithelial cells of proximal convoluted tubules and Bowman¬¥s capsule.

135

The seminiferous tubules and interstitial cells of testis also demonstrated strong immunostaining.

136

No immunoreactions for ACE2 were observed in the lung specimens. Very weak signal, associated

137

with apical membranes, was detected in sporadic ciliary cells of a nasopharyngeal mucosa sample.

138

Although the evaluation of immunostaining reaction is generally considered semiquantitative at

139

most, the results seem to correlate fairly well with the corresponding mRNA expression levels.

140
141

Single cell RNA-Seq analysis indicates cell-specific expression for ACE2 mRNA

142

The respiratory tract is the main target region that is affected by COVID-19 infection. Bulk RNA-

143

Seq data from lung specimens showed low expression levels for ACE2 (Fig. 1). Therefore, we

144

performed an analysis of single cell RNA-Seq using both human lung and mouse trachea datasets,

145

representing the breadth of the lower respiratory tract. Figures 3 and 4 show the expression of

146

ACE2 mRNA in identified cell types of lung and trachea, respectively. In lung, ACE-2 expressing

147

cells are generally uncommon with no cell type having a ratio of ACE2-expressing cells greater

148

than 2.6%. The cell types with the greatest proportion of ACE2 expression are those of arterial

149

vascular endothelial cells (2.55%), goblet cells (2.02%), and venous vascular endothelial cells

150

(1.33%). In trachea, the highest ratio of ACE2-expressing cells included the club cells (16.62%),

151

goblet cells (13.84%), and ciliary epithelial cells (6.63%).

152

Since both the airways and intestine contain goblet cells, SARS-CoV-1 affects gastrointestinal tract,

153

and bulk RNA-Seq data shows high expression in small intestine and colon, we decided to analyze

154

another single cell RNA-Seq dataset covering mouse intestinal epithelial cells. Figure 5 indicates

155

the highest levels of ACE2 mRNA signal in the absorptive enterocytes (44.09%), whereas the

156

intestinal goblet cells (1.35%) remain mostly negative.

157
158

ACE2 mRNA expression levels are unrelated to age and gender in the lung

159

Since both age and gender may contribute to onset and severity of COVID-19 symptoms we aimed

160

to investigate the effect of these variables on the expression levels of ACE2 mRNA. Figure 6

161

indicates that some tissues showed a slight trend to lower expression in older age categories.

162

Among all tested tissues, statistically significant differences between the age categories were seen

163

in the tibial nerve (p=8.58 x 10-6), minor salivary gland (p=0.002), aorta (p=0.003), whole blood

164

(p=0.005), transverse colon (p=0.010), hypothalamus (p=0.039), and sun exposed skin (p=0.046).

165

Importantly, the lung specimens showed no significant difference of ACE2 mRNA expression

166

between different age categories (p=0.681). Complete data on ACE mRNA expression levels in

167

different age categories are shown in Supplementary Table 1. To make a binary comparison of

168

expression by age, samples were divided into groups of ‚â§45 and >45 years of age. In comparison of

169

these younger and older age groups, significant differences in expression were found in tibial nerve

170

(p=2.47 x 10-7), whole blood (p=3.21 x 10-4), minor salivary gland (p=4.89 x 10-4), sun exposed

171

skin (p=0.003), transverse colon (p=0.022), testis (p=0.025), esophageal muscle layer (p=0.040),

172

and subcutaneous adipose tissue (p=0.045).

173

ACE2 mRNA levels largely overlapped between male and female sexes as shown in Figure 7. In

174

the lung, no statistically significant difference was observed in the expression levels between the

175

male and female subjects (p=0.908). Statistically significant differences were observed in the

176

adipose tissue (p=0.0001), whole blood (p=0.0002), amygdala (p=0.0006), transverse colon

177

(p=0.0008), muscle layer of esophagus (p=0.002), left ventricle of heart (p=0.005), Epstein-Barr

178

virus-transformed lymphocytes (p=0.015), and esophagus-gastroesophageal junction (p=0.024).

179

Notably, there was no clear sex-specific trend pointing to one direction in all these cases. ACE

180

mRNA expression levels in all studied tissues sorted according to subjects¬¥ gender are shown in

181

Supplementary Table 2.

182
183

Proximal promoter contains putative TFBSs for ileum, colon, and kidney expression

184

TFBS analysis of the ACE2 intestinal transcript promoter (ENST00000252519) revealed several

185

candidate binding sites which occur in a cluster extending from 400 bp upstream of the transcription

186

start site; CDX2, HNF1A, FOXA1, SOX4, TP63, HNF4A, DUX4, FOXA2, NR2F6, and SOX11

187

(Fig. 7A). These predicted sites overlap an evolutionarily conserved region in mammals and are

188

proximal to several ATAC-Seq peaks. In several tissues these TFs are found to be highly positively

189

correlated (>0.7) with expression of ACE2: CDX2 (colon, terminal ileum), HNF1A (colon, kidney,

190

terminal ileum), FOXA1 (cervix, colon, terminal ileum), HNF4A (colon, terminal ileum), FOXA2

191

(colon, kidney), NR2F6 (colon, kidney, terminal ileum), and SOX11 (kidney). In addition, two of

192

the TFs are highly negatively correlated with ACE2 expression DUX4 (kidney) and FOXA1

193

(kidney). Full prediction results are included as Supplementary Table 3 and TF correlations by

194

tissue are present in Supplementary Table 4.

195

Analysis of the ACE2 lung transcript promoter (ENST00000427411) produced putative TFBS

196

predictions for ESRRA, HNF4A, CDX2, CEBPA, ESRRB, MEF2B, TCF7, TCF7L2, JUN, and

197

LEF1 (Fig. 7B). The predicted TFBSs clustered within 200 base pairs of the TSS, and overlap with

198

evolutionarily conserved regions, TFBS metaclusters, and ATAC-Seq peaks. The TFs

199

corresponding to predicted TFBSs, which are positively correlated (>0.7) with ACE2 expression,

200

are ESRRA (terminal ileum, colon), HNF4A (terminal ileum, colon), CDX2 (colon, terminal

201

ileum), CEBPA (colon, terminal ileum), ESRRB (cervix), TCF7L2 (testis). Those TFBSs with TFs

202

which strongly (<-0.7) negatively correlate with ACE2 are ESRRA (kidney) and TCFL72 (kidney).

203

The lung-specific transcript TSS aligns with the p3@ACE2 FANTOM5 dataset CAGE peak, which

204

indicates that the expression of this transcript is much lower than the intestinal transcript, which

205

corresponds with p1@ACE2 and p2@ACE2 FANTOM5 CAGE peaks. Common between the two

206

tissue-specific transcripts, are predictions for CDX2 and HNF-family transcription factors.

207
208

ACE2 mRNA expression correlates with metalloproteases and transporter genes

209

Coexpression analysis identified numerous genes in ileum, testis, colon, and kidney which are

210

highly correlated (>0.8) with ACE2 (Table 1; Supplementary Table 5). In particular, in the ileum

211

there are a number of genes with correlation values greater than 0.95. In contrast, analysis of the

212

lung shows a maximum correlation of expression of 0.6275. The genes with which ACE2 mRNA

213

expression shows the highest levels of coexpression code for metalloprotease and transporter

214

proteins. Selected tissue-specific ACE2-correlated genes, determined with bulk RNA-Seq data, are

215

presented with their expression levels within the scRNA-Seq trachea and intestinal datasets in

216

Figure 9.

ACE2 is associated with vascular growth

DISCUSSION

226

The predominant pathological features of COVID-19 infection largely mimic those previously

227

reported for SARS-CoV-1 infection. They include dry cough, persistent fever, progressive dyspnea,

228

and in some cases acute exacerbation of lung function with bilateral pneumonia [31]. Major lung

229

lesions include several pathological signs, such as diffuse alveolar damage, inflammatory exudation

230

in the alveoli and interstitial tissue, hyperplasia of fibrous tissue, and eventually lung fibrosis [34-

231

36]. It has been shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization technique that SARS-CoV-1 RNA

232

locates to the alveolar pneumocytes and alveolar space [37, 38]. Mossel and colleagues

233

demonstrated that SARS-CoV-1 replicates in type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes, but not in type 1 (AT1)

234

cells [39]. Considering all of these facts, it is not surprising that most histopathological analyses

235

have been focused on distal parts of the respiratory airways, while the regions other than the

236

alveolus have been less systematically studied.

237

To understand better the pathogenesis of COVID-19 we need to know where ACE2, the receptor for

238

SARS-CoV, is located within the human respiratory tract and elsewhere. Overall, different studies

239

including ours have convincingly shown that several organs, such as the small intestine, colon,

240

kidney, and testis, express higher levels of ACE2 than the lung and other parts of the respiratory

241

tract. Our analysis of ACE2 expression in the human lung show low levels of expression in all cell

242

types, with arterial vascular endothelial cells achieving the highest overall ratio of just ~2.5%. The

243

present results based on mouse tracheal dataset suggested that ACE2 mRNA is predominantly

244

expressed in the club cells, goblet cells, and ciliated epithelial cells, and at significantly higher

245

frequency than found in the lung. The mouse dataset used in our study contained no secretory3

246

cells, which Lukassen and colleagues recently reported to express the highest levels of ACE2

247

mRNA along the human respiratory tract [40]. Another study reported positive expression in the

248

type AT2 pneumocytes [41], which is in line with the results of Lukassen et al. [40], but only a few

249

cells appeared positive. A third study based on single cell expression data demonstrated the

250

strongest positive signal in the lung AT2 cells, while other cells including AT1 cells, club cells,

251

ciliated cells, and macrophages showed weaker expression [42]. A fourth single cell expression

252

analysis using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database recently demonstrated ACE2-positive

253

signal in 1% of AT2 cells and in 2% of respiratory tract epithelial cells [43]. This correlates with

254

our own findings for lung. For comparison about 30% of ileal epithelial cells were ACE2-positive,

255

and 44% of enterocytes in small intestine of mouse. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse

256

tissues has shown positive signal in the club cells, AT2 cells, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle

257

cells [44]. In spite of the obvious discrepancies between different datasets, that highlights the need

258

for large numbers of thoroughly characterized cells for single cell RNA-Seq analyses, we can now

259

make some conclusions of the expression of ACE2 mRNA in the respiratory tract. First, ACE2 is

260

positively though weakly expressed in the AT2 cells of the lung and less so in AT1 cells. Second,

261

ACE2 also shows a weak positive signal, but at significantly higher proportions of cells, in several

262

other cell types of the trachea, including goblet cells, club cells, and ciliated cells. Third, based on

263

the findings of Lukassen et al. [40] secretory3 cells, a transient cell type of the bronchial tree, may

264

express the highest levels of ACE2. These ACE2-positive cell types may represent the main host

265

cells for SARS-CoV-2 along the whole respiratory tract. However, the median percentage of ACE-

266

expressing secretory3 cells in the study was less than 6%, significantly less than that observed in

267

club (16.62%), goblet (13.84%), and ciliated (6.63%) cells of trachea we have identified in the

268

GSE103354 dataset.

269

Goblet cells, ciliated epithelial cells, and club cells are considered important cell types for the

270

protection of airway mucosa. Lukassen and coworkers [40] described secretory3 cells as

271

intermediate cells between goblet, ciliated, and club cells. If SARS-coronaviruses predominantly

272

attack these cells, locating along the airway segments including the trachea, bronchi, and

273

bronchioles until the last segment that is the respiratory bronchioles, it would be obvious that

274

physiological protective mechanisms are severely affected. Defective mucosal protection and

275

inefficient removal of pathogens due to viral infection may contribute to onset of severe bilateral

276

pneumonia that is common for SARS-diseases [45]. This pathogenic mechanism is supported by

277

previous findings, showing that early disease is manifested as a bronchiolar disease with respiratory

278

epithelial cell necrosis, loss of cilia, squamous cell metaplasia, and intrabronchiolar fibrin deposits

279

[31]. In fact, it has been suggested that early diffuse damage as a result of SARS-CoV-1 infection

280

may actually initiate at the level of the respiratory bronchioles [46, 47].

281

Our findings confirm that the respiratory tract tissues have quite limited expression levels of ACE2

282

compared to several other tissues that show much more prominent signal. Because ACE2 is highly

283

expressed in the intestine [28], as also confirmed by our bioinformatics study, it would be obvious

284

to predict that both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infections cause significant gastrointestinal pathology and

285

symptoms including diarrhea. Interestingly, the patients with COVID-19 have reported less

286

gastrointestinal symptoms than the SARS-CoV-1-infected patients [22, 29]. The pathophysiological

287

basis for this phenomenon is not understood at this point, and thus further investigations on this

288

topic are warranted.

289

When we initiated the present study, we hypothesized that understanding better the transcriptional

290

regulation of the ACE2 gene might help to explain the peculiar distribution pattern of ACE2 in

291

tissues. Since upregulation of ACE2 would reflect an increased number of SARS-coronavirus

292

receptors on cell surfaces, it could possibly help us to understand the mechanisms why certain

293

patients (males more than females, old more than young, smokers more than non-smokers) are more

294

susceptible for the most detrimental effects of the COVID-19 infection. In our study, the signals for

295

ACE2 mRNA in the lung specimens did not vary much in different age groups nor did they show

296

significant differences between males and females, which is in line with previous findings [40].

297

Therefore, different expression levels of lung ACE2 may not explain the variable outcome of the

298

disease concerning age groups and genders.

299

To investigate the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 gene we made predictions for the binding sites

300

of transcription factors within the proximal promoter region of the intestine-specific and lung-

301

specific human ACE2 transcript promoters. Our findings introduced several putative binding sites in

302

the ACE2 promoter for known transcription factors, which showed high levels of coexpression with

303

ACE2 in several tissues including the ileum, colon, and kidney. The identified transcription factors

304

could represent potential candidate target molecules which regulate ACE2 expression. Two of our

305

predictions, for HNF1A and HNF1B have been previously identified experimentally to drive ACE2

306

expression in pancreatic islet cells and insulinoma cells, respectively [48]. Later work by the same

307

group has shown that our prediction of FOXA binding sites in the ACE2 promoter are also likely

308

correct [49]. It is of interest that ACE2 might be regulated by oxygen status. Zhang and coworkers

309

previously demonstrated that ACE2 mRNA and protein levels increased during the early stages of

310

hypoxia and decreased to near-baseline levels at later stages after hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1Œ±

311

accumulation [50]. Based on these findings ACE2 has been listed as a HIF1Œ±-target gene [51],

312

although it does not follow the typical HIF1Œ± regulated expression pattern, nor is there any

313

predicted HIF1Œ± binding site in our analyses. However, HNF1B has been identified as upregulated

314

in hypoxia in kidney, independent of HIF1Œ± [52], and in hypoxic embryonic stem cells HIF1Œ± has

315

been shown to increase expression of transcription factors TCF7/LEF1 (predicted to bind the

316

promoter of the lung-specific ACE2 transcript) through Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling [53].

317

The regulation of ACE2 expression remains an enigma and there may be multiple factors involved.

318

There has been concern that the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could

319

increase the expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry [54, 55].

320

Previous studies have suggested that both ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor type I

321

antagonist therapies increase ACE2 mRNA expression in the rat heart [56]. There has also been

322

some evidence in humans showing increased expression of ACE2 in the heart, brain, and even in

323

urine after treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers [54]. Since these drugs are widely used for

324

treatment of hypertension and heart failure, it would be important to determine in COVID-19

325

patients whether these medications have any significant effects on symptoms or outcome of the

326

disease.

327

Gene ontology investigations revealed interesting novel data on potential physiological roles of

328

ACE2. The five most significant gene ontology terms included angiogenesis, blood vessel

329

morphogenesis, vasculature development, cardiovascular system development, and blood vessel

330

development. Our study of lung showed that the arterial and venous vascular endothelial cell types

331

had the highest ratios of ACE2-expressing cells, first and third highest, respectively. In another

332

study, ACE2 expression was previously detected in blood vessels [26], and a recent study showed

333

that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of directly infecting blood vessel cells [12]. Endothelial ACE2

334

expression may be linked to clotting and multi-organ dysfunction reported in many patients with

335

COVID-19. Based on the present finding angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis may be

336

considered a putative function for ACE2 in addition to its classical role as the key angiotensin-(1-7)

337

forming enzyme [57].

338

Conclusions: Our bioinformatics study confirmed the low expression of ACE2 in the respiratory

339

tract. In lung it was lowest of all, while significantly higher in the trachea. Bulk RNA-Seq analyses

340

indicated the highest expression levels in the small intestine, colon, testis, and kidney. In the human

341

lung scRNA-Seq dataset, the strongest positive signals for ACE2 mRNA were observed in vascular

342

endothelial cells, goblet cells, ciliated cells, and AT2 and AT1 pneumocytes. In the mouse trachea

343

dataset, positive signals were most common in club cells, goblet cells and ciliated epithelial cells.

344

The results suggest that SARS-CoV infection may target the cell types that are important for the

345

protection of airway mucosa and their damage may lead to deterioration of epithelial cell function,

346

finally leading to a more severe lung disease with accumulation of alveolar exudate and

347

inflammatory cells and lung edema, the signs of pneumonia recently described in the lung

348

specimens of two patients with COVID-19 infection [58]. Gene ontology analysis based on

METHODS

352

ACE2 mRNA expression

353

From the FANTOM5 project [59], cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) sequencing of cDNA

354

has been performed in 1,839 human samples from 875 different primary cells, tissues, and cell

355

lines. Expression of transcription start sites (TSSs) was extracted and combined for all genes in all

356

samples as tags per million (TPM). From this compiled set, ACE2 gene expression was extracted

357

and presented as barplot using the Matplotlib [60] and Seaborn [61] Python libraries. Similarly,

358

human gene expression data (as TPM) was extracted from the GTEx database, along with metadata

359

on the samples. ACE2 gene expression values were separated by tissue and compared among 10-

360

year interval age groups to determine if the values showed any differences throughout the lifecycle.

361

Boxplots for tissues of relevance were generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

362
363

Coexpression and gene ontology enrichment analysis

364

In each of the tissues present in the GTEx dataset, expression values for ACE2 were compared with

365

expression of all other genes by Spearman correlation analysis using the SciPy [62] Python library

366

to identify those genes with concordant expression patterns. Bonferroni correction was used to

367

derive an adjusted p-value threshold of 9.158E-07. For each tissue, those genes which both satisfied

368

the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value threshold and had a correlation of expression of 0.50 or greater

369

were analyzed using the Gprofiler gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis [63] Python library to

370

identify possible enriched terms in biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), cellular

371

component (CC), human phenotype (HP), KEGG pathway, and WikiPathways (WP) ontologies.

374

Immunohistochemical localization of human ACE2 was evaluated from immunostained specimens

375

provided by Protein Expression Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/). The images of the Figure 2

376

represent duodenum from 77-years-old female, kidney from 36-years-old male, testis from 38-

377

years-old male, lung from 61-years-old female, and nasopharyngeal mucosa from 78-years-old

378

female. According to Protein Expression Atlas the immunostainings were performed with the rabbit

379

anti-human polyclonal antibody (HPA000288; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) raised against 111 N-

380

terminal amino acids of ACE2 and diluted 1:250 for the staining.

381
382

Promoter Analysis

383

Analysis of ACE2 promoter regions was performed using the TFBSfootprinter tool

384

(https://github.com/thirtysix/TFBS_footprinting) which uses transcription-relevant data from

385

several major databases to enhance prediction of putative TFBSs, including: ATAC-Seq data from

386

ENCODE [64], transcription start sites and expression data from FANTOM5 [65], expression

387

quantitative trail loci from GTEx [66], TFBS metacluster data from GTRD [67], TFBS binding

388

profile data from JASPAR [68], and sequence and conservation data from Ensembl [69]. Detailed

389

description of this novel tool is under preparation (Barker et al. manuscript under preparation).

390

Previous studies identified two distinct tissue-specific transcription start sites (TSS) for intestine

391

and lung expression [48], which correspond to primary protein-coding Ensembl transcripts

392

ENST00000252519 and ENST00000427411, respectively. These two transcripts were targeted for

393

transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis; input parameters of 1,000 base pairs (bp)

394

upstream and 200 bp downstream, relative to the TSS.

Single-Cell RNA-Seq

20
397

Single-cell expression datasets were identified for relevant tissues/cells of lung (human) [70],

398

trachea (mouse) [71], and small intestine (mouse) [72]. Using a modified workflow described

399

previously in [73], for each dataset the samples were filtered by Gaussian fit of read count,

400

expressed gene count, and number of cells in which a gene is expressed. Counts were normalized by

401

cell, log transformed, principle component analysis performed with 15 components, and k-nearest

402

neighbors computed using SCANPY [74], and then the full data set normalized with R package

403

‚Äòscran‚Äô [75]. Batch correction by individual and sample region was performed with SCANPY using

404

the ComBat function. The top 1,000 genes with highly differential expression were identified for

405

cluster analysis which was performed with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection

406

(UMAP) and force directed graph models. The top 100 marker genes were identified as those with

407

higher expression unique to each cluster by Welch t-test in SCANPY. Expression of the ACE2 gene

408

was mapped onto cluster figures to determine overlap with previously identified cell types or cell

409

type marker genes identified in the literature. Cell type was mapped by expression of known marker

410

genes of cell types expressed in the lung and small intestine, as defined by de novo prediction in the

411

original articles.

412
413

Statistics

414

Comparisons of ACE2 expression values in different tissues and between groups delineated by age

415

or sex, were carried out by one-way ANOVA using the stats package in the SciPy [62] Python

416

library. Only groups with 20 or more observations and a 2-sided chi squared probability of

417

normality of <=0.1 (due to the robustness of ANOVA to non-normal distributions) were used for

418

comparison. Correlation of gene expression values was calculated by two-sided Spearman rank-

419

order analysis, where a Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold was computed using Œ±=0.05/number

420

of comparisons. Gene ontology enrichment analyses performed using the GProfiler tool utilize a

421

custom algorithm for multiple testing of dependent results, which corresponds to an experiment-

Figure 2. Immunohistochemical localization of ACE2 protein in selected human tissues. In the

701

duodenum (A), the protein is most strongly localized to the apical plasma membrane of absorptive

702

enterocytes (arrows). The goblet cells (arrowheads) show weaker apical staining. Intracellular

703

staining is confined to the absorptive enterocytes. In the kidney (B), ACE2 shows prominent apical

704

staining in the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubules (arrows) and Bowman¬¥s capsule

705

epithelium (arrowheads). The distal convoluted tubules are negative (asterisk). The testis specimen

706

(C) shows strong immunostaining in the seminiferous tubules (arrows) and interstitial cells

707

(arrowheads). The lung sample (D) is negative. In the nasopharyngeal mucosa (E), ACE2 signal is

708

very weak and only occasional epithelial cells show weak signals (arrows). Immunostained

709

specimens were taken from the Protein Expression Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/).

756

(Ensembl GERP), and cluster within 400 base pairs (bp) of the transcription start site. B) Promoter

757

region of the lung specific ACE2 transcript. The predicted binding sites cluster within 200 bp of the

758

TSS and overlap regions of conservation in mammal species, ATAC-Seq peaks (ENCODE), and

759

TFBS metaclusters (GTRD).
