Abstract

31

The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2

32

infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To

33

develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular

34

mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein

35

used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that

36

SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of

37

SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core

38

of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that

39

several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with

40

enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus

41

fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by

42

divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We

43

then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent

44

fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and

45

pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more

46

potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective

47

against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses

48

tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently

49

inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

50

Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected

51

mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and

52

treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging

53

SARSr-CoVs.

Introduction

56

In April of 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a priority

57

list of pathogens, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute

58

respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Disease X, a disease with an epidemic or pandemic

59

potential caused by an unknown pathogen1,2 (Fig.1a).

60

In late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with an unknown etiology in

61

Wuhan, China was considered as the first Disease X following the announcement by

62

WHO. Shortly thereafter, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, as denoted by WHO 3,

63

was identified as the pathogen causing the coronavirus disease COVID-19

64

2019-nCoV with 79.5% and 96% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat

65

coronavirus, SL-CoV-RaTG13, respectively 6, was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the

66

Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of

67

Viruses (ICTV) 7, while, in the interim, it was renamed HCoV-19, as a common virus

68

name, by a group of virologists in China 8-10.

As of 24 February 2020, a total of 79,331 confirmed cases of COVID-19,

including 2,618 deaths, were reported in China and 27 other countries

Coronaviruses (CoVs), the largest RNA viruses identified so far, belonging to the

75

Coronaviridae family, are divided into 4 genera, α-, β-, δ- and γ-coronaviruses, while

76

the β-coronaviruses are further divided into A, B, C, and D lineages. The seven CoVs

77

that can infect humans (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the

78

α-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the β-coronaviruses lineage A,

79

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the β-coronaviruses lineage B (β-B coronaviruses),

80

and MERS-CoV in the β-coronaviruses lineage C 6. To develop specific SARS-CoV-2

fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared

82

to that of SARS-CoV. Particularly, the spike (S) protein S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2,

Most importantly, the ACE2-binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in

SARS-CoV S proteins should also be compared in order to investigate the structural

In our previous studies, we designed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1,

100

targeting the HR1 domains of HCoV S proteins, which proved to be effective in

101

inhibiting infection of 5 HCoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and 3

102

SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs). By intranasal application of this peptide, either

103

pre- or post-challenge with a coronavirus, the treated mice were protected from

104

HCoV-OC43 or MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide has prophylactic

105

and therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection14. Indeed, our recent studies

106

have shown that EK1 peptide is effective against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated

107

membrane fusion and PsV infection in a dose-dependent manner 15.

108

In this study, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits much higher capacity of

109

membrane fusion than SARS-CoV, suggesting that the fusion machinery of

110

SARS-CoV-2 is an important target for development of coronavirus fusion inhibitors.

111

We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2's 6-HB core and

112

identified several mutated amino acid residues in HR1 domain responsible for its

113

enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. By conjugating the cholesterol molecule to

114

the EK1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, EK1C4, exhibited highly

115

potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and PsV

116

infection, about 240- and 150-fold more potent than EK1 peptide, respectively.

117

EK1C4 is also highly effective against in vitro and in vivo infection of some live

118

HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, suggesting potential for

119

further development as pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based therapeutics and prophylactics

120

for treatment and prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2

121

and MERS-CoV, as well as future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging

122

SARSr-CoVs.

Results

124

The capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion

125

From the GISAID Platform (https://platform.gisaid.org), we obtained the

126

full-length amino-acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV 2019-2020) S protein

127

(GenBank: QHD43416). Through alignment with SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs S

128

proteins, we located the functional domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which

129

contains S1 subunit and S2 subunit with the cleavage site at R685/S686 15. S1 subunit

130

is located within the N-terminal 14–685 amino acids of S protein, containing

131

N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and receptor binding

132

motif (RBM). S2 subunit contains fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad

133

repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (Fig. 1b).

134

Recent biophysical and structural evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 S protein

135

binds hACE2 with 10-fold to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S protein,

136

suggesting the higher infectivity of the new virus 12. Unlike other β-B coronaviruses,

137

S protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a special S1/S2 furin-recognizable site, indicating

138

that its S protein might possess some unique infectious properties. Indeed, in live

139

SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found a typical syncytium phenomenon naturally formed

140

by infected cells, which is rarely reported in SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1c). To

141

further explore the special characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cloned the S

142

gene into PAAV-IRES-GFP vector and established the S-mediated cell-cell fusion

143

system, using 293T cells that express SARS-CoV-2 S protein and EGFP

144

(293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP) as the effector cells, and ACE2/293T cells expressing

145

human ACE2 receptor as the target cells (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1a). After effector cells

146

and target cells were cocultured at 37 °C for 2 h, the fused cells showed at least 2-fold

147

larger size than normal cells and multiple nuclei, and these cells were observed in the

148

SARS-CoV-2 group, but not the SARS-CoV group. After coincubation for 24 h,

149

hundreds of target cells fused together as one big syncytium, containing multiple

150

nuclei (Fig. 1d). Another 24h later, the syncytium grew bigger and could be easily

151

observed under both light and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1e). Similar results were

152

observed in the fusion between 293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP cells and Huh-7 cells,

153

which naturally express human ACE2 receptor on the cell surface. Their syncytium

154

was obviously formed after coincubation for 48 h, similar to the syncytium formed by

155

live SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh-7 cells (Fig. 1c and 1f). On the contrary, SARS-CoV

156

S protein lacked the ability to mediate the cell-cell fusion under the same conditions

157

(Fig. 1d) based on the required presence of exogenous trypsin to complete membrane

158

fusion in our previous studies. Therefore, compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S

159

protein showed much more efficiency in mediating viral surface-fusion and entry into

160

target cells

161

S-expression or 293T cells without ACE2-expression (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1b),

162

confirming that S-receptor engagement is necessary for the S-mediated viral fusion

163

and entry.

S2 subunit plays a very important role in the membrane fusion process mediated by

168

MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV S protein

169

HR1 and HR2 in subunit S2 of SARS-CoV-2 also interacted to form coiled-coil

170

complex to support membrane fusion and viral infection15 (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2).

171

However, the specific binding characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 6-HB remained to be

172

explored.

16,17

. Similarly, our recent study suggested that

173

To understand the structural basis of the interactions between HR1 and HR2

174

regions of SARS-CoV-2, a fusion protein containing the major parts of HR1 (residues

175

910 to 988) and HR2 (residues 1162 to 1206) with a flexible linker (L6, SGGRGG) in

176

between was constructed for crystallographic study. The crystal structure of

177

HR1-L6-HR2 shows a canonical 6-HB structure with a rod-like shape 115 Å in length

178

and 25 Å in diameter (Fig. 2b). The three HR1 domains form a parallel trimeric

179

coiled-coil center, around which three HR2 domains are entwined in an antiparallel

180

manner. The interaction between these two domains is predominantly a hydrophobic

181

force. Each pair of two adjacent HR1 helices forms a deep hydrophobic groove,

182

providing the binding site for hydrophobic residues of the HR2 domain, including

183

V1164, L1166, I1169, I1172, A1174, V1176, V1177, I1179, I1183, L1186, V1189,

184

L1193, L1197 and I1198 (Fig. 2c). The hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and

185

HR2 are mainly located in the helical fusion core region, which will be discussed

186

later.

187

The overall 6-HB structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other HCoVs

188

with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.36 Å to SARS-CoV 6-HB and 0.66 Å

189

to MERS-CoV 6-HB for all the Cα atoms (Fig. 2d). This finding suggested that the

190

overall 6-HB conformation is an important and highly conserved component for these

191

dangerous coronaviruses. When comparing with the 6-HB of other common

192

coronaviruses causing mild respiratory disease, such as 229E and NL63, the

193

SARS-CoV-2 6-HB has a similar overall structure, except for the different length of

194

HR2 helix in the 6-HB. The HR2 domain of 229E or NL63 forms a longer and

195

bending helix to interact with trimeric HR1 core (Fig. 2e). The relationship between

196

the structural difference and the pathogenicity of these HCoVs remains to be

197

elucidated.

198

According to sequence alignment, the S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and

199

SARS-CoV are highly conserved, with 92.6% and 100% overall homology in HR1

200

and HR2 domains, respectively. Inside the fusion core region of HR1 domain, there

201

are 8 different residues (Fig. 3a), which may contribute the enhanced interactions

202

between HR1 and HR2 and stabilize 6-HB conformation of SARS-CoV-2 as revealed

203

by crystallographic analysis, compared with those of SARS-CoV. This significant

204

difference has not been observed in other SARS-like viruses, such as WIV1, Rs3367,

205

and RsSHC014. As shown in Figure 3b, the K911 in SARS-CoV HR1 could bind to

206

E1176 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.9 Å in distance. However, with the Lys-Ser

207

replacement, S929 in SARS-CoV-2 binds to S1196 through a strong hydrogen bond

208

2.4 Å in distance. In SARS-CoV, Q915 in the HR1 domain does not bind to the HR2

209

domain. However, with Q-K replacement in the new virus, K933 in the HR1 domain

210

binds to carbonyl oxygen of N1172 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.7 Å in distance

211

(Fig. 3b). In SARS-CoV, E918 in the HR1 domain binds to R1166 in the HR2 domain

212

through a weak salt bridge 3.7 Å in distance. In SARS-CoV-2, E918 is mutated to

213

D936 and binds to R1185 in the HR2 domain through a salt bridge 2.7 Å in distance

214

(Fig. 3c). In SARS-CoV, K929 in HR1 binds to E1163 in HR2 through a salt bridge

215

3.2 Å in distance, while T925 is not involved in the interaction. However, when T925

216

was mutated to S943, it could bind to E1182 in the HR2 domain with a hydrogen

217

bond 2.6 Å in distance, and K947 could also bind to E1182 through a salt bridge 3.0

218

Å in distance (Fig. 3d). These results suggested that the multiple replacements in the

219

HR1 domain of emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus could enhance the interactions between

220

HR1 and HR2 domain to further stabilize the 6-HB structure, which may lead to

221

increased infectivity of the virus.

222

Design and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of lipopeptides with

223

remarkably improved fusion inhibitory activity

224

Previously, we found that peptide EK1 could disturb viral 6-HB formation and

225

effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PsV infection. However, the potent stability of

226

SARS-CoV-2 6-HB structure might reduce the antiviral efficacy of EK1. Recently,

227

numerous reports have shown that the lipidation strategy can effectively improve the

228

antiviral activity of fusion inhibitory peptides, such as the ant-HIV-1 peptide LP-19 18,

229

and the anti-Nipah virus lipopeptides 19. In order to improve the inhibitory activity of

230

EK1, cholesterol (Chol) and palmitic acid (Palm) were covalently attached to the

231

C-terminus of EK1 sequence under the help of a flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG)

232

spacer, and the corresponding lipopeptides EK1C and EK1P were constructed,

233

respectively (Fig. 4a). Both of them could completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mediated

234

cell-cell fusion at the concentration of 2.5 μM (Fig. 4b). The inhibitory activity with

235

mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values is 48.1 nM for EK1C and 69.2 nM

236

for EK1P, respectively (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, the EK1-scrambled peptide showed no

237

inhibitory activity with the concentration up to 5 μM (Fig. 4c). These results strongly

238

suggest that lipidation of EK1 is a promising strategy to improve its fusion-inhibitory

239

activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially, cholesterol-modification.

240

On the basis of the structure of EK1C, series of cholesteryl EK1 with multiple

241

linkers were constructed, where the glycine/serine-based linker, i.e., GSG, or

242

PEG-based spacer was employed between EK1 and the cholesterol moiety (Fig. 4d).

243

Compared with EK1C1, EK1C2 and EK1C showed similar inhibitory activities.

244

Strikingly, EK1C3 peptide with both the 3-amino acid linker “GSG” and the

245

PEG4-based spacer, exhibited 4-fold more potency than EK1C1. It is noteworthy that

246

changing “GSG” in EK1C3 to a longer 5-amino acid linker “GSGSG” significantly

247

increased the inhibitory potency of the hybrid molecule, and EK1C4 had IC50 value of

248

1.3 nM, which was 43-fold more potent than EK1C1. These findings indicate that the

249

linker length has a significant effect on the overall activity of lipopeptides.

250

Comparison of increasing PEG-based arm lengths in EK1C4 shows that inhibitors

251

potency slightly decreased in the cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. 4e). The data suggest that

252

“GSGSG-PEG4” linker was optimal to bridge both parts of the conjugates. Similarly,

253

EK1C4 showed the most potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 PsV

254

infection, with IC50 value of 15.8 nM, providing 149-fold stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2

255

activity than that of EK1 (IC50=2,375 nM) (Fig. 4f).

256

The lipopeptide EK1C4 exhibits the most potent inhibitory activity against

257

membrane fusion mediated by S proteins and entry of pseudotyped

258

coronaviruses

259

We have previously demonstrated that EK1 could effectively inhibit divergent

260

HCoV infection by targeting the HR1 domains, including α-HCoV and β-HCoV. Here,

261

we further systematically evaluated the broad-spectrum surface-fusion inhibitory

262

activity of EK1C4 on cell-cell fusion mediated by S proteins of divergent

263

coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and

264

HCoV-229E. Among them, SARS-CoV has the closest relatives to SARS-CoV-2, and

265

its S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion could be effectively inhibited by EK1C4 with

266

IC50 of 4.3 nM, which is about 94-fold more active than that of EK1 (IC50 = 409.3 nM)

267

(Fig. 5a). Similarly, EK1C4 showed extremely potent fusion-inhibitory activity on

268

MERS-S- and OC43-S-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC50 of 2.5 nM and 7.7 nM,

269

which were 95- and 101-fold more potent when compared to EK1, respectively,

270

indicating that EK1C4 could potently and broadly inhibit S protein-mediated cell-cell

271

fusion of various β-HCoVs (Fig. 5b-c). For α-HCoVs, EK1C4 also effectively

272

blocked the fusion process mediated by the S protein of HCoV-229E and

273

HCoV-NL63 with IC50 of 5.2 nM and 21.4 nM, respectively, while EK1 showed

274

inhibitory activity of IC50 ranging from 207.4 to 751.0 nM (Fig. 5d-e). Moreover, with

275

their potential for human infection, SL-CoVs, including WIV1, Rs3367 and

276

RsSHC014, the fusion process of which is mediated by S protein, could also be

277

significantly prevented by EK1C4 with IC50 ranging from 4.3 to 8.1 nM, as well as

278

EK with IC50 ranging from 237.0 to 279.6 nM (Fig. 5f-h). As control, the

279

EK1-scrambled peptide showed no inhibitory activity with concentration up to 5 μM

280

in all those coronavirus cell-cell fusion assays (Fig. 5a-h).

281

We also assessed the antiviral activity of EK1C4 on PsV infection by divergent

282

coronaviruses. As expected, EK1C4 showed much more potent activity than EK1

283

(IC50 ranging from 631.8 to 3237.0 nM) against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and

284

HCoV-OC43 infection with IC50 of 11.7 nM, 11.1 nM and 37.7 nM, respectively (Fig.

285

5i-k). EK1C4 also effectively blocked PsV infection of α-HCoVs, including

286

HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, with IC50 of 12.4 nM and 76.6 nM, respectively,

287

which was about 319- and 99-fold more active than EK1 (IC50 ranging from 3,963 to

288

7,666 nM) (Fig. 5l-m). Similarly, by cholesteryl modification with “GSGSG-PEG4”

289

linker, the inhibitory activity of EK1 could be significantly increased on PsV infection

290

from SL-CoVs, including WIV1 and Rs3367, where EK1C4 showed potent inhibitory

291

activity with IC50 of 30.8 nM and 66.9 nM, respectively, which is 175-fold to 89-fold

292

more potent than that of EK1 (Fig. 5n-o).

293

EK1C4 possesses the most potent inhibitory activity against in vitro infection by

294

live coronaviruses

295

We further assessed the inhibitory activity of EK1C4 against live HCoVs infection,

296

including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63.

297

Importantly, EK1C4 effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection at the cellular level

298

in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 36.5 nM, being 67-fold more active than that

299

of EK1 (IC50=2,468 nM) (Fig. 6a), which is consistent to the results of cell-cell fusion

300

assay and PsV infection assay mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Similarly, EK1C4

301

also showed more potent antiviral activity than EK1 against MERS-CoV,

302

HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 infection with IC50s of 4.2 nM, 24.8

303

nM, 101.5 nM and 187.6 nM, respectively, which are 190-, 62-, 42- and 19-fold more

304

potent than those of EK1, respectively (Fig. 6b-e). We next assessed the cytotoxicity

305

of EK1C4 on various target cells and found that the half cytotoxic concentration

306

(CC50) was beyond 5 μM, which is the highest detection concentration of EK1C4 (Fig.

307

S3). Therefore, the selectivity index (SI=CC50/IC50) of EK1C4 is >136, suggesting

308

that EK1C4 is a promising SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitor with little, or even no, toxic

309

effect in vitro. Further, we explored the potent antiviral mechanism of EK1C4 and

310

found that the complexes of EK1C4/SARS-2HR1, EK1C4/MERS-HR1, and

311

EK1C4/SARS-2HR1 harbor higher stability and increased Tm values than those of the

312

complexes formed by EK1 and HR1s (Fig. S4). These results suggested that increased

313

antiviral activity of EK1C4 should be related its increased binding affinity with HR1,

314

but their detailed interactions require further studies.

315

Intranasally applied EK1C4 showed strong protection of mice against

316

HCoV-OC43 infection

317

Recently, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread in humans by transmitting through the

318

respiratory tract. Here, we used an HCoV-OC43 infection mouse model to further

319

investigate the potential prophylactic effect of EK1C4 in clinical applications via the

320

intranasal administration route (Fig. 6f-g). In the OC43-infected mouse model, we

321

treated newborn mice with EK1C4 at a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg 0.5 h (Pre-0.5), 2 h

322

(Pre-2), 4 h (Pre-4), 12 (Pre-12) and 24 h (Pre-24) before challenging with

323

HCoV-OC43 at 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose). Starting from 4 days’

324

post-infection (dpi), the body weight of mice in the viral control group decreased

325

significantly along with 100% mortality (Fig. 6f-g). The final survival rates of mice in

326

Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, Pre-12 and Pre-24 groups were 100%, 100%, 100%, 83% and

327

0%, respectively (Fig. 6f-g). In contrast, EK1 with a single dose of 20 mg/kg via nasal

328

administration exhibited very promising prophylactic effect in the Pre-0.5 h and Pre-1

329

h groups, whereas all mice in the EK1-Pre-2 h group eventually died similarly to the

330

mice in the viral control group (Fig. S5). These results suggested that EK1C4 has

331

better stability, antiviral activity, and prolonged half-life in the airway environment

332

when compared with EK1.

333

We then tested the therapeutic effect of EK1C4 0.5 h (Post-0.5 group) and 2 h

334

(Post-2 group) after HCoV-OC43 infection (Fig. 6h-i). The Post-0.5 group and Post-2

335

group mice showed 100% and 16.7% survival rate, respectively, suggesting that

336

EK1C4 harbors good therapeutic effect after a short period of HCoV-OC43 infection,

337

possibly resulting from the establishment of HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse brain

338

where EK1C4 cannot get through the blood brain barrier via nasal administration14.

339

As shown in Fig. S6, high viral titer was detected in brains of all 5 mice in Pre-24

340

group and 4 out of 5 mice in Post-2 group, but was not detected in brain tissues of all

341

mice in Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, and Post-0.5 groups, while only moderate level of viral

342

titer was detected in brain tissue in one of the 5 mice in Pre-12 group (Fig. S6 a and b).

343

Similar to those in the viral control mice, mice in Pre-24 and Post-2 groups exhibited

344

similar histopathological changes in brain tissues, including vacuolation, degeneration,

345

and infiltration. However, the brain tissues of mice in Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, Pre-12

346

and Post-0.5 group as well as the normal control group showed no apparent

347

histopathological changes (Fig. S6 c).

348

Discussion

349

Over the past 20 years, highly infectious pathogens have been emerging

350

increasingly, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012

351

WHO proposed “Disease X” in the blueprint priority diseases for any new unknown

352

pathogen that may cause an epidemic or pandemic in the future, calling for the

353

development of effective and safe vaccines and antivirals to prevent and treat such

354

Disease X. Indeed, at the end of 2019, the outbreak of Wuhan pneumonia with an

355

unknown etiological agent, the first Disease X following WHO's announcement was

356

reported to WHO. Shortly thereafter, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (also known

357

as 2019-nCoV or HCoV-19), was identified to be the etiology of the Wuhan

358

pneumonia, i.e., COVID-19 as designated by WHO.

20-22

. In 2018,

359

Unlike SARS-CoV, live SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were found to form typical

360

syncytium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may mainly utilize the plasma membrane

361

fusion pathway to enter and replicate inside host cells. Consistently, in the cell-cell

362

fusion system, SARS-CoV-2 S protein could effectively mediate the formation of

363

syncytium between the effector cell and the target cell in the absence of an exogenous

364

proteolytic enzyme, e.g., trypsin, while SARS-CoV S protein could not. Actually, the

365

plasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosomal membrane

366

fusion pathway for most viruses because the latter is more prone to activating the host

367

cell antiviral immunity23,24. Generally, β-B coronaviruses lack the S1/S2

368

furin-recognition site, and their S proteins are uncleaved in the native state. For

369

example, SARS-CoV enters into the cell mainly via the endosomal membrane fusion

370

pathway where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L and activated25.

371

Inducing the S1/S2 furin-recognition site could significantly increase the capacity of

372

SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection 26. Interestingly,

373

SARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, but its specific role in S

374

protein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle remains to be further explored

375

(Fig. S7). A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mainly used TMPRSS2 for

376

plasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute an

377

option for blocking SARS-CoV-2 fusion with and entry into the host cell 27.

378

The 6-HB structure formed by HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 subunit of HCoVs

379

plays a key role during the viral membrane fusion process, which makes it one of the

380

most important targets for drug design. In previous studies, we have found that HR1

381

and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 could form a stable coiled-coil complex, but the detailed

382

conformations remain unknown. According to the X-ray crystallographic analysis of

383

the complex formed by HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b), it is a typical 6-HB

384

fusion core structure similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although the

385

amino acid sequences of HR2 domain from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are fully

386

identical, multiple residue differences occur in the HR1 domain of SARS-CoV-2.

387

However, instead of weakening the interaction between HR1 and HR2, such unilateral

388

difference seems to form new interactions in some regions and enhance the existing

389

ones in other regions (Fig. 3). When K991 in SARS-CoV HR1 was replaced with
15

390

S929 in SARS-CoV2 HR1, a new, strong hydrogen bond was formed with a distance

391

of 2.4 Å. K933 forms a new interaction with N1192 in SARS-CoV-2 with a distance

392

of 2.7 Å, whereas the corresponding position in SARS-CoV has no such interaction.

393

In the other two regions, E918 binds to R1166 and K929 binds to E1163 in

394

SARS-CoV, both of which were enhanced in SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that

395

this new HCoV has evolved with improved binding affinity between HR1 and HR2

396

domains, which may accelerate the viral membrane fusion process and enhance viral

397

infectivity or transmissibility. A recent study also found that the binding affinity

398

between ACE2 receptor on the host cell and RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is

399

more than 10-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may also be associated with

400

the increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-212.

401

The conjugation of cholesterol to viral entry inhibitor has been proved to be an

402

effective strategy to enhance the antiviral activity, such as C34 peptide for HIV-1

403

However, the mechanism of this enhancement, especially the role of cholesterol group

404

in the C-terminal tail of entry inhibitor, is still unclear. There is a possibility that the

405

cholesterol group could anchor to the target membrane to facilitate the binding of

406

inhibitor to the HR1 targets. However, we noticed that binding affinity between

407

EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2-HR1P is significantly enhanced than EK1 peptide alone,

408

which suggested that cholesterol group may be involved in binding to HR1P directly

409

(Fig. S4). Therefore, using structural simulation and docking method, we predicted a

410

possible model of EK1C4 in binding with SARS-CoV-2 HR1P (Fig. S8). In this

411

model, the EK1C4 peptide anchors to one of the three hydrophobic grooves of HR1

412

trimer via its EK1 moiety, and also anchors to another adjacent hydrophobic groove of

413

HR1 trimer via its cholesterol moiety. The cholesterol group of EK1C4 may bind to

414

HR1P through hydrophobic interactions, while several hydrogen bonds may form

415

between HR1 and helical region of EK1C4. The intermediated GSGSG-PEG4 linker

416

of EK1C4 peptide is just enough to connect these two moieties on the two binding

417

targets. Admittedly, the exact mechanism and structure of EK1C4 need more studies

418

in the future.

419

In the past few decades, the viral HR1 domain has been proved to be an important

420

target for the development of viral fusion and entry inhibitors. In the early outbreak of

421

MERS, we quickly solved the 6-HB fusion core structure formed by MERS-CoV S

422

protein HR1 and HR2 domains and designed the fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2

423

which proved to be highly effective in blocking its spike protein-mediated membrane

424

fusion and inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection16. The results from animal

425

experiments showed that intranasal application of HR2P-M2 peptide could effectively

426

protect mice from MERS-CoV infection with reduction of virus titers in the lung

427

more than 1000-fold29. However, the MERS-CoV HR2P-M2 peptide could not inhibit

428

SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide lacks cross-inhibitory activity

429

against other β-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs. To be well prepared

430

for combating the emerging coronaviruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, we

431

designed and synthesized the first pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, and found

432

that EK1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all HCoVs that we tested,

433

including SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, as well as bat SARSr-CoVs. As expected, we

434

recently have shown that EK1 is also effective in inhibiting infection of the novel

435

β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2

436

fusion inhibitory activity. Indeed, we found that one of the modified EK1 peptides,

437

EK1C4, was 226-fold and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 S

438

protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, respectively, than EK1. EK1C4

439

also showed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV,

440

MERS-CoV and other HCoVs.

448

intranasally is expected to have good therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2

449

infection.

450

Currently, no specific anti-CoV therapeutics or prophylactics have been used in

451

clinics for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A number of

452

nonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN, lopinavir-ritonavir (HIV protease

453

inhibitors), chloroquine, favipiravir (T-705) and remdesivir (GS-5734), have been

454

used in clinics in China to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection 30. Their in vivo efficacies still

455

require further confirmation. Their potential use for treatment of infection by other

456

coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Compared with

457

these clinically used nonspecific antiviral drugs, EK1C4 has more advantages for

458

treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the sequence of its target,

459

the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein, is highly conserved. Therefore, EK1C4

460

possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance and cannot easily induce drug-resistant

461

mutations. Second, EK1C4 can be used in an intranasal formulation to prevent

462

coronavirus infection. The small bottles can be carried easily by persons who will

463

have close contact with infected patients or high-risk populations. Third, EK1C4 can

464

be used in inhalation formulation for treatment of patients to reduce the viral loads in

465

their lungs, thus attenuating the acute lung injury caused by viral infection and

466

reducing the chance to spread the virions to the closely contacted persons. The

467

inhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense of

468

staying in hospitals. Fourth, EK1C4 is expected to be safe to humans because it will

469

be used locally, not systemically, and peptide drugs are generally safer than chemical

470

drugs. Fifth, because of its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, EK1C4 can be

471

used for treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2, but also

472

other HCoVs. Sixth, recently 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified 31, but

473

we found that both the HR1 and HR2 domains among those reported genomes show

474

100% identity (Fig. S9), indicating the high conservation of EK1C4 target. In the

475

meantime, the HR2 derived peptides have much larger interface on HR1 domain,

476

making it more resistant to the viral mutations. Therefore, EK1C4 shows exceptional

promise to be developed as the first pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based antiviral

532

were added in the presence or absence of a peptide at the indicated concentrations at

533

37 °C for 2 h. 293T/EGFP cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as a

534

negative control. The fusion rate was calculated by observing the fused and unfused

535

cells using fluorescence microscopy.

536

Inhibition of pseudotyped HCoV infection

537

293T cells were cotransfected with pNL4-3.luc.RE (the luciferase reporter-expressing

538

HIV-1 backbone) and pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2-S (encoding for CoVs S protein)

539

using VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China)

540

particles were efficiently released in the supernatant. The supernatant was harvested at

541

72 h post-transfection, centrifuged at 3000× g for 10 min, and frozen to −80 °C. To

542

detect the inhibitory activity of a peptide on infection of coronavirus PsV, target cells

543

(293T/ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs; RD cells for HCoV-OC43;

544

Huh-7 for other CoVs) were plated at a density of 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate

545

one day prior to infection 14. PsV was mixed with an equal volume of a peptide which

546

was series diluted with PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixture was transferred to the

547

Huh-7 cells. Medium was changed after 12 h and incubation continued for 48 h.

548

Luciferase activity was analyzed by the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison,

549

WI, USA).

550

and stained. Plaques were counted by fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde and staining

560

with 0.1% crystal violet. To test the effect of peptide on HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E

561

and HCoV-NL63 replication, 50 μL of 100 TCID50 virus were mixed with an equal

562

volume of peptide and incubated at 37 ° C for 1 hour. Afterwards, the mixture was

563

added to RD, Huh-7 and LLC-MK2 cells, respectively. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8,

564

Dojindo, Kumamoto, Kyushu, Japan) assay was applied to determine cytopathic

565

effect.

566

Circular dichroism spectroscopy

567

The peptides or peptide mixtures were dissolved in PBS to prepare a solution with a

568

final concentration of 10 μM at 37 °C for 30 min and then measured on a Jasco-815-

569

circular dichroism spectrometer 34. The scanning wavelength range was 198-260 nm.

570

Thermal denaturation detection starts at 222 nm with a 5 °C/min thermal gradient

571

detection.

572

Mouse infection studies

573

Newborn mice were bred from pregnant mice purchased from the Animal Center of

574

Fudan University, and all the related experiments were carried out in strict accordance

575

with institutional regulations (approval number 20190221-070, approval date 21

576

February 2019). Each group had 12 3-day-old mice. To test the protective effect of

577

peptides on HCoV-infected mice, EK1C4 (0.5 mg/kg), EK1 (20 mg/kg) in 2 µl 28%

578

Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin (HBC), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution,

579

were administered intranasally 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 h before challenge, or 0.5 and 2

580

h after challenge . Then mice were challenged intranasally with HCoV at a dose of

581

102 TCID50. For the viral control group, the same volume of 28% HBC or PBS was

582

administered intranasally. In each group, six mice were randomly selected for

583

euthanasia on day 5 after infection, then five mice for collecting and assessing the

584

viral titer in mouse brain, one mouse for brain histological examination. Body weight

585

and survival of the remaining six mice in each group were monitored for 14 days 35

586

Cytotoxicity assay

587

Cytotoxicity of the peptides to the cells (Vero-E6, Huh-7, LLC-MK2 and RD cells)

588

was tested by using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Briefly, each cell type was

589

seeded into the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (10,000 per well) and incubated at

590

37 °C for 12-15 h, replacing medium with DMED containing EK1C4 at graded

591

concentrations to culture at 37 °C for 2 days; CCK-8 solution (10 μL per well) was

592

added, followed by an additional incubation for 4 h. The absorbance was measured at

593

450 nm.

594

Expression and purification of fusion protein HR1-L6-HR2 of SARS-CoV-2

595

The coding sequences of HR1 (residues 910 to 988) and HR2 (residues 1162 to 1206)

596

domains of SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunits were tandem linked though a 6-residue linker

597

(L6: SGGRGG). The resulting sequences encoding the fused HR1-L6-HR2 protein

598

were then cloned into a modified pET-28a vector containing a His6-SUMO tag

599

upstream of the multiple cloning site. The recombinant construct was expressed in

600

Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) media

601

supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C and were induced with 1 mM IPTG

602

for 12 h at 16 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 g for 10

603

min at 4 °C and were lysed by high-pressure homogenizer twice after resuspension in

604

buffer containing 25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, and 200 mM NaCl. The fusion proteins

605

were isolated by Ni-affinity chromatography, and the SUMO tag was removed by

606

Ulp1 enzyme (1:100 w/w) cleavage. HR1-L6-HR2 protein was concentrated and

607

gel-filtered on a 10/300 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column. Peak fractions

608

containing HR1-L6-HR2 trimer were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/ml through

609

centrifugation (EMD Millipore).

610

Crystallization and structure determination

611

Crystals were obtained at 16 °C for 7 days using the hanging drop vapor diffusion

612

method by mixing equal volume of protein solution (HR1-L6-HR2, 10 mg/mL) and

613

reservoir solution (10% PEG8000, 200 mM zinc acetate, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0). Then

614

crystals were flash-frozen and transferred to liquid nitrogen for data collection. On the

615

in-house (Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) X-ray source

616

(MicroMax 007 generator (Rigaku, Japan)) combined with Varimax HR optics

617

(Rigaku, Japan), HR1-L6-HR2 crystals at 100 K were diffracted to 2.9-Å resolution at

618

a wavelength of 1.5418 Å. A native set of X-ray diffraction data was collected with

619

the R-AXIS IV ++ detector (Rigaku, Japan) with an exposure time of 3 min per image

620

and was indexed and processed using iMosflm

621

dataset is P21. Molecular replacement was performed with PHENIX.phaser 37 to solve

622

the phasing problem, using the SARS-CoV S protein core structure (PDB code

623

1WYY) as a search model. The final model was manually adjusted in COOT and

624

refined with Refmac 38. Data collection statistics and refinement statistics are given in

625

Table 1. Coordinates were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB code:

626

6LXT). The interaction model of EK1C4 peptide and HR1 domains of SARS-nCoV-2

627

was predicted by SWISS-MODEL sever 39

628

and by Autodock 4 software 40 for cholesterol moiety (Fig. S8).

629

Statistical analysis

630

The survival rates of mice were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. CalcuSyn

631

software was kindly provided by T.C. Chou, and the percent inhibition and IC50

632

values were calculated based on it 34.
