Abstract

17

The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, poses serious

18

threats to public health and social stability, calling for urgent need for vaccines and

19

therapeutics. SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to SARS-CoV, thus it is important to define

20

the between antigenic cross-reactivity and neutralization. In this study, we firstly analyzed 20

21

convalescent serum samples collected from SARS-CoV infected individuals during the 2003

22

SARS outbreak. All patient sera reacted strongly with the S1 subunit and receptor-binding

23

domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, cross-reacted with the S ectodomain, S1, RBD, and S2

24

proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S

25

protein-driven infections. Multiple panels of antisera from mice and rabbits immunized with a

26

full-length S and RBD immunogens of SARS-CoV were also characterized, verifying the

27

cross-reactive neutralization against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that a palm civet

28

SARS-CoV-derived RBD elicited more potent cross-neutralizing responses in immunized

29

animals than the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, informing a strategy to develop a

30

universe vaccine against emerging CoVs.

Introduction

36

The global outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by severe

37

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a new coronavirus (CoV)

38

genetically close to SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 (1-3). As of 20 April 2020, a total of

39

2,246,291 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 152,707 deaths, have been reported from

40

213 countries or regions, and the numbers are growing rapidly (https://www.who.int). The

41

pandemic threatens to become one of the most difficult times faced by humans in modern

42

history. Unfortunately, even though 17 years passed, we have not developed effective

43

prophylactics and therapeutics in preparedness for the re-emergence of SARS or SARS-like

44

CoVs. A vaccine is urgently needed to prevent the human-to-human transmission of

45

SARS-CoV-2.

46

Like SARS-CoV and many other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its surface spike (S)

47

glycoprotein to gain entry into host cells (4-6). Typically, the S protein forms a homotrimer

48

with each protomer consisting of S1 and S2 subunits. The N-terminal S1 subunit is

49

responsible for virus binding to the cellular receptor ACE2 through an internal

50

receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is capable of functional folding independently, whereas

51

the membrane-proximal S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion events. Very recently, the

52

prefusion structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined by cryo-EM, which

53

revealed an overall similarity to that of SARS-CoV (4, 7); the crystal structure of the

54

SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2 was also determined by several independent

55

groups, and the residues or motifs critical for the higher-affinity RBD-ACE2 interaction were

56

identified (8-10).

57

The S protein of CoVs is also a main target of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) thus being

58

considered an immunogen for vaccine development (4, 11). During the SARS-CoV outbreak

59

in 2002, we took immediate actions to characterize the immune responses in infected SARS

60

patients and in inactivated virus vaccine- or S protein-immunized animals (12-20). We

61

demonstrated that the S protein RBD dominates the nAb response against SARS-CoV

62

infection and thus proposed a RBD-based vaccine strategy (11, 15-22). Our follow-up studies

63

verified a potent and persistent anti-RBD response in recovered SARS patients (23-25).

64

Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share substantial genetic and functional similarities,

65

their S proteins, especially in the RBD sequences, display relatively larger divergences.

66

Toward developing vaccines and immunotheraptics against emerging CoVs, it is

67

fundamentally important to characterize the antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2

68

and SARS-CoV.

Results

71

Serum antibodies from recovered SARS patients react strongly with the S protein of

72

SARS-CoV-2

73

A panel of serum samples collected from 20 patients recovered from SARS-CoV infection

74

was analyzed for the antigenic cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, we examined the

75

convalescent sera by a commercial diagnostic ELISA kit, which uses a recombinant

76

nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 as detection antigen. As shown in Figure 1A, all the

77

serum samples at a 1:100 dilution displayed high reactivity, verifying that the N antigen is

78

highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. As tested by ELISA, each of the

79

patient sera also reacted with the SARS-CoV S1 subunit and its RBD strongly (Fig. 1B). Then,

80

we determined the cross-reactivity of the patient sera with four recombinant protein antigens

81

derived from the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, including S ectodomain (designated S), S1

82

subunit, RBD, and S2 subunit. As shown in Fig. 1C, all the serum samples also reacted

83

strongly with the S and S2 proteins, but they were less reactive with the S1 and RBD proteins.

84

Serum antibodies from recovered SARS patients cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2

85

As limited by facility that can handle authentic viruses, we developed a pseudovirus-based

86

single-cycle infection assay to determine the cross-neutralizing activity of the convalescent

87

SARS sera on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The pseudotype for vesicular stomatitis virus

88

(VSV-G) was also prepared as a virus control. Initially, the serum samples were analyzed at a

89

1:20 dilution. As shown in Fig. 2A, all the sera efficiently neutralized both the SARS-CoV

90

and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses to infect 239T/ACE2 cells, and in comparison, each serum

91

had lower efficiency in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 as compared to SARS-CoV. None of the

92

immune sera showed appreciable neutralizing activity on VSV-G pseudovirus. The

93

neutralizing titer for each patient serum was then determined. As shown in Fig. 2B, the patient

94

sera could neutralize SARS-CoV with titers ranging from 1:120 to 1: 3,240 and

95

cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with titers ranging from 1:20 to 1: 360. In highlight, the

96

patient P08 serum had the highest titer to neutralize SARS-CoV (1: 3,240) when it neutralized

97

SARS-CoV-2 with a titer of 1:120; the patient P13 serum showed the highest titer on

98

SARS-CoV-2 (1:360) when it had a 1:1,080 titer to efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV.

101

and SARS-CoV-2, we generated mouse antisera against the S protein of SARS-CoV by

102

immunization. Herein, three mice (M-1, M-2, and M-3) were immunized with a recombinant

103

full-length S protein in the presence of MLP-TDM adjuvant, while two mice (M-4 and M-5)

104

were immunized with the S protein plus alum adjuvant. Binding of antisera to diverse S

105

antigens were initially examined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 3A, the mice immunized by the

106

S protein with the MLP-TDM adjuvant developed relatively higher titers of antibody

107

responses as compared to the two mice with the alum adjuvant. Apparently, each of mouse

108

antisera had high cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 S and S2 proteins, but the

109

cross-reactive antibodies specific for the SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD were hardly detected

110

except the anti-S1 response in mouse M3. Subsequently, the neutralizing capacity of mouse

111

anti-S sera was measured with pseudoviruses. As shown in Fig. 3B to 3F, all the antisera,

112

diluted at 1: 40, 1: 160, or 1: 640, potently neutralized SARS-CoV, and consistently, they

113

were able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 although with reduced capacity relative to

114

SARS-CoV.

115

Mouse and rabbit antisera developed against SARS-CoV RBD cross-react and

116

neutralize SARS-CoV-2

117

As the S protein RBD dominates the nAb response to SARS-CoV, we sought to characterize

118

the RBD-mediated cross-reactivity and neutralization on SARS-CoV-2. To this end, we firstly

119

generated mouse anti-RBD sera by immunization with two RBD-Fc fusion proteins: one

120

encoding the RBD sequence of a palm civet SARS-CoV strain SZ16 (SZ16-RBD) and the

121

second one with the RBD sequence of a human SARS-CoV strain GD03 (GD03-RBD). As

122

shown in Fig. 4A, all of eight mice developed robust antibody responses against the
6

123

SARS-CoV S1 and RBD; and in comparison, four mice (m1 to m4) immunized with

124

SZ16-RBD exhibited higher titers of antibody responses than the mice (m5 to m8) immunized

125

with GD03-RBD. Each of anti-RBD sera cross-reacted well with the S protein of

126

SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 do share antigenically conserved

127

epitopes in the RBD sites. Noticeably, while the SZ16-RBD immune sera also reacted with

128

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen, the reactivity of the GD03-RBD immune sera was hardly

129

detected, implying that recombinant RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2 used here might not be

130

correctly folded to mimic the antigenic conformation presented on its S protein. Similarly, the

131

neutralizing activity of mouse antisera was determined by pseudovirus-based single-cycle

132

infection assay. As shown by Fig. 4B to 4I, each antiserum even at a high dilution (1:640)

133

displayed very potent activity to neutralize SARS-CoV; they also cross-neutralized

134

SARS-CoV-2 with relatively lower efficiency.

135

We further developed rabbit antisera by immunizations, in which two rabbits were

136

immunized with SZ16-RBD and two rabbits were with GD03-RBD. Interestingly, both RBD

137

proteins elicited antibodies highly reactive with both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

138

antigens (Fig. S1), which were different from their immunizations in mice. As expected, all of

139

the rabbit antisera potently neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a similar profile

140

with that of the mouse anti-S and anti-RBD sera. Again, the results verified that the

141

SARS-CoV S protein and its RBD immunogens can induce cross-neutralizing antibodies

142

toward SARS-CoV-2 by vaccination.

143

Rabbit antibodies induced by SZ16-RBD but not GD03 can block RBD binding to

144

293T/ACE2 cells

145

To validate the observed cross-reactive neutralization and explore the underlying mechanism,

146

we purified anti-RBD antibodies from the rabbit antisera above. As shown in Fig. 5A, four

147

purified rabbit anti-RBD antibodies reacted strongly with the SARS-CoV RBD protein and

148

cross-reacted with the SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD but not S2 proteins in a dose-dependent

149

manner. Consistent to its antiserum, the purified rabbit R-4 antibody was less reactive with the

150

SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Moreover, the purified antibodies dose-dependently neutralized

151

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 but not VSV-G (Fig. 5B). Next, we investigated whether the

152

rabbit anti-RBD antibodies block RBD binding to 293T/ACE2 cells by flow cytometry. As

153

expected, both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins could bind to 293T/ACE2

154

cells in a dose-dependent manner, and in a line with previous findings that the RBD of

155

SARS-CoV-2 bind to ACE2 more efficiently (Fig. S2). Surprisingly, the antibodies purified

156

from SZ16-RBD-immunized rabbits (R-1 and R-2) potently blocked the binding of both the

157

RBD proteins, whereas the antibodies from GD03-RBD-immunized rabbits (R-3 and R-4) had

158

no such blocking functionality except a high concentration of the rabbit R-3 antibody on the

159

SARS-CoV RBD binding (Fig. 6).

160
161

Discussion

162

To develop effective vaccines and immunotherapeutics against emerging CoVs, the antigenic

163

cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is a key scientific question need be

164

addressed as soon as possible. However, after the SARS-CoV outbreak more than 17 years

165

there are very limited blood samples from SARS-CoV infected patients currently available for

166

such studies. At the moment, Hoffmann et al. analyzed three convalescent SARS patient sera
8

167

and found that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S protein-driven infections were inhibited

168

by diluted sera but the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was less efficient (26); Qu and coauthors

169

detected one SARS patient serum that was collected at two years after recovery, which

170

showed a serum neutralizing titer of > 1: 80 dilution for SARS-CoV pseudovirus and of 1:40

171

dilution for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (27). While these studies supported the

172

cross-neutralizing activity of the convalescent SARS sera on SARS-CoV-2, a just published

173

study with the plasma from seven SARS-CoV infected patients suggested that cross-reactive

174

antibody binding responses to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein did exist, but cross-neutralizing

175

responses could not be detected (28). In this study, we firstly investigated the cross-reactivity

176

and neutralization with a panel of precious immune sera collected from 20 recovered SARS

177

patients. As shown, all the patient sera displayed high titers of antibodies against the S1 and

178

RBD proteins of SARS-CoV and cross-reacted strongly with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

179

In comparison, the patient sera had higher reactivity with the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2

180

relative to its S1 subunit and RBD protein, consistent with a higher sequence conservation

181

between the S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV than that of their S1 subunits and

182

RBDs (3, 4). Importantly, each of the patient sera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with

183

serum titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:360 dilutions, verifying the cross-reactive neutralizing

184

activity of the SARS patient sera on the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

185

Currently, two strategies are being explored for developing vaccines against emerging

186

CoVs. The first one is based on a full-length S protein or its ectodomain, while the second

187

utilizes a minimal but functional RBD protein as vaccine immunogen. Our previous studies

188

revealed that the RBD site contains multiple groups of conformation-dependent neutralizing

189

epitopes: some epitopes are critically involved in RBD binding to the cell receptor ACE2,

190

whereas other epitopes possess neutralizing function but do not interfere with the RBD-ACE2

191

interaction (15, 18). Indeed, most of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) previously

192

developed against SARS-CoV target the RBD epitopes, while a few are directed against the

193

S2 subunit or the S1/S2 cleavage site

194

SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized, and it was found that many SARS-CoV-neutralizing

195

mAbs exhibit no cross-neutralizing capacity (9, 31). For example, CR3022, a neutralizing

196

antibody isolated from a convalescent SARS patient, cross-reacted with the RBD of

197

SARS-CoV-2 but did not neutralize the virus (31, 32). Nonetheless, a new human anti-RBD

198

mAb, 47D11, has just been isolated from transgenic mice immunized with a SARS-CoV S

199

protein, which neutralizes both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (33). The results of polyclonal

200

antisera from immunized animals are quite inconsistent. For examples, Walls et al. reported

201

that plasma from four mice immunized with a SARS-CoV S protein could completely inhibit

202

SARS-CoV pseudovirus and reduced SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to ~10% of control, thus

203

proposing that immunity against one virus of the sarbecovirus subgenus can potentially

204

provide protection against related viruses (4); two rabbit sera raised against the S1 subunit of

205

SARS-CoV also reduced SARS-CoV-2-S-driven cell entry, although with lower efficiency as

206

compared to SARS-CoV-S (26). Moreover, four mouse antisera against the SARS-CoV RBD

207

cross-reacted efficiently with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralized SARS-CoV-2,

208

suggesting the potential to develop a SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccine preventing

209

SARS-CoV-2 either (34). Differently, it was reported that plasma from mice infected or

210

immunized by SARS-CoV failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (28),

(29, 30). The cross-reactivity of such mAbs with

10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.052126; this version posted April 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

211

and mouse antisera raised against the SARS-CoV RBD were even unable to bind to the S

212

protein of SARS-CoV-2 (9). In our studies, several panels of antisera against the SARS-CoV

213

S and RBD proteins were comprehensively characterized, which provided convincing data to

214

validate the cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

215

Meaningfully, this work found that the RBD proteins derived from different SARS-CoV

216

strains can elicit antibodies with unique functionalities: while the RBD from a palm civet

217

SARS-CoV (SZ16) induced potent antibodies capable of blocking the RBD-receptor binding,

218

the antibodies elicited by the RBD derived from a human strain (GD03) had no such effect

219

despite their neutralizing activities. SZ16-RBD shares an overall 74% amino-acid sequence

220

identity with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, when their internal receptor-binding motifs (RBM)

221

display more dramatic substitutions (~50% sequence identity); however, SZ16-RBD and

222

GD03-RBD only differ from three amino acids, all locate within the RBM. How these

223

mutations change the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the S protein and RBD

224

immunogens requires more efforts.

225

Lastly, we would like to discuss three more questions. First, it is intriguing to know

226

whether individuals who recovered from previous SARS-CoV infection can recall the

227

immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this, an epidemiological investigation on the

228

populations exposed to SARS-CoV-2 would provide valuable insights. Second, whether a

229

universe vaccine can be rationally designed by engineering the S protein RBD sequences.

230

Third, although antibody-dependent infection enhancement (ADE) was not observed during

231

our studies with the human and animal serum antibodies, this effect should be carefully

232

addressed in vaccine development.

Recombinant S proteins

460

Two RBD-Fc fusion proteins, which contain the RBD sequence of Himalayan palm civet

461

SARS-CoV strain SZ16 (GenBank: AY304488.1) or the RBD sequence of human SARS-CoV

462

strain GD03T0013 (GenBank: AY525636.1, denoted GD03) linked to the Fc domain of

463

human IgG1, were expressed in transfected 293T cells and purified with protein A-Sepharose

464

4 Fast Flow in our laboratory as previously described (15). A full-length S protein of

465

SARS-CoV Urbani (GenBank: AY278741) was expressed in expressSF+ insect cells with

466

recombinant baculovirus D3252 by the Protein Sciences Corporation (Bridgeport, CT, USA)

467

(16). A panel of recombinant proteins with a C-terminal polyhistidine (His) tag, including S1

468

and RBD of SARS-CoV (GenBank: AAX16192.1) and S ectodomain (S-ecto), S1, RBD, and

469

S2 of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: YP_009724390.1), were purchased from the Sino Biological

470

471

Serum samples from recovered SARS patients

472

Twenty SARS patients were enrolled in March 2003 for a follow-up study at the Peking

473

Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing. Serum samples were collected from recovered

474

patients at 3-6 months after discharge, with the patients’ written consent and the approval of

475

the ethics review committee (23, 24). The samples were stored in aliquots at -80°C and were

476

heat-inactivated at 56°C before performing experiments.

477

Animal immunizations

20 μg of SZ16-RBD or GD03-RBD fusion proteins plus MLP-TDM adjuvant. The mice were

483

boosted two times with 10 μg of the same antigens plus the MLP-TDM adjuvants at 3-week

484

intervals. Third, four New Zealand White rabbits (12 weeks old) were immunized

485

intradermally with 150 μg of SZ16-RBD or GD03-RBD resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2) in the

486

presence of Freund’s complete adjuvant and boosted two times with 150 μg of the same

487

antigens plus incomplete Freund’s adjuvant at 3-week intervals. Mouse and rabbit antisera

488

were collected and stored at -40°C.

489

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

490

Binding activity of serum antibodies with diverse S protein antigens was detected by ELISA.

491

In brief, 50 ng of a purified recombinant protein (SARS-CoV S1 or RBD and SARS-CoV-2

492

S-ecto, S1, RBD, or S2) were coated into a 96-well ELISA plate overnight at 4°C. Wells were

493

blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 hour at 37°C, followed by

494

incubation with 1:100 diluted antisera or serially diluted purified rabbit antibodies for 1 hour

495

at 37°C. A diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human, mouse or rabbit

496

IgG antibody was added for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed five times

497

between each step with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. Wells were developed using

498

3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and read at 450 nm after terminated with 2M H2SO4.

499

Neutralization assay

500

Neutralizing activity of serum antibodies was measured by pseudovirus-based single cycle

501

infection assay. The pseudovirus particles were prepared by co-transfecting HEK293T cells

504

(IPBCAMS-WH-01; GenBank: QHU36824.1) or SARS-CoV (GD03T0013) or the G protein

505

of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Cell culture supernatants containing virions were

506

harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtrated and stored at -80oC. To measure the neutralizing

507

activity of serum antibodies, a pseudovirus was mixed with an equal volume of serially

508

diluted sera or purified antibodies and incubated at 37 oC for 30 min. The mixture was then

509

added to 293T/ACE2 cells at a density of 104 cells/100 μl per plate well. After cultured at 37

o

511

(relative luminescence unit, RLU) was measured using luciferase assay reagents and a

512

luminescence counter (Promega, Madison, WI). Percent inhibition of serum antibodies

513

compared to the level of the virus control subtracted from that of the cell control was

514

calculated. The highest dilution of the serum sample that reduced infection by 50% or more

515

was considered to be positive.

516

Flow cytometry assay

517

Blocking activity of purified rabbit anti-RBD antibodies on the binding of RBD protein with a

518

His tag to 293T/ACE2 cells was detected by flow cytometry assay. Briefly, 2 μg/ml of

519

SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein or 10 μg/ml of SARS-CoV RBD protein were added to 4 x 105 of

520

cells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After washed with PBS two times, cells

521

were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled rabbit anti-His tag antibody

522

(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for 30 min at room temperature. After two washes,

523

cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by FACSCantoII instrument (Becton Dickinson,

C for 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in reporter lysis buffer, and luciferase activity

Statistical analysis

526

Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 7 Software. One-way or two-way

527

analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett posttest was used to test for statistical

528

significance. Only p values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant (p>0.05

529

[ns, not significant], p ≤ 0.05 [*], p ≤ 0.01 [**], p ≤ 0.001 [***]).
