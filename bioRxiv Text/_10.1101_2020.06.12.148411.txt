Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data available
about COVID-19 during pregnancy have demonstrated placental infection; however, the
intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still debated. Intriguingly, while canonical
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mediators are expressed at low levels in placental cells, the
receptors for viruses that cause congenital infections such as the cytomegalovirus and Zika
virus are highly expressed in these cells. Here we analyzed the transcriptional profile
(microarray and single-cell RNA-Seq) of proteins potentially interacting with coronaviruses
to identify non- canonical mediators of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the
placenta. We show that, despite low levels of the canonical cell entry mediators ACE2 and
TMPRSS2, cells of the syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast, and extravillous
trophoblast co-express high levels of the potential non-canonical cell-entry mediators DPP4
and CTSL. We also found changes in the expression of DAAM1 and PAICS genes during
pregnancy, which are translated into proteins also predicted to interact with coronaviruses
proteins. These results provide new insight into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and
host proteins that may act as non-canonical routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection and
replication in the placenta cells.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). It was first notified at the
end of 2019, in Wuhan, China, and become a worldwide pandemic (2). At the beginning of
July, six months later, COVID-19 infected over 12 million people and is the cause of
approximately 557,000 deaths worldwide (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).
Older age, laboratory abnormalities, and several comorbidities are associated with
the more severe cases of COVID-19 (3). For specific groups of COVID-19 patients, for
example, pregnant women, the potential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains mostly
unknown, and data are limited. However, considering previous works reporting
coronaviruses infections (4), pregnant women are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection
due to physiological changes in the immune, cardiorespiratory, and metabolic systems (5).
Although only a small number of maternal viruses infections are transmitted to the
fetus, some may cause life-threatening diseases (6). These viruses use cellular host entry
mediators expressed by placenta cells, as described for the cytomegalovirus and the Zika
virus (7, 8), to infect these cells. The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak, associated with fetal
brain damage, emphasizes the necessity of further characterization and understanding
placental infection or intrauterine (vertical) transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the
possible adverse fetal outcomes. The few studies on the subject have provided
contradictory findings, with some reports suggesting no evidence of placental infection or
vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (9–11). Conversely, multiple lines of evidence have
shown placental SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women diagnosed with moderate to
severe COVID-19. Neonates born from mothers with COVID-19 presented a positive
serological test for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG (12, 13). While the IgG
can be transferred from mother to fetus across the placenta, the detection of IgM in
newborns suggests a vertical transmission of the virus, since IgM cannot cross the placental
barrier due to its high molecular mass (14). Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA transmission
was comprehensively confirmed by pathological and virological investigations. (15) Also,
it was recently shown SARS-CoV-2 particles in syncytiotrophoblast with generalized
inflammation, diffuse perivillous fibrin depositions, and tissue damage in an asymptomatic
woman (16). Remarkably, these placental alterations due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection lead
to fetal distress and neonatal multi-organ failure. These results highlight the importance of

exploring the expression profile of potential host mediators of the SARS-CoV-2 that may
create a permissive microenvironment to placental infection and possible vertical
transmission of the virus.
In fact, like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 requires diverse host cellular factors for
infection and replication. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the canonical
receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) for viral
attachment (17). This process is followed by S protein priming by cellular transmembrane
serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that allows the fusion of the virus with host cellular
membranes (17). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has demonstrated that both
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in multiple tissues affected by COVID-19, including
airway epithelial cells, cornea, digestive and urogenital systems (18). Few cells express
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta (18, 19), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to
infect the placenta through the canonical cell entry mediators. Therefore, other host
interacting proteins may play a role in the biological cycle of the virus and contribute to the
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta. In this paper, we demonstrate, through
transcriptomic (microarray and scRNA-Seq) analysis and in silico predictions of virus-host
protein-protein interactions, that cells of the syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast,
and extravillous trophoblast express high levels of potential non-canonical cell-entry
mediators dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and cathepsin L (CTSL), despite low-levels of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2. These results open new avenues of investigation of the human
placenta infection by the SARS-CoV-2.

Results
Prediction of non-canonical routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection in human placenta cells
We first investigated the gene expression in placental tissues of classical host-virus
interacting proteins described in the literature. The canonical entry receptors ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 were low expressed throughout gestation. CTSL, which is translated into a
lysosomal cysteine proteinase that plays a role in intracellular protein catabolism presented the highest level of expression in the placenta during the first, second, and third
trimester. Similarly, DPP4, which is translated into an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein,
was highly expressed throughout gestation (Figure 1A).
Next, we analyzed the gene expression profile during gestation in placental tissues. We
found 25 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the second trimester, and 687 DEGs in
the third, when they were independently compared to the first trimester (Supplementary
Table 1). All DEGs were divided into three clusters by the K-means clustering analysis
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Cluster 1 includes genes that increase expression during
pregnancy, and these genes enriched terms related to blood vessels morphogenesis,
complement cascade, extracellular matrix organization, and cellular response to nitrogen
compounds. Cluster 2 encompasses genes that increase expression specifically in the third
trimesters, which are related to female pregnancy, growth hormone signaling pathway,
homeostasis, and steroid biosynthetic process. Cluster 3 includes genes that decrease
expression during pregnancy. and these genes enriched terms related to cell division, sulfur
compounds biosynthetic process, chromosomal segregation, PID MYC active pathway
(Supplementary Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 2). The gene expression changes
in the course of pregnancy revealed that the second and third trimesters enriched genes that
are associated with the placental growth, mainly in the third trimester (Supplementary
Figure 1C and Supplementary Table 3). Even with a high discrepancy between the
number of DEGs in second and third trimesters (25 and 687, respectively), we identified
similarities in the enriched terms between gene clusters (Supplementary Figure 1D) and
between the second and third trimesters of gestation (Supplementary Figure 1E).
We further asked whether the DEGs in the placenta during gestation are translated into
proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV proteins. Considering that the current
cases of SARS-CoV-2 placental infection are mainly related to the third trimester of
pregnancy (15, 20), we selected the 687 DEGs in the placenta in the third trimester

compared to the first trimester and, among them, 474 and 213 were up- and downregulated, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Next, we selected the human proteins
potentially interacting with SARS-CoV using the P-HIPSter database. We found 32 virushost interacting proteins of SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table 4), and nine virus-host
interacting proteins of the ZIKV (Supplementary Table 5). We also found that, from these
list of virus-host interacting proteins, 10 DEGs (DAAM1, FRMD3, STX3, HBD, PRKCZ,
CTK3, PAICS, EVL, TREM2, and HBE1) are translated into proteins that interact with
SARS-CoV proteins, and one with the ZIKV (Supplementary Figures 1F and 1G).
Among these 10 DEGs, six were up-regulated (DAAM1, FRMD3, STX3, HBD, PRKCZ,
and CTK3) and four (PAICS, EVL, TREM2, and HBE1) were down-regulated in the third
trimester (Figure 1B). The gene DAAM1, which is translated into an intrinsic membrane
glycoprotein implicated in cell motility, adhesion, cytokinesis, and cell polarity - showed
the highest level of fold change in the third trimester of gestation compared to the first
(logFC= 1.43; Figure 1B). The host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPI) predicted for
these 10 DEGs presented a Likelihood Ratio (LR) > 100 (Supplementary Table 6),
according to P-HIPSTer (21). Noteworthy, PAICS transcript, which is translated into an
enzyme that catalyzes the sixth and seventh steps of the novo purine biosynthesis, were
predicted to interact with both SARS-CoV and ZIKV (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Table 7). We observed a significant interaction of placental proteins predicted to interact
with SARS-CoV-2 (based on the DEGs or not), and PAICS was also predicted to interact
with other proteins in the PPI network with the highest degree (Figure 1C and
Supplementary Table 8).
We next used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the expression of the 10 DEGs
translated into proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV in human placental cells
(Supplementary Figures 1H and 1I). We selected the genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL,
DPP4, PAICS, and DAAM1 for further investigations using scRNA-seq transcriptome data
from cells of the syncytiotrophoblast (n=1144), villous cytotrophoblast (n=8244), and
extravillous trophoblast (n=2170) of non-disease human placental tissues, considering the
potential relevance of these genes for SARS-CoV infection and replication in the organ
(Figure 1D). We noticed that the expression of the classical SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor
genes (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was minimally expressed in these cells. In contrast, potential
non-canonical cell entry mediator genes DPP4 and CTSL, as well as the genes for the
predicted virus-host interaction proteins DAAM1, and PAICS were expressed at higher

levels (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 2A). We also looked for the co-expression
of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with DPP4, CTSL, DAAM1, and PAICS by using scRNA-Seq in
these same cells (Figure 2). This analysis revealed that DPP4, CTSL, DAAM1, and PAICS
are co-expressed at high-levels, while these genes are co-express at low levels with ACE2
and TMPRSS2 (Figure 2). Remarkably, we found only three cells co-expressing ACE2 and
TMPRSS2. For this reason, we consider that DPP4, CTSL, DAAM1, and PAICS may
represent candidates of an alternative route for SARS-CoV-2 infection in human placentas.
We used The Human Protein Atlas to predict the subcellular location of proteins encoded
by our candidates. DPP4 is predicted as intracellular, membrane, and secreted protein;
CTSL is a protein located in the Golgi apparatus and additionally in vesicles; PAICS is a
protein found in the cytosol while DAAM1 is located in the plasma membrane and cytosol
(Figure 1E). Finally, we analyzed the gene expression profile of ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL,
DPP4, DAAM1, and PAICS genes on publicly available scRNA-Seq datasets of lung, liver,
and thymus fetal tissues. CTSL, DPP4, and DAAM1 were found as highly expressed in fetal
cells compared to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in all tissues analyzed (Supplementary Figure 2).
Additional investigations may determine the generality and impact of these findings,
including the confirmation of vertical transmission.

Discussion
Recent literature has shown placenta cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant
women diagnosed with moderate to severe COVID-19 (15, 22) with findings supporting the
possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (15, 23). However, few placenta cells
express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (18, 19) required for virus entry, raising the question about
whether potential non-canonical molecular mechanisms may be involved in the biological
cycle of the virus in these cells. Here, we demonstrated by transcriptomic analyses
(microarray and scRNA-Seq) and in silico predictions of virus-host protein-protein
interactions that, despite low-levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, villous trophoblast cells
express high levels of the potential non-canonical cell-entry mediators DPP4 and CTSL.
We also found changes in the expression of DAAM1 and PAICS genes that code for
proteins predicted to interact with SARS-CoV proteins during pregnancy. These results
provide evidence of potential host-virus PPI that may lead to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
replication in the human placenta.
Firstly, we characterized the expression of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV entryassociated receptors and proteases genes, which revealed that DPP4 and CTSL are highly
expressed in villous trophoblast cells during pregnancy. DPP4 has a high affinity to the
SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain, (24) and critical DPP4 residues share the
SARS-CoV-2-S/DPP4 binding as found for MERS-CoV-S/DPP4 (27). In a pioneer study
based on SARS-CoV cell entry mechanisms, Simmons et al. (25) described a three-step
method for host-virus membrane fusion, involving receptor-binding and induced
conformational changes in S glycoprotein with subsequent CTSL proteolysis and activation
of membrane fusion within endosomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been
further demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can use CTSB and CTSL as well as TMPRSS2 for
priming host cells (26, 27). These data provide evidence that CTSL is a potentially
promising treatment for COVID-19 by blocking coronavirus host cell entry and
intracellular replication (28). Secondly, we analyzed whether placental development and
growth are associated with transcriptional changes in proteins that potentially interact with
SARS-CoV. Among the transcripts translated into proteins predicted as interacting with
SARS-CoV, DAAM1 increased with placental development and growth. DAAM1 was
previously identified as a regulator of bacteria phagocytosis by regulating filopodia
formation and phagocytic uptake in primary human macrophages (29). We predicted that
DAAM1 potentially interact with the viral protein encoded from open reading frame 8

(ORF8) and the hypothetical protein sars7a of SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV ORF8 shares
the lowest homology with all SARS-CoV-2 proteins; however, it was previously
demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 expression was able to selectively target MHC-I for
lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism in different cell types (30).
We found that PAICS transcript, which is also translated into a protein predicted as
interacting with the Nsp3 of SARS-CoV, decreased its levels with placental development
and growth. PAICS is an enzyme of de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, which was
previously predicted as having a putative interaction with the human influenza A virus
(IAV) nucleoprotein and was up-regulated during IAV infection (31). The putative
interaction of Nsp3 with PAICS is relevant. Nsp3 is one of the 16 non-structural proteins in
the replicase ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (1, 32), and binds to virus
RNA and proteins, including the nucleocapsid protein (33). Considering the low-levels of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 that we found in villous trophoblast cells, our results provide
evidence of alternatives cell-entry mediators in the placenta. Moreover, the description of
the potential interaction between host and SARS-CoV-2 may provide insights into the
mechanisms of placental infection in women with COVID-19.
Cellular and molecular composition play a role in placenta infection and intrauterine
transmission of viruses (34, 35). Thus, we finally used single-cell analysis of the
syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblasts - the fetal
component of the placenta - that confirmed the low-levels of expression of the canonical
entry receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes (18, 19). Conversely, we found that these cells
express high-levels of DPP4 and CTSL, two potential mediators of SARS-Cov-2 host cell
entry (24, 27) that may contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 infection (15, 22, 23). It is essential
to highlight that our scRNA-Seq analysis showed that the non-canonical DPP4 and CTSL
entry genes (24, 27) are highly co-expressed in syncytiotrophoblast, villous
cytotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblasts cells. The transcripts DAAM1 and PAICS,
which are translated into proteins predicted as potentially interacting with SARS-CoV-2,
were also highly co-expressed with DPP4 and CTSL. These results demonstrate that,
although ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are poorly expressed in the placenta, other mediators that
potentially interact with the virus are highly co-expressed in villous trophoblast cells and,
therefore, may represent a valuable alternative route for infection and viral replication.
Although our in-silico analyses are a starting point, they have limitations. We
reanalyzed published placenta datasets with a limited number of samples (microarray = 12

individuals, and scRNA-seq = 5 individuals) and, consequently, validations in a large
cohort of samples must be performed. The predicted interactions presented here should also
be experimentally validated in infected cells or placenta to circumvent these limitations.
Moreover, the analyses of single-cell data should be conducted for the entire period of
gestation, considering that we only evaluated single-cell data from the first trimester of
pregnancy. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta needs to be performed in a large
cohort of pregnant women with COVID-19, including asymptomatics. Considering that
vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still debated, the follow-up of newborns from
mothers with COVID-19 during pregnancy should be necessary since, if it occurs even in
the non-asymptomatic, the long-term consequences are mostly unknown.
In conclusion, despite low-levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, our analyses demonstrate
that villous trophoblast cells express high levels of potential non-canonical cell-entry
mediators DDP4 and CTSL. We also found changes in the expression of the DAAM1 and
PAICS genes coding for proteins predicted to interact with SARS-CoV proteins during
pregnancy. These results provide new insight into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2
and the host proteins and indicate that coronaviruses may use multiple mediators for virus
infection and replication.

Materials and Methods
Differential expression analysis of the placenta during pregnancy trimesters
We reanalyzed microarray data from villous trophoblast tissues of first (45-59 days,
n = 4), second trimester (109-115 days, n = 4), and third trimesters (n = 4) available in
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), under the accession number GSE9984 (36). Next, we
identified the DEGs during the pregnancy, by comparing the second trimester and third

tool

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r. Genes with Log2 of Fold Change ≥ |0.5| and

expression profiles during pregnancy by using the K-means clustering analysis based on
One Minus Pearson Correlation (Robust Multi-array Average, RMA, normalization log2,
K-means = 3).
Enrichment analysis
We used the Metascape tool (https://metascape.org) (37) to perform functional
enrichment analysis of the genes lists generated in the clustering and differential expression
analyses.
Placenta proteins that potentially interact with coronaviruses and Zika virus
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mediators were selected for first screening using the human
proteins already described in the COVID-19 Cell Atlas (https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/)
and the literature (18, 24, 27, 38). Next, we used gene expression data to generated a list of
PPIs that potentially interact with human coronaviruses and the ZIKV from the Pathogen–
Host Interactome Prediction using Structure Similarity (P-HIPSTer, http://phipster.org/)
database (23) (Supplementary Table 4 and 5, respectively). SARS-CoV was included in
the analysis considering the evolutionary relationship between the novel SARS-CoV-2
(38), and ZIKV considering its impact on placental infection and fetal microcephaly (7, 34).
