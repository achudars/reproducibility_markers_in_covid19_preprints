Abstract: Current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally within a
matter of months. The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and
contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease
progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these
host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes
underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their
epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key
immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active
epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across
different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are
among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been
designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and
inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher
positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key
cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both
ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species
compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as nonISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs
and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict
COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in
people of different subgroups.

First identified in Wuhan, China, last December, the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) has spread worldwide and caused over 0.68/17 million confirmed deaths and
infected cases across 200 countries by the end of July 2020 [1,2]. COVID-19 stands out as a
new zoonotic disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) [3], which, in the view of a virus, obtains an effective balance between its deadliness
and contagiousness in humans [4,5]. In line with that, patients with the ages over 45,
especially 75 years old had a worse prognosis and 5-10 fold higher mortal rate than
younger ones at 0-17 years old, who mostly showed a mild disease or even asymptomatic
[6-15]. Similarly, higher mortality rates were observed in males than females, and
particularly in the patients who have pre-existing medical conditions (comorbidities)
regardless of gender or age [6-15]. These underlying comorbidities include diabetes,
cancer, immunodeficiency, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, asthma and lung
disease, kidney disease, as well as chronic GI/liver disorders. In addition to predictable
symptoms of cough, fever and headache from the lung infection, the virus can spread to
almost every organ including the brain, heart, gut, kidneys and skin to cause organspecific problems [6-15]. Therefore, from the view of the host, SARS-CoV2 susceptibility
and disease progression of COVID-19 is a phenomenon of epigenetic regulation, which
underlies the diversity of the disease progression throughout the body system and across
different patients that share a near identical genetic background [16-19].

Zoonosis and reverse zoonosis infer a dynamic exchange of pathogens between humans
and animals, particularly domestic and wild vertebrates. This constitutes a major challenge
for both public health and animal health, and unites them into ONE ecological health.
Therefore, the potential infection of SARS-CoV2 in both wild and domestic animals raises
a big public health concern after the COVID-19 prevalence in human society [20,21]. This
concern emphasizes: (1) the identification of reservoir animal species that originally
passing SARS-CoV2 to humans; and (2) potential risks of infected people passing the virus
to animals, particularly domestic species, to form an amplifying zoonotic cycle and
exacerbate SARS-CoV2 evolution and cross-species transmission [20,21]. Recent studies
provided evidence that domestic cats and dogs could be virally or serologically positive
for SARS-CoV2 [22-28], as were several Bronx zoo tigers [29]. Several studies, using
experimental inoculations of human SARS-CoV2 isolates, demonstrated that ferrets,
hamsters, domestic cats and some non-human primate species were susceptible to human
SARS-CoV2 strains; however, pigs, alpacas, and (putatively) cattle are not [22-29].
Previously, we and several others have proposed structural simulation models of ACE2
and the viral S-Receptor binding domain (S-RBD) to predict SARS-CoV2 susceptibility
across representative vertebrates, especially major domestic and wild mammalian species
[30-33]. The structural affinity between ACE2 and S-RBD plays a primary role in the viral
attachment and accessibility in cells, and the specific early cellular responses that regulate
ACE2 expression and signal early immune responses determine the host susceptibility to
the virus [34-40]. We propose an integrative model, which incorporates both ACE2-RBD
structural affinity (primarily determined by cross-species genetic difference) and
epigenetic regulation of key genes during the early phase of the virus-host interaction, to
predict host COVID-19 susceptibility and disease progression [30-33].

Among the core host factors that determine COVID-19 susceptibility and early disease
progression, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and interleukin (IL)-6 were focused

upon because of their critical roles directly involved in viral infection and host
immunopathies [41-45]. In SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis, ACE2 serves as primary receptors
for cell attachment and entry [42,43]. Several groups have reported that SARS-CoV2 exerts
higher receptor affinity to human ACE2 than other coronaviruses, which may contribute
to the high-contagiousness and rapid spread of SARS-CoV2 in humans [42,43]. Being a key
enzyme in the body’s renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE2 catalyzes
angiotensinogen (AGT) to produce the active forms of hormonal angiotensin (Ang) 1-9,
which directly regulate the blood volume/pressure, body fluid balance, sodium and water
retention, as well as co-opt multiple effects on inflammation, apoptosis, and generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) [43-45]. In this regard, not only do the virus direct binding
and functional impairment of ACE2 enzymatic function serve as a physio-pathological
mechanism underlying COVID-19 disease complex, but also epigenetic regulation of
ACE2 expression in various tissues/conditions, especially of that related to blood clotting,
aneurism and chilblains in infant patients [43-46].

SARS-CoV2 seizes ACE2 for cell entry, which is followed by a cytokine-related syndrome,
namely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Plausibly, the occupancy of the ACE2
catalytic domain by the viral Spike protein (S) blocks AGT activation into Ang1-9 and
leads to the accumulation of Ang2 in the serum [43-46]. Circulatory increase of Ang2
induces inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and soluble IL-6 receptor α (sIL6Rα) in pneumocytes and macrophages, through binding Ang1-receptor (AT1R) and
activating disintegrin- and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17)-mediated cascade [41-46]. This
process is followed by activation of the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6-AMP), which co-activates NFκB and transcription factor STAT3 to enhance inflammatory response and leads to ARDS
underlying COVID-19. Ang2-AT1R activation also induces pyroptosis, a highly
inflammatory form of programmed cell death accompanying cytotoxicity caused by viral
infections [41,45,46]. Aggregately, SARS-CoV2 itself also activates NF-κB via various
pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) [33-40]. Therefore, IL-6 and IL-6 AMP are biomarkers
of hyperactivation of inflammatory machinery exacerbated by ACE2 blocking and viral
infection, which represent key cytokines in deciphering cytokine-related syndrome and
disease progression of COVID-19 [41,45,46].

The expression of ACE2 is inter-regulated by multiple physio-pathological factors,
including intracellular pathogenic infection, pre-existing inflammatory condition from
comorbidities, and inflammatory cytokines including TNF and IFNs [41-46]. Several recent
studies demonstrated that human ACE2 gene behaved like an interferon-stimulated gene
(ISG) and was stimulated by viral infection and IFN treatment; however, mouse Ace2 gene
was not [47-49]. Canonical ISGs describe over a thousand cellular genes that are induced
by IFN simulation via the IFN-JAK-STAT signaling axis [50]. These canonical ISGs are
mainly induced by type I and type III IFNs but overlap with those upregulated by type II
IFN (i.e. IFN-γ) [47-50]. These ISGs comprise a frontline of antiviral immunity to restrict
virus spreading from the initial infection sites [50]. However, based on gene evolution and
epigenetic analyses, ACE2 may not be a member of these classical antiviral ISGs, and more
likely belong to the non-canonical ISGs (non-ISGs) like IL-6 (a.k.a. IFN-β2 in humans) [4751]. These non-ISGs are primed under a pre-inflammatory condition and stimulated by
IFN or IFN plus TNF through an epigenetic cascade involving positive histone
modification (mainly H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) to increase chromatin accessibility for
binding by transcription factors including PU.1, IRFs, and NF-κB and culminating in non-

ISGs expression (Figure 1) [51-54]. To confirm that, we conducted cross-species
comparative analysis between IL-6 and ACE2 genes. First, annotation of ENCODE
epigenetic datasets discovered similarity of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac markers between IL-6
and ACE2 gene promoters in both humans and mice; however, significantly higher Zscores and enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in human IL-6 and ACE2 genes were
detected than in their mouse orthologs, respectively [55]. Second, detection of cisregulatory elements (CREs) that bind core transcription factors of non-ISGs, including
PU.1, IRFs, and NF-κB, in ACE2 and IL-6 gene proximal promoter regions across 25
representative animal species [56]. Third, we found that the evolutionary increase of
ACE2, and especially the IL-6 genes response to inflammatory and IFN signaling may
serve as epigenetic marker for COVID-19 susceptibility in some animal species including
humans. Finally, using our non-biased RNA-Seq data, we further categorize some more
non-ISGs that resemble the expression pattern of either IL-6 or ACE2 [57]. Notably, we
detected two ACE2 isoforms, which differ in both proximal promoters and coding regions,
in some livestock species including pigs, dogs and cattle [30]. In pigs, the ACE2 short
isoform (ACE2S) has an expression pattern similar to IL-6 than the long isoform (ACE2L).
Collectively, our findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs responding
differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling, and their epigenetic properties may serve
as biomarkers to predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates longitudinally and
partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups [20,30-33].

2.1. Epigenetic processes in induction of non-canonical IFN-stimulated genes (non-ISGs):
Studied mostly in humans and mice, the hundreds of classical ISGs, such as ISG15 and
IRF1 , contain the main IFN-responsive CREs, including IFN-stimulated regulatory
element (ISRE) and γ-activated sequence (GAS), in their promoter regions [47,50]. The
tripartite IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which is composed of three transcription
factors including STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9, is activated downstream of the IFN-JAK-STAT
signaling axis to bind ISREs and stimulate canonical ISG expression [47,50]. In addition to
this classical axis to induce ISGs, IFNs also co-opt multiple non-canonical signaling
pathways to activate these ISGs or other corresponding genes together through various
alterative mechanisms [51-54]. These non-canonical IFN signaling pathways involve
extensive crosstalk between the signaling pathways mediated by various cellular pathogen
pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-1, IL-6 and
TNF [51-54]. The non-canonical signaling pathways not only diversify mechanisms for
inducing ISGs, but also extend the spectrum of IFN-responsive genes, indicating a
multifunctional property of IFNs in antiviral and immuno-physiological regulation [5054]. Recent studies showed that human IL-6 and ACE2 are two candidates for these nonISGs [47-51]. Figure 1 shows current understanding of the gene activation cascade of
human IL-6 (and plausibly ACE2) genes as an example of non-ISGs, whose IFN-inductive
property and systemic role recently recognized as underlying multiple inflammatory
comorbidities [51,54]. In brief, stimulation of epithelial cells and tissue macrophages by
early pro-inflammatory signaling of TNF induces transient expression of TNF-target genes
encoding inflammatory mediators, such as IL6 and TNF. This is followed by a transient
state that is insensitive to further inflammatory signaling from TLR activation, and thus
relevant chromatin containing non-ISGs is not activated (depicted by a grey shade in Fig.

1). This transient suppression state, however, can be activated by a co-stimulation with
TNF plus IFN-α resulting in increase of positive histone markers (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac)
and chromatin accessibility of the gene promoter regions, which sequentially recruit the
binding of corresponding transcription factors including IRFs and NF-κB to activate nonISG expression [51,54]. Besides IL-6, many tunable ISGs including human ACE2 as
demonstrated in recent studies show sustainable response to IFN and pathogenic
inflammatory signaling, and share expression patterns involving epigenetic sensation and
synergistic IFN-induction as depicted for non-ISGs (Figure 1) [47-54]. However, the crossspecies evolutionary characterization of non-ISGs has not been studied. Using IL-6 and
ACE2 as examples, extensive epigenetic and expression analyses were performed in this
study to determine their epigenetic evolution and potential role as biomarkers to predict
the susceptibility and disease progression of COVID-19.

Epigenetic positive histone modification in a certain chromatin region, mainly including
histone H3 with tri-methylation at the 4th lysine residue (H3K4me3) or with the acetylation
at the 27th lysine residue (H3K27ac) here, is associated with a higher activation status of
adjacent gene transcription, thus defined as active enhancer markers in epigenetic
analyses. The enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac defines one epigenetic feature of nonISGs post activation [51-55]. Through annotation of Chip-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets from
839 and 157 cell/tissue types of humans and mice through ENCODE
(https://www.encodeproject.org/) [55], we detected significant and comparative existence
of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac markers between IL-6 and ACE2 gene promoters in various
humans and mouse samples (Figure 2). However, higher Z-scores and enrichment of
H3K4me3 and H3K27ac were found in human IL-6 and ACE2 genes (Figure 2A and 2B)
than their mouse orthologs (Figure 2C and 2D). In both distal and proximal regions of the
ACE2 gene promoters, the human gene (Figure 2A) was marked by 2-3 fold more of these
positive histone medication than the mouse ortholog, indicating higher activation and
transcription activity of human IL-6 and ACE2 genes under similar conditions. Because
these findings are extracted from the extensive datasets representing systemic sample
types, it is convincing that typical epigenetic positive histone modification, H3K4me3 and
H3K27ac, is significantly associated with the promoter regions of ACE2 as with IL-6 genes.
Specifically, IL-6 genes were shown to have more histone modifications around their
proximal promoter regions than ACE2 genes, which had more in distal regions. There
were higher Z-score and enrichment of these positive histone markers in the human genes
than their mouse orthologs, indicating evolutionary and probably species-specific manner
of epigenetic regulation of these non-ISGs [51,54]. This epigenetic difference of key nonISGs might contribute to disease susceptibility and progression when animals of different
species are exposed to same pathogenic pressure.

examined the existence of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that interact with typical nonISGs transcription factors including PU.1 (a.k.a. SPI1), IRFs, and NF-κB1/2 in the promoter

regions of IL-6 and ACE2 gene orthologs [50-56]. We extracted the primal promoter
sequences from IL-6 and ACE2 genes from 25 representative vertebrate species, which
contain ten previously validated SARS-CoV2-susceptible species and other naturally
unsusceptible species based on collected evidence [26-30]. As shown in Figure 3, all three
types of CREs (i.e. PU.1, IRFs, and NF-κB) that mark non-ISG expression were mapped for
cross-species existence in the promoter regions of both IL-6 and ACE2 genes. Significant
PWM scores (p < 0.0001) were determined for their CREs when each was compared with
the corresponding human CRE matrix (Figure 3A-3C) [56]. ACE2 genes had a generally
lower PWM scores for these CREs than those for IL-6 genes, in particular the PWM scores
for NF-κB2 CRE in ACE2 genes were at 2-8 Log2units lower (Figure 3D). This indicates
that ACE2 genes were less responsive to non-canonical NF-κB signaling mediated by NFκB2 [58,59]. Because dysregulation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling has been well known
for contribution to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the differential role of
ACE2 and IL-6 in inflammatory immunopathies are worth further investigation [58,59].
Notably, only CRE matrices to IRF1 were shown in Figure 3C, both ACE2 and IL-6 gene
promoters actually contain CREs binding IRF2-8 with high PWM scores, except of CREs
interacting with IRF5 and IRF9 had low PWM scores in most tested species (Figure 4 and
Figure 5). Because IRF9 is a key component of ISGF3 and binding to ISREs to activate
canonical ISG expression, this discovery evidently differs ACE2 and IL-6 genes from the
classical ISGs such as ISG15 and IRF1 (Figure 4) [50,51]. However, IL-6 genes of eight
species maintain their IRF9 binding CREs as for examples in Zebrafish and frogs, only rat
ACE2 gene showed a high PWM score for containing an IRF9 binding CRE (Figure 4). This
further postulates a species-dependent trend of non-ISG evolution, and warrants further
investigation in contributing to host-pathogen interaction.

Figure 5 gathers cross-species analyses of mean PWM scores of the CREs, which bind
STAT1/2, PU.1 (a.k.a. SPI1), NF-κB1, NF-κB2, and multiple IRFs (including, IRF1-4, IRF7,
and IRF8 that show significant PWM scores with p<0.0001 under the algorithm’s default)
in the proximal promoter regions of IL-6 and ACE2 gene orthologs from the 25
representative vertebrate species. As shown, these bookmarking CREs for non-ISGs had
comparable Log2(mPWM) scores between ACE2 and IL-6 genes across different species
and also showed species-specific variation to some extent. IL-6 genes generally had a
higher mPWM scores for more of the tested animal species with CREs that bind STAT1/2
and IRFs downstream of IFN signaling (Figure 5A and 5E) [50, 52]. Of significant
difference between ACE2 and IL-6 genes was their CREs’ PWM scores pertinent to NF-κB1
and NF-κB2 (Figure 5C and 5D). Whereas ACE2 genes evolved to be slightly more
responsive to the canonical NF-κB1 signaling in most mammalian species (Figure 5C), IL-6
genes obtained much higher responsiveness to non-canonical NF-κB2 signaling (Figure
5D). Recent studies showed that defects in non-canonical NF-κB2 signaling are associated
with severe immune deficiencies, and dysregulation of this pathway contributes to the
pathogenesis of various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [58,59]. The epigenetic
difference of IL-6 and ACE2 genes downstream of canonical NF-κB1 and non-canonical
NF-κB2 signaling thus may serve as differential gene markers for inflammatory-related
syndromes [58,59].

As previously described, in addition to its core role in physiological regulation of blood
volume/pressure and body fluid balance, the RAAS also critically affects inflammation,
apoptosis, and other immune reactions. For instance, suppression of ACE2 increases Ang2
production to signal pro-inflammatory and apoptotic responses in affected tissues [44-46].
When exacerbated by infection of an intracellular pathogen, such as SARS-CoV2 in
COVID-19 cases, a high inflammatory form of programed cell death, known as pyroptosis,
is induced accompanying massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL1, IL-6, TNF and CXCL10 [41,45,46]. Because the potential clinical relevance to these CREs
in COVID-19, we performed a comparative study to determine if the COVID-19
susceptible animal species obtain some epigenetic features in these core CREs in regulation
of IL-6 and ACE2 expression. Figure 6 compares the mPWM scores of these core non-ISG
CREs between two groups: known SARS-CoV2 susceptible species [CoV2(+)] and
unsusceptible species [CoV2(-)]. Figure 6 shows that ACE2 and IL-6 genes from CoV2(+)
species contain CREs that have significantly higher mPWM scores. This indicates that in
some vertebrate species, non-ISGs like ACE2 and especially IL-6 genes evolve to obtain
high inductive propensity by inflammatory and IFN signaling [47-54]. Therefore, in
addition to the ACE2 structure and affinity to S-RBD, the epigenetic evolution for IL-6 and
ACE2 stimulation (reflected by higher mPWM scores), may serve as epigenetic biomarkers
(or triggers) for susceptibility prediction of COVID19 and other ARDS longitudinally
across vertebrates and horizontally in the subgroups of humans [30,47-54].
2.5. Overall comparison of phylogenic topologies between IL-6 and ACE2 gene promoter
sequences
In addition to focusing on epigenetic analysis of these non-ISG CREs, we also conducted
cross-species comparison of phylogenic topology between the full proximal promoter
sequences of IL-6 and ACE2 genes. Overall, the topology of the phylogenies of IL-6 and
ACE2 gene promoters are similar with a comparative topological score of 86.5 % (Figure 7).
Sharing a root of low vertebrates (D. rerio and/or X. tropicalis), the CoV2(+) species were
distributed within the clades containing primates, carnivores and glires. In contrast, all the
ruminant promoters were clustered into a most phylogenically distant clade and associated
with no CoV2(+) species (Figure 7). Comparison of the two phylogenies in detail showed
that the major difference came from the location of the chicken, rabbit, guinea pig, and pig.
In the IL-6 promoter phylogeny (Figure 7, left panel), chicken IL-6 promoter seems to derive
rodent IL-6 gene promoters after evolution from the fish and frog; in the ACE2 promoter
phylogeny (Figure 7, right panel), however, the chicken ACE2 promoter serves as a root leaf
with the zebrafish. The largest difference is between phylogenic positions of IL-6 and ACE2
gene promoters for pigs and guinea pigs. Whereas in the IL-6 promoter phylogeny, the pig
sisters to those of the alpaca and horse, within the Carnivore clade that contains most of the
validated CoV2(+) species in addition to the primate clade, porcine ACE2 gene promoter
was next to the ruminant clade that has no CoV2(+) species identified so far [20-29]. Guinea
pig as a rodent species has its IL-6 promoter surprisingly within the primate clade, but its
ACE2 promoter appears more primitive and shares the clade with the frog. Given the
primate and carnivore clades contain most identified CoV2(+) species, if pig and guinea pig
are proved to be CoV2(+) species, the IL-6 promoter phylogeny may better correlate to
CoV2(+) prediction; otherwise, the ACE2 promoter phylogeny correlates better. The rabbit

and otter, which occupy similar positions in both IL-6 and ACE2 promoter phylogenies,
may have a high potential to be CoV2(+) and COVID-19 susceptible based on this and
previous studies, which used epigenetic and structural models, respectively [30-33]. In this
regard, pigs and guinea pigs may serve as symbol species to estimate the epigenetic role of
non-ISGs in CoV2(+) prediction. No study has tested CoV2/COVID-19 susceptibility in
guinea pigs, but studies in pigs concluded the species was unsusceptible [20]. This may
indicate that the overall epigenetic feature of ACE2 genes better relates to CoV2(+) status in
some mammalian species. However, the study of key CRE scores of non-ISGs in Figure 6
indicates that IL-6 gene CRE scores have a higher correlation when compared between the
CoV2(+) and CoV2() species. This may reflect an etiological fact that CoV2(+) is necessary
but not sufficient for COVID-19 progression; and the latter is indeed dependent on the host
immune reaction, particularly the early ISGs and non-ISG responses studied here [51,54]. In
that regard, epigenetic evolution/regulation of ACE2 and IL-6 genes may signify two layers
of COVID-19 progression, i.e. ACE2 is better for CoV2(+) and IL-6 is better for downstream
COVID-19 symptoms [51,54,58,59].

Compared with canonical ISGs, studies of epigenetic regulation and expression of nonISGs have just started accompanying our understanding of their role in some autoimmune
and inflammatory diseases in recent years [50-54]. Although some non-canonical signaling
pathways, that are independent of the canonical IFN-JAK-ISGF3 axis, play a role in ISG
induction, the classification criteria of non-ISGs is not established [50-54]. Using IL-6 and
ACE2 genes as examples of non-ISGs, the disparity of their cross-response to
inflammatory and IFN signaling could be one way to classify them as IL-6-like or ACE2like groups. We therefore analyzed a non-biased transcriptome (RNA-Seq) dataset from
porcine alveolar macrophages treated with different stimuli and infected with a porcine
arterivirus, a respiratory virus belonging to Nidovirales with coronaviruses [57]. We chose
to use porcine transcriptome data because of the species-focus of our projects and the
anatomy and physiological resemblance between pigs and humans [57]. Figure 8 presents
the IL-6-like and ACE2-like groups, which were categorized based on their responsive
patterns to LPS and two types of IFNs (i.e. IFN-α or type I and type II IFN-γ) at the early
phase of 5 h post the treatment/infection [57]. These clustered IFN responsive genes were
mainly from the RAAS, TNF, IL-6, chemokine superfamilies. For IL-6 non-ISG group, all of
these genes showed robust stimulation by LPS as well as a weaker response to both IFNs
(Figure 8A). In contrast, the ACE2-group genes were insensitive to LPS, but were
upregulated significantly by both types of IFNs (Figure 8B). Compared with the canonical
group of ISGs (Figure 8C), which shows the highest response to the type I IFN-α, IL-6
group had a least increase upon IFN-α and a similar stimulation by IFN-γ as for ISGs; and
ACE2 group showed a mid-response to IFN-α but highest to IFN-γ (Figure 8A-8D). Figure
8D statistically demonstrates the stimulatory difference among three groups of IFNresponsive genes: (1) for ISGs: IFN-α >IFN-γ>LPS with a higher background expression in
PBS, IL-4 and IL-10 treatments; (2) for IL-6-like non-ISGs: LPS>IFN-γ>IFN-α with the
lowest background expression; and (3) for ACE2-like non-ISGs: IFN-γ>IFN-α >LPS with a
mid-background expression. Therefore, our classification of ISGs and non-ISGs represents

a complete scenario of gene response levels (i.e. at low, mid and high levels of responses to
LPS and two types of IFNs) to complement each other per their responsive propensity to
LPS, IFN-γ, and IFN-α. As previously described, most ISGs especially non-ISGs are interregulated through multiple canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways. The crosstalking of signaling pathways mediated by different types of IFNs and inflammatory
cytokines is dynamic to form into an intricate regulatory network underlying animal
immunity to determine disease pathogenesis in various situations [50-54]. So with the
functional extension of physiological genes, such as AGT and ACE2, the new discovery of
species-dependent response to viral infections and IFN stimulation, posits them as
immunogenetic factors critical to determining COVID-19 disease progression in addition
to its role as a major virus receptor [44-49]. Notably, several ACE2 isoforms have been
identified in humans and several major livestock species [30]. Our transcriptome analysis
also picked up one short porcine ACE2 isoform (ACE2S), its expression pattern actually is
more like IL-6 non-ISGs than the consensus ACE2 longer isoform (ACE2L) [30]. In
addition to ACE2, the AGT gene of the RAAS also showed a non-ISG property similar to
ACE2 (Figure 8A and 8B). Collectively, transcriptomic annotation afforded us to cluster
tentative non-ISGs that share expression patterns similar to IL-6 or ACE2 genes.
Interestingly, most of them belong to IL-6, TNF and chemokine superfamilies, whose roles
in regulation of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as in COVID-19
progression warrant further investigation.

Figure 9 depicts the working summary of this study for epigenetic evolution and
regulation of IL-6 and ACE2 as non-ISGs, indicating their potentials as biomarkers for
inflammatory syndrome underlying pathogenic viral infection such as of COVID-19. NonISGs such as those categorized by resemblance to IL-6 and ACE2 genes were sequentially
regulated by TNF, IFN and TLR signaling, which modify chromatin accessibility through
activating histone modification and recruitment of transcription factors including PU.1,
IRF and NF-κB binding on the promoter regions of these non-ISGs. In turn, it will amplify
the inflammatory loop through IL-6-mediated response and inducing more ACE2
expression, which collectively contributes to the occurrence of respiratory and
inflammatory syndromes as in COVID-19. Therefore, high expression of non-ISGs such as
IL-6 and ACE2 could be biomarkers for the exacerbation of inflammation underlying some
viral infections especially those like SARS-CoV2, which dysregulates the physiological
function of ACE2 in the RAAS-centric body systems. In addition, the cross-species
epigenetic evolution of these key physio-pathological genes may provide a key to decipher
molecular mechanisms underlying species-specific susceptibility to COVID-19 from the
host side.

Annotation of ENCODE epigenetic datasets: The profile of epigenetic markers relevant to
histone positive modification, mainly H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, were searched using the
gene symbols through the ENCODE public domain at https://www.encodeproject.org/
under the default condition [55]. The ENCODE datasets for generating the epigenetic
results include those mainly based on Chip-Seq and ATAC-Seq from 839 and 157

Promoter sequence extraction and alignment: The DNA sequences of the proximal promoters
of analyzed genes were extracted from NCBI Gene and relevant databases
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene). Both IL-6 and ACE2 genes and corresponding
transcripts have been well annotated in most representative vertebrate species. In most
cases, the annotations were double verified through the same Gene entries at Ensembl
(https://www.ensembl.org). The protein and DNA sequences were collected from all nonredundant transcript variants and further verified for expression using relevant RNA-Seq
data (NCBI GEO profiles). The proximal promoter region spans ~2.5 kb before the
predicted transcription (or translation) start site (TSS). The protein and DNA sequences
were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment tools of ClustalW or Muscle through
an EMBL-EBI port (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). Other sequence management was conducted
using programs at the Sequence Manipulation Suite (http://www.bioinformatics.org).
Sequence alignments were visualized using Jalview (http://www.jalview.org) and MEGAx
(https://www.megasoftware.net). Sequence similarity calculation and plotting were done
using SDT1.2 (http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~brejnev). Other than indicated, all programs were
run with default parameters [30].

Examining transcription factor binding sites in the gene promoters and PWM scoring: We use
two programs/databases to confirm each other for the major CRE predictions. The
regulatory elements (and corresponding binding factors) in the ~2.5 kb proximal promoter
regions were examined against both human/animal TFD Database using a program Nsite
(Version 5.2013, at http://www.softberry.com). The mean position weight matrix (PWM) of
key cis-elements in the proximal promoters were calculated using PWM tools through
https://ccg.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/pwmtools, and the binding motif matrices of examined TFs were
extracted from MEME-derived HOCOMOCOv11 TF collection affiliated with the PWM
tools [56]. The species-specific CRE sequences were then extracted from each promoter
sequence for alignments in Fig. 3.

Phylogenic analysis and topological comparison: Evolutionary analyses were conducted in
MEGA X as described. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum
Likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were
obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of
pairwise distances estimated using the Tamura-Nei model, and then selecting the topology
with superior log likelihood value. For topological comparison between phylogenic trees
generated using IL-6 and ACE2 gene proximal promoters, the phylogenies of Newick
strings were generated using the MEGA program, and topological comparison between
the Newick trees was performed with Compare2Trees at
(http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~ntmwn/compare2trees) to obtain the overall topological
scores. Other than indicated, all programs were run with default parameters as the
programs suggested.

Figure legends
Figure 1: Schematic of epigenetic regulation and interferon (IFN) signaling to coordinate induction
of non-canonical IFN-stimulated genes (non-ISGs). Stimulation of lung macrophages and epithelial
cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces transient expression of TNF-target genes encoding
inflammatory mediators, such as IL6 and TNF, followed by an insensitive state in which signaling
responses to TLR ligands are strongly suppressed, and chromatin is not activated (depicted by a grey
shade). This transient suppression state can be activated by a co-stimulation with TNF plus IFN-α
and results in increase of positive histone markers (mostly H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) and chromatin
accessibility, which further coordinate binding of IRFs and NF-κB transcription factors and lead to
non-ISG marker gene (such as IL-6) expression. Many inflammatory genes including angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as demonstrated in recent studies can be among these genes, which are
bookmarked with primed chromatin and subsequently exhibit a robust transcriptional response even
to very weak proximal TLR-induced signals, which may comprise a critical factor in exacerbation of
pulmonary inflammatory and COVID-19 syndrome. Adapted and redrawn from Barrat et al. (2019)
[51]. Abbreviations: ac, acetyl; me, methylation; Pol, polymerase; PU.1, transcription factor binding

cell/tissue types of humans and mice, respectively from https://www.encodeproject.org/).
Comparative existence of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac markers was detected between IL-6 and ACE2
gene promoters in either humans (A & B) and mice (C & D); however, higher Z-scores and enrichment
of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac were found in human IL-6 and ACE2 genes (A & B) than their orthologs
in mice (C & D).

Distal, >2000 bp before the transcription start sites (TSS), and proximal promoter

gene orthologs from the representative two SARS-CoV2-unsusceptible species (pigs and mice) and
seven susceptible species. All three types of CREs have comparable Log2(mPWM) scores between
ACE2 and IL-6 genes, except NF-κB2 that mediates non-canonical NF- κB response (D) has a
significant lower mPWN score (2-6 Log2 units), indicating ACE2 genes are among different non-ISGs
group other than IL-6.

susceptibility. Mean PWM (mPWM) scores were generated as described in previous figures, and
compared between two groups of known COVID-19 susceptible species [CoV2(+)] and unsusceptible
species [CoV2(-)]. This shows that ACE2 and especially IL-6 genes from CoV2(+) species contain the
CREs have significantly higher mPWM scores, indicating that in some vertebrate species, non-ISGs
like ACE2 and especially IL-6 genes evolved to obtain high inductive propensity by inflammatory

proximal promoters, the phylogenies of Newick strings were generated using the MEGA, and
topological comparison between the Newick trees was performed with Compare2Trees at

Figure 8: Genome-wide categorizing non-ISGs based on the similarity of inductive pattern to IL-6
and ACE2 genes. The non-biased genome-wide transcriptomic data was generated using a RNA-Seq
procedure in porcine lung macrophages stimulated with each of activation stimulator of IL-4, IL-10,
LPS, IFN-α or IFN-γ at 20 ng/ml and infected by porcine arterivirus virus for 5 h, using an Illumina
procedure as previously described [57]. Significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in reninangiotensin system (RAS), interleukin (IL)-6, TNF and chemokine super-families were annotated and
grouped using heatmaps according to their inductive expression patterns similar to: (A) IL-6, (B)
ACE2; (C) Examples of canonical ISGs as reference; (D) Averaged transcriptomic expression levels
(normalized at Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads, RPKM) of the grouped
ISGs or non-ISGs above. Indicated by arrows, pigs have two ACE2 isoforms, namely ACE2L and
ACE2S, which have different expression patterns, ACE2S similar to IL-6 was showing less responsive
to IFN-α but highly responsive to LPS and IFN-γ. In contrast, ACE2L and another key gene, AGT, in
RAS were categorized together with other non-ISGs (B), which is more like the expression pattern of
canonical ISGs (C) than the IL-6 group (A).
Figure 9: Working summary for IL-6 and ACE2 as non-ISGs biomarkers and contribution to COVID19 susceptibility. Epigenetic regulation of non-ISGs such as IL-6 and ACE2 was sequentially regulated
by such as TNF, IFN and TLR signaling, which modify chromatin accessibility through activating
histone modification and recruitment of transcription factors including PU.1, IRF and NF-κB binding
on promoter regions of IL-6 and ACE2 genes. In turn, it will amplify inflammatory loop through IL6-mediated response and inducing more ACE2 expression, which collectively contribute to the
occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome as in COVID-19. Therefore, high expression of non-ISGs
such as IL-6 and ACE2 could be biomarkers to determine COVID-19 susceptibility and disease
development in different animal species. Abbreviations: non-ISG, non-canonical interferon
stimulated genes; GTF, sTF, or TF, general (G), tissue-specific (s) transcription factor (TF); TLR, tolllike receptor; TSS, transcription start site.

Figure 5: Cross-species analysis of mean PWM scores of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that bind (A) STAT1/2, (B) PU.1 (a.k.a. SPI1),
(C) NF-κB1, (D) NF-κB2, and (E) IRFs (including IRF1-9, which show significant PWM scores with p<0.0001) in the proximal promoter
regions of IL-6 and ACE2 gene orthologs from the 25 representative vertebrate species. All types of CREs have comparable Log2(mPWM)
scores between ACE2 and IL-6 genes, except NF-κB2 that mediates non-canonical NF-κB response (D) has a significant lower mPWN score
(2-6 Log2 units), indicating ACE2 genes are among different non-ISGs group other than IL-6. Canonical ISGs of human ISG15 and IRF1
are used as references. mPWM scores are calculated using tools at https://ccg.epfl.ch/pwmtools/pwmscore.php with CRE Matrices from

Figure 6: Cross-species correlation of epigenetically regulatory CREs, which associate with inflammatory and IFN signaling, in IL-6
and ACE2 gene promoters as biomarkers for COVID-19 susceptibility. Mean PWM (mPWM) scores were generated as
described in previous figures, and compared between two groups of known COVID-19 susceptible species [CoV2(+)] and
unsusceptible species [CoV2(-)]. This shows that ACE2 and especially IL-6 genes from CoV2(+) species contain CREs with
significantly higher mPWM scores, indicating that in some vertebrate species, non-ISGs like ACE2 and especially IL-6
genes evolved to obtain high inductive propensity by inflammatory and IFN signaling, and may serve as epigenetic biomarkers
(or triggers) for susceptibility prediction for COVID-19 and other ARD syndromes. Abbreviation: H_Bat, Great horseshoe bat, and
other abbreviations are as in Figure 4.

ACE2 promoter phylogeny

Figure 7: Cross-species phylogenic and topological comparison of IL-6 and ACE2 gene promoters. Evolutionary analyses were
conducted in MEGA X. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model. The
tree with the highest log likelihood (-52755.39) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is
shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ
algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Tamura-Nei model, and then selecting the topology with superior log
likelihood value. For topological comparison between phylogenic trees generated using IL-6 and ACE2 gene proximal promoters, the
phylogenies of Newick strings were generated using the MEGA, and topological comparison between the Newick trees was performed
with Compare2Trees at (http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~ntmwn/compare2trees) to obtain the overall topological scores. Orange circle:
COVID-19 susceptible species. Arrows: other tentative marker species to determine which group (IL-6 or ACE2) of non-ISGs are more
determined for COVID-19 susceptibility. Abbreviations are as in Figure 4.

Figure 8: Genome-wide categorizing of non-ISGs based on the similarity of inductive pattern to IL-6 and ACE2 genes. The non-biased
genome-wide transcriptomic data was generated using RNA-Seq of porcine lung macrophages activated with stimuli of IL-4, IL-10, LPS, IFNα or IFN-γ at 20 ng/ml and infected by porcine arterivirus virus for 5 h, using an Illumina procedure as previously described [57]. Significantly
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in renin-angiotensin system (RAS), interleukin (IL)-6, TNF and chemokine super-families were
annotated and grouped using heatmaps according to their inductive expression patterns similar to: (A) IL-6, (B) ACE2; (C) Examples of
canonical ISGs as reference; (D) Averaged transcriptomic expression levels (normalized at Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million
mapped reads, RPKM) of the grouped ISGs or Non-ISGs above. Indicated by arrows, pigs have two ACE2 isoforms, namely ACE2L and
ACE2S, which have different expression patterns, ACE2S similar to IL-6 was shown to be less responsive to IFN- α but highly responsive to
LPS and IFN-γ. In contrast, ACE2L and another key gene, AGT, in RAS were categorized together with other non-ISGs (B), which is more
like the expression pattern of canonical ISGs (C) than the IL-6 group (A).

Figure 9: Working summary for IL-6 and ACE2 as non-ISGs biomarkers and contribution to COVID-19 susceptibility. Epigenetic
regulation of non-ISGs such as IL-6 and ACE2 was sequentially regulated by such as TNF, IFN and TLR signaling, which modify
chromatin accessibility through activating histone modification and recruitment of transcription factors including PU.1, IRF and
NF-κB binding on promoter regions of IL-6 and ACE2 genes. In turn, it will amplify the inflammatory loop through the IL-6mediated response and induce greater ACE2 expression, which collectively contributes to the occurrence of respiratory
distress syndrome as in COVID-19. Therefore, high expression of non-ISGs such as IL-6 and ACE2 could be biomarkers to
determine COVID-19 susceptibility and disease development in different animal species. Abbreviations: non-ISG, non-canonical
interferon stimulated genes; GTF, sTF, or TF, general (G), tissue-specific (s) transcription factor (TF); TLR, toll-like receptor;
TSS, transcription start site.
