Abstract
In the absence of a vaccine and other effective prophylactic or therapeutic
countermeasures the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) remains a significant public health threat. Attachment and entry of coronaviruses
including SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). Recently, a SARSCoV-2 Spike Pseudotyped Lentivirus (SSPL) was developed that allows studying spikemediated cell entry via luciferase reporter activity in a BSL2 environment. Here, we show
that iota-carrageenan can inhibit the cell entry of SSPL in a dose dependent manner.
SSPL particles were efficiently neutralized with an IC50 value of 2.6 µg/ml iotacarrageenan. In vitro data on iota-carrageenan against various Rhino- and Coronaviruses
showed similar IC50 values and translated readily into clinical effectiveness when a nasal
spray containing iota-carrageenan demonstrated a reduction in severity and duration of
symptoms of common cold caused by various respiratory viruses. Accordingly, our in vitro
data on SSPL suggest that administration of iota-carrageenan may be an effective and
safe prophylaxis or treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Introduction
The spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) around
the world has created a pandemic situation regarded as a significant public health threat
[1–4]. SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-1. Although the
sequence of the spike glycoprotein (SGP) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly different
compared to the SGP of SARS-CoV-1, both bind to the same receptor, human angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Upon binding to hACE2 the protease TMPRSS2 modifies
SGP, thus allowing envelope fusion and viral entry [5]. In addition to this rather specific
mechanism,

many

viruses

(including

some

betacoronaviruses)

use

cellular

polysaccharides as cellular attachment co-receptors, allowing the virus to adhere to the
surface of the cell. This unspecific interaction increases the local concentration of viral
particles leading to more effective infection rates.
All respiratory viruses have in common that they must pass through the physical barrier of
mucus and respiratory fluid to reach the cell surface. It is hypothesized that the viruses
utilize their positive electrical charge to reach the negatively charged cell surface [6].
Polyanionic molecules such as iota-carrageenan may present a way of trapping the
viruses as they move towards the surface of the cell. The lack of any pharmacological,
immunological, or toxicological activity of large polyanionic molecules such as iotacarrageenan and their lack of absorption or metabolism makes them a safe topical antiviral
treatment.
The antiviral activity of iota-carrageenan has been demonstrated in vitro against a variety
of respiratory viruses [7–9]. The transferability of these in vitro data into clinical
effectiveness was evaluated in four clinical trials [10–14].
The efficacy and safety of an iota-carrageenan containing nasal spray have been studied
in more than 600 children and adults suffering from early symptoms of common cold. In
all trials a significant reduction of viral load of different respiratory viruses has been
demonstrated in the iota-carrageenan treatment group compared to placebo thereby
convincingly bridging in vitro neutralization data and effectiveness against a respiratory
infection of humans. Additionally, this titer reduction also manifested clinically by reducing
the severity and duration of symptoms as well as the number of relapses in the verum

group. There were no differences with respect to safety between iota-carrageenan treated
patients compared to placebo [6].
Due to the highly transmissible and pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2, handling of live
virus requires biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment. Thus, only facilities equipped with
BSL-3 can safely study neutralizing responses using live virus. Hence, we utilized a
recently developed high titer lentivirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 (SSPL) to screen
potential inhibitors in a lower biosafety level laboratory. Since the backbone of this virus
consists of a non-replicating lentivirus, it poses no risk of infection to the personnel
involved. Attachment and entry can be measured via luciferase reporter activity which
correlates directly with the efficiency of transduction. Using this lentiviral system, we tested
the ability of various sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit viral attachment and entry. We
discuss implications of the findings for both SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures and potential
clinical applications.

Results
Iota-carrageenan neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudotyped Lentivirus (SSPL)
particles
To determine whether iota-carrageenan can block the infection of cells with SSPL we
incubated the particles with 10 µg/ml iota-carrageenan dissolved in 0.5% NaCl solution for
30 minutes prior infection. For infection, this mixture was diluted according to the
manufacturer´s protocol by the addition of 5 volumes of medium resulting in a final
concentration of 1.7 µg/ml. Mock-infected cells and infected, mock-treated (0.5% NaCl)
cells served as positive and negative control, respectively. In addition, we tested the serum
of a patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, who showed sero-conversion in an
IgG ELISA specific for SGP and nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. This serum effectively
neutralized the virus while a control serum from 2011 had no effect on virus infection (Fig.
1). Serum was used in a 1:15 dilution during the pre-incubation with the virus and in a final
1:90 dilution during infection. With 82% neutralization capacity, 10µg/ml iota-carrageenan
were equally effective as the 1:15 diluted antiserum (86% neutralization). These results
demonstrate that low concentrations iota-carrageenan are capable of neutralizing SSPL
particles.

reduction of the signal by more than 80% indicating a plateau above this concentration.
Interestingly, the presence of only 1 µg/ml (0.17 µg/ml) iota-carrageenan resulted in a
detectable reduction of infectivity by more than 20%.

Several polymers were tested for their ability to neutralize SSPL particles (Figure 3). While
iota-carrageenan effectively inhibited the virus at 100 µg/ml (17 µg/ml) and 10 µg/ml (1.7
µg/ml), kappa-carrageenan and lambda-carrageenan were only active at 100 µg/ml (17
µg/ml). High molecular weight fucoidan from two different species, Undaria pinnatifida and

concentration (100 µg/ml). Polymers without sulfate groups, carboxymethylcellulose
(CMC) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) were inactive in this assay. Also, a low
molecular weight sulfated sugar, galactose-4-sulfate did not neutralize SSPL.
The composition of the kappa- and lambda-products was determined by NMR analysis to
evaluate if iota-carrageenan is present in these preparations. Surprisingly, kappacarrageenan contained 16%, and lambda-carrageenan 27% iota-carrageenan.

Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV OC43 concerning their sensitivity to iota- and
kappa-carrageenan inhibition

Both, SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV OC43, belong to the genus of beta-coronaviridae. While
SARS-CoV-2 newly emerged in late 2019, hCoV OC43 was identified in 1967 [15].
Infection with hCoV OC43 usually leads to common cold symptoms and only rare cases
of severe infection result in viral pneumonia. Coronaviruses are commonly detected in
patients suffering from common cold and usually represent 10-15% of the cases. In clinical
studies with an iota-carrageenan containing nasal spray more than 30% of the tested
subjects that were virus-positive had an infection with either hCoV OC43 or 229E (alphacoronavirus) with an equal 50:50 split between those two viral subtypes. In these clinical
trials effectiveness against coronaviruses was clearly demonstrated. Therefore, we
wanted to compare the in vitro neutralisation capacity of iota- und kappa-carrageenan
against clinically sensitive hCoV OC43 with the one against SSPL. A cell culture assay
with hCoV OC43 was established and the effect of iota-carrageenan, kappa-carrageenan
and Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) on viral replication was tested. In contrast to the SSPL
neutralization assay, in this cell culture assay the polymer concentration during
virus/polymer pre-incubation and infection was held constant. The polymers were titrated
from 100 µg/ml to 0.007 µg/ml. Iota-carrageenan dose-dependently inhibited hCoV OC43
replication with an IC50 value of 0.33 µg/ml, while 100 µg/ml kappa-carrageenan resulted
in an inhibition of less than 50%. The control polymer CMC did not show any inhibition
(data not shown). These data demonstrate that SSPLs are similarly sensitive to iotacarrageenan as hCoV OC43 (table 1).

Discussion
In this study we utilized a SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudotyped Lentivirus to test the
neutralization efficacy of different sulfated polymers. An analogous assay was recently

used to test the neutralization potential of serum IgG during the active and convalescent
phase of COVID-19. While both, asymptomatic patients as well as symptomatic patients,
had neutralizing serum IgG antibodies, also in both groups a reduction of the antibody
levels and the neutralization capacity was observed within 2-3 months after infection. The
authors speculate that the observed decrease of antibodies and neutralization capacity
may pose a risk for using an “immunity passport” and that prolongation of public health
interventions may be needed [16]. The findings are also important with respect to the
development of a vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and the formation of long-lasting
neutralizing antibodies and their protective potential will be key factors for success. In the
light of these findings the neutralization capacity of iota-carrageenan, which was in the
same range as a positive serum from a COVID-19 patient and in the same range as
soluble ACE receptor protein (IC50 ~ 0.5 – 2 µg/ml; [17]), may be an important additional
option for prophylactic and therapeutic intervention.
A comparison of iota-carrageenan with other sulfated polymers such as kappa- and
lambda-carrageenan and fucoidans from different species showed that iota-carrageenan
has superior efficacy. While 100 µg/ml of kappa- and lambda-carrageenan also
neutralized SARS-CoV-2 effectively, the fucoidans were hardly efficacious. NMR analysis
of kappa- and lambda-carrageenan revealed surprisingly high amounts of iotacarrageenan, namely 16 % and 27 % in the kappa- and lambda-products, respectively. At
10 µg/ml iota-carrageenan showed a neutralization capacity of 79 %. With the 100 µg/ml
kappa- and lambda-preparations a similar neutralization of around 80 % was reached. As
the iota-carrageenan concentration in these preparations is 16 and 27 µg/ml, respectively,
we hypothesize that the inhibition observed with kappa- and lambda-carrageenan is
mainly due to the presence of iota-carrageenan. More research with iota-carrageenan
free, better refined kappa and lambda polymers is needed to allow conclusions on their
individual virus blocking effect. The data further highlight the need for quality control via
NMR when natural biopolymers are studied.
Antiviral effectiveness of iota-carrageenan has been established in cell culture assays for
different rhinoviruses as well as influenza A and B viruses and coronavirus OC43 [7].
Human rhinovirus titers were reduced by more than one log when 5 µg/ml iotacarrageenan were added before and during the infection. The IC50 values for the inhibition

of influenza A viruses, H1N1/PR8/34, H3N2 Aichi/2/68, nH1N1/09 were in the range of 0.2
to 0.9 µg/ml, and CoV OC43 was inhibited with an IC50 of 0.33 µg/ml. In vitro data on
influenza virus are supported by a set of in vivo data with influenza A H1N1/PR8/34
infected mice. In the placebo group only 10 % of the animals survived the lethal infection,
while in the group treated intranasally with 1.2 mg/ml iota-carrageenan 70 % survived
when treatment started at the day of infection. When treatment started 48 hours after
infection, still 50% of the animals survived. This result was strengthened by the
observation that nasal and lung titers were strongly reduced 120 hours after infection
similarly as in those animals treated with oseltamivir [8].
Nasal sprays containing 1.2 mg/ml iota-carrageenan have been tested clinically in children
and adults suffering from early symptoms of common cold. The spray was applied three
times daily for 4 or seven consecutive days. The patients were tested for the presence of
viral pathogens including human rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses (OC43 and 229E),
respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, human influenza A and B strains, as well as
parainfluenzaviruses 1-3 before and during treatment (days 1 and 3-5). In one clinical
study with adults an additional test for viruses was performed on day 10-11 [13]. The most
abundant viral pathogens in both studies were human rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and
influenza A viruses, with 59 %, 34.6 %, and 18.5 %, respectively. The rate of virus-positive
subjects was 89 % for children from the age of 1-18 years, while in adults the rate was
58 %. While in adults only 15 % of the patients more than one viral pathogen was detected,
in children this rate increased to 41 %. Five different viruses were detected in one child,
hCoV

OC43,

and

parainfluenzavirus 3. As a result of treatment with iota-carrageenan in all clinical studies
viral titers were strongly reduced compared to placebo [6]. This reduction of viral titers
translated into reduced severity and duration of common cold symptoms and reduction of
relapses during the observation period of up to 21 days. The finding that patients may
suffer from more than one viral infection also implicates that a pan-anti-viral treatment may
be superior compared to virus-specific therapies.
SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by iota-carrageenan to the same extent as other respiratory
viruses for which a clinical benefit has been proven. Furthermore, iota-carrageenan shows
an equivalent effectivity against SARS-CoV-2 as a neutralizing antiserum and soluble ACE

receptors [17], both well accepted parameters for clinical performance. Therefore, our data
suggest that treatment with iota-carrageenan either prophylactically or therapeutically may
be similarly effective in humans suffering from COVID-19. Clinical data and post market
surveillance data showed that iota-carrageenan is well-tolerated and the number of
reported adverse events are very low (1.07 reported adverse events per 100.000 sold
units since 2013; more than 8 million units sold). Also in case of the emergence of another
“new” respiratory virus, that then again may result in pandemic, iota-carrageenan may
serve as a first unspecific treatment to close the gap between virus identification and
successful developments of vaccines or specific antiviral medication.

Materials and Methods
Pseudotyped viral particles
Pseudotyped particles were obtained from BPS Bioscience, San Diego CA92121
Catalog#: 79942. The pseudovirions contain SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Genbank
Accession #QHD43416.1) and the firefly luciferase gene driven by a CMV promoter.
Therefore, the spike-mediated cell entry can be measured via luciferase reporter activity.
The SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped lentivirus has been designed to measure the activity
of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a Biosafety Level2 facility.

Compounds
Iota-, kappa- and lambda-carrageenan were purchased from Dupont former FMC
Biopolymers (both Philadelphia, PA). Fucoidan from Undaria pinnatifolia and Fucus
vesiculosis were from Marinova (Marinova Pty Ltd, Australia), CMC was from Mare Austria
GmbH, HPMC from Fagron (Fagron BV, The Netherlands), galactose-4-sulfate was
purchased from Merck KGA (Germany).
The dry polymer powders were dissolved in cell culture water (B Braun Melsungen AG,
Germany) to a final concentration of 2.4 mg/ml containing 0.5% NaCl (Merck KGA,
Germany). This stock solution was sterile filtered through a 0.22mm filter (Sarstedt,
Germany) and stored at 4°C until use.

Neutralization tests
Approximately 7500 ACE2-HEK293 cells/well were infected with 750 infectious particles
of SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped lentivirus (Luc reporter). Virus was incubated with
buffer (controls) or the tests substances for 30 minutes before infection. Subsequently 5
volumes of cell culture medium (MEM (Merck KGA, Germany) containing 10% FCS
(Merck KGA, Germany), 4 mM glutamine (Merck KGA, Germany), 1 mM sodium pyruvate
(Merck KGA, Germany), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Merck KGA, Germany). 24 hours
after infection, the medium was changed to fresh cell culture medium. 48 hours after
infection plates were lysed by freeze / thaw before luciferase reagent (Bright Glow,
Promega, Madison, WI) was added to cells to measure the luciferase activity using a BMG
Fluostar Microplate reader. As positive control cells infected with virus mock treated, as
negative control uninfected cells (mock-infected) were included. Luciferase data were
routinely corrected with metabolic data (Alamar blue) derived from a parallel plate with
identical set-up.

Human coronavirus OC43 (hCoV-OC43)
hCoV OC43 was obtained from the ATCC and propagated in Vero (embryonic African
green monkey kidney) cells that were purchased from the ATCC. The cells were cultivated
in OptiPro serum free medium (Life Technologies Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA)
supplemented with 4 mM L-gluta-mine (Merck KGA, Germany). Virus stocks were frozen
at −80°C and virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay.

Virus reduction assay – hCoV OC43
The assay was adapted for hCoV OC43 from a protocol described elsewhere [9]. In short,
the virus was preincubated with a semilogarithmic dilution series of polymers control
solutions for 30 minutes before it was added to a monolayer of VERO cells for infection.
After an infection period of 45 minutes at RT the inoculum was removed; cells were
overlaid with medium containing test substance and then cultured at 37°C, hereby
maintaining the same concentrations of active agent as in the prophylactic treatment.
Staining was performed on fixed cells using an antibody directed against the hCoV-OC43
nucleoprotein as a primary antibody (Merck #MAB9013) followed by a horse radish

peroxidase labeled detection antibody (Thermo Scientific #31430) and TMB as substrate.
For detection, a BMG Fluostar Microplate reader was utilized. To enable direct comparison
of the effectiveness of the test substances, the IC50 value of each sample was calculated
for a sigmoidal dose–response model with XLfit Excel add-in version 5.3.1.

NMR Analysis of kappa- and lambda-carrageenan
10 mg kappa and lambda-carrageenan samples were sent to Spectral Services, Köln, for
NMR measurements. In brief, 10 mg substance were dissolved in 1 ml D2O containing 3(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-d4 sodium salt (0.01% as standard). Measurements for 1H
spectra were done with an Avance III HD 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Billarica,
MA).
