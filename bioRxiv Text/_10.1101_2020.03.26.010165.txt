ABSTRACT
The pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
have all emerged into the human population with devastating consequences. These viruses make
use of a large envelope protein called spike (S) to engage host cell receptors and catalyze
membrane fusion. Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable
target for the development of therapeutics to combat these highly pathogenic coronaviruses.
Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) from a
llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spikes. These VHHs are capable of
potently neutralizing MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses. The crystal structures
of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs
block receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed
VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S, and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH is capable of
neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion. These data
provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and
suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION

2

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that are divided into four genera (α, β,

3

γ, δ) and infect a wide variety of host organisms (Woo et al., 2009). There are at least seven

4

coronaviruses that can cause disease in humans, and four of these viruses (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-

5

OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) circulate seasonally throughout the global population,

6

causing mild respiratory disease in most patients (Gaunt et al., 2010). The three remaining

7

viruses, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, are zoonotic pathogens that have caused

8

epidemics or pandemics with severe and often fatal symptoms after emerging into the human

9

population (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2020; Zaki et

10

al., 2012). For these highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses, prophylactics and therapeutic

11

treatments are needed.

12

The surfaces of coronaviruses are decorated with a spike glycoprotein (S), a large class I

13

fusion protein (Bosch et al., 2003). The S protein forms a trimeric complex that can be

14

functionally categorized into two distinct subunits, S1 and S2, that are separated by a protease

15

cleavage site. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which interacts with

16

a proteinaceous host-cell receptor to trigger membrane fusion. The S2 subunit contains the fusion

17

machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and the α-helical heptad repeats. The

18

functional host cell receptors for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are angiotensin converting

19

enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively (Li et al., 2003; Raj et al.,

20

2013). The interactions between these receptors and their respective RBDs have been thoroughly

21

characterized, both structurally and biophysically (Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2013). Recently, it

22

has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 S also makes use of ACE2 as a functional host-cell receptor

23

and several structures of this complex have already been reported (Hoffmann, 2020; Lan, 2020;

24

Wan et al., 2020; Yan, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).

25

Recent advances in cryo-EM have allowed researchers to determine high-resolution

26

structures of the trimeric spike protein ectodomains and understand how S functions as a

27

macromolecular machine (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Li et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2016; Wang et

28

al., 2013). Initial cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-1 spike revealed that the RBDs

29

adopted at least two distinct conformations. In the “up” conformation, the RBDs could be

30

observed jutting out away from the rest of S, such that they could easily engage ACE2 without

31

causing any steric clashes. In the “down” conformation, the RBDs were tightly packed against

32

the top of the S2 subunit, preventing binding by ACE2 (Gui et al., 2017). Subsequent

33

experiments have corroborated this phenomenon and similar dynamics have been observed in

34

MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S and in alphacoronavirus S proteins (Jones et al., 2019;

35

Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Walls, 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al.,

36

2017). Due to the relatively low abundance of particles that can be observed by cryo-EM with

37

three RBDs in the up conformation, it is thought that this conformation may correspond to an

38

energetically unstable state (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017). These observations

39

led to the hypothesis that the CoV RBDs may be acting as molecular ratchets, wherein a

40

receptor-binding event would trap the RBD in the less stable up conformation, leading to gradual

41

destabilization until S is finally triggered to initiate membrane fusion. Recent experiments

42

characterizing RBD-directed anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies that trap the SARS-CoV-1 RBD in

43

the up conformation and lead to destabilization of the prefusion spike have lent support to this

44

hypothesis (Walls et al., 2019).

45

Numerous anti-SARS-CoV-1 RBD and anti-MERS-CoV RBD antibodies have been

46

reported and their mechanisms of neutralization can be attributed to the occlusion of the

47

receptor-binding site and to trapping the RBD in the unstable up conformation, effectively acting

48

as a receptor mimic that triggers a premature transition from the prefusion-to-postfusion

49

conformation (Hwang et al., 2006; Walls et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015).

50

Heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs), present in camelids, contain a single variable domain

51

(VHH) instead of two variable domains (VH and VL) that make up the equivalent antigen-

52

binding fragment (Fab) of conventional IgG antibodies (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993). This

53

single variable domain, in the absence of an effector domain, is referred to as a single-domain

54

antibody, VHH or Nanobody® and typically can acquire affinities and specificities for antigens

55

comparable to conventional antibodies. VHHs can easily be constructed into multivalent formats

56

and are known to have enhanced thermal stability and chemostability compared to most

57

antibodies (De Vlieger et al., 2018; Dumoulin et al., 2002; Govaert et al., 2012; Laursen et al.,

58

2018; van der Linden et al., 1999). Their advantageous biophysical properties have led to the

59

evaluation of several VHHs as therapeutics against common respiratory pathogens, such as

60

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Detalle et al., 2016; Rossey et al., 2017). The use of VHHs as

61

biologics in the context of a respiratory infection is a particularly attractive application, since the

62

highly stable VHHs can be nebulized and administered via an inhaler directly to the site of

63

infection (Respaud et al., 2015). Moreover, due to their stability after prolonged storage, VHHs

64

could be stockpiled as therapeutic treatment options in case of an epidemic. Although

65

therapeutics against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are sorely needed, the feasibility of using

66

VHHs for this purpose has not yet been adequately explored. Several MERS-CoV S-directed

67

VHHs have been reported, but their epitopes remain largely undefined, other than being

68

classified as RBD-directed (Stalin Raj et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018).

69

Here we report the isolation of two potently neutralizing VHHs directed against the

70

SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV RBDs. These VHHs were elicited in response to immunization of

71

a llama with prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV S proteins. We solved the

72

crystal structures of these two VHHs in complex with their respective viral epitopes and

73

determined that their mechanisms of neutralization were occlusion of the receptor binding

74

interface and trapping of the RBDs in the up conformation. We also show that the SARS-CoV-1

75

RBD-directed VHH exhibits cross-reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and is capable of

76

blocking the receptor-binding interface. After engineering this VHH into a bivalent Fc-fusion,

77

we show that this cross-reactive VHH is also capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S

78

pseudoviruses. In addition, we demonstrate that the VHH-Fc fusion can be produced at high

79

yields in an industry-standard CHO cell system, suggesting that it merits further investigation as

80

a potential therapeutic for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

81

RESULTS

82

Isolation of betacoronavirus S-directed VHHs

83

Our initial aim was to isolate VHHs that could potently neutralize MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-

84

1. Therefore, a llama was sequentially immunized subcutaneously twice with SARS-CoV-1 S

85

protein, twice with MERS-CoV S protein, once again with SARS-CoV-1 S and finally with both

86

SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV S protein (S. Figure 1A). To obtain VHHs directed against these

87

spike proteins, two consecutive rounds of panning were performed using either SARS-CoV-1 S

88

or MERS-CoV S protein. Positive clones were sequenced and multiple sequence alignment and

89

phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method revealed that seven unique MERS-CoV

90

S and five unique SARS-CoV-1 S VHHs were isolated (S. Figure 1B). These VHHs and an

91

irrelevant control (RSV F-VHH, directed against the F protein of human respiratory syncytial

92

virus) were subsequently expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified from the yeast medium

93

(Rossey et al., 2017). The binding of the purified VHHs to prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S

94

and SARS-CoV-1 S was confirmed by ELISA (S. Figure 1C). Four clones (MERS VHH-55, -

95

12, -34 and -40), obtained after panning on MERS-CoV S protein, bound with high affinity to

96

prefusion stabilized MERS-CoV S, whereas the affinity of VHH-2, -20 and -15 was 100- to

97

1000-fold lower. Of the five clones isolated after panning on SARS-CoV-1 S protein, three VHH

98

clones (SARS VHH-72, -1 and -6) interacted strongly with prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-1 S

99

protein.

100

VHHs neutralize coronavirus S pseudotyped viruses

101

To assess the antiviral activity of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S-directed VHHs, in vitro

102

neutralization assays using MERS-CoV England1 S and SARS-CoV-1 Urbani S pseudotyped

103

lentiviruses were performed. The high affinity MERS VHH-55, -12, -34 and -40 neutralized

104

MERS-CoV S pseudotyped virus with IC50 values ranging from 0.014 to 2.9 µg/mL (0.9 nM to

105

193.3 nM), while no inhibition was observed for the lower affinity MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1

106

specific VHHs (Table 1). SARS VHH-72 and -44 were able to neutralize lentiviruses

107

pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-1 S with an IC50 value of 0.14 (9 nM) and 5.5 µg/mL (355 nM),

108

respectively. No binding was observed for SARS VHH-44 to prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-1

109

S protein in the ELISA assay. Sequence analysis revealed that the neutralizing MERS-CoV

110

specific VHHs -12, -40 and -55 have highly similar complementarity-determining regions

111

(CDRs), indicating that they likely bind to the same epitope (S. Figure 2). In contrast, the CDRs

112

from the SARS-CoV S-specific VHHs -44 and -72 are highly divergent.

113

Epitope mapping of betacoronavirus S-directed VHHs

114

To map the epitopes targeted by the neutralizing VHHs, we tested binding to recombinant

115

MERS-CoV S1, RBD, NTD and SARS-CoV-1 RBD and NTD by ELISA (Figure 1A and S.

116

Figure 3).The MERS-CoV S-specific VHHs strongly bound to MERS-CoV S1 and RBD in a

117

concentration-dependent manner, and no binding to the MERS-CoV NTD was observed.

118

Similarly, strong binding of SARS VHH-72 to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD protein but not the SARS-

119

CoV-1 NTD protein was observed. Again, no binding of SARS VHH-44 to either the SARS-

120

CoV-1 RBD or NTD protein was detected. These data demonstrate that the neutralizing VHHs

121

SARS VHH-72 and MERS VHH-55 target the RBDs. Based on the specificity and potent

122

neutralizing capacity of SARS VHH-72 and MERS VHH-55, we measured the affinities of these

123

VHHs by immobilizing recombinantly expressed VHH to an SPR sensorchip and determined the

124

binding kinetics for their respective RBDs. We found that both of these VHHs bound to their

125

targets with high affinity. SARS VHH-72 bound to its target with an affinity of 1.2 nM and

126

MERS VHH-55 bound to its target with an affinity of 79.2 pM, in part due to a very slow off-

127

rate constant (kd = 8.2 x10-5 s-1) (Figure 1B).

128

Structural basis of VHH interaction with RBDs

129

To investigate the molecular determinants that mediate potent neutralization and high-affinity

130

binding by MERS VHH-55, we solved the crystal structure of MERS VHH-55 bound to the

131

MERS-CoV RBD. Crystals grew in space group C2221 and diffracted X-rays to a resolution of

132

3.4 Å. After determining a molecular replacement solution and iterative building and refinement,

133

our structure reached an Rwork/Rfree of 21.4%/26.8% (Table 2). The asymmetric unit of this

134

crystal contained eight copies of the MERS VHH-55 + MERS-CoV RBD complex and had a

135

solvent content of ~58%. The electron density allowed unambiguous definition of the interface

136

between the RBD and VHH, with the three CDRs forming extensive binding contacts with the

137

RBD, burying 716 Å2 of surface area by pinching the RBD between the CDR2 and CDR3. The

138

CDR3 of MERS VHH-55 is looped over the DPP4-binding interface, occluding DPP4 from

139

productively engaging the MERS-CoV RBD (Figure 2A-B).

140

There are numerous contacts between the CDRs of MERS VHH-55 and the MERS-CoV

141

RBD, and the majority of these are confined to CDRs 2 and 3 (Figure 2C-D). The sole

142

interaction from the MERS VHH-55 CDR1 comes from Asp35 forming a salt bridge with

143

Arg542 from the RBD. CDR2 forms hydrogen bonds using Ser53 and Asp61 to engage RBD

144

residues Asp539 and Gln544. Furthermore, Asn58 from the CDR2 also engages Arg542 from the

145

RBD. Trp99 from the MERS VHH-55 CDR3 forms a salt bridge with Glu513 via the nitrogen

146

from its pyrrole ring. Finally, Glu95 from the MERS VHH-55 CDR3 also forms a salt bridge

147

with Arg542 from the MERS-CoV RBD, suggesting that Arg542 plays a critical role in MERS

148

VHH-55 binding since it is productively engaged by residues from all three CDRs. This arginine

149

has also been implicated in binding to the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4, and has previously been

150

identified as one of the twelve highly conserved amino acids that is crucial for high-affinity

151

receptor engagement (S. Figure 4A) (Wang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014).

152

In addition to forming a salt bridge with Glu513 from the MERS-CoV RBD, Trp99 of the

153

MERS VHH-55 CDR3 is positioned near a hydrophobic patch formed by Phe506 (S. Figure

154

4B). This amino acid exhibits natural sequence variation in several MERS-CoV strains, such that

155

a Leu is occasionally observed at this position. To evaluate the extent to which this substitution

156

may impact MERS VHH-55 binding, we generated a F506L substitution and measured binding

157

by SPR (S. Figure 4C). Surprisingly, this substitution resulted in a ~200-fold reduction in

158

MERS VHH-55 binding affinity. Despite this substantial reduction, the affinity of MERS VHH9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.010165; this version posted March 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

159

55 to MERS-CoV RBD F506L remains high, with a KD = 16.5 nM. Other than the variability

160

that is observed at position 506 of the MERS-CoV RBD, the rest of the MERS VHH-55 epitope

161

is highly conserved across the 863 strains that are curated in the MERS-CoV Virus Variation

162

database (S. Figure 4A). This high degree of epitope conservation suggests that VHH-55 would

163

broadly recognize MERS-CoV strains.

164

We also sought to discover the molecular determinants of binding between SARS VHH-

165

72 and the SARS-CoV-1 RBD by determining the crystal structure of this complex. Crystals

166

grew in space group P3121 and diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 2.2 Å. We obtained a

167

molecular replacement solution and refined the structure to an Rwork/Rfree of 20.3%/23.6%

168

through iterative building and refinement (Table 2). Our structure reveals that CDRs 2 and 3

169

contribute to the majority of the 834 Å2 of buried surface area at the binding interface (Figure

170

3A). This interface does not, however, overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Rather, ACE2

171

would clash with the CDR-distal framework of SARS VHH-72 (Figure 3B). This clash would

172

only be enhanced by the presence of an N-linked glycan at Asn322 of ACE2, which is already

173

located within the VHH framework when the receptor-bound RBD is aligned to the VHH-bound

174

RBD (Figure 3C).

175

SARS VHH-72 binds to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD by forming an extensive hydrogen-bond

176

network via its CDRs 2 and 3 (Figure3D-E). Ser56 from the CDR2 simultaneously forms

177

hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone of three residues from the SARS-CoV-1 RBD:

178

Leu355, Tyr356 and Ser358. The peptide backbone of Ser358 also forms a hydrogen bond with

179

the backbone of neighboring Thr57 from the CDR2. A salt bridge formed between CDR2 residue

180

Asp61 and RBD residue Arg426 tethers the C-terminal end of the CDR2 to the RBD. The N-

181

terminus of the CDR3 forms a short β-strand that pairs with a β-strand from the SARS-CoV-1

182

RBD to bridge the interface between these two molecules. This interaction is mediated by

183

backbone hydrogen bonds from CDR3 residues Gly98, Val100 and Val100a to RBD residues

184

Cys366 and Phe364. Glu100c from the CDR3 forms hydrogen bonds with the sidechain

185

hydroxyls from both Ser362 and Tyr494 from the SARS-CoV-1 RBD. The neighboring CDR3

186

residue also engages in a sidechain-specific interaction by forming a salt bridge between the

187

pyrrole nitrogen of Trp100d and the hydroxyl group from RBD residue Thr363. Asp101 is

188

involved in the most C-terminal interaction from the CDR3 by forming a salt bridge with RBD

189

residue Lys365. The extensive interactions formed between CDRs 2 and 3 of SARS VHH-72

190

and the SARS-CoV-1 RBD explain the high-affinity binding that we observed between these

191

molecules.

192

SARS VHH-72 is cross-reactive against WIV1-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

193

Analysis of 10 available SARS-CoV-1 strain sequences revealed a high degree of conservation

194

in the residues that make up the SARS VHH-72 epitope, prompting us to explore the breadth of

195

SARS VHH-72 binding (S. Figure 5A). WIV1-CoV is a betacoronavirus found in bats that is

196

closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and also utilizes ACE2 as a host-cell receptor (Ge et al., 2013).

197

Due to the relatively high degree of sequence conservation between SARS-CoV and WIV1-CoV,

198

we expressed the WIV1-CoV RBD and measured binding to SARS VHH-72 by SPR (S. Figure

199

5B). SARS VHH-72 also exhibits high-affinity binding to the WIV1-CoV RBD (7.4 nM),

200

demonstrating that it is cross-reactive between these two closely related coronaviruses (S. Figure

201

5C).

202

Based on the high degree of structural homology that has been reported between SARS-

203

CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S (Walls, 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020), we also tested SARS VHH-72

for cross-reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 by SPR (Figure 4). The binding affinity

205

of SARS VHH-72 for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 was ~39 nM. This diminished binding

206

affinity, compared to the binding of SARS VHH-72 to SARS-CoV-1 RBD, can primarily be

207

attributed to an increase in the dissociation rate constant of this interaction (Figure 4A). The

208

only variant residue on the SARS-CoV-1 RBD that makes direct contact with SARS VHH-72 is

209

Arg426, which is Asn439 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure 3C).

210

VHHs disrupt RBD dynamics and receptor-binding

211

As stated previously, the RBDs of MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S undergo

212

dynamic conformational rearrangements that alternately mask and present their receptor-binding

213

interfaces and potential neutralizing epitopes to host molecules. By aligning the crystal structures

214

of MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72 bound to their respective targets to the full-length, cryo-

215

EM structures of the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we can begin

216

to understand how these molecules might function in the context of these dynamic

217

rearrangements. When the MERS-CoV RBDs are all in the down conformation or all in the up

218

conformation, MERS VHH-55 would be able to bind all three of the protomers making up the

219

functional spike trimer without forming any clashes. However, if a down protomer was bound by

220

MERS VHH-55 and the neighboring protomer sampled the up conformation, this RBD would

221

then be trapped in this state by the presence of the neighboring MERS VHH-55 molecule

222

(Figure 5A). This conformational trapping would be even more pronounced upon SARS VHH-

223

72 binding to the full-length SARS-CoV-1 S protein or the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

224

Due to the binding angle of SARS VHH-72, when a bound SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD

225

samples the down conformation, it would form dramatic clashes with the S2 fusion subunit,

226

regardless of the conformations of the neighboring RBDs (Figure 5B-C). Therefore, once a

227

single SARS VHH-72 binding event took place, the bound protomer would be trapped in the up

228

conformation until either SARS VHH-72 was released or until the S protein was triggered to

229

undergo the prefusion-to-postfusion transition. Based on the binding angles of MERS VHH-55

230

and SARS VHH-72, we can conclude that these molecules would likely disrupt the RBD

231

dynamics in the context of a full-length S protein by trapping the up conformation. Because this

232

up conformation is unstable and leads to S protein triggering, it is possible that this

233

conformational trapping may at least partially contribute to the neutralization mechanisms of

234

these VHHs.

235

Based on our structural analysis, we hypothesized that another mechanism by which both

236

MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72 neutralize their respective viral targets is by blocking the

237

interaction between the RBDs and their host-cell receptors. To test this hypothesis, we performed

238

a BLI-based assay in which the SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RBDs were

239

immobilized to biosensor tips, dipped into VHHs and then dipped into wells containing the

240

recombinant, soluble host cell receptors. We found that when tips coated in the MERS-CoV

241

RBD were dipped into MERS VHH55 before being dipped into DPP4, there was no increase in

242

response that could be attributed to receptor binding. When tips coated with the MERS-CoV

243

RBD were dipped into SARS VHH-72 and then DPP4, a robust response signal was observed, as

244

expected. Similar results were observed when the analogous experiments were performed using

245

the SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, SARS VHH-72 and ACE2 (Figure 5D). These results

246

support our structural analysis that both MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72 are capable of

247

neutralizing their respective viral targets by directly preventing host-cell receptor binding.

248

Bivalent SARS VHH-72 is capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses

249

Despite the relatively high-affinity binding that was observed by SPR between SARS VHH-72

250

and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, this binding could not be detected by ELISA nor was SARS VHH13

251

72 capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S VSV pseudoviruses, possibly due to the high off-rate

252

constant, whereas SARS-CoV-1 pseudotypes were readily neutralized (Figure 6A-D). In an

253

attempt to overcome this rapid dissociation, we engineered two bivalent variants of SARS VHH-

254

72. These included a tail-to-head fusion of two SARS VHH-72 molecules connected by a

255

(GGGGS)3 linker (VHH-72-VHH-72) and a genetic fusion of SARS VHH-72 to the Fc domain

256

of human IgG1 (VHH-72-Fc) (S. Figure 6A-C). These bivalent SARS VHH-72 constructs were

257

able to bind to both prefusion SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 as demonstrated by

258

ELISA and by a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 to Vero E6

259

cells (Figure 6C-D and S. Figure 6B-C). We could also detect binding of both of these

260

constructs to full length SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S expressed on the surface of

261

mammalian cells (S. Figure 6D-E). Supernatants of HEK 293S cells transiently transfected with

262

VHH-72-Fc exhibited neutralizing activity against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S VSV

263

pseudoviruses in the same assay which showed no such cross-reactive neutralization for

264

monovalent SARS VHH-72 (Figure 6E-F). A BLI experiment measuring binding of VHH-72-

265

Fc to immobilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 further confirmed that bivalency was able to

266

compensate for the high off-rate constant of the monomer (Figure 7A). Furthermore, cross-

267

neutralizing VHH-72-Fc construct reached expression levels of ~300 mg/L in ExpiCHO cells

268

(Figure 7B). Using VHH-72-Fc purified from ExpiCHO cells and a SARS-CoV-2 S

269

pseudotyped VSV with a luciferase reporter, we evaluated the neutralization capacity of VHH-

270

72-Fc and found that it was able to neutralize pseudovirus with an IC50 of approximately 0.2

271

µg/mL (Figure 7C).

DISCUSSION

273

Here we report the isolation and characterization of two potently neutralizing single-domain

274

antibodies from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1

275

spikes. These VHHs bind to the spike RBDs with high affinity and are capable of neutralizing S

276

pseudotyped viruses in vitro. To our knowledge, the isolation and characterization of SARS-

277

CoV-1 S-directed VHHs have not been described before. Several MERS-CoV S-specific VHHs

278

have been described, all of which have been directed against the RBD. Several of these VHHs

279

have also been reported to block DPP4 binding, much like MERS VHH-55 (Stalin Raj et al.,

280

2018; Zhao et al., 2018). By solving the crystal structures of these newly isolated VHHs in

281

complex with their respective viral targets, we provide detailed insights into epitope binding and

282

their mechanisms of neutralization.

283

A number of RBD-directed conventional antibodies have been described that are capable

284

of neutralizing SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV. The epitope of MERS VHH-55 overlaps with the

285

epitopes of several of these MERS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies including C2, MCA1, m336,

286

JC57-14, D12, 4C2 and MERS-27 (Chen et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018; Wang et

287

al., 2015; Ying et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015) (S. Figure 7A). The epitope of SARS VHH-72 does

288

not significantly overlap with the epitopes of any previously described antibodies other than that

289

of the recently described CR3022, which is also capable of binding to the RBDs of both SARS-

290

CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S (Hwang et al., 2006; Pak et al., 2009; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Walls

291

et al., 2019; Yuan M, 2020) (S. Figure 7B). However, unlike SARS VHH-72, CR3022 does not

292

prevent the binding of ACE2 and it lacks neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al.,

293

2020; Yuan M, 2020). Because SARS VHH-72 binds with nanomolar affinity to a portion of the

294

SARS-CoV-1 S RBD that exhibits low sequence variation, as demonstrated by its cross-

295

reactivity toward the WIV1-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, it may broadly bind all S proteins

296

from SARS-CoV-like viruses. We show that by engineering a bivalent VHH-72-Fc construct, we

297

are able to compensate for the relatively high off-rate constant of the monovalent SARS VHH-

298

72. This bivalent molecule expresses well in transiently transfected ExpiCHO cells (~300 mg/L)

299

and is capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses in vitro.

300

Due to the inherent thermostability and chemostability of VHHs, they have been

301

investigated as potential therapeutics against a number of diseases. Several HIV- and influenza-

302

directed VHHs have been reported previously, and there are multiple RSV-directed VHHs that

303

have been evaluated (Detalle et al., 2016; Ibanez et al., 2011; Koch et al., 2017; Rossey et al.,

304

2017). The possibility of administering these molecules via a nebulized spray is particularly

305

attractive in the case of respiratory pathogens because the VHHs could theoretically be inhaled

306

directly to the site of infection in an effort to maximize bioavailability and function (Larios Mora

307

et al., 2018). Due to the current lack of treatments for MERS, SARS and COVID-19 and the

308

devastating effects associated with pandemic coronavirus outbreaks, both prophylactic and

309

therapeutic interventions are sorely needed. It is our hope that due to their favorable biophysical

310

properties and their potent neutralization capacity, MERS VHH-55, SARS VHH-72 and VHH-

311

72-Fc may serve as both useful reagents for researchers and as potential therapeutic candidates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

343

Llama immunization

344

A llama, negative for antibodies against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 S glycoprotein, was

345

subcutaneously immunized with approximately 150 µg recombinant SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein

346

on days 0, 7, 28 and 150 µg recombinant MERS-CoV S-2P protein on days 14 and 28 and 150 µg

347

of both MERS-CoV S-2P and SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein on day 35 (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018;

348

Pallesen et al., 2017). The adjuvant used was Gerbu LQ#3000. Immunizations and handling of the

349

llama were performed according to directive 2010/63/EU of the European parliament for the

350

protection of animals used for scientific purposes and approved by the Ethical Committee for

351

Animal Experiments of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (permit No. 13-601-1). Blood was collected

352

5 days after the last immunization for the preparation of lymphocytes. Total RNA from the

353

peripheral blood lymphocytes was extracted and used as template for the first strand cDNA

354

synthesis with oligo dT primer. Using this cDNA, the VHH encoding sequences were amplified

355

by PCR and cloned between the PstI and NotI sites of the phagemid vector pMECS. In the pMECS

356

vector, the VHH encoding sequence is followed by a linker, HA and His6 tag

357

(AAAYPYDVPDYGSHHHHHH). Electro-competent E.coli TG1 cells were transformed with the

358

recombinant pMECS vector resulting in a VHH library of about 3 x 108 independent transformants.

359

The resulting TG1 library stock was then infected with VCS M13 helper phages to obtain a library

360

of VHH-presenting phages.

363

Phages displaying MERS-CoV-specific VHHs were enriched after 2 rounds of biopanning on

364

20 μg of immobilized MERS-CoV S-2P protein in one well of a microtiter plate (type II, F96

365

Maxisorp, Nuc). For each panning round an uncoated well was used as a negative control. The

366

wells were then washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.05% Tween 20 and

367

blocked with SEA BLOCK blocking buffer (Thermo Scientific) in the first panning round and 5%

368

milk powder in PBS in the second panning round. About 1011 phages were added to the coated

369

well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Non-specifically bound phages were removed

370

by washing with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (10 times in the first panning round and 15 times in the

371

second panning round). The retained phages were eluted with TEA-solution (14% trimethylamine

372

(Sigma) pH 10) and subsequently neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8. The collected phages were

373

amplified in exponentially growing E.coli TG1 cells, infected with VCS M13 helper phages and

374

subsequently purified using PEG 8,000/NaCl precipitation for the next round of selection.

375

Enrichment after each panning round was determined by infecting TG1 cells with 10-fold serial

376

dilutions of the collected phages after which the bacteria were plated on LB agar plates with

377

100 μg mL−1 ampicillin and 1% glucose.

378

Phages displaying SARS-CoV-1 directed VHHs were enriched after 2 rounds of

379

biopanning on 20 μg of SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein captured with an anti-foldon antibody

380

(generously provided by Dr. Vicente Mas) in one well of a microtiter plate (type II, F96 Maxisorp,

381

Nuc). Before panning phages were first added to DS-Cav1 protein (McLellan et al., 2013)

382

containing a C-terminal foldon domain, to deplete foldon specific phages. The unbound phages

383

were next added to the coated well. Panning was performed as described above.

386

After panning, 45 individual colonies of phage infected bacteria isolated after the first panning

387

round on MERS-CoV S-2P or SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein and 45 individual colonies isolated after

388

the second panning round on MERS-CoV S-2P or SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein were randomly

389

selected for further analysis by ELISA for the presence of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 specific

390

VHHs, respectively. The individual colonies were inoculated in 2 mL of terrific broth (TB)

391

medium with 100 µg/mL ampicillin in 24-well deep well plates. After growing individual colonies

392

for 5 hours at 37 °C, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mM) was added to induce

393

VHH expression during overnight incubation at 37 °C. To prepare periplasmic extract, the bacterial

394

cells were pelleted and resuspended in 250 μL TES buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA,

395

0.5 M sucrose) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently 350 μL water was added to induce

396

an osmotic shock. After 1 hour incubation at 4 °C followed by centrifugation, the periplasmic

397

extract was collected.

398

VHH-containing periplasmic extracts were then tested for binding to either MERS-CoV S-

399

2P or SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein. Briefly, in the PE-ELISA screen after panning on MERS-CoV

400

S-2P protein, wells of microtiter plates (type II, F96 Maxisorp, Nuc) were coated overnight at 37

401

°C with 100 ng MERS-CoV S-2P (without foldon), MERS-CoV S-2P protein (with foldon) or as

402

negative controls coated with SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein (with foldon), HCoV-HKU1 S-2P

403

(without foldon), DS-Cav1 (with foldon) or bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich). In the

404

PE-ELISA screen after panning on SARS-CoV-1 S protein wells of microtiter plates (type II, F96

405

Maxisorp, Nuc) were coated with 100 ng SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein (with foldon), SARS-CoV-1

406

S-2P protein captured with an anti-foldon antibody (with foldon) or as negative controls coated

407

with MERS-CoV S-2P (without foldon), HCoV-HKU1 S-2P (without foldon), DS-Cav1 (with

408

foldon) or bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich). The coated plates were blocked with 5%

409

milk powder in PBS and 50 μL of the periplasmic extract was added to the wells. Bound VHHs

410

were detected with anti-HA (1/2,000, MMS-101P Biolegend) mAb followed by horseradish

411

peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-mouse IgG (1/2,000, NXA931, GE Healthcare). Periplasmic

412

fractions, for which the OD450 value of the antigen coated wells were at least two times higher than

413

the OD450 value of the BSA coated wells, were considered to be specific for the coated antigen and

414

selected for sequencing. The selected clones were grown in 3 mL of LB medium with 100 μg/mL

415

ampicillin. The DNA of the selected colonies was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit

416

(Qiagen) and sequenced using the MP057 primer (5’-TTATGCTTCCGGCTCGTATG-3’).

Cloning of MERS- and SARS-CoV directed VHHs into a Pichia pastoris expression vector

419

In order to express the MERS- and SARS-CoV VHHs in Pichia pastoris, the VHH encoding

420

sequences were cloned in the pKai61 expression vector (Schoonooghe et al., 2009). In the vector,

421

the VHH sequences contain a C-terminal 6x His-tag, are under the control of the methanol

422

inducible AOX1 promotor and in frame with a modified version of the S.cerevisae α-mating factor

423

prepro signal sequence. The vector contains a Zeocine resistance marker for selection in bacteria

424

as well as in yeast cells. The VHH encoding sequences were amplified by PCR using the following

Generation of bivalent VHH-constructs for production in Pichia pastoris

435

To generate bivalent tandem tail-to-head VHH constructs, the VHH sequence was amplified by

436

PCR using the following forward (5’- GGGGTATCTCTCGAGAAAAGGCAGGTGC

437

AGCTGGTGGAGTCTGGG-3’) and reverse (5’- AGACTCCTGCAGCTGCACCTGACT

438

439

CTGGG-3’) primers, thereby removing a PstI site from the beginning of the VHH coding sequence

440

and adding a (GGGGS)3 linker and the start of the VHH coding sequence with a PstI site at the

441

end of the sequence. After PCR, the fragment was cloned between the XhoI and SpeI sites in a

442

SARS VHH-72 containing pKai61 vector, thereby generating a homo-bivalent construct. The

443

vector containing this bivalent VHH was linearized and transformed in GS155 Pichia pastoris

444

cells as outlined above.

Pichia production and purification MERS- and SARS-CoV directed VHHs

447

The transformed Pichia pastoris clones were first expressed in 2 mL cultures. On day 1, 4 clones

448

of each construct were inoculated in 2 mL of YPNG medium (2% pepton, 1% Bacto yeast extract,

449

1.34% YNB, 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 6, 0.00004% biotin, 1% glycerol) with 100 μg/mL

450

Zeocin (Life Technologies) and incubated while shaking at 28 °C for 24 hours. The next day, the

451

cells were pelleted by centrifugation and the medium was replaced by YPNM medium (2% pepton,

452

1% Bacto yeast extract, 1.34% YNB, 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 1% methanol) to induce

453

VHH expression. Cultures were incubated at 28 °C and 50 μL of 50% methanol was added at 16,

24 and 40 h. After 48 h, the yeast cells were pelleted and the supernatant was collected. The

455

presence of soluble VHHs in the supernatants was verified using SDS-PAGE and subsequent

456

Coomassie Blue staining. VHH-containing supernatants of the different clones for each construct

457

were pooled and the VHHs were purified using HisPurTM Ni-NTA Spin Plates (88230, Thermo

458

Scientific™). Next, purified VHHs were concentrated on AcroPrepTM Advance 96-well filter

459

plates for ultrafiltration 3 kDa cutoff (8033,Pall) and the imidazole-containing elution buffer was

460

exchanged with PBS.

461

Production was scaled up (50 mL) for the VHHs with neutralizing capacity. Growth and

462

methanol induction conditions and harvesting of medium were similar as mentioned above for the

463

2 mL cultures. The secreted VHHs in the medium were precipitated by ammonium sulfate

464

(NH4)2SO4 precipitation (80% saturation) for 4 h at 4 °C. The insoluble fraction was pelleted by

465

centrifugation at 20,000 g and resuspended in 10 mL binding buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4 pH 7.5,

466

0.5M NaCl and 20 mM imidazole pH 7.4). The VHHs were purified from the solution using a 1

467

mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). To elute the bound VHHs a linear imidazole gradient

468

starting from 20 mM and ending at 500 mM imidazole in binding buffer over a total volume of 20

469

mL was used. VHH containing fractions were pooled and concentrated and the elution buffer was

470

exchanged with PBS with a Vivaspin column (5 kDa cutoff, GE Healthcare).

478

incubating the plates sequentially with either mouse anti-Histidine Tag antibody (MCA1396, Abd

479

Serotec) followed horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-mouse IgG (1/2000, NXA931, GE

Healthcare) or Streptavidin-HRP (554066, BD Biosciences) or by an HRP-linked rabbit anti-

481

camelid VHH monoclonal antibody (A01861-200, GenScript). After washing 50 µL of TMB

482

substrate (Tetramethylbenzidine, BD OptETA) was added to the plates and the reaction was

483

stopped by addition of 50 µL of 1 M H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nM was measured with an

484

iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio Rad). Curve fitting was performed using nonlinear

CoV pseudovirus neutralization

488

Pseudovirus neutralization assay methods have been previously described (Pallesen et al., 2017;

489

Wang et al., 2015). Briefly, pseudoviruses expressing spike genes for MERS-CoV England1

490

(GenBank ID: AFY13307) and SARS-CoV-1 Urbani (GenBank ID: AAP13441.1) were

491

produced by co-transfection of plasmids encoding a luciferase reporter, lentivirus backbone, and

492

spike genes in 293T cells (Wang et al., 2015). Serial dilutions of VHHs were mixed with

493

pseudoviruses, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then added to previously-plated

494

Huh7.5 cells. 72 hours later, cells were lysed, and relative luciferase activity was measured.

495

Percent neutralization was calculated considering uninfected cells as 100% neutralization and

496

cells transduced with only pseudovirus as 0% neutralization. IC50 titers were determined based

497

on sigmoidal nonlinear regression.

Rentsch and Zimmer, 2011; Hoffmann, 2020). For the VSV pseudotype neutralization

501

experiments, the pseudoviruses were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with different dilutions of

502

purified VHHs or with dilution series of culture supernatant of 293S cells that had been

503

transfected with plasmids coding for SARS VHH-72 fused to human IgG1 Fc (VHH-72-Fc) or

504

with GFP-binding protein (GBP: a VHH specific for GFP). The incubated pseudoviruses were

505

subsequently added to confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells. Sixteen hours later, the

506

transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring the firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates

507

using the firefly luciferase substrate of the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a

508

Figure 5: Neutralizing mechanisms of MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72. A) The MERS-CoV spike
(PDB ID: 5W9H) is shown as a molecular surface, with each monomer colored either white, gray or tan.
The tan and white monomers are bound by MERS VHH-55, shown as blue ribbons. The clash between
MERS VHH-55 bound to the white monomer and the neighboring tan RBD is highlighted by the red
ellipse. B) The SARS-CoV-1 spike (PDB ID: 5X58) is shown as a molecular surface, with each protomer
colored either white, gray or pink. Every monomer is bound by a copy of SARS VHH-72, shown as dark
blue ribbons. The clashes between copies of SARS VHH-72 and the two neighboring spike monomers are
highlighted by the red circle. C) The SARS-CoV-2 spike (PDB ID: 6VXX) is shown as a molecular
surface, with each protomer colored either white, gray or green. Every monomer is bound by a copy of
SARS VHH-72, shown as dark blue ribbons. The clashes between copies of SARS VHH-72 and the two
neighboring spike monomers are highlighted by the red circle. The SARS-CoV-2 trimer appears smaller
than SARS-CoV-1 S due to the absence of flexible NTD-distal loops which could not be built during cryoEM analysis. D) CoV VHHs prevent MERS-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-1 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1
from interacting with their receptors. The results of the BLI-based receptor-blocking experiment are

Figure 6: Bivalency overcomes the high off-rate constant of SARS VHH-72. A) SARS-CoV-1 S and B)
SARS-CoV-2 S VSV pseudoviruses were used to evaluate the neutralization capacity of SARS VHH-72.
MERS VHH-55 and PBS were included as negative controls. Luciferase activity is reported in counts per
second (c.p.s.). NI cells were not infected. C) Binding of bivalent VHHs was tested by ELISA against
SARS-CoV-1 S and D) SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1. VHH-72-Fc refers to SARS VHH-72 fused to a human
IgG1 Fc domain by a GS(GGGGS)2 linker. VHH-72-Fc (S) is the same Fc fusion with a GS, rather than a
GS(GGGGS)2, linker. GBP is an irrelevant GFP-binding protein. VHH-72-VHH-72 refers to the tail-tohead construct with two SARS VHH-72 proteins connected by a (GGGGS)3 linker. VHH-23-VHH-23
refers to the two irrelevant VHHs linked via the same (GGGGS)3 linker. E) SARS-CoV-1 S and F) SARSCoV-2 S pseudoviruses were used to evaluate the neutralization capacity of bivalent VHH-72-Fc. GBP and
PBS were included as negative controls. NI cells were not infected.

Figure 7: VHH-72-Fc neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses. A) BLI sensorgram measuring apparent
binding affinity of VHH-72-Fc to immobilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1. Binding curves are colored black,
buffer-only blanks are colored gray and the fit of the data to a 1:1 binding curve is colored red. B) Time
course analysis of VHH-72-Fc expression in ExpiCHO cells. Cell culture supernatants of transiently
transfected ExpiCHO cells were removed on days 3-7 after transfection (or until cell viability dropped
below 75%), as indicated. Two control mAbs were included for comparison, along with the indicated
amounts of purified GBP-Fc as a loading control. C) SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped VSV neutralization
assay. Monolayers of Vero E6 cells were infected with pseudoviruses that had been pre-incubated with the
mixtures indicated by the legend. The VHH-72-Fc used in this assay was purified after expression in
ExpiCHO cells (n = 4). VHH-23-Fc is an irrelevant control VHH-Fc (n = 3). NI cells were not infected.
Luciferase activity is reported in counts per second (c.p.s.) ± SEM.

Supplementary Figure 4: MERS VHH-55 binds to a relatively conserved epitope on the MERS-CoV
RBD. A) The crystal structure of MERS VHH-55 bound to the MERS-CoV RBD is shown with MERS
VHH-55 in white ribbons and the MERS-CoV RBD as a multicolored molecular surface. More variable
residues are shown in warm colors and more conserved residues are shown in cool colors according to the
spectrum (bottom). Sequence alignments and variability mapping was performed using ConSurf. B) The
crystal structure of MERS VHH-55 bound to the MERS-CoV RBD is shown as ribbons with MERS VHH55 colored blue and the MERS-CoV RBD colored tan. Phe506 from the MERS-CoV RBD and Trp99 from
MERS VHH-55, which are thought to form hydrophobic interactions with one another are shown as sticks
surrounded by a transparent molecular surface. C) SPR sensorgram measuring the binding of MERS
VHH-55 to the naturally occurring MERS-CoV RBD F506L variant. Binding curves are colored black and
the fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is colored red.

Supplementary Figure 6: Engineering a functional bivalent VHH construct. A) Flow cytometry
measuring the binding of the bivalent SARS VHH-72 tail-to-head fusion (VHH-72-VHH-72) to SARSCoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 S expressed on the cell surface. VHH-23-VHH-23, a bivalent tail-to-head fusion
of an irrelevant nanobody, was included as a negative control. B) Binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 to
Vero E6 cells is prevented by VHH-72-VHH-72 in a dose-dependent fashion. Binding of SARS-CoV-2
RBD-SD1 to Vero E6 cells was detected by flow cytometry in the presence of the indicated bivalent VHHs
(n = 2 except VHH-72-VHH-72 and VHH-23-VHH-23 at 5 µg/ml, n = 5). C) Binding of SARS-CoV-2
RBD-SD1 to Vero E6 cells is prevented by bivalent VHH-72-Fc fusion proteins in a dose-dependent
fashion. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1-Fc to Vero E6 cells was detected by flow cytometry in the
presence of the indicated constructs and amounts (n = 2 except no RBD, n = 4). D) Cell surface binding of
SARS VHH-72 to SARS-CoV-1 S. 293T cells were transfected with a GFP expression plasmid together
with a SARS-CoV-1 S expression plasmid. Binding of the indicated protein is expressed as the median
fluorescent intensity (MFI), measured to detect the His-tagged MERS VHH-55 or SARS VHH-72 or the
SARS VHH-72-Fc fusions, of the GFP positive cells divided by the MFI of the GFP negative cells. E) Cell
surface binding of SARS VHH-72 to SARS-CoV-2. MFI was calculated using the same equation as S.

ribbons and the MERS-CoV RBD as a white molecular surface. Epitopes from previously reported crystal
structures of the MERS-CoV RBD bound by RBD-directed antibodies are shown as colored patches on the
MERS-CoV RBD surface. The LCA60 epitope is shown in yellow, the MERS S4 epitope is shown in
green, the overlapping C2/MCA1/m336 epitopes are shown in red and the overlapping JC5714/D12/4C2/MERS-27 epitopes are shown in purple. B) The structure of SARS VHH-72 bound to the
SARS-CoV-1 RBD is shown with SARS VHH-72 as cyan ribbons and the SARS-CoV-1 RBD as a white
molecular surface. Epitopes from previously reported crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD bound
by RBD-directed antibodies are shown as colored patches on the SARS-CoV-1 RBD surface. The 80R
epitope is shown in blue, the S230 epitope is shown in yellow, and the overlapping m396/F26G19 epitopes
