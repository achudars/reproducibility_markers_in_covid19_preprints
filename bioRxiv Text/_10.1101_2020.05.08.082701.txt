Abstract
The coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, is presently responsible for a
global pandemic wherein more than 3.5 million people have been infected and more than 250,000 killed
to-date. There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, leaving governments and public health agencies
with little defense against the virus aside from advising or enforcing best practices for virus transmission
prevention, which include hand-washing, physical distancing, use of face covers, and use of effective
disinfectants. In this study, a novel iodine complex called CupriDyne® was assessed for its ability to
inactivate SARS-CoV-2. CupriDyne was shown to be effective in inactivating the virus in a timedependent manner, reducing virus titers by 99% (2 logs) after 30 minutes, and reducing virus titers to
below the detection limit after 60 minutes. The novel iodine complex tested herein offers a safe and
gentle alternative to conventional disinfectants for use on indoor and outdoor surfaces.

Introduction
Beginning in December of 2019, the novel coronavirus known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic wherein over 3.5 million people have been
infected, and over 250,000 people have died of the disease known as COVID-19 as of May, 2020 (Johns
Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020). First identified in patients in Wuhan City in Hubei
province, China (Lu et al, 2020), COVID-19 causes symptoms including a dry cough, fever, shortness of
breath and sore throat (CDC, 2020), and in severe cases can cause severe pneumonia, pulmonary
edema, organ failure, and death (Chen et al, 2020). The pandemic has spread to over 180 countries, with
most governments enacting unprecedented restrictions on movement and assembly of people to curb
the growth of the pandemic. Currently, there is no vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19.
Public health organizations have provided guidance on best practices to limit the spread of COVID-19,
which include frequent hand washing, physical distancing, the use of face covers, and the use of
effective cleaners and disinfectants to decontaminate surfaces (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2020). In the United
States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created a list of registered disinfectants that
meet its criteria for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (US EPA, 2020).

Broadly, the most common disinfectant used against the SARS-CoV-2 is diluted bleach, a widely available
and highly effective viral disinfectant. Bleach has several downsides when considered for widespread
use including common irritation of skin, mucosal membranes, and airways, its instability when exposed
to light, and its high degree of reactivity with organic material (WHO, 2014). Other common
disinfectants such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are also effective and widely available, but also have
downsides such as flammability, rate of evaporation, and skin sensitivity (Stanford, 2020). In light of
these disadvantages, there is a need to develop new disinfectants that are effective against SARS-CoV-2
but which do not cause sensitivity or irritation issues among exposed people, and which can provide
long-lasting efficacy.
Iodine-containing disinfectants have been used since the mid-19th century (Sneader, 2005), and today
iodine complexes such as povidone-iodine (PVP-I) are used in diverse applications that include surgical
antiseptic, skin disinfection, and water disinfection (Durani and Leaper, 2008). While traditional Lugol’s
iodine or iodine tinctures (wherein elemental iodine is dissolved in water or alcohol, respectively) are
effective yet cytotoxic disinfectants, povidone-iodine complexes provide effective disinfection without
significant cytotoxicity due to the slow release of iodine from the polyvinylpyrrolidone with which iodine
is complexed. However, povidone-iodine causes noticeable staining of skin and surfaces and commonly
causes skin irritancy (WHO, 2008), making it an unpopular hard surface disinfectant. Mechanistically,
iodine is believed to react with and inactivate bacteria and viruses by oxidizing and/or iodinating critical
proteins, DNA, RNA, and fatty acids (Gottardi, 1999; Gottardi, 2014). Iodine-containing solutions have
been proven effective against a wide variety of viruses including influenza A, poliovirus, adenovirus type
3, mumps, and HIV (Wada et al, 2016; Kawana et al, 1997), with some indication of greater viricidal
spectrum of activity compared to other commercially available disinfectants.
Iodine-containing solutions have historically been employed against other respiratory virus infection
outbreaks. In 2006, PVP-I was used to inactivate the SARS coronavirus of the so-called SARS epidemic to
below detectable levels in a laboratory study (Kariwa et al, 2006), and it was demonstrated effective
against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015 (Eggers et al, 2015).
Limited evidence also suggests iodine was successfully used to combat the spread of the 1918 H1N1 flu
pandemic, also known as the Spanish Flu (Derry et al. 2009).
CupriDyne® iodine complex (“CupriDyne”), made by Odor-No-More, Inc., a subsidiary of California-based
life sciences company BioLargo, Inc., is a novel iodine complex solution that produces high local
concentrations of iodine without causing the safety and staining issues associated with Lugol’s iodine or
PVP-I respectively. CupriDyne uses a proprietary chemical solution to produce aqueous elemental iodine
(I2) and cuprous iodide (CuI) in equilibrium.
CupriDyne is thought to react with airborne and surface-bound contaminants, microbes, and viruses
through 1) direct oxidation and/or iodination by I2, and 2) reaction with cuprous iodide (CuI). In addition
to the established antimicrobial action of I2, copper-containing complexes have been documented to
exhibit bactericidal and viricidal activity (Borkow et al, 2004), providing a theoretical basis for added
viricidal action of CupriDyne relative to traditional iodine solutions. In this study, CupriDyne was
assessed for its efficacy in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 using a Vero cell monolayer infection model.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell growth
Vero cells were grown in DMEM containing 1x L-glutamine, 1x penicillin/streptomycin, 1% MEM
vitamins, and 10% FBS, and were incubated at 37oC in 5% CO2. Cells were used at 85-95% confluent
growth.
Virus stocks
The SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) virus was obtained from The World Reference Center for Emerging
Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA), University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). SARS-CoV-2 was
propagated in DMEM containing 1x L-Glutamine, 1x penicillin/streptomycin, 1% MEM vitamins, and 5%
FBS at 37oC in 5% CO2. Prior to incubation, virus stocks were stored at -80oC at a concentration of 1x106
TCID50 per mL. All experiments involving infectious virus were conducted by Dr. Slobodan Paessler’s
laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) in approved biosafety level 3
laboratories in accordance with institutional health and safety guidelines and federal regulations.
Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 virus stocks
Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 was added at a MOI of 0.01 to Vero cells and incubated 1 hour at 37°C. Viral
inoculum was removed, and fresh infection media added. Cells were incubated for an additional 48
hours before supernatant was collected. Supernatant was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm to
remove cell debris. Virus stocks were stored at -80oC at a concentration of 1x106 TCID50 per mL.
Determination of Viral Titers
Viral titers were measured by TCID50 on Vero Cells. 96-well plates with Vero cells were used for this
assay. Each log10 dilution of the virus was inoculated in quadruplicates. On day 4 post-infection, the cells
were fixed with 10% formalin for 45 minutes and subsequently stained with crystal violet.
Determination of virus inactivation using CupriDyne or controls
Aliquots of stock virus were mixed 1:10 by volume with CupriDyne iodine complex (CupriDyne (250 ppm,
25 ppm, or 2.5 ppm)) or control solutions, negative control (room temperature water) or positive
control (boiling water >100oC)). The mixtures were incubated for predetermined time intervals at room
temperature at which time infection media was added to neutralize antiviral activity. Subsequently, The
SARS-CoV-2 viral titer (TCID50/mL) for each test substance was determined. The experiment was
conducted in triplicate.

Results
The ability of the CupriDyne iodine complex to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using a Vero cell
monolayer model. Undiluted (250 ppm), 1:10 diluted (25 ppm), and 1:100 diluted (2.5 ppm) solutions of
CupriDyne were assayed in order to approximate the minimum concentration of iodine complex
required to yield viricidal activity. The efficacy with which the CupriDyne iodine complex inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be both time- and concentration-dependent. Diluted samples of CupriDyne
(25 ppm or 2.5 ppm) were not found to cause a statistically significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 titers.

Undiluted CupriDyne (250 ppm) was shown to effectively inactivate the virus to a statistically significant
extent after 10, 30, and 60 minutes.
After incubation with undiluted (250 ppm) CupriDyne for 10 minutes, viral titers dropped by 1 log (onetailed t-test p-value = 0.0306). Viral titers dropped 2 logs (one-tailed t-test p-value = 0.0003) after
incubation with undiluted CupriDyne for 30 minutes. Further incubation with undiluted CupriDyne for 60
minutes reduced viral titers below the limit of detection (< 75 TCID50 per ml).

Figure 1: Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by CupriDyne. Stocks of SARS-CoV-2 virus were incubated with
CupriDyne solutions at 250 ppm (undiluted), 25 ppm (1:10 dilution), or 2.5 ppm (1:100 dilution), room
temperature water, or boiling water (>100oC water) for 10, 30, or 60 minutes. Samples were incubated
with Vero cell monolayers to determine remaining viable viral particle titers (TCID50).

Discussion
In this study, the efficacy of the CupriDyne iodine complex was assessed for its ability to inactivate SARSCoV-2. The results clearly show that the CupriDyne iodine complex has viricidal activity against SARSCoV-2. This effect is both concentration- and time-dependent. The CupriDyne iodine complex may
provide an alternative means of addressing and mitigating risks associated with surface contamination
and environmental exposure to infective SARS-CoV-2 virus particles.
It is thought that CupriDyne inactivates viruses through the combined effects of iodine and cuprous
iodide. The results collected here extend previous work demonstrating antiviral iodine activity against
human CoV viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to now include SARS-CoV-2 (Eggers et al., 2015,
Eggers et al., 2018). The limited literature available on viral iodine inactivation suggests iodine attacks

tyrosine and histidine residues on the viral protein coat resulting in structural changes and loss of
infectivity (Gottardi, 1999; Gottardi, 2014). Further knowledge of the mechanism(s) of iodine
inactivation may allow for improvements to the viricidal activity of the CupriDyne iodine complex.
Both bleach and alcohol exhibit instability in the environment over time, creating a gap for long-lasting
viricidal disinfectants. To determine whether CupriDyne may offer a longer-lasting alternative to bleach
and alcohol-based disinfectants, further studies should be conducted to assess CupriDyne’s viricidal
efficacy over extended (24 hours and more) exposure times with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, additional
studies should be conducted to directly compare CupriDyne’s efficacy over time relative to the efficacy
of common bleach and alcohol-based solutions. However, initial results clearly show that CupriDyne
exhibits viricidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 over 60 minutes.
The CupriDyne iodine complex contains ingredients that are safe for human exposure and which are not
known to be associated with poor environmental outcomes. Furthermore, a recent study conducted by
a government-certified South Korean laboratory demonstrated that CupriDyne passed all safety, aquatic
toxicity, and skin sensitivity tests required by the South Korean government (data not shown). These
attributes offer a potential advantage to currently available solutions for environmental control of SARSCoV-2 such as bleach or alcohol-based products that have downsides for widespread use including skin
sensitivity, inhalation risks, and poor environmental outcomes. Further studies should be conducted to
assess, at large scale and with good laboratory practice (GLP) standards, any potential negative health or
environmental impacts of CupriDyne to verify whether it could represent a safer, more environmentally
friendly surface disinfection alternative to conventional solutions.
This study provides strong evidence to the potential suitability of the CupriDyne novel iodine complex
for minimizing environmental exposure to the SARS-CoV-2.
