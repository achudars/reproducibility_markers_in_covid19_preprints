Abstract
An examination is presented of scientific research publication trends during the global
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. After reviewing the timing of the emergence of the
pandemic in 2020 and the growth of governmental responses, available secondary and sources
are used to highlight impacts of COVID-19 on scientific research. A bibliometric analysis is then
undertaken to analyze developments in COVID-19 related scientific publications through to
October of 2020 by broad trends, fields, countries, and organizations. Two publication data
sources are used: PubMed and the Web of Science.
While there has been a massive absolute increase in PubMed and Web of Science papers
directly focused on COVID-19 topics, especially in medical, biological science, and public health
fields, this is still a relatively small proportion of publication outputs across all fields of science.
Using Web of Science publication data, the paper examines the extent to which researchers
across all fields of science have pivoted their research outputs to focus on topics related to
COVID-19. A COVID-19 research pivot is defined as the extent to which the proportion of output
in a particular research field has shifted to a focus on COVID-19 topics in 2020 (to date)
compared with 2019. Significant variations are found by specific fields (identified by Web of
Science Subject Categories). In a top quintile of fields, not only in medical specialties,
biomedical sciences, and public health but also in subjects in social sciences and arts and
humanities, there are relatively high to medium research pivots. In lower quintiles, including
other subjects in science, social science, and arts and humanities, low to zero COVID-19
research pivoting is identified.

Introduction
This working paper takes an initial look at scientific research publication trends during the
global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
To provide context, the paper first discusses the timing of the emergence of the pandemic in
2020 and the growth of governmental responses. Scientific research, as with other societal and
economic activities across the globe, has been greatly impacted by COVID-19.
As one approach (of many possible approaches) to assessing COVID-19’s effects on science, the
paper analyzes developments in COVID-19 and all scientific publications in 2020 by broad
trends, fields, countries, and organizations. Comparisons are made with the pre-COVID year of
2019. The paper also examines the extent to which researchers across all fields of science have
pivoted their research outputs to focus on topics related to COVID-19.
Two publication data sources are used for the analyses presented in the paper: PUBMED and
the Web of Science. A bibliometric search approach is applied to publication datasets from
these two sources to identify COVID-19 relevant publications. The publication datasets and
bibliometric search approach are described in a subsequent section of the paper.

Emergence of the pandemic and timing of government responses
In January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of
international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 In March 2020, WHO
designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.2 While early cases of COVID-19 were reported in January
2020, the worldwide rate of growth of reported cases began to accelerate from February 2020
(Figure 1). Reported COVID-19 cases continued to increase globally throughout 2020, reaching
45.7 million by the end of October 2020, and growing to over 61 million by the end of
November 2020.3 The number of countries reporting COVID-19 cases rose to 22 by the end of
January 2020, rising to 58 by the end of February 2020. Just a month later, by the end of March
2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in 192 countries, rising to 212 by October 2020.4
Governments around the world have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with a range of
policy responses including workplace and school closings, requests and orders to stay at home,

controls on domestic and international travel, financial and economic support, and multiple
healthcare and public health measures.5 The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT) indicates that some governments were undertaking policy responses in January 2020.
However, the greatest surge worldwide in COVID-19 government responses occurred in March
and April of 2020, continuing – with some fluctuations – throughout 2020, as measured by
OxCGRT’s global mean index values for COVID-19 government response for over 180 countries
(Figure 1).6

Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientific research
Published reports and articles indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had multiple consequences for
scientific research.
For scientists working directly on COVID-19 research, including in epidemiology, virology, testing and
diagnosis, therapies and treatments, medical equipment, vaccine development, and public health
responses, it has been a period of urgent focus with expectations of rapid results. Worldwide, scientists
have been activated to respond to COVID-19, using both existing resources and a massive injection of

new R&D funds by research sponsors.7,8 Research sponsors have shortened proposal review times and
accelerated award processes for new COVID-19 R&D funding.9 More than 175 new COVID-19 R&D
programs and projects have been identified by OECD in in multiple locations (including in Europe, the
US, Canada, Australia, China, Brazil, Russia and India).10 Another estimate suggests that, since January
2020, more than $9 billion in government, philanthropic, and industry funding has been committed
globally for COVID-19 R&D.11 Much of this funding has gone to COVID-19 R&D by private companies,
although universities and other public research organizations have also been supported, with the US
being by far the largest sponsor, followed by Canada, Germany and the UK.12
The urgency of the pandemic and the extraordinary new R&D focus on COVID-19 has resulted in a
massive increase in COVID-19 research publications. There has been a sharp growth in papers
addressing COVID-19 topics, with US, Chinese, UK, and other European researchers anchoring the
largest research networks.13 There has been growth not only in peer-reviewed journal articles but also in
preprints (non-peer reviewed, publicly available papers) that address COVID-19 topics, with new tools
and databases emerging to track and sort these papers.14 Cautions have been raised about the quality of
COVID-19 “speed science,” especially among non-reviewed preprints.15 However, one early (April 2020)
study found that more than three-quarters of the 11,686 COVID-19 papers identified at that point were
journal papers (compared with preprint papers in repositories, many of which were pre-publication
versions of papers in processes of journal submission).16 The study noted that the three largest openaccess repositories for COVID-19 papers were PMC and PubMed, medRxiv and BioRxiv.

Meanwhile, particularly since March 2020 as governments expanded responses to curtail the spread of
the pandemic, scientists in non-COVID-19 research domains have endured multiple disruptions to
regular research work.17,18,19 Research facilities, laboratories, and labs have been closed for long periods
in many countries. Across all fields, large numbers of researchers have spent months working from
home, using remote access where possible. The recruitment of doctoral and early career researchers
(especially internationally) has slowed, where it was not suspended.20 Research-related fieldwork and
other travel has halted, while online video conferencing for team meetings, workshops and conferences
has boomed. With school closures and social distancing, scientists with family and other caring
responsibilities have faced added pressures, with effects on research productivity especially experienced
by women.21,22
The closure of research facilities in 2020 resulted in benchwork, experiments and trials being stopped
and the blocking of access to labs, instruments, and equipment. For example, more than 90% of labs at
MIT were shut by March 20. 23 The only exemptions were for labs working with coronavirus research,
expensive materials, and certain animal experiments. As elsewhere, researchers shifted to a virtual
environment, including using (and publishing with) already available data, or reorienting projects to
involve more simulation work. In some instances, new lab automation was introduced. However,
remote working for many months has presented challenges. For non-COVID 19 cancer research, access
to labs and samples, the pausing of patient enrolment on clinical trials, and face-to-face interactions
with colleagues have been major concerns.24 In contrast, for some other non-lab bound scientists, the
worldwide slowdown or ceasing of human activities caused by the pandemic presented unique
observational opportunities. New opportunities emerged to study impacts of reduced traffic, ocean

world.25,26
Towards the middle and latter months of 2020, research labs began to re-open in a growing number of
countries. In this phase of ramp-up, labs typically re-opened with capacity reductions or controlled shift
work due to social distancing and other preventative measures.27,2829 At the UK’s Institute for Cancer
Research, the proportion of time researchers spent in labs dropped from 53% pre-pandemic to 5% in
lockdown, returning only to 34% many months later during phased access. 30
The reopening of research labs for non-COVID-19 research has proceeded cautiously, even in locations,
such as China, where the spread of COVID-19 has been controlled following the initial outbreak. In other
countries, including in the UK and other parts of Europe, there have been phases of ramping-up of some
research activities, followed by subsequent lockdowns in the Autumn of 2020.
The outlook for the large-scale rollout of safe and effective vaccines now appears optimistic for 2021.
However, there remain uncertainties in many countries as to when labs can fully open, without social
distancing, and when international travel will fully resume. Some work practices established in the
pandemic may persist (including continued extensive use of virtual team working and virtual
conferencing), while there are likely to be enduring impacts for many researchers in terms of lost
experiments, reoriented topics, and career development.

Identifying COVID-19 publications: A bibliometric search approach
To provide an update to bibliometric studies undertaken earlier in the pandemic, the paper probes
trends in COVID-19 publications and non-COVID-19 publications as far as is possible in 2020.
Complete publication data for the full year of 2020 is not available at the time of this analysis. Access is
available for publication datasets through to September to November of 2020, allowing about 9 to
nearly 11 months of publication data to be analyzed (depending on the database). Two publication
databases are used. The first is the PubMed database, maintained by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). This allows searches of more
than 31 million journal records and abstracts in biomedical, health and related fields, including more
than 8 million full-text records.31 The second database is the Web of Science (WoS), maintained by

Clarivate Analytics, which contains 78 million publication records from about 21,000 peer-reviewed
journals in more than 250 fields of science, social science, and arts and humanities.32 Both PubMed and
WoS have worldwide coverage, although they predominantly contain English-language records.33
To identify COVID-19 records in PubMed, the following COVID-19 bibliometric search approach
developed by Search Technology and Georgia Tech was used:34
•

PubMed: "COVID-19"[All Fields] OR ("coronavirus"[MeSH Terms] OR "coronavirus"[All Fields])
OR "Corona virus"[All Fields] OR "2019-nCoV"[All Fields] OR "SARS-CoV"[All Fields] OR "MERSCoV"[All Fields] OR "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"[All Fields] OR "Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome"[All Fields]

This search approach was applied to PubMed to obtain summary totals for COVID-19 records for all
years. Additionally, for detailed analysis based on aggregations of individual records, the paper uses a
publicly available database of COVID-19 PubMed records made available by Search Technology based on
the above search approach. This database contained 56,463 COVID-19 records from PubMed published
in 2020 through to September 22, 2020 (All documents).35
To identify COVID-19 records in WoS, the same bibliometric search approach was adapted for the WoS
Advanced Search facility:
•

WoS: TS=("COVID-19" OR Coronavirus OR "Corona virus" OR "2019-nCoV" OR "SARS-CoV" OR
"MERS-CoV" OR "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome" OR "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome")

This search approach was applied to the WoS (Indexes=SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH,
ESCI) refined by document types (article, early access, review, or proceedings paper). After capturing
records and cleaning, this resulted in 44,022 COVID-19 WoS records, published 1969 through to October
24, 2020. Aggregated analysis was also undertaken for all WoS publication records (with same Indexes
and document types, for 2020) downloading the summary results (but not individual records).
VantagePoint desktop text mining software was used for further processing and analysis of the two
datasets containing the WoS and PubMed records.36
The next parts of the paper present analyses using the WoS and PubMed publication data. In
interpreting these analyses, keep in mind the differences between the two databases. As noted, the
WoS covers all fields of science, social science, and arts and humanities. The analysis that follows
includes articles, early access, review, or proceedings papers from reviewed sources. Articles and

reviews comprise about 95% of the COVID-19 WoS dataset. Preprints and chapters in edited volumes
are not included, and there is some lag (most relevant for 2020 data) in review and publication
processes. PubMed is focused on biomedical, health and related fields, but there is a wider sweep in the
records reported including Medline (containing publication records from evaluated journals), papers
from other journals, chapters and preprints (the latter with less time lag in posting).

Growth of COVID-19 publications in 2020
Research related to various forms of coronavirus has been undertaken for several decades, with
publication at a relatively low level, e.g. at around 150-200 annual publications in the late 1990s and
early 2000s.37 There was a spike in research publications with about 700 WoS and 4,000 PubMed
publications over the 3-year 2003-2005 period, with the global emergence of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), a distinct coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Subsequently, coronavirus-related publications
continued at annual levels of around 650 and 760 in the WoS and PubMed in the 2006 to 2019 period.
The publication profile, of course, changed dramatically in 2020, with the rapid worldwide spread of
COVID-19. The urgent focus of scientific attention generated by the pandemic, as noted earlier in this
paper, has been associated with a massive increase in publication outputs on COVID-19 topics. From
January to November 2020, more than 38,000 WoS and 78,000 PubMed publications were recorded.
Reflecting the upward step in the volume of COVID-19 publications is a noticeable shift in 2020 in the
proportion of all scientific publication efforts devoted to pandemic-related research. When compared
with 2019, the share of COVID-19 publications in 2020 in all publications rose from 0.03% to 1.8% in the
WoS and from 0.07% to 5.3% in PubMed (Figure 2).
On a month-by-month basis in 2020, COVID-19 research publications in PubMed began to accelerate in
February and March 2020 (when the global extent of the pandemic was fully realized, and government
responses heightened). There was a further increase in rate of PubMed COVID-19 outputs from April
through to the Summer of 2020. (Figure 3.) This analysis is based on PUBMED records published in 2020
as of September 22, 2020. Publication tallies for more recent months are not completely captured. In
other words, the apparent downward PubMed profile from August 2020 is based on incomplete record
capture. More publications will be added in the more recent months when 2020 is more fully indexed
(by the first part of 2021). WoS COVID-19 publications show comparable trends, except with a lower
rate of take-off (than for PubMed publications) in Spring 2020. Again, the WoS dataset (containing
COVID-19 publication records as of October 24, 2020) is not complete for more recent months.

In 2000, there were 141 WoS and 151 PubMed publication recorded on coronavirus-related topics.

mid-size developed (OECD)38 countries of France, Canada, Spain, Germany, and Australia comprise all
but one among other locations in the top ten. India is positioned fifth by number of 2020 COVID-19
papers, with two other non-OECD countries – Brazil and Iran – placed eleventh and twelfth.
Based on WoS publications, the positioning of the US and China is reversed when publications across all
fields is considered. The US contributed 29.1% of 2020 publications in the COVID-19 WoS dataset,
compared with 22.3% of all WoS publications over the period January 2020 through to November 2020,
a ratio of Covid-19 to all papers of 1.30. 39 The comparable numbers for China are 15.6% of COVID-19
WoS papers and 23.6% of all WoS papers, with a ratio of Covid-19 to all papers of 0.66. Understanding
the reasons for this difference needs further investigation, but it probably reflects the strong and
relatively larger base of biomedical research in the US and the influence of rapidly available added
COVID-19 research funding. Additionally, it is important to note that China has published and made
available a large volume of WoS (as well as PubMed) papers on COVID-19.
Among other countries, the UK, Italy, India and Canada published in 2020 (to date) a relatively larger
share of COVID-19 WoS papers when compared with all WoS papers (ratios of 1.46, 2.43, 1.15, and 1.15
respectively). France and Germany are among countries publishing COVID-19 papers in 2020 at
comparable or relatively lower rates when compared with all WoS papers (1.03 and 0.83 respectively).
Authors affiliated with institutions in Russia published COVID-19 WoS papers at relatively lower rates
when compared with all Russian WoS papers (ratio of 0.42).

Researchers from a wide range of organizations (based on author affiliations) in multiple countries have
been contributing to the rapid expansion of COVID-19 research papers in 2020. Of the top 20
organizations by PubMed COVID-19 publications in 2020 (to September 22), nine are based in the US,
four in China, two in the UK, and one each in Singapore, Italy, India, Canada, and Iran (Figure 5). Mostly,
the leading organizations are research universities and specialized medical research institutions,
although there is notable representation from identifiable hospitals and clinics.40 For WoS COVID-19
publications in 2020 (to October 24), organizations from fewer countries are represented in the top 20,
but the top part of that list is comparable, led by eight organizations based in the US, six in China, and
three in the UK (Figure 6).

Huazhong University of Science and Technology (in Wuhan, Hubei province, China) is the leading
publisher of both PubMed and WoS COVID-19 papers, by volume of papers. Wuhan University is tenth
organization by PubMed COVID-19 papers and third by WoS COVID-19 papers, again by volume of
output. 41 The University of Hong Kong is also a leading producer of PubMed COVID-19 outputs. Johns

In the top 100 COVID-19 publishing organizations by author affiliations in the PubMed dataset, 54 are indicated
as universities, 25 as medical schools, 18 are hospitals or clinics, and 3 are national or public research
organizations. However, organizations and affiliations can be intertwined. Hospitals and clinics are often
associated with universities. In some cases, researchers will publish with a university or medical school or hospital
affiliation (or a combination of two or more affiliations).

Pennsylvania in North America, and University College London and Oxford University in the UK, are
leading producers of PubMed COVID-19 publications. These are all large research institutions with
significant medical and public health research capabilities. By output of WoS COVID-19 papers, research
institutions in China, North America, and Europe (the UK and Italy) comprise the top ten. 42

Figure 6

COVID-19 Publications by Subject Categories
The journals included in the WoS publication database are classified by over 250 “subject categories.”43
These subject categories (SCs) are broadly equivalent to disciplines, but this is not a perfect match. 44
Journals can and do cover multiple fields of science. In the WoS scheme, journals (and the papers they
publish) may be classified in up to 6 SCs, although about 60% of journals in WoS are classified in only
one SC, with another 30% classified in two SCs.45 Some journals are explicitly interdisciplinary. Reflecting
this there are nine WoS SCs that are designated as multidisciplinary, including “Multidisciplinary
Sciences” (which includes such journals as Nature and Science that publish across all fields of science).
42

While there are broad similarities in outputs of COVID-19 PubMed and WoS papers by organizational affiliations,
some differences are also observable. Underlying reasons for these differences may include variations in
organizational structure (e.g. university relationships with medical schools and affiliated hospitals) and disciplinary
composition within each institution, topical foci, and distribution of publication outlets including by journal, peer
reviewed and preprint placements.

The journal SC (or combination of SCs) is allocated to every paper in the journal, although individual
papers within a particular journal may be varied in their subject matter. Additionally, as scientific fields
evolve and novel fields form, new journals typically emerge. This presents classification challenges and
lags, although SCs and constituent journals are periodically updated to reflect changes in fields, new
fields, and repositioning of journals. While it is convenient and common to use WoS SCs to overview the
distribution of published outputs by various scientific fields, these caveats about the classification
scheme should be kept in mind.
To provide a basis over time for comparison, WoS COVID-19 publications are analyzed for two time
periods: 2017-201946 and 2020 (through to October 24). (Figure 7.) In the earlier period, “Virology” was
the leading SC category, with 562 coronavirus WoS publications, or 24.4%) of this SC’s total from 2017 to
2019 (three complete years). In this earlier period, the second and third SCs by 562 coronavirus WoS
publications were “Infectious Diseases” (354 publications) and “Microbiology” (285 publications).
Together, more than half (52.1%)47 of earlier period coronavirus outputs were classified in these three
SCs, reflecting a research focus on the properties and microbiology of the virus itself.

Figure 7

In 2020, the profile of COVID-19 research publications dramatically changed – with an upsurge in the
volume of publications and engagement of scientists from a wider array of research fields. There was a
massive increase in “Medicine, General & Internal” (over 2,500 WoS COVID-19 publications in 2020 to
date, compared with just over 50 WoS coronavirus publications in the prior three-year period). Along
with large increases of 2020 COVID-19 WoS publications in the SCs of “Public, Environmental &

Occupational Health,” “Pharmacology & Pharmacy,” “Environmental Sciences,” “Surgery,” and
“Medicine, Research and Experimental,” this represents an understandable and rapid broadening of
COVID-19 research activities into the domains of treatment, therapy, contagion, and public health.
Multiple other medical fields with little prior coronavirus research activity saw significant increases in
2020 COVID-19 WoS publications, including “Psychiatry,” “Cardiac &, Cardiovascular Systems,”
“Oncology,” “Clinical Neurology,” “Radiology,” “Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,” and “Pediatrics”
(see Figure 7). The SCs of “Infectious Diseases,” “Microbiology,” and “Virology,” as with “Immunology”,
“Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,” and “Cell Biology”, all saw surges in 2020 COVID-19 WoS
publications as researchers further analyzed the nature and pathology of the virus and explored human
impacts and responses. Research on vaccines is categorized across several SCs: the leading categories
for COVID-19 WoS publications related to vaccines are “immunology,” “Virology”, “Medicine, Research
and Experimental,” “Microbiology,” and Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology.”

COVID-19 Pivots in 2020 by Research Fields
With the urgency and global spread of the pandemic in 2020, scientists around the world have
substantially expanded their COVID-19 research efforts. One outcome of this, as we have seen, is a
massive increase in the volume of PubMed and WoS publications on COVID-19 topics. It is evident, from
the analysis in the previous section of WoS subject categories, that researchers in medicine, biological
sciences, and public health domains have greatly expanded COVID-19 publication outputs in 2020. The
entry of “Economics” (at 30th place) in the top 30 SCs by number of WoS COVID-19 publications in 2020
(Figure 7) highlights COVID-19 research activity in the social sciences. This is comprehensible: while the
global pandemic has caused tragic public health consequences and massive impacts on health care
systems, it has resulted in huge effects worldwide across all aspects of life and human activity, economy,
society, community, and government.
Given the scale and scope of the pandemic, scientists across a wide range of research fields will surely
be interested in, and concerned about, the impacts and consequences of COVID-19 in its many and
varied forms. Those interests and concerns may take different forms including policy and community
engagement as well as reoriented or new research projects related to COVID-19 topics. Publication
opportunities from these activities and projects likely varies across fields. As discussed earlier in this
paper, large numbers of scientists not working directly on urgent COVID-19 medical, biological science,
or public health topics have spent much of 2020 working from home or at reduced levels of access to
their labs, field sites, or research subjects. This surely influences research paper productivity. In certain
circumstances, output may increase, for example for scientists working directly on urgent COVID-19
topics or who have access to data that can be written up. We have clearly seen a massive increase in
PubMed and WoS publications related to COVID-19. To an extent, this wave of new COVID-19
publications may have substituted for what would have been other outputs; or the urgency of the
pandemic and the massive efforts of researchers (and perhaps a strong desire by some to be first to
publish) may have generated increased publication productivity. In many other cases, there may be
adverse effects on publication productivity, where research has slowed or paused or where researchers
have been preoccupied with family or caring responsibilities, online teaching (where researchers also
teach), crisis management, or suffered personal or family health impacts.
It is important for many reasons (including research management, researcher career development, and
policy learning) to assess how research productivity, as measured by publication outputs, has been

affected during the pandemic, with comparison to pre-pandemic norms (and, of course, the postpandemic era, when we reach that point). Such an analysis should account for field and institutional
effects as well as potential differential effects by researcher gender, seniority, and roles. Any immediate
(2020) analysis should also account for the significant variations in time lags to publication by journals in
different fields48 and the impact of the pandemic on journal peer review processes.49
However, 2020 is not yet complete (at the time of analysis and writing). Indeed, a complete record of
publications for the full year of 2020 will only be available only in 2021, as some time needs to elapse
before all prior period publications are recorded in indexes such as PubMed or WoS. Hence, it is not yet
possible to undertake disaggregated and controlled measures of research publication output by quantity
for the full year of 2020 compared with 2019 (or, indeed, for earlier years).
These caveats noted, it is nonetheless possible to assess COVID-19 research pivots not only for medical,
biological science, or public health fields, but across all domains of science, social science, and the
humanities. A COVID-19 research pivot is defined as the extent to which the proportion of output in a
particular research field has shifted to a focus on COVID-19 topics in 2020 (to date) compared with 2019.
COVID-19 research pivoting is calculated by measuring publication outputs on COVID-19 topics in a field
as a percentage of all publication outputs in that field for 2019 and 2020, then subtracting the 2019
percentage from the 2020 percentage. This results in a COVID-19 “pivot point” index. This is a simple
method, but it is effective in normalizing outputs for the yet not quite complete year of 2020. There are
some fields (for example, “Virology”) with a proportion of publication outputs captured by the COVID-19
bibliometric search term in 2019; the pivot point measure highlights the added extent to which the
proportion of 2020 COVID-19 publication outputs increased over the prior year. Most research fields,
however, had zero 2019 COVID-19 publication outputs; in this case, the pivot point measures the new
extent to which research outputs in that field shifted to a COVID-19 focus in 2020, if at all.
The method is operationalized by applying the COVID-19 bibliometric search term to the full WoS online
database as of October 24, 2020 (Indexes=SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, ESCI) refined
by document types (article, early access, review, or proceedings paper). For 2019, the total number of
WoS records is 2,567,047, of which 828 are identified as COVID-19 publications. For 2020 (through to
October 24), the total number of WoS records is 1,952,201, of which 30,143 are identified as COVID-19
publications. WoS subject categories (SCs) are used as a proxy for research fields. All 254 WoS SCs (as of
October 2, 2020) are included in the analysis. (See Appendix for data table.)
Recall that not all 2020 publications are recorded yet (whether for papers with COVID-19 or non-COVID19 topics). Whether a WoS publication count of about 1.9 million papers by the third week of October
2020 (or 2.1 million by the end of November 2020 50) is significantly different from the comparable
numbers at the same time in 2019 cannot be determined as that data is not available to the researcher

(although that information would be available internally to the producer of the database). However, it
can be observed that there has been an overall increase in the share of COVID-19 outputs in all WoS
publications, increasing from 0.03% in 2019 to 1.5% in 2020 (to October 24).51,52 This represents an
absolute and significant increase of about 29,300 COVID-19 papers in 2020 (to October 24). Most
published papers recorded in the WoS in 2020 are not COVID-19 related (i.e. the whole of science has
not pivoted to COVID-19 research). Nonetheless, by specific SCs, there are substantial variations, with
some fields (as defined by WoS subject categories) making noticeable COVID-19 research pivots, while in
most fields there is a small or non-detectable COVID-19 research pivot.
To analyze the extent of the relative shift into COVID-19 research topics by individual scientific fields in
2020 (to October 24), the COVID-19 research pivot (RP) measure is calculated for each WoS SC. For the
254 SCs, key RP values are: maximum = 15.8; mean = 1.5; median = 0.6; and minimum = 0.0. An
asymmetrical and skewed distribution is indicated, with a long right tail of low to zero RP values. To
visualize the distribution, the ranked RP measures by SC are presented by quintiles. The top quintile is
named as comprising “high to medium” pivots, the second and third quintiles as “medium to low”
pivots, and the fourth and fifth quintiles as “low to zero” pivots. Percentages of SC COVID-19 related
outputs are denoted as cPC19 and cPC20 for 2019 and 2020 (to October 24) respectively.
In the first quintile, the SC with the highest COVID-19 research pivot is “Virology” (RP=15.8; cPC19=3.0%;
cPC20=18.8%). (Figure 8.) The second highest is “Medical Ethics” (RP=15.0, cPC19=0.0%; cPC20=15.0%).
Rounding out the top ten SCs with highest relative COVID-19 research pivots are “Infectious Diseases”
(RP=9.5), “Medicine General Internal” (RP=7.0), “Otorhinolaryngology” (RP=6.4), “Public Administration”
(RP=6.3), “Critical Care Medicine” (RP=5.6), “Public Environmental & Occupational Health” (RP=5.5),
“Emergency Medicine” (RP=5.3), and “Health Care Sciences Services” (RP=5.2). For only three of these
ten SCs is cPC19 > 0.0, indicating that most of these fields have made a new and rapid research pivot
into COVID-19 in 2020. Additionally, while six of the top ten SCs with the highest RP rankings are in
medical specialties (including emergency and critical care) and biological sciences, the other four are in
fields of medical ethics, public administration, public health, and health care delivery, highlighting the
wide-ranging implications of the pandemic taken up by researchers.
This pattern is replicated in the balance of the first quintile of high to medium RPs, with multiple medical
specialties, biological sciences, and public health fields represented, alongside “Ethics,” “Social issues,”
“Health Policy Sciences,” “Social Sciences, Biomedical,” and “Social Work.” Other entries in the medium
RP sections of the first quintile also include “Folklore”, “Law”, and “Women’s Studies.”53

51

The aggregated WoS publication numbers reported in this analysis are slightly lower than reported in Figure 2.
The reason is that the subject category analysis in this section was undertaken with data as of October 24, 2020
(when WoS reported 1.95 million records), while Figure 2 is based on data from November 30, 2020 (when WoS
reported 2.105 million records) 2020 (Indexes=SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, ESCI) refined by
document types (article, early access, review, or proceedings paper).
52
The 2020 COVID-19 share of all WoS publications is lower than reported for PubMed (see earlier discussion and
Figure 2). PubMed focus on medical, bioscience, and public health domains and includes preprints, while WoS
primarily covers journals across all fields of science, social science, and the arts and humanities.
53
These fields vary in size, with total SC publishing (in 2020) ranging from many thousands to a few hundred. While
“Folklore” is the smallest field in the top quintile (RP=3.8, cPC19=0.0%; cPC20=3.8%), researchers in this field have
published in 2020 on such subjects as myths and urban legends about coronavirus, and how the pandemic has
affected museums and traditional folk crafts.

Figure 8

Of the 51 SCs in the first quintile, 35 (69%) are indexed in the WOS SCI, 15 (29%) in SSCI, and 1 (2%) in
A&HCI.54 In the first quintile, 2.7 < RP < 15.8 with a mean (x̄) of 4.6.
The second and third quintiles (“medium to low” COVID-19 research pivots) also contain a mix of
science, social science, and arts and humanities SCs. (Figure 9.) “Parasitology” (RP=2.7, cPC19=0.2%;
cPC20=2.7%) and “Clinical Neurology” (RP=2.6, cPC19=0.0%; cPC20=2.6%) lead this intermediate set of
quintiles, ranked 52 and 53 (of 254) respectively. The entries from SSCI and A&HCI in this set are led by
“Area Studies” (RP=2.6, cPC19=0.0%; cPC20=2.6%) and “Cultural Studies” (RP=2.0, cPC19=0.0%;
cPC20=2.0%). Although “Economics” is represented in 30th position by absolute number of COVID-19
publications (Figure 7), it is more moderately ranked (89 of 254) in terms of its relative COVID-19
research pivot (RP=1.4, cPC19=0.0%; cPC20=1.4%). Economics is one of the largest producers of SSCI
WoS publications; however, even though 350 COVID-19 related papers were identified in 2020 (to
October 24), this was a relatively small proportion of its total SC output (25,325) to the search date.
Of the 101 SCs in the second and third quintiles, 55 (54%) are indexed in SCI, 34 (34%) in SSCI, and 12
(12%) in A&HCI. In this medium to low set, 0.3 < RP < 2.7 (x̄ = 1.2). In the last set, the fourth and fifth
quartiles, there are 102 SCs, of which 76 (75%) are indexed in SCI, 7 (7%) in SSCI, and 19 (19%) in A&CHI.
In this “low-to zero” set, 0.0 ≤ RP < 0.3 (x̄ = 0.1). In 37 SCs in the lowest quintile, no COVID-19 related
papers were identified out of more than 216,000 WoS publications for 2020 (to October 24). (Figure 10.)
Again, note that publication data for 2020 is incomplete; researchers in these SCs may have preprints,
papers or forthcoming and other COVID-19 research contributions not captured by this analysis.

Concluding Comments
The analyses presented in this paper should be regarded as preliminary. In 2020, scientific research
around the world has been massively impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic; these impacts are still
in progress and will likely continue well into 2021. The full consequences and implications of COVID-19
and the pandemic on science, researchers and research institutions will take some further time, possibly
years, to be wholly comprehended.
The paper has used available secondary and bibliometric data to analyze one aspect of the pandemic’s
impacts on research, focusing on publication outputs (through to the September to November of 2020,
depending on the databases used). Large-scale publication data is available in the PubMed and WoS
database, although complete publication records for 2020 will not be available until the early parts of
2021. This caveat should be kept in mind, along with other limitations in using publication outputs to
assess research performance, differences in content between PubMed and the WoS, and variations by
fields and countries in approaches to publishing in sources that are recorded in these two publication
databases.
The analysis finds a massive absolute increase in PubMed and Web of Science papers directly focused on
COVID-19 topics, especially in medical, biological science, and public health fields, although this is still a
relatively small proportion of publication outputs across all fields of science. Using Web of Science
publication data, the paper examined the extent to which researchers across all fields of science have
pivoted their research outputs in 2020 to focus on topics related to COVID-19. Significant variations are
found by specific fields (identified by Web of Science Subject Categories). In a top quintile of fields – not
only in medical specialties, biomedical sciences, and public health but also in subjects in social sciences
and arts and humanities – there are relatively high to medium research pivots. In lower quintiles,
including other subjects in science, social science, and arts and humanities, low to zero COVID-19
research pivoting is identified. It was noted that researchers may have preprints, papers or forthcoming
and other COVID-19 research contributions not captured by the WoS analysis.
