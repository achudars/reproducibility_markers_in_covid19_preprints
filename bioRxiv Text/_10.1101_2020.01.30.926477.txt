Abstract (365 words)
Background: The current outbreak caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China
has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed
cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.
Methods: We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the
Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database
of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA
6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct
phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic
analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the
molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the
most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.
Results: An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and
genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of
ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There
are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide
substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10-2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with
95% HPD interval being 6.27 × 10-4 to 2.72 × 10-2) for N, 5.34 × 10-3 (5.10 × 10-4, 1.28 ×
10-2) for S, 1.69 × 10-3 (3.94 × 10-4, 3.60 × 10-3) for P, 1.65 × 10-3 (4.47 × 10-4, 3.24 × 10-3)
for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent
common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the
epidemic.
Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV
are involved in this outbreak that might occur a few months earlier before it was
officially reported.

Background
Coronaviruses (CoV) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae) are enveloped, positive
stranded RNA viruses, which includes 4 genera Alphacoronavirus (α-CoV),
Betacoronavirus (β-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (γ-CoV), and Deltacoronavirus (δ-CoV)
[1,2]. Since 1960, six different CoVs have been identified and two epidemic CoVs have
emerged in human during the last 2 decades [3]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-CoV in 2002-2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in
2012-2015 both belong to the genus Betacoronavirus [4,5].
On 31 December 2019, Wuhan City of Hubei Province reported a number of cases
of pneumonia related to a local seafood market. The main clinical manifestation of these
cases was fever, a few patients had dyspnea, and the chest films showed double-lung
infiltrative lesions [6]. The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus
(novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV), which was isolated on 7 January 2020, and on 11 and
12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) received further detailed information
from the National Health Commission about the outbreak. As of 28 January 2020, there
were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and had affected 11 countries or regions
[7,8].
All human CoVs may be of zoonotic origin, and may indeed originate from bats [9].
To discover the evolutionary history of the viruses, we analyzed the genomes of
2019-nCoVs, compared their variations in both nucleotide and amino acid sequence
levels, and determined their molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide
substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor. We tried to explore the origin and
evolution mechanism of the viruses causing the epidemic, and to provide theoretical basis
for early warning of similar events caused by β-CoVs in the future.

Methods
Genomes collection
Complete Genomes of 2019-nCoVs were downloaded from the Global Initiative on
Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID, http://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/frontend) on

January 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV in 2002-2003 (GenBank accession: NC_004718) and
two Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolates bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession:
MG772933) and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank accession: MG772934) were also
downloaded for serving as the reference sequences. The former is a reference sequence
(RefSeq) of pathogens that have caused major epidemics [10], while the latter two are the
wild strains with the highest identity with 2019-nCoVs [11]. Moreover, unlike GISAID,
the three sequences downloaded from GenBank have detailed comments, which can be
used to investigate the coding sequences (CDS) of different proteins.

Phylogenetic tree construction and amino acid residues alignment
The CLUSTAL W profile alignment option was used to align the whole genomes. On this
basis, the coding sequence (CDS) of ployprotein (P, ORF1ab), spike protein (S),
nucleoprotein (N), matrix protein (M) and small envelope protein (E) in the genomes are
trimmed out from each reference sequence, since they are very important enzymatic or
structural proteins in coronavirus [10,12]. Pairwise distances were calculated by using the
DNADIST program of the PHYLIP package and by using the Kimura two-parameter
model of nucleotide substitution. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using
neighbour-joining (NJ) methods. All phylogenetic trees were inferred by using MEGA6
software [13]. The deduced amino acid residues of these 5 proteins were compared by
Lasergene 7 program again [14].

Computation of mean evolutionary rate and the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA)
Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST v1.6.1
(http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) software package, was used to determine the molecular
evolutionary rate [15]. Because the viral genomes sequenced in this outbreak are
relatively concentrated in time, no reference sequence other than the outbreak has
been included.
GTR+G+I multiple models were chosen as the nucleotide substitution and site
heterogeneity models. Each analyses consisting of 10,000,000 generations under the

strict clock model because the sequence identity in each nexus matrix is very high.
Bayesian skyline population size was set as demographic models for each
species-specific data set. Model selection was based on an analysis of marginal
likelihoods, calculated in Tracer version 1.5. Effective sample sizes (ESSs) of at least
200 were considered appropriate and the results were considered valid. For tMRCA
analysis, the collection dates of 2019-nCoVs were calculated by using the following
formula, and the values of date were accepted by Tipdate time collector:
[(month-1)×30＋date]/360＋Year (i.e., 2019 or 2020)

Results
Phylogenetic trees and genetic distances
As of January 24, 2020, there were 26 viral genomes of 2019-nCoVs. After excluding
one with incomplete information (EPI_ISL_402125) and another excessively short
one (EPI_ISL_402126), a total of 24 viral genomes were included in the follow-up
study.
The phylogenetic trees showed that all isolates of 2019-nCoVs automatically
clustered on whole genome and CDS of five proteins, indicating their close relationship.
However, in the whole genome and the CDS of P, S and N, an isolate (EPI_ISL_403928)
is different from other 23 (Fig 1). This isolate was derived from a 61-year-old male
patient in Wuhan. The sample was collected on 1 January, 2020, and the possibility of
false sequencing was ruled out. The genetic distances of genomes show results consistent
to the phylogenetic trees. The mean genetic distance is 0.00021±0.00002 for all the
isolates but only 0.00010±0.00001 after an exclusion of EPI_ISL_403928. The mean
genetic distance between EPI_ISL_403928 and the other 23 is 0.00146±0.00018. The
CDS of P, S and N show a similar difference between EPI_403928 and the group of 23
(Tab 1). All isolates of 2019-nCoV however, have the same CDS of M and E.

Amino acid residues alignment
CDS of polyprotein encodes many proteins, mainly soluble enzymes, which play an

important role in the infection cycle of a virus. Its precursor contained the most amino
acid residues, up to 7096. There are 22 variations between EPI_ISL_403928 and the other
2019-nCoVs (Fig 2).
Two important structural proteins, S and N, are composed of 1273 and 419 amino

residues,

respectively.

2019-nCoVs,

EPI_ISL_403928 has four variations in S protein (T572I, G799V, F800C and N801K)
and two variations in N protein (A414C and D415I). M and E proteins show no variation
so far.

Evolutionary rate and tMRCA
Nucleotide substitution rates of the whole genome and CDS for different proteins differed
from each other (Tab 2). The substitution rate from high to low was 1·05 × 10-2
(nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 × 10-4 to 2.72 ×
10-2, similarly hereinafter) for N, 5.34 × 10-3 (5.10 × 10-4, 1.28 × 10-2) for S, 1.69 × 10-3
(3.94 × 10-4, 3.60 × 10-3) for P, and 1.65 × 10-3 (4.47 × 10-4, 3.24 × 10-3) for whole
genome. It is estimated that the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs
existed about 0.253-0.594 year (somewhat, 91-214 days) ago, or their evolutionary
divergence appeared 91-214 days ago. However, M and E demonstrated no divergences
up to this point.

Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the whole genome and the CDS of several key proteins of
2019-nCoVs. 2019-nCoVs are the pathogens that cause severe pneumonia in human in
Wuhan recently. It is found one of the isolates (EPI_ISL_403928) has obvious variations
in whole genome and CDS of P, S and N proteins, which result in the substitution of
several amino acids.
We also analyzed the nucleotide substitution rate in the whole genome level and the
CDS of some proteins during their evolution process. There is no variation in CDS of M
and E proteins. CDS of N protein has the highest rate of base substitution (1·05 × 10-2

substitutions/site/year). The divergence time of the viruses deduced is about 91-214 days
before the submission of the first isolate. Their earliest sampling time was 8 December,
2019, and 91-214 days before that day, the viruses infected human or host animals and
began to diverge in the evolution process. It is not clear if the viruses began to mutate
before or after infecting human beings. There is also a possibility there were two strains
evolved coincidentally, one for human and one for host animals that evolved more
adaptive to human and then infected human. Our analysis indicates that the outbreak
occurred a few months earlier than it was officially reported, and there might be recessive
infection and underdetection in the population. Therefore, the seafood market in Wuhan,
which is believed to be the first spot of the outbreak, may or may not be the case.
Human recessive infection of Betacoronavirus does exist. For example, it occurs
in the population for HKU1, another member of β-CoVs. HKU1 is related to a variety
of children's and adult diseases and distributed globally [16]. In the United States, 0.5%
HKU1 positive rate was detected in 15 287 respiratory samples during 2009-2013
[17]; in Kenya, Africa, 2.1% of the 417 respiratory samples collected in 2009-2012
were infected by HKU1 [18]; in Southeast Asia, the positive rate of HKU1 was 1.1%
in 2060 adult acute respiratory samples from Malaysia in 2012-2013 [19]. The
positive detection rate was 1.9% in Japan and 4342 from 2010 to 2013, and 2.5% in
Korea [20,21]. Recessive HKU1 infection was common and many patients with
HKU1 infection were found in routine examinations [24-25]. Cases of recessive
2019-nCoV infection have also been reported in succession. Recessive infection is
one of the reasons for underdetection.
All human CoVs (HCoVs) is mainly of zoonotic origin, and most likely originate
from bats [9]. The common scenario of CoV evolution then involves past transitions
into intermediate hosts such as livestock, which have closer interaction with human
and may carry a diversity of viruses including variants directly related to ancestral
strains [26,27]. For this outbreak, there is evidence for specific wild animals being
intermediate hosts in the seafood market in Wuhan, similar to the outbreak of
SARS-CoV in Guangdong Province of China in 2002-2003 [28]. People engaged in

hunting and management of such wild animals are at high risk of infection, likely live
in mountain or rural areas and are more likely to be undetected when having such an
infection for various reasons.

Conclusions
Our study suggests that there are at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV
infecting human and human infection occurred a few months earlier than the outbreak
being officially announced. Recessive infection and underdetection can cause a delay in
response. The seafood market in Wuhan may or may not be the first spot of this outbreak.
A large number of viruses carried by wild animals bring many uncertainties to the
emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). In order to effectively control these EIDs, it is
necessary to strengthen interdisciplinary cooperation and communication among human,
animal and environmental health investigators based on the One Health concept, so as to
detect and identify pathogens as early as possible, find patients and report epidemics, and
effectively control the spread of EIDs through timely isolation and prevention measures
and observation of close contacts.

Figure Captions and Legends
Fig 1. Phylogenetic trees of 24 isolates of 2019-nCoV
a- d correspond to the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of polyprotein
(P), the spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N).
EPI_ISL_403928 is labelled by red dot and line.

Fig 2. Alignment for amino acid residues of polyprotein of 2019-nCoV
Due to the limited space, only 18 isolates of 2019-nCoV were displayed. Four lines at the
bottom were used as references, especially the SARS-CoV (accession NC_004718), to
show the correspondence sites of amino acid residues between 2019-nCoV and the
known Betacoronavirus. Also because of the limited space, the same sites of amino acid
residues as EPI_ISL_403928 were omitted.
