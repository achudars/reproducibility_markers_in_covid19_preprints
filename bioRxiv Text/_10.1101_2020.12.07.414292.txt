Abstract

12

Viral zoonoses are a serious threat to public health and global security, as reflected by the current

13

scenario of the growing number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

14

cases. However, as pathogenic viruses are highly diverse, identification of their host ranges remains

15

a major challenge. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental framework, called

16

REceptor ortholog-based POtential virus hoST prediction (REPOST), for the prediction of potential

17

virus hosts. REPOST first selects orthologs from a diverse species by identity and phylogenetic

18

analyses. Secondly, these orthologs is classified preliminarily as permissive or non-permissive type

19

by infection experiments. Then, key residues are identified by comparing permissive and non-

20

permissive orthologs. Finally, potential virus hosts are predicted by a key residue–specific weighted

21

module. We performed REPOST on SARS-CoV-2 by studying angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

22

orthologs from 287 vertebrate animals. REPOST efficiently narrowed the range of potential virus

23

host species (with 95.74% accuracy).

Introduction

Viral zoonoses pose serious threats to public health and global security, and have caused the

27

majority of recent human pandemics [e.g., those of HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome

28

(SARS), and avian influenza] (Kreuder Johnson et al., 2015; Olival et al., 2017; Stephen S et al.,

29

2012). An understanding of the species tropism of viral transmission is thus key for the development

30

of pandemic control programs. The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused

31

by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also, 2019-nCoV and COVID-

32

19 virus) has caused an unprecedented public health and economic crisis (Zhou et al., 2020).

33

Comparison with related coronavirus sequences has shown that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in

34

bats, followed by transmission to an intermediate host (Dos Santos Bezerra et al., 2020; Lam et al.,

35

2020; Lopes, de Mattos Cardillo, & Paiva, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Numerous studies suggest that

36

a diversified host range is involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak (Abdel-Moneim &

37

Abdelwhab, 2020; Hossain, Javed, Akter, & Saha, 2020). In vivo studies have demonstrated that

38

mink, ferrets, cats, dogs, and some non-human primates are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, whereas

39

mice, white-tufted-ear marmosets, chickens, ducks, and tree shrews are not (Abdel-Moneim &

40

Abdelwhab, 2020; Hossain et al., 2020; S. Lu et al., 2020; Oreshkova et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020;

41

X. Zhao et al., 2020; Y. Zhao et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is another critical example

42

proving the existence of close, straightforward interaction among humans, animals, and

43

environmental health that can result in the emergence of a deadly pandemic.

44

A large number of viruses, including coronavirus and influenza virus, has existed in nature for a

45

long time (Cui, Li, & Shi, 2019; D. Liu, Ma, Jiang, & He, 2019; Olival et al., 2017; Tiwari et al.,

46

2020; Xiaoman, Xiang, & Jie, 2020). These viruses live in and coexist with animals. They are also

47

constantly mutating and awaiting opportunities to invade human beings. Animal surveys resulted in

48

the discovery of many thousands of new viruses. Such research would benefit studies of viral

49

diversity and evolution, and could determine whether and why some pathogens cross species

50

boundaries more frequently than others (Bae & Son, 2011; Edward C, Andrew, & Kristian G, 2018;

51

Lasso et al., 2019; Olival et al., 2017; Stephen S et al., 2012). Given the rarity of outbreaks, however,

52

it is arrogant to imagine that we could use such surveys to predict and mitigate the emergence of

53

disease. In addition, due to adaptive genetic recombination, the possibility that a new coronavirus

54

or influenza virus will evolve cannot be excluded, as reflected by the current scenario of the growing

55

number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. There is a small, but real, possibility that SARS-CoV-2 will take

56

refuge in a new animal host and be reintroduced to humans in the future. Thus, the possibility of

57

interspecies transmission of viral infections in hot spots is of concern to human beings. As these

58

viruses are very diverse, evaluation of the threat that they pose remains a major challenge, and

59

efficient approaches to the rapid prediction of potential animal reservoirs are needed.

60

One way in which virologists can attempt to predict potential host species is via the cellular

61

receptors of viruses. The recognition of and interaction with cellular receptors are critical initial

62

steps in the infectious viral life cycle and play key regulatory roles in host range, tissue tropism, and

63

viral pathogenesis (Maginnis, 2018). In addition, the gain of function of a virus to bind to receptor

64

counterparts in other species is prerequisite for interspecies transmission (G. Lu, Wang, & Gao,

65

2015). Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the cellular receptor

66

for SARS-CoV-2(Hamming et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2020). SARS-CoV (Wenhui Li et al., 2003)

67

and human coronavirus NL63 (Hofmann et al., 2005; Kailang Wua, Weikai Lib, Guiqing Penga, &

68

Lia, 2009) have caused human disease previously and interact with ACE2 to gain entry into cells.

69

ACE2 is expressed in a diverse range of species throughout the subphylum Vertebrata. The host

70

range of SARS-CoV-2 may be extremely broad due to the conservation of ACE2 in mammals (G.

71

Lu et al., 2015). Using in vitro functional assays, Liu et al. (Y. Liu et al., 2020) showed that 44

72

mammalian ACE2 orthologs, including those of domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals

73

commonly found in zoos and aquaria – but not orthologs in New World monkeys – could bind the

74

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In addition to performing receptor sequence

75

analysis, Kerr et al. (Kerr et al., 2015) developed a combined computational and experimental

76

approach to assess the compatibility of New World arenaviruses with potential new host species,

77

although this method is suitable only for the rodent host range. Using the random forest machine-

78

learning algorithm, Eng et al. (Eng, Tong, & Tan, 2014) constructed computational models for

79

prediction of the host tropism of influenza A virus, but this method is suitable only for the avian and

80

human host ranges. Many other computational approaches have been developed to predict

81

bacteriophage–host relationships, but whether these methods can be applied to animal viruses is

82

unknown (Ahlgren, Ren, Lu, Fuhrman, & Sun, 2017; Edwards, McNair, Faust, Raes, & Dutilh, 2016;

83

Roux, Hallam, Woyke, & Sullivan, 2015).

84

With the advancement of high-throughput next-generation sequencing, the virus isolation

85

technology that enables identification of the pathogen causing an outbreak is no longer the

86

bottleneck it once was (Jonsdottir & Dijkman, 2016; Ko, Salem, Chang, & Chao, 2020; Zhu et al.,

87

2020). Novel and traditional techniques have proven to be extremely useful for the discovery of

88

viral receptors; in particular, biochemical and structural analyses have provided a great deal of

89

insight into the molecular interactions between viruses and receptors (Maginnis, 2018). In addition,

90

the continuous enrichment of protein sequence databases has increased the number of species for

91

which receptor protein sequences are available. These excellent conditions enable the development

92

of approaches for the prediction of potential hosts of pathogenic viruses. In this report, we describe

93

a combined computational and experimental approach called REceptor ortholog-based POtential

94

virus hoST prediction (REPOST), which provides a flexible framework for the identification of

95

potential virus hosts based on virus receptor ortholog analysis. REPOST takes virus cellular receptor

96

orthologs from multiple species as input and predicts the possibility of undetermined species’ roles

97

as potential hosts. Using this framework, we first systematically analyzed ACE2 orthologs from 287

98

vertebrates, primarily mammals. Then, we analyzed the binding ability of ACE2 to viruses from 16

99

representative species in a pseudovirus infection experiment. Thereafter, we identified 95 key ACE2

100

residues that may destroy ACE2–SARS-CoV-2 interaction. Finally, we used a residue-weighted

101

calculation method to predict the possibility of ACE2 as a receptor in unknown species. The

102

accuracy of the framework is very high, as proven by the second functional experiment.

105

Design and comprehensive features of the REPOST workflow

106

REPOST application requires the following dependences: (1) known cellular receptor of the virus,

107

(2) the availability of receptor orthologs from most species [we recommend downloading receptor

108

protein sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database], and

109

(3) ability to perform an in vitro virus or pseudovirus infection experiment (See Methods). The

110

REPOST workflow is as follows (Fig. 1). (1) Receptor orthologs are selected for the following

111

infection experiment based on identity and phylogenetic analyses among various species. The

112

species of the selected orthologs should be representative of taxonomic groups (e.g., primates,

113

rodents, carnivores, bats, marsupials, birds) and should better to be frequently in close contact with

114

humans. And the orthologs should have high degrees of relative identity with those from known

115

virus hosts. (2) Each selected ortholog is preliminarily classified as permissive or non-permissive

116

(meaning that cells with the ortholog overexpression is or is not permissive of virus entry) by

117

performing virus or pseudovirus infection experiment. In addition, published experimental evidence

118

can also be used to supplement our classification. At least three orthologs of each type are needed.

119

(3) Key residues are identified by comparing permissive and non-permissive orthologs (for details,

120

see the SARS-CoV-2 example). (4) Potential virus hosts are predicted by a key residue–specific

121

weighted module.

122

Taken together, based on a combination of virus infection experiments and computational analysis,

123

REPOST can be used to extrapolate, on a large scale, the possibility of undetected species being

124

virus hosts.

Application of REPOST to predicting potential host range of SARS-Cov-2

129

Selection of ACE2 orthologs from various species by identity and phylogenetic analysis

130

We collected the DNA, mRNA, and protein sequences of ACE2 orthologs from 287 vertebrate

131

animals from the NCBI database. These species were mammals (n = 126), birds (n = 73), amphibians

132

(n = 4), bony fishes (n = 66), lizards (n = 9), and other chordates (n = 10). The mammals were

133

primates (n = 26), rodents (n = 23), carnivores (n = 23), whales and dolphins (n = 10), bats (n = 13),

134

even-toed ungulates (n = 14), marsupials (n = 4), and other placental species (n = 13) (Fig. 2A). The

135

length ranged from 6694 to 107639 bp for DNA sequences, and 1035 to 7004 bp for mRNA

136

sequences (Fig. S1A, B). Protein sequences contained 344 to 862 amino-acid residues, and the

137

length in 25% of species was the same as that of human (805 amino-acid residues) (Fig. S1C).

138

We first performed the phylogenetic analysis, and found that ACE2 orthologs from the same taxon

139

were usually clustered into the same branch. (Fig. S2). Also, we analyzed the identities of all

140

sequences pairwisely, the result indicate that the ACE2 protein sequences were highly conserved

141

across each taxon examined, as well as each subclass of mammals (Fig. 2B), suggesting that we can

142

start classification with a few representatives from each taxon. Then, we ranked the identity of ACE2

143

among all species taxon to humans, and the result yielded the following order from high to low was

144

as below: primates, rodents, carnivores, other placental species, even-toed ungulates, whales and

145

dolphins, bats, marsupials, birds, other chordates, amphibians, lizards, and bony fishes (Fig. 2C).

146

Based on the ranking result, we found that ACE2 in other vertebrate species except mammals had

147

low consistency with that of human, suggesting they were not likely to be potential hosts or

148

reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2. Previous study has supported our observation that poultry (belong to

149

birds) is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2(Shi et al., 2020). We finally chose 16 representative ACE2

150

orthologs (very similar to that of humans) from mammals (include primates, rodents, carnivores,

151

bats, and even-toed ungulates) for following analysis. (Fig. 3). Among these species are wild

152

animals, zoo animals, pets, and livestock that are frequently in close contact with humans, and model

153

animals used in biomedical research.

Classification of permissive and non-permissive ACE2 orthologs by infection experiment in vitro
We infected BHK-21 cells ectopically expressing individual selected ACE2 orthologs with

164

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles. As expected, BHK-21 cells lacking endogenous ACE2

165

expression were not permissive of SARS2pp infection. BHK-21 cells expressing ACE2s from Homo

166

sapiens, Felis catus, Manis javanica, Canis lupus familiaris, Equus caballus, Capra hircus, Sus

167

scrofa, Ursus arctos horribilis, Camelus ferus, Bos taurus, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Paguma larvata

168

and Macaca mulatta were permissive of SARS2pp entry. ACE2s from Eptesicus fuscus and Mus

169

musculus were not permissive of SARS2pp entry cells (Fig. 3A). The luciferase activity of different

170

ACE2 orthologs of vector-transfected cells was consistent with the eGFP signals (Fig. 3B). Besides,

171

we regarded ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus, Chlorocebus sabaeus, and Macaca fascicularis as

172

permissive, and regarded Callithrix jacchus as non-permissive orthologs respectively, as published

173

experimental evidence proved that ACE2 of R. sinicus could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into HeLa

174

cells(Zhou et al., 2020), Chlorocebus sabaeus(Cross et al., 2020), and Macaca fascicularis(S. Lu et

175

al., 2020) were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and yet C. jacchus was not susceptible to

176

SARS-CoV-2 infection(S. Lu et al., 2020).

177

Taken together, we eventually get 17 permissive and 3 non-permissive ACE2 orthologs. These

178

orthologs would be used for the identification of key residues which changes of them may damage

179

the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 interaction.

Identification of key residues by comparing permissive and non-permissive ACE2 orthologs

After sequence comparison, we found 33 ACE2 protein residues of M. musculus, 20 residues of

189

C. jacchus, and 50 residues of E. fuscus that differed from those of all SARS-CoV-2–permissive

190

species (Fig. 4A, Table S1). Take the residues at the ACE2–SARS-CoV-2 interaction interface as an

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.414292; this version posted December 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this

191

example, we found that substitutions in residues Q24, D30, K31, E42, M82, Y83, K353, and G354

192

that distinguished ACE2s of C. jacchus, M. musculus, and E. fuscus from those of all permissive

193

species (Fig. 4B). These residues may be the key sites affecting the ACE2–SARS-CoV-2 binding.

194

The ACE2 orthologs were characterized by a peptidase M2 domain (PD) which located outside

195

the cell membrane and mediates virus binding, and a collectrin domain. In PD, there are 20 amino-

196

acid residues located in the ACE2–SARS-CoV-2 contact interface (Lan et al., 2020; Renhong Yan

197

et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wrapp. et al., 2020), and these residues are critical for virus

198

recognition (Lan et al., 2020). The 75 of identified residues were located in the PD and 8 were

199

located at the ACE2–SARS-CoV-2 interface (Fig. 4 B, C). We believed that the changes in amino

200

acids at these sites might have a greater influence on the destruction of ACE2–SARS-CoV-2 binding

201

than do changes at other sites.

Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 potential hosts by key residue–specific weighted module

215

Based on the above work, we developed a residue-specific weighted module for the prediction of

216

susceptibility of untested mammal species (Figure 5A). The module takes as input multiple receptor

217

orthologs, which including permissive, non-permissive orthologs from tested species and orthologs

218

from other species to predict. It will first calculate a residue-weighted distance matrix for all

219

orthologs taking into account three priors of the PD domain, the 95 key residues and the contact

220

surface with SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 4C). We then used this distance matrix to select as

221

potentially permissive (or non-permissive) candidates orthologs that were much closer to known

222

permissive (or non-permissive) orthologs than to known non-permissive (or permissive) orthologs

223

(Methods).

224

The optimized distance matrix clearly separated known permissive and non-permissive orthologs,

225

with no discernible mixing (Fig. 5B), as supported by independent experimental evidence (Y. Liu et

226

al., 2020) (Fig. 5B; see also Table S2 for a full list of predictions for all 56 or 20 orthologs close to

227

known permissive or non-permissive orthologs). Also, it displayed excellent performance in the

228

extrapolation of non-permissive orthologs (which are currently scarce and potentially critical to the

229

mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 tropism), with 9 of 11 identifications validated by

230

subsequent assay of pseudovirus entry into BHK-21 cells (Fig. 5C). The other two orthologs showed

231

only weak infection positivity (infection rates < 35%).

232

Taken together, REPOST, combined of phylogenetic analysis, experimental functional

233

assessment, and residues-specific weighted module, provide an efficient framework for screening

234

key residues of virus receptor that determine virus–receptor interaction and assessing the potential

235

host ranges of pathogenic viruses. Compared with other methods based on molecular docking or

236

simple molecular consistency analysis (Kerr et al., 2015; Y. Liu et al., 2020), REPOST has higher

237

accuracy and a wider range of applications. In SARS-CoV-2 case, we found that ACE2 orthologs

238

from a wide range of mammals, including pets, livestock, and animals commonly kept in zoos or

239

aquaria, could act as functional receptors to mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many of these species

240

have been proved in previous experimental evidence (Abdel-Moneim & Abdelwhab, 2020; Hossain

241

et al., 2020).This suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might have a broad host tropism and underscore the

242

necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future outbreaks. In addition, we identified 10

243

245

of SARS-CoV-2, as all non-mammalian ACE2 orthologs were too dissimilar from known

permissive orthologs (Fig. S3A).

Discussion

259

This study introduces and demonstrates the use of REPOST for the identification of potential

260

virus hosts, using ACE2 receptor orthologs of SARS-CoV-2 as an example. This method showed a

261

high host prediction accuracy. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor ACE2

262

orthologs are strongly conserved across mammalian species, indicating the importance of the

263

physiological function of ACE2. Furthermore, the protein sequence diversity of ACE2 was greater

264

among bats than among other tested mammals, and ACE2 orthologs of bats were located on two

265

distant branches of the evolutionary tree, highlighting the possibility that bat species act as reservoirs

266

of SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor viruses. Notably, we also found that ACE2 orthologs from a wide

267

range of mammals, including pets (e.g., cats and dogs), livestock (e.g., pigs, cattle, rabbits, sheep,

268

horses, and goats), and animals commonly kept in zoos or aquaria, could act as functional receptors

269

to mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection when ectopically expressed in BHK-21 cells, suggesting that

270

SARS-CoV-2 has a diverse range of hosts and intermediate hosts. These findings highlight the

271

importance of the surveillance of animals in close contact with humans as potential zoonotic

272

reservoirs. These results suggest that the potential host of the virus is related to the phylogeny of the

273

species to a certain extent, but it is not accurate to predict based on this solely. Based on our

274

experimental results, we identified 95 differences in amino-acid residues between SARS-CoV-2–

275

permissive and –non-permissive ACE2 orthologs, eight of which are located at the ACE2–S protein

276

interface. Some of these residues have been confirmed in other studies (F. Li, 2013; W. Li et al.,

277

2005; Procko, 2020). The final prediction results were satisfactory and consistent with independent

278

experimental evidence28, and the module showed excellent performance in the extrapolation of non-

279

permissive orthologs. It is worth mentioning that the analysis identified 10 previously unrecognized

280

non-permissive ortholog sequences from primate, rodent, bat, and marsupial species. These findings

281

will enrich negative datasets, increasing the accuracy of the screening of key residues that affect

282

virus–receptor interaction, and will aid the establishment and training of optimized predictive

283

models.

284

We propose that REPOST will strengthen the ability to rapidly identify potential hosts of new

285

pathogenic viruses affecting not only humans, but also animals. Another advantage of REPOST is

286

the ease of key residue screening, which may lead to the identification of promising targets for the

287

development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. REPOST can also be applied in other cases; for

288

viruses with more than one cellular receptor, for example, all receptor orthologs can be used as input

289

for systematic analysis. When the viral receptor cannot be identified, sequence information for all

290

cellular membrane proteins can be integrated as input for prediction. REPOST, however, can be

291

further improved. Other factors, such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the host

292

immune response, can affect the susceptibility of animals (Bourgonje et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al.,

293

2020). In some cases, viruses must open numerous “locks,” which can be conceptualized as a

294

doorknob plus a deadbolt, to invade cells. In future research, we will explore the use of different

295

sources of virus and host information to analyze the impacts of different characteristics on prediction

296

results. In summary, the establishment of the REPOST predictive framework may be of great

297

significance for the prevention and control of future outbreaks.

Materials and methods

299

Protein sequence identity and phylogenetic analyses

300

The amino-acid sequences of ACE2 orthologs from 287 vertebrates were downloaded from the

301

National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

302

Numbers in each sequence correspond to GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)

303

accession numbers. ACE2 protein sequence identity, defined as the percentage of identical residues

304

between two sequences, was analyzed using MEGA-X software (version 10.05) (Kumar, Stecher,

305

Li, Knyaz, & Tamura, 2018) and the MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation

306

(MUSCLE) algorithm (Edgar, 2004). Then, a phylogenetic tree was built using the minimum-

307

evolution method with MEGA-X.

308

Expression vector and cell lines

309

The cDNAs encoding ACE2 orthologs tagged with hexa-histidine were synthesized and cloned

310

into a pCAG vector derived from pcDNA3 by replacement of the CMV promoter with the CAG

311

promoter. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. BHK-21 cells were maintained in

312

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine

serum (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1× non-essential amino acids (Gibco), and 50 IU/ml

314

penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) in a humidified 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator at 37°C.

315

Pseudovirus infection of BHK21 cells expressing ACE2 orthologs

316

BHK-21 cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells per well in 96-well plates 12–18 h before transfection.

317

The cells were then transfected with 100 ng control or ACE2 orthologs expressing plasmids with

318

GenJet™ reagent (ver. II; SignaGen). The culture medium was refreshed 6–8 h after transfection.

319

Another 6–16 h later, cells in each well were infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus bearing dual-

320

reported genes (eGFP and luciferase) at an MOI of 3 or 10. The culture medium was changed 12 h

321

after infection. At 60–72 h post-infection, images of eGFP expression were captured under a

322

fluorescent microscope (IX73; Olympus) and luciferase activity was detected with the Steady-

323

Lumi™ II Firefly luciferase assay kit (Beyotime).

Details of the prioritization module

325

The weighted (Manhattan) distance for each pair of ortholog sequences 𝑆 𝑖 , 𝑆𝑗 was defined as
𝑑(𝑆 𝑖 , 𝑆𝑗 |𝑤𝑡 ≔ {𝑤𝑡,1 , 𝑤𝑡,2 , 𝑤𝑡,3 }) ≔ ∑𝑡 (𝟏𝑠𝑖 ≠𝑠𝑗 × 𝑤𝑡,1 × 𝑤𝑡,2 × 𝑤𝑡,3 ) ,

326

𝑡

𝑡

327

where 𝟏𝑠𝑖 ≠𝑠𝑗 is the indicator function that takes 1 when the residues of 𝑆 𝑖 and 𝑆𝑗 at the 𝑡 th

328

position of the alignment differ (i.e., 𝑠𝑡𝑖 ≠ 𝑠𝑡 ) and 0 otherwise, and 𝑤𝑡 ≔ {𝑤𝑡,1 , 𝑤𝑡,2 , 𝑤𝑡,3 } are

329

weights for the following three priors: (1) whether the residue at this position in the human ortholog

330

is in the PD (𝑤𝑡,1 )(Wang et al., 2020), (2) how much residue composition at this position differs

331

between all permissive and non-permissive species from the experiment (𝑤𝑡,2 ), and (3) whether the

332

residue at this position in the human ortholog is on the contact surface (𝑤𝑡,3 )(Lan et al., 2020). For

333

MUSCLE alignment, we used default parameters and removed all positions at which the human

334

ortholog was gapped.

where 𝑷 and 𝑵 are the sets of sequences of known permissive and non-permissive orthologs,

respectively, and 𝑼(𝑆 𝑖 |𝑤𝑡 ) are the three orthologs closest to 𝑆 𝑖 in the distance matrix weighted

341

by 𝑤𝑡 . Ideally, this score should be high when the distance matrix separates the pair of

342

neighborhoods of most pairs of known permissive and non-permissive orthologs. The optimized

343

weights are {𝑤𝑡,1 = 10, 𝑤𝑡,2 = 10, 𝑤𝑡,3 = 10} . Finally, we prioritized the orthologs using the

344

following receptor score 𝑅(𝑆 𝑖 ):

346

All orthologs with 𝑅(𝑆 𝑖 ) ≥ 0.5 (candidate permissives) and 𝑅(𝑆 𝑖 ) ≤ 0 (candidate non-

347

permissives) were then prioritized (Table S2). All 11 candidates non-permissives except

348

Ornithorhynchus anatinus and Myotis davidii (whose residue conformations at the S protein contact

349

surfaces were extremely similar to that of human ACE2) were tested experimentally.
