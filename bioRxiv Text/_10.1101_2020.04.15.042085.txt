Abstract (295)

30

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 first reported in Wuhan, China,

31

emerged and rapidly spread to numerous other countries globally, causing the current

32

pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can

33

result in severe disease and lethality. Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug for

34

treating COVID-19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific antiviral therapies and

35

vaccines.

36

In order for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at

37

two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In

38

the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the SARS-CoV-2 S

39

protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the

40

proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2

41

(TMPRSS2) at the S2’ site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of

42

SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2

43

expression. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two

44

synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor

45

aprotinin. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic

46

furin inhibitor MI-1851. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with MI-1851 produced more

47

potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine

48

protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus

49

replication.

50

Our data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and furin are essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation

51

in human airway cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 either by

52

targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors.

53

Therefore, this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction

56

In December 2019, a new coronavirus (CoV) emerged which rapidly spreads around the

57

world causing a pandemic never observed before with these viruses. The virus was identified

58

as a new member of the lineage b of the genus Betacoronavirus that also contains the 2002

59

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the WHO.

60

The respiratory disease caused by the virus was designated as coronavirus disease 2019

61

(COVID-19).

62

CoVs are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses belonging

63

to the order Nidovirales and infect a broad range of mammalian and avian species, causing

64

respiratory or enteric diseases. CoVs have a major surface protein, the spike (S)

65

protein, which initiates infection by receptor binding and fusion of the viral lipid envelope with

66

cellular membranes. Like fusion proteins of many other viruses, the S protein is activated by

67

cellular proteases. Activation of CoV S is a complex process that requires proteolytic

68

cleavage of S at two distinct sites, S1/S2 and S2’ (Fig. 1), generating the subunits S1 and S2

69

that remain non-covalently linked (Belouzard et al. 2009; Follis et al. 2006; Bosch et al.,

70

2008). The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain, while the S2 subunit is

71

membrane-anchored and harbours the fusion machinery. Cleavage at the S2′ site, located

72

immediately upstream of the hydrophobic fusion peptide, has been proposed to trigger the

73

membrane fusion activity of S (Madu et al., 2009; Walls et al., 2016). In contrast, the

74

relevance of S cleavage at the S1/S2 site is yet not fully understood. Processing of CoV S is

75

believed to occur sequentially, with cleavage at the S1/S2 site occurring first and subsequent

76

cleavage at S2′. Cleavage at the S1/S2 site may be crucial for conformational changes

77

required for receptor binding and/or subsequent exposure of the S2’ site to host proteases at

78

the stage of entry (reviewed in Head-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012; Millet and Whittaker,

79

2015; Hoffmann et al., 2018).

80

Many proteases have been found to activate CoVs in vitro including furin, cathepsin L, and

81

trypsin-like serine proteases such as the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2),

82

TMPRSS11A, and TMPRSS11D (reviewed in Head-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012; Millet and

83

Whittaker, 2015; Hoffmann et al., 2018). Among them, TMPRSS2 and furin play major roles

84

in proteolytic activation of a broad range of viruses (reviewed in Klenk and Garten, 1994;

85

Garten, 2018; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, 2018). TMPRSS2 is a type II transmembrane serine

86

protease (TTSP) that is widely expressed in epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastrointestinal

87

and urogenital tract (reviewed in Bugge et al., 2009; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, 2018). The

88

physiological role of TMPRSS2 is yet unknown, but TMPRSS2-deficient mice lack a

89

discernible phenotype suggesting functional redundancy (Kim et al., 2006). In 2006, we first

90

identified TMPRSS2 as a virus activating protease, by demonstrating that it cleaves the

91

surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) of human influenza A viruses (Böttcher et al., 2006).

92

Subsequently, TMPRSS2 was shown to activate the fusion proteins of a number of other

93

respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza viruses as well

94

as CoVs including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in vitro

95

(reviewed in Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, 2018; Hoffmann et al., 2018). TMPRSS2 cleaves at

96

single arginine or lysine residues (R/K↓), and hence, activates viral fusion proteins at so

97

called monobasic cleavage sites. More recent studies by us and others demonstrated that

98

TMPRSS2-deficient mice do not suffer from pathology when infected with certain influenza A

99

virus strains, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, due to inhibition of proteolytic

100

actviation of progeny virus and consequently inhibition of virus spread along the respiratory

101

tract (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Tarnow et al., 2014; Sakai et al., 2014; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al.,

102

2019). These studies identified TMPRSS2 as an essential host cell factor for these

103

respiratory viruses and further demonstrated that inhibition of virus activating host cell

104

proteases, particularly TMPRSS2, provides a promising approach for the development of

105

therapeutics to treat respiratory virus infections. The proprotein convertase (PC) furin is a

106

type I transmembrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic tissues and cells.

107

Furin cleaves the precursors of a broad range of proteins including hormones, growth

108

factors, cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules during their transport along the

109

secretory pathway at multibasic motifs of the preferred consensus sequence R-X-R/K-R↓

110

(reviewed in Garten, 2018). Moreover, furin has been identified as an activating protease for

111

the fusion proteins of a broad range of viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza A

112

viruses (HPAIV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, Measles virus, and

113

Yellow Fever virus as well as bacterial toxins such as Shiga toxin or anthrax toxin at

114

multibasic motifs (reviewed in Klenk and Garten, 1994; Rockwell et al., 2002; Garten, 2018).

115

Acquisition of a multibasic cleavage site by insertion of basic amino acids has long been

116

known to be a prime determinant of avian influenza A virus pathogenicity in poultry.

117

Activation of the surface glycoprotein HA of HPAIV by furin supports systemic spread of

118

infection with often lethal outcome. In contrast, the HA of low pathogenic avian influenza A

119

viruses (LPAIV) is activated at a monobasic cleavage site by trypsin-like serine proteases.

120

Appropriate proteases are believed to be expressed in the respiratory and intestinal tract of

121

birds, confining spread of infection to these tissues.

122

A recent study by Hoffmann et al. indicates that TMPRSS2 is also involved in SARS-CoV-2 S

123

protein activation (Hoffmann et al., 2020). The authors show that transient expression of

124

TMPRSS2 in Vero cells supports cathepsin-independent entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes.

125

Moreover, pretreatment of human Caco-2 colon and human airway cells with the broad range

126

inhibitor camostat mesylate that also inhibits TMPRSS2 activity, markedly reduced entry of

127

SARS-CoV-2 as well as VSV pseudotypes containing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. This

128

indicates that a trypsin-like serine protease is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 entry into these cells.

129

However, sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein suggests that furin may also be

130

involved in S processing (Fig. 1B; Coutard et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). The S1/S2 site of

131

SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains an insertion of four amino acids providing a minimal furin

132

cleavage site (R-R-A-R685↓) in contrast to the S protein of SARS-CoV. Instead, similar to

133

SARS-CoV the S2’ cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 S possesses a paired dibasic motif with a

134

single KR segment (KR815↓) that is recognized by trypsin-like serine proteases.

135

In the present study we demonstrate that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is activated by

136

TMPRSS2 and furin. We also show that inhibitors against both proteases strongly suppress

137

virus replication in human airway epithelial cells and that the combination of both types of

138

inhibitors has a synergistic effect on virus reduction. Our results show that this approach has

139

a high therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.

144

Cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site FRET-substrates by furin

145

The S1/S2 cleavage site of the novel emerged SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to possess a

146

minimal furin consensus motif of the sequence R-R-A-R↓ with an alanine instead of a basic

147

residue in P2 position (Fig. 1B; Coutard et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). Only few furin

148

substrates possess a nonbasic residue in P2 position, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa

149

exotoxin A or Shiga toxin (Rockwell et al., 2002; Garten, 2018). To test, whether the S1/S2

150

sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is efficiently cleaved by furin, a small series of

151

Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) substrates was synthesized (Fig. 2A). All

152

compounds possess a 3-nitrotyrosine amide as P4ˈ residue and a 2-amino-benzoyl

153

fluorophore in P7 position. The analogous sequences of the S proteins from MERS-CoV,

154

SARS-CoV, and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain Beaudette were prepared as

155

reference substrates. Moreover, two FRET substrates of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage

156

site with P2 AK and AR mutations were synthesized, to evaluate whether they could

157

constitute even more efficient cleavage sites for furin than the wild-type. The FRET

158

substrates were tested in an enzyme kinetic assay with human furin, and their cleavage

159

efficiency is shown in Figure 2B. The FRET substrate of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage

160

site was efficiently cleaved by recombinant furin. In contrast, the monobasic SARS-CoV

161

FRET substrate was not processed by furin. The MERS-CoV S1/S2 FRET substrate

162

possessing a dibasic R-X-X-R motif was cleaved by furin approximately 10-fold less

163

efficiently than the best substrates of this FRET series. The FRET substrate SARS-CoV5

164

2_M1, which contains an optimized furin recognition site by virtue of an AK mutation in P2

165

position, was cleaved with similar efficiency compared to the wild-type sequence. However,

166

substitution of AR in the P2 position strongly enhanced cleavage by furin. As expected, the

167

analogous reference sequence of IBV was also processed by furin very efficiently. The data

168

show that the R-R-A-R motif at the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 S is efficiently

169

cleaved by furin in vitro.

170
171

SARS-Cov-2 spike protein is cleaved by both furin and TMPRSS2

172

We next examined whether the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is cleaved by endogenous furin in

173

HEK293 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with pCAGGS plasmid encoding the SARS-

174

CoV-2 S protein with a C-terminal Myc-6xHis-tag, and incubated in the absence and

175

presence of the potent synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851 (cf. Fig. S1; manuscript in

176

preparation). At 24 h post transfection, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and

177

Western blot analysis using antibodies against the Myc epitope. As shown in Fig. 2C, the

178

uncleaved precursor S and the S2 subunit were detected in the absence of MI-1851,

179

indicating that S is cleaved by endogenous proteases at the S1/S2 site in HEK293 cells. S

180

cleavage was efficiently prevented by MI-1851. In contrast, S cleavage was not prevented by

181

the trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Thus, the data indicate that SARS-CoV-2

182

S protein is cleaved by furin at the S1/S2 site in HEK293 cells.

183

We then investigated SARS-CoV-2 S cleavage by TMPRSS2. Since HEK293 cells do not

184

express endogenous TMPRSS2 (unpublished data; see also www.proteinatlas.org), we co-

185

transfected the cells with pCAGGS-S-Myc-6xHis and pCAGGS-TMPRSS2. Then, the cells

186

were incubated in the absence or presence of MI-1851 to suppress S cleavage by

187

endogenous furin. Interestingly, two S cleavage products of approximately 95 and 80 kDa,

188

respectively, were detected upon co-expression of TMPRSS2 in the absence of MI-1851

189

(Fig. 2C), most likely S2 and S2‘, as they can both be detected by the Myc-specific antibody

190

(cf. Fig. 1A). In the presence of MI-1851, only a minor S2 protein band was detected.

191

However, the amount of S2‘ protein present in transient TMPRSS2 expressing cells was

192

similar in MI-1851 treated and untreated cells, suggesting that S cleavage at the S2‘ site is

193

only caused by TMPRSS2 activity. The small amount of S2 protein detected in TMPRSS2-

194

expressing cells in the presence of MI-1851 was likely due to residual furin activity rather

195

than cleavage of S at the S1/S2 site by TMPRSS2. Together, the data show that SARS-CoV-

196

2 can be cleaved by furin and by TMPRSS2. The data further suggest that the proteases

197

cleave S at different sites with furin processing the S1/S2 site and TMPRSS2 cleaving at the

198

S2‘ site.

Knockdown of TMPRSS2 prevents proteolytic activation and multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 in

201

Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells

202

Next, we wished to investigate whether TMPRSS2 is involved in proteolytic activation and

203

multicycle replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. To specifically

204

knockdown TMPRSS2 activity, we previously developed an antisense peptide-conjugated

205

phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al., 2011).

206

PPMO are single-stranded nucleic acid-like compounds, composed of a morpholino oligomer

207

covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide, and can interfere with gene expression

208

by sterically blocking complementary RNAs. PPMO are water-soluble and achieve entry into

209

cells and tissues without assisted delivery (reviewed in Stein, 2008; Moulton and Moulton,

210

2010). The previously developed PPMO T-ex5 interferes with correct splicing of TMPRSS2

211

pre-mRNA, resulting in the production of mature mRNA lacking exon 5 and consequently

212

expression of a truncated TMPRSS2 form that is enzymatically inactive. Using T-ex5 PPMO-

213

mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 activity, we were able to identify TMPRSS2 as the major

214

influenza A virus activating protease in Calu-3 cells and primary human airway epithelial cells

215

and of influenza B virus in primary human type II pneumocytes (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et

216

al., 2011; Limburg et al., 2019).

217

Here, Calu-3 cells were treated once with T-ex5 PPMO for 24 h prior to infection with SARS-

218

CoV-2 in order to inhibit the production of normal TMPRSS2-mRNA and deplete

219

enzymatically active TMPRSS2 present in the cells. The cells were then inoculated with

220

SARS-CoV-2 at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, further incubated without

221

additional PPMO treatment for 72 h, then fixed and immunostained using an antiserum

222

against the 2002 SARS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 3A, a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) and

223

efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was visible in Calu-3 cells treated with a negative-

224

control PPMO of nonsense sequence designated as “scramble” as well as untreated cells

225

that were used as controls. In contrast, no CPE and only small foci of infection were

226

observed in T-ex5 PPMO treated cells at 72 h p.i. (Fig. 3A). To examine SARS-CoV-2

227

activation and multicycle replication in PPMO treated cells in more detail, Calu-3 cells were

228

treated with PPMO for 24 h prior to infection, then inoculated with virus at a MOI of 0.001 for

229

1.5 h and incubated for 72 h in the absence of further PPMO, as described above. At

230

different time points virus titers in supernatants were determined by tissue culture infection

231

dose 50 % (TCID50) end-point dilution. T-ex5 PPMO treatment dramatically reduced virus

232

titers in Calu-3 cells, by 1,000- and 4,000-fold at 16 and 24 h p.i., respectively, and 180-fold

233

at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 3B).

234

To confirm knockdown of enzymatically active TMPRSS2 expression, Calu-3 cells were

235

treated with PPMO or remained untreated for 24 h, after which TMPRSS2-specific mRNA

236

was isolated and analysed by RT-PCR as described previously (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et

237

al., 2011). Total RNA was analysed with primers designed to amplify nucleotides 108 to 1336

238

of TMPRSS2-mRNA. A full-length PCR product of 1228 bp was amplified from untreated and

239

scramble PPMO treated Calu-3 cells, whereas a shorter PCR fragment of about 1100 bp was

240

amplified from T-ex5 PPMO-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Sequencing revealed that the truncated

241

TMPRSS2-mRNA lacked the entire exon 5 (data not shown). To further confirm that T-ex5

242

PPMO single dose treatment prior to infection still interferes with TMPRSS2-mRNA splicing

243

at 72 h p.i., total RNA was isolated from infected cells at 72 h p.i. and amplified as described

244

above. As shown in Fig. 3C, the majority of TMPRSS2-mRNA amplified from T-ex5 treated

245

cells at 72 h p.i. lacked exon 5. The data demonstrate that T-ex5 was very effective at

246

producing exon skipping in TMPRSS2-pre-mRNA and, thus, at inhibiting expression of

247

enzymatically active protease, during the virus growth period in Calu-3 cells. However, a

248

small band of the full-length PCR product was visible after 72 h p.i., indicating low levels of

249

expression of enzymatically active TMPRSS2 at later time points of the virus growth period,

250

which may explain the increase in virus titers observed at 48 h p.i. (cf. Fig. 3B). Cell viability

251

was not affected by T-ex5 PPMO treatment of Calu-3 cells, as shown in Fig. 3D and

252

described previously (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al., 2011; Limburg et al., 2019).

253

Together, our data identify TMPRSS2 as host cell factor essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation

254

and multiplication in Calu-3 cells and show that downregulation of TMPRSS2 activity

255

dramatically blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication.

256
257

Inhibition of either TMPRSS2 or furin activity suppresses multicycle replication of SARS-

258

CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cells

259

We next investigated the efficacy of different inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases, also

260

inhibiting TMPRSS2, on preventing SARS-CoV-2 activation by TMPRSS2 in Calu-3 cells. We

261

used the natural broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin from bovine lung and two

262

prospective peptide mimetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2, MI-432 (Hammami et al., 2012) und MI-

263

1900 (Fig. S1). Aprotinin has long been known to prevent proteolytic activation and

264

multiplication of influenza A virus in cell cultures and mice. Furthermore, inhalation of

265

aerosolized aprotinin by influenza patients markedly reduced the duration of symptoms

266

without causing side effects (Zhirnov et al., 2011). MI-432 was shown to efficiently inhibit

267

proteolytic activation and multiplication of influenza A virus in Calu-3 cells (Meyer et al.,

inhibitor MI-432.

270

To examine the antiviral efficacy of the protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, Calu-3 cells

271

were infected with the virus at a low MOI of 0.001 for 1.5 h, after which the inoculum was

272

removed and the cells incubated in the presence of the inhibitors at the indicated

273

concentrations for 72 h. The cells were fixed and immunostained using a rabbit antiserum

274

originally produced against SARS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 4, strong CPE and efficient spread

275

of SARS-CoV-2 infection was visible in Calu-3 cells in the absence of protease inhibitors.

276

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus induced CPE was efficiently inhibited by aprotinin

277

treatment in a dose-dependent manner and only a few infected cells were visible in Calu-3

278

cultures treated with 20-50 µM aprotinin. Even at lower concentration of 10 µM the spread of

279

SARS-CoV-2 was greatly reduced and CPE markedly prevented. Treatment with peptide

280

mimetic TMPRSS2 inhibitors MI-432 and MI-1900 also strongly prevented SARS-CoV-2

281

multiplication and CPE in Calu-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, although less potently

282

than aprotinin. At 20-50 µM of MI-432 or MI-1900 only small foci of infection were visible. At a

283

concentration of 10 µM, virus spread and CPE in MI-432 treated cells were still markedly

284

reduced compared to control cells, whereas CPE and spread of infection was observed in

285

the presence of 10 µM MI-1900, although still reduced compared to control cells. The data

286

demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in Calu-3 human airway cells can be strongly

287

suppressed by aprotinin and the synthetic TMPRSS2 inhibitors MI-432 and MI-1900.

288

The observed efficient cleavage of transient expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein by furin in

289

HEK293 cells prompted us to investigate if furin is involved in SARS-CoV-2 activation in

290

Calu-3 cells. Therefore, virus spread in Calu-3 cells was analysed in the presence of the furin

291

inhibitor MI-1851. Interestingly, MI-1851 strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spread at even the

292

lowest concentration of 10 µM, indicating that furin is critical for SARS-CoV-2 activation and

293

multiplication in these cells (Fig. 4). Finally, to examine whether endosomal cathepsins are

294

involved in SARS-CoV-2 activation in Calu-3 cells, multicycle virus replication was

295

determined in the presence of the cathepsin inhibitor E64d. Cathepsin L was shown to

296

cleave the S protein of 2002 SARS-CoV S close to the S1/S2 site (R667) at T678 in vitro

297

(Bosch et al., 2008). Here, strong CPE and foci of infection were observed in E64d-treated

298

cells even at the highest dose of 50 µM, similar to that observed in DMSO-treated as well as

299

untreated control cells, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 activation in Calu-3 cells is independent

300

of endosomal cathepsins.

301

In sum, our data demonstrate that inhibition of either TMPRSS2 or furin strongly inhibits

302

SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 human airway cells, indicating that both proteases are critical for S

303

activation. In contrast, endosomal cathepsins are dispensable or not involved at all in SARS-

304

CoV-2 activation in these cells.

306

Growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in protease inhibitor-treated Calu-3 cells

307

To analyse inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activation and multiplication by the different protease

308

inhibitors in more detail, we performed virus growth kinetics in inhibitor treated cells. Calu-3

309

cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.001 and then incubated in the

310

presence of 10 or 50 µM of the different protease inhibitors. At 16, 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. the

311

viral titer in supernatants was determined by TCID50 titration. Untreated cells and cells

312

treated with DMSO alone were used as controls. SARS-CoV-2 replicated to high titers within

313

24-48 h in untreated and DMSO treated cells Calu-3 cells (Fig. 5A). Aprotinin suppressed

314

virus replication 20- to 35-fold compared to control cells even at a concentration of 10 µM.

315

The TMPRSS2 inhibitor MI-432 reduced virus titers in a dose-dependent manner with 5-fold

316

reduction in virus titers at a concentration of 10 µM and 14-fold at 50 µM. Treatment of cells

317

with TMPRSS2 inhibitor MI-1900 reduced virus titers in a manner similar to that of MI-432 at

318

10 µM. However, treatment with 50 µM MI-1900 caused strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

319

replication with 25- to 70-fold reduced viral titers compared to control cells. The furin inhibitor

320

MI-1851 efficiently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in Calu-3 cells, producing a 30- to

321

75-fold reduction in virus titers at a dose of 10 µM. In contrast, virus multiplication was not

322

affected by treatment with the cathepsin inhibitor E64d, which is in congruence with the data

323

shown in Fig. 4. To provide evidence that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in inhibitor

324

treated cells was not caused by cytotoxic effects, we analysed cell viability in Calu-3 cells

325

treated with 50 µM of the different inhibitors for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 5B, evaluation of cell

326

viability revealed no significant cytotoxicity by any of the inhibitors under conditions used in

327

the virus growth experiments.

328

The data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently reduced by inhibiting

329

either TMPRSS2 or furin activity, demonstrating that both proteases are crucial for SARS-

330

CoV-2 activation.

331
332

Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells with a combination of TMPRSS2 and furin

333

inhibitors

334

Finally, we wished to examine whether the combination of inhibitors against TMPRSS2 and

335

furin shows a synergistic antiviral effect. Therefore, Calu-3 cells were infected with virus as

336

described above and incubated in the presence of aprotinin, MI-432 or MI-1900 in

337

combination with MI-1851 at 10 and 50 µM each, respectively, for 72 h. Virus titers in

338

supernatants were determined at indicated time points. Single dose treatment of each

339

inhibitor and untreated cells were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 5C, the combination of

340

10 µM of MI-1851 with either aprotinin or MI-432 showed enhanced antiviral activity against

341

SARS-CoV-2 and 10- to 30-fold reduced virus titers compared to 10 µM of each inhibitior

342

alone and even caused a 4- to 8-fold reduction in virus titer compared to 50 µM single

343

inhibitor treatment. Combination of 50 µM of MI-432 and MI-1851 reduced virus titers 10- to

344

32-fold compared to 50 µM of each inhibitor alone and thereby dramatically suppressed

345

SARS-CoV-2 multiplication 100- to 250-fold compared to untreated or DMSO treated cells. In

346

contrast, treatment of Calu-3 cells with 50 µM of MI-1851 and aprotinin did not cause further

347

suppression of virus titers compared to the combination of 10 µM of each inhibitor. The

348

combination of 10 µM MI-1851 and MI-1900 did not show enhanced antiviral activity

349

compared to single inhibitor treatments at 10 µM. However, treatment of cells with 50 µM of

350

MI-1900 and MI-1851 caused 5-fold reduction in viral titers when compared to cells treated

351

with 50 µM of each inhibitor alone and thereby dramatically reduced SARS-CoV-2

352

multiplication in Calu-3 cells compared to control cells. We furthermore examined the

353

antiviral activity of a combination of T-ex5 PPMO and furin inhibitor MI-1851 against SARS-

354

CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, combined treatment of Calu-3 cells with 25 µM T-

355

ex5 PPMO and 50 µM MI-1851 almost completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication with a

356

nearly 40,000-fold reduction in virus titers at 24 h p.i., and reduced virus titers 1,000-fold at

357

48 h p.i. compared to control cells. Combination of T-ex5 and MI-1851 was synergistic and

358

caused 30- to 10-fold lower virus titers at 16 and 24 h p.i. when compared with single

359

inhibitor treated cells. The data demonstrate that efficient inhibition of S cleavage by a

360

combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors can block SARS-CoV-2 replication in human

361

airway epithelial cells. Further, our data show that combination of TMPRSS2 and furin

362

inhibitors acts synergistically and allows inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activation and

363

multiplication at lower doses compared to single protease inhibitor treatment.

364

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and furin cleave the SARS-CoV-2 S

365

protein and are essential for virus multicycle replication in Calu-3 human airway cells. The

366

results indicate that TMPRSS2 and furin cleave S at different sites - furin at the S1/S2 site

367

and TMPRSS2 at the S2‘ site - and that TMPRSS2 and furin cannot compensate for each

368

other in SARS-CoV-2 S activation. Hence, inhibition of either one of these critical proteases

369

can render the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 unable to efficiently mediate virus entry and

370

membrane fusion. Therefore, TMPRSS2 and furin provide promising drug targets for

371

treatment of COVID-19, and inhibitors MI-432, MI-1900, MI-1851 as well as T-ex5 PPMO

372

may provide the basis for development of novel protease inhibitors. Our data further

373

demonstrate that aprotinin efficiently prevents proteolytic activation and multiplication of

374

SARS-CoV-2 in human airway cells and is therefore worthy of consideration for further

375

testing and possible development as a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19.

377

Discussion

378

Proteolytic processing of CoV S is a complex process that requires cleavage at two different

379

sites and is yet not fully understood. The amino acid sequence at the S1/S2 and S2’

380

cleavage sites varies among CoVs (Fig. 1B), suggesting that partially different proteases

381

may be involved in activation. Sequence analyses of the S protein of the novel emerged

382

SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the R-R-A-R motif at the S1/S2 site may by sensitive to

383

cleavage by furin, while the S2’ site contains a single R residue that can be cleaved by

384

trypsin-like serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 (Coutard et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020;

385

Hoffmann et al., 2020). In the present study, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

386

is cleaved by furin and by TMPRSS2. Furthermore, we show that multicycle replication of

387

SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 human airway cells is strongly suppressed by inhibiting TMPRSS2

388

and furin activity, demonstrating that both proteases are crucial for S activation in these cells.

389

Our data indicate that furin cleaves at the S1/S2 site, whereas TMPRSS2 cleaves at the S2’

390

site. The effective processing of the S1/S2 site by furin was additionally confirmed by

391

comparing the cleavage rates of various FRET substrates derived from the P6-P3’ segments

392

of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs. The data clearly revealed that due to the 4-mer PRRA

393

insertion a well suited furin cleavage site exists in S of SARS-CoV-2, which is similarly

394

cleaved as the sequence from the IBV CoV, whereas the analogous substrate of SARS-CoV

395

is not processed by furin. Strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells by

396

synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851 furthermore suggests that TMPRSS2 does not compensate

397

for furin cleavage at the S1/S2 site. Likewise, strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by

398

knockdown of TMPRSS2 activity using T-ex5 PPMO or treatment of Calu-3 cells with

399

aprotinin, MI-432 and MI-1900, respectively, indicates that furin cannot compensate for the

400

lack of TMPRSS2 in S activation. This was further confirmed by using an analogous FRET

401

substrate derived from the S2’ cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. S2). Kinetic

402

measurements clearly revealed that this substrate cannot be cleaved by furin (Fig. S2). Thus,

403

we could experimentally demonstrate for the first time that furin only activates the S1/S2 site,

404

as expected from the amino acid sequence at the cleavage sites (Coutard et al., 2020; Walls

405

et al., 2020). Together, our data indicate that furin and TMPRSS2 cleave S at different sites,

406

and, cleavage by both proteases is crucial to render the S protein active for mediating virus

407

entry and membrane fusion (Fig. 6). Iwata-Yoshikawa et al. showed that TMPRSS2-deficient

408

mice do not suffer from pathology when infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Iwata-

409

Yoshikawa et al., 2019). The data demonstrated that TMPRSS2 is essential for multicycle

410

replication and spread of these CoVs similar to what we and others have been observed for

411

certain influenza A virus strains (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Tarnow et al., 2014; Sakai et al.,

412

2014). However, it remains to be determined whether knockout of TMPRSS2 prevents

413

cleavage of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at both sites, S1/S2 and S2’, or
12

414

whether another protease is involved in S cleavage similar to what we have observed here

415

for SARS-CoV-2.

416

In cell culture, CoVs can enter cells via two distinct routes: the late endosome where S is

417

cleaved by cathepsins or via the cell-surface or early endosome utilizing trypsin-like

418

proteases for S cleavage (Simmons et al., 2005; Bosch et al., 2008; reviewed in Millet and

419

Whittaker, 2015). However, several recent studies revealed that clinical isolates of human

420

CoV (HCoV) achieve activation by trypsin-like serine proteases and utilize endosomal

421

cathepsins only in the absence of suitable trypsin-like proteases in cell culture (Shirato et al.,

422

2016, 2018). Thus, activation by cathepsins appears to be a mechanism that is acquired by

423

the virus during multiple passaging in cell cultures (Shirato et al., 2018). Congruently, Zhou

424

et al. showed that SARS-CoV pathogenesis in mice was strongly prevented by camostat, a

425

broad-range inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases, but not by inhibitors of endosomal

426

cathepsins (Zhuo et al., 2015). Here, we show that the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d that

427

also inhibits cathepsin L and B did not affect SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells,

428

indicating that endosomal cathepsins are dispensable or not involved at all in SARS-CoV-2

429

activation in human airway cells.

430

The presence of a multibasic cleavage site that is processed by ubiquitously expressed furin

431

and, therefore, supports systemic spread of infection, has long been known to be a major

432

determinant of the pathogenicity of HPAIV in poultry (reviewed in Garten and Klenk, 2008). In

433

contrast, the HA of LPAIV is activated at a monobasic cleavage site by trypsin-like serine

434

proteases present in a limited number of tissues limiting spread of infection to these tissues.

435

The S protein of IBV strain Beaudette contains multibasic motifs at the S1/S2 and S2’ site

436

(Fig. 1B). IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus and causes a highly contagious,

437

acute respiratory disease of chickens. Cleavage of IBV S protein by furin at the S2’ site has

438

been associated with neurotropism in chicken (Cheng et al., 2019). Congruently, here, FRET

439

substrates of the S1/S2 and S2’ site of the IBV Beaudette S protein were efficiently cleaved

440

by furin (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B). However, the advantage of furin-cleavable multibasic motifs

441

at the S1/S2 and/or S2’ site for multicycle replication, cellular tropism and pathogenicity of

442

HCoVs remains to be determined. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 possess a furin cleavage

443

motif at the S1/S2 site. In contrast, the S proteins of the 2002 SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and

444

HCoV-NL63 possess single arginine residues at both cleavage sites (see also Fig. 2B and

445

S2A). Interestingly, among the S proteins of the seven CoV infecting humans only SARS-

446

CoV S lacks the 4-mer insertion at the S1/S2 site (Fig. 1B; Walls et al., 2020). The S protein

447

of MERS-CoV contains a dibasic motif of the sequence R-X-X-R at both S1/S2 and S2’ site.

448

It is still controversial whether MERS-CoV is activated by furin in human airway epithelial

449

cells, as its clear role remains to be demonstrated (Gierer et al., 2015; Millet and Whittaker,
13

450

2014; Burkhard et al., 2014; Matsuyama et al., 2018). Probably, other proteases like the

451

serine protease matriptase/ST14, which also prefers sequences with arginine in P1 and P4

452

position, might be involved. Matriptase is expressed in a broad range of cells and tissues and

453

has been shown to activate the HA of H9N2 influenza A viruses possessing the cleavage site

454

motif R-S-S-R (Baron et al., 2013; reviewed in Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, 2018). Interestingly,

455

a study by Park et al. indicated that cleavage of MERS-CoV S by furin or other PCs at the

456

S1/S2 site takes place in virus-producing cells prior to virus release and can impact the

457

cellular localization of membrane fusion and virus entry into a new cell (Park et al., 2016).

458

Cleavage of MERS-CoV at the S1/S2 site was postulated as a prerequiste for subsequent

459

cleavage of S at the S2’ site by host proteases present at the surface or in early endosomes

460

of human airway cells facilitating virus entry independent of S cleavage by cathepsins in the

461

late endosome. However, other HCoV including the 2002 SARS-CoV are described to be

462

released with non-cleaved S from the infected cell. Hence, S cleavage at both sites, S1/S2

463

and S2’, has to take place at the stage of entry for these viruses.

464

The present study demonstrates that TMPRSS2 and furin are promising drug targets for the

465

treatment of COVID-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination

466

of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. The used TMPRSS2 inhibitors MI-432 and MI-1900 as well

467

as the furin inhibitor MI-1851 provide promising compounds for further drug development. In

468

search for suitable antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infections, protease inhibitors that

469

have been approved for other applications may be promising for drug repurposing to treat

470

COVID-19. Aprotinin is a broad range serine protease inhibitor isolated from bovine lung,

471

which is used as a fibrinolysis inhibitor to reduce perioperative bleeding (reviewed in

472

Steinmetzer et al., 2020) and has long been known to inhibit influenza A virus activation and

473

replication in cell culture and in mice in vivo (Zhirnov et al., 2011). In a clinical trial, inhalation

474

of aerosolized aprotinin in patients with inﬂuenza and parainﬂuenza markedly reduced the

475

duration of symptoms without causing side effects (Zhirnov et al., 2011). Thus, aprotinin is an

476

inhibitor of TMPRSS2 worthy of consideration for further testing and possible development

477

as a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19. Another promising TMPRSS2 inhibitor candidate

478

for COVID-19 treatment is the broad range protease inhibitor camostat. Camostat mesylate

479

is a phenyl-4-guanidinobenzoate derivative originally developed under the name FOY-305 for

480

the treatment of pancreatitis (Tanaka et al., 1979; Midgley et al., 1994) and has been shown

481

to efficiently inhibit replication of different CoV in cell culture and experimentally infected mice

482

(Kawase et al., 2012; Shirato et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015). Recently, Hoffmann et al.

483

showed that pretreatment of human Caco-2 colon cells and human airway cells with

484

camostat mesylate markedly reduced entry of SARS-CoV-2 as well as VSV pseudotypes

485

containing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Hoffmann et al., 2020).

486

However, it should be noted that all of these compounds inhibit numerous trypsin-like serine

487

proteases and thus may cause various adverse effects. A specific inhibition of TMPRSS2

488

activity during an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection would provide the most promising approach to

489

reduce side effects by inhibiting virus activation by host cell proteases. TMPRSS2-deficient

490

mice show no discernible phenotype, indicating functional redundancy or compensation of

491

physiological functions by other protease(s) in the host (Kim et al., 2006). Unfortunately,

492

there is no crystal structure of TMPRSS2 available so far, which prohibits a rational structure-

493

based design of more efficient inhibitors of this protease. However, first homology models

494

have been established, which may help for the development of improved TMPRSS2

495

inhibitors in the future (Steinmetzer and Hardes, 2018; Rensi et al. https://chemrxiv.org).

496

PPMO are highly selective inhibitors of target gene expression. They bind to a

497

complementary sequence in target mRNA and can affect gene expression by steric blockage

498

of translation initiation or pre-mRNA splicing. The demonstration of T-ex5 PPMO efficacy in

499

the present study suggests that reducing TMPRSS2 expression by use of a mRNA-directed

500

approach in general and by PPMO in particular is worthy of further consideration.

501

Importantly, in various experimental animal models of other viral infections and disease,

502

PPMO were able to be transported to lung tissue after intranasal administration and

503

produced strong reductions in virus growth and virus-induced pathology (Gabriel et al., 2008;

504

Lupfer et al,. 2008, Lai et al,. 2008; Opriessnig et al., 2011).

505

Very effective furin inhibitors containing a C-terminal 4-amidinobenzylamide residue have

506

been developed in recent years. Several of these analogues have been successfully used to

507

inhibit the replication of numerous furin dependent human pathogenic viruses like H5N1

508

influenza A virus, Chikungunya virus, West-Nile virus and Dengue-2 virus, Mumps virus or

509

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (reviewed in Steinmetzer and Hardes, 2018; Krüger et al.,

510

2018; Van Lam van et al., 2019). So far, these inhibitors have only been used in virus

511

infected cell cultures, but not in animal models. However, the less potent furin inhibitor hexa-

512

D-arginine has been used in mice and rats to protect them against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

513

Exotoxin A and anthrax toxemia (Sarac et al., 2002, 2004). Therefore, it can be speculated

514

that a specific furin inhibition in the respiratory tract and lung by inhalative treatment of e.g.

515

MI-1851 or structurally related compounds could be possible without severe side reactions,

516

despite many physiological functions of furin.

517

Here, the combination of the TMPRSS2 inhibitors aprotinin or MI-432 with furin inhibitor MI-

518

1851 showed enhanced antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human airway cells and

519

supported strong reduction of virus multiplication at lower doses compared to treatment with

520

each inhibitor alone. Therefore, the combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors provides a

521

promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections that not only may

522

enhance antiviral effects, but may also reduce drug toxicity and undesirable side effects by

523

allowing reductions of the inhibitor doses. Notably, inhibition of TMPRSS2 and furin acts on

524

the same target and our data show that inhibition of S cleavage at one of the two sites is

525

sufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication by reduced production of infectious progeny

526

virus containing inactive S. Thus, the combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors can act

527

synergistically until S cleavage at one or two sites is completely prevented. The combination

528

of protease inhibitors with antiviral compounds provides an approach that may show even

529

more synergistic antiviral activity at lower drug doses and may furthermore exclude the

530

development of drug resistant viruses. The combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors,

531

respectively, with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate has been shown to

532

block influenza A virus replication in human airway cells at remarkably lower concentration of

533

each inhibitor as compared to single inhibitor treatment (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al.,

534

2012). Combination of a furin inhibitor with oseltamivir carboxylate and the antiviral

535

compounds ribavirin and favipiravir, respectively, efficiently blocked multicycle replication of

536

HPAIV of subtype H5N1 and H7N1 in cell cultures (Lu et al., 2015; Garten et al., 2015).

537

Thus, combination of protease inhibitors (e.g. aprotinin or camostat) and antivirals provides a

538

promising approach to block SARS-CoV-2 replication that should be tested in cell cultures

539

and animal models and should furthermore be considered as therapeutic strategy for the

540

treatment of COVID-19.

541

In summary, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 and furin are essential for activation and

542

multiplication of the novel emerged SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cells and provide

543

promising drug targets for treatment of COVID-19. TMPRSS2 and furin have been shown to

544

be involved in the proteolytic activation of a broad range of viruses. However, the

545

development of host protease inhibitors as a preventative and/or therapeutic strategy for the

546

treatment of virus infections has been minimal to date. Our data demonstrate the high

547

potential of protease inhibitors as drugs for SARS-CoV-2 treatment and highlight the urgent

548

need of drug development and repurposing of potent host protease inhibitors for the

549

treatment of virus infections in general and emerging CoV infections in particular.

Materials and Methods

559
560

Cells. Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells (ATCC® HTB55) were cultured in Dulbecco’s

561

modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM)-Ham F-12 medium (1:1) (Gibco) supplemented with 10%

562

fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine, with fresh culture medium

563

replenished every 2 to 3 days. Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL-1586) and HEK293 (ATCC® CRL-

564

1573) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS, antibiotics and

565

glutamine.

566
567

Virus and plasmids. Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were performed under biosafety level 3

568

(BSL-3) conditions. The virus used in this study was SARS-CoV-2 isolate Munich 929 (kindly

569

provided by Christian Drosten, Institute of Virology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin,

570

Germany). Virus stock was propagated on Vero E6 cells in DMEM medium with 1 % FCS for

571

72 h. Cell supernatant was cleared by low-speed centrifugation and stored at -80°C.

572

The cDNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank

573

accession number MN908947; codon-optimized, sequence available upon request) with a C-

574

terminal Myc-6xHis-tag was synthesized at Eurofins and subcloned into in the pCAGGS

575

expression plasmid using XhoI and NheI restriction sites (pCAGGS-S-Myc-6xHis).

576

Expression plasmid pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 encoding the cDNA of human TMPRSS2 has been

577

described previously (Böttcher et al., 2006).

578
579

Antibodies. A polyclonal serum against 2002 SARS-CoV was generated by immunization of

580

rabbits with inactivated SARS-CoV. A monoclonal mouse antibody against the C-terminal

581

Myc-tag was purchased from CellSignaling Technology (2276S). A monoclonal mouse anti-

582

beta actin antibody was purchased from Abcam (ab6276). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-

583

conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from DAKO.

Protease inhibitors. Aprotinin was purchased from AppliChem, the cysteine protease

594

inhibitor E64d from Sigma-Aldrich (E8640). The synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and furin

595

were synthesized according to previous methods (Hammami et al., 2012; Hardes et al.,

596

2015). Stock solutions of protease inhibitors were prepared in double distilled water

597

(aprotinin, MI-432, MI-1851) or sterile DMSO (MI-1900, E64d) and stored at -20°C.

Synthesis of FRET substrates

600

The peptides were synthesized by automated solid phase peptide synthesis on a Syro 2000

601

synthesizer (MultiSynTech GmbH, Witten, Germany) using approximately 100 mg Rink-

602

amide-MBHA resin (loading 0.68 mmol/g) for each 2 ml reaction vessel and a standard

603

Fmoc-protocol with double couplings (approximately 4-fold excess of Fmoc amino acid,

604

HOBt and HBTU, respectively, and 8 equiv. DIPEA, 2  2 h coupling time) as described

605

recently (Hardes et al., 2013). After final coupling of Boc-2-aminobenzoic acid, the resin was

606

washed with 20 % piperidine in DMF (5 and 15 min) to remove an acylation on the 3-

607

nitrotyrosine (Singh et al., 2002). The peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected

608

by a mixture of TFA/triisopropylsilane/water (95/2.5/2.5, v/v/v) over 2 h at room temperature,

609

followed by precipitation in cold diethyl ether. All peptides were purified by preparative

610

reversed-phase HPLC to more than 95 % purity based on the detection at 220 nm, and

611

finally obtained as lyophilized TFA-salts.

612

Enzyme kinetic measurements with recombinant soluble human furin

613

The measurements were performed in black 96-well plates (Nunc, Langenselbold) at room

614

temperature with a microplate reader (Safire2, Tecan, Switzerland) at ex 320 nm and em 405

615

nm. Each well contained 20 µL of the substrate solution (dissolved in water), and 150 µL

616

buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.2 % Triton X-100, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.02 % Natriumazid und 1 mg/mL

617

BSA, pH 7.0). The measurements were started by addition of 20 µL furin (Kacprzak et al.,

618

2004) solution (0.5 nM in assay). The measurements were performed for 5 min, and the

619

steady-state rates were calculated from the slopes of the progress curves.

621

RNA isolation, RT-PCR analysis of exon skipping, and RT-qPCR analysis of protease

622

transcripts. For analysis of TMPRSS2-mRNA from PPMO-treated Calu-3 cells, cells were

incubated with the indicated concentrations (25 µM) of T-ex5 or scramble PPMO or without

624

PPMO in PPMO medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.1 % BSA, antibiotics, and glutamine)

625

for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated at the indicated time points using the RNeasy Mini kit

626

(QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)

627

was carried out with total RNA using the one-step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN) according to the

631

from control cells and a shorter PCR fragment of about 1,100 bp lacking exon 5 from T-ex5-

632

treated cells (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al., 2011) were used. RT-PCR products were

633

resolved on a 0.8 % agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.

634
635

Infection of cells and multicycle virus replication in the presence of protease inhibitors

636

or PPMO. SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments of Calu-3 cells were performed in serum-free

637

DMEM supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics (DMEM++). For analysis of multicycle

638

replication kinetics Calu-3 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to 90 % conﬂuence.

639

Cells were then inoculated with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 in DMEM++

640

for 1.5 h, washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 3 % FCS, glutamine

641

and antibiotics (DMEM+++) with or without addition of protease inhibitors or DMSO to the

642

medium for 72 h. At 16, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (p.i.), supernatants were collected,

643

and viral titers were determined by tissue culture infection dose 50 % (TCID50) titration as

644

described below. In addition, cells were fixed and immunostained against viral proteins as

645

described below at 72 h p.i. to evaluate virus spread and virus-induced CPE.

646

For PPMO treatment, Calu-3 cells were incubated with 25 µM T-ex5 or scramble PPMO or

647

remained untreated in PPMO medium for 24 h prior to infection. Cells were infected as

648

described above and incubated in DMEM+++ without PPMO for 72 h.

649
650

Virus titration by TCID50. Viral supernatants were serial diluted in DMEM++. Each infection

651

time point was titrated in 4 replicates from 51 to 511. Subsequently, 100 µl of each virus

652

dilution were transfered to Calu-3 cells grown in 96-well plates containing 100 µl DMEM+++

653

and incubated for 72 h. Viral titers were determined with Spearman and Kärber algorithm

654

described in Hierholzer and Killington et al., 1996.

655
656

Transient expression of SARS CoV-2 S protein in HEK293 cells. For transient expression

657

of SARS-CoV-2 S protein 60 % confluent HEK293 cells were co-transfected with 1.6 µg of

658

pCAGGS-S-Myc-6xHis and either 15 ng of empty pCAGGS vector or pCAGGS-TMPRSS2

659

using Liopfectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers protocol for 48 h.

Cells were harvested and centrifuged for 5 min at 8.000 x g. Subsequently cells were

661

subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described below.

species-speciﬁc peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using

669

the ChemiDoc XRS system with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).

670
671

Immunohistochemical staining and microscopy. To visualize viral spread in SARS-CoV-2

672

infected Calu-3 cells, immunohistochemical staining was performed. Calu-3 cells were fixed

673

72 h post infection in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 36 h at 4 °C. The cells were

674

permeabilized with 0.3 % Triton-X-100 (Sigma Aldrich) for 20 min at room temperature (RT).

675

The cells were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit serum against 2002 SARS-CoV for 1.5 h at

676

RT, a species-specific peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at RT and

677

subsequently stained using the peroxidase substrate KPL TrueBlue™ (Seracare) and further

678

analysed on a Leica Dmi1 microscope.

679
680

Cell viability assay. Cell viability was assessed by measuring the cellular ATP content using

681

the CellTiterGlo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). Calu-3 cells grown in 96-well

682

plates were incubated with 25 µM of each PPMO or 50 µM of each of the protease inhibitors

683

for 24 and 72 h, respectively. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the substrate

684

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was measured using a 96-well plate

685

(Nunc) with a luminometer (Centro LB 960; Berthold Technologies). The absorbance values

686

of PPMO- or inhibitor-treated cells were converted to percentages by comparison to

687

untreated control cells, which were set at 100 % cell viability.

Figure 6

Figure 6: Proposed processing of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S by TMPRSS2 and furin.
i) S must be cleaved at two sites, S1/S2 and S2‘, to trigger fusion of viral and cellular
membranes during virus entry in order to release the virus genome into the host cell. CoV S
cleavage is believed to occur sequentially, with cleavage at the S1/S2 site occurring first and
subsequent cleavage at the S2′ site. Furin processes the S1/S2 site, whereas TMPRSS2
cleaves at the S2‘ site, and both proteases cannot compensate each other. Inhibition of
either furin (ii) or TMPRSS2 (iii) or simultaneous inhibition of both proteases (iv) renders the
S protein fusion-inactive and prevents virus entry. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 prevents exposure
of the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of the S2‘ subunit (iii and iv). Inhibition of furin
cleavage at the S1/S2 site may directly interfere with virus entry and membrane fusion by
steric blockage of conformational changes (ii, upper scheme) or may prevent exposure of the
S2‘ site to TMPRSS2 (ii, lower scheme). Fusion-competent S is indicated in blue, fusionincompetent S in grey.
