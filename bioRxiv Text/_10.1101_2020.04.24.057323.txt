Abstract (250)
Since emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, there has been a critical need to understand
prevalence, transmission patterns, to calculate the burden of disease and case fatality rates.
Molecular diagnostics, the gold standard for identifying viremic cases, are not ideal for
determining true case counts and rates of asymptomatic infection. Serological detection of
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies can contribute to filling these knowledge gaps. In this study, we
describe optimization and validation of a SARS-CoV-2-specific-enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) using the prefusion-stabilized form of the spike protein [1]. We performed
receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses to define the specificities and sensitivities of the
optimized assay and examined cross reactivity with immune sera from persons confirmed to
have had infections with other coronaviruses. These assays will be used to perform contact
investigations and to conduct large-scale, cross sectional surveillance to define disease burden
in the population.

Background
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, there has been a need to identify transmission
patterns, determine prevalence, and determine the true burden of disease and case fatality
rates. Case fatality rates have differed between countries [2-4]. Defining these rates has been
difficult due to various factors including f asymptomatic infection [5-7] and limits to molecular
testing capacity. Several reports have confirmed that most patients with established SARS-CoV2 infections mount serum antibody responses specific to viral proteins [8-10]. Because
seroconversion may not occur for 1-3 weeks after symptom onset, antibody testing may have
limited utility for diagnosis of acute infection. However, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum
antibody responses can be used to define transmission chains in contact investigations.
Additionally, in cross -sectional serosurveillance studies, antibody assays can be used to define
the burden of disease and be used for more accurate calculations of case fatality rates.

Objectives
In this manuscript we describe assay optimization and validation of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
ELISA. We intend to use this assay in contact investigations to identify individuals who had a
SARS-CoV-2 infection without prior molecular diagnostic confirmation. We plan to use these
assays to study the natural history of infection to determine the percent of individuals with a
range of disease severity who mount serum antibody responses against the virus. Finally, we
plan to use these assays in large-scale serosurveillance to better define, on a population basis,
the number of individuals who may have had COVID-19, including those with mild and

asymptomatic infections. These studies will be essential for characterizing transmission,
identifying the true burden of disease, existence of population-wide serum antibodies, and
calculating accurate case fatality rates. To this end, we needed to define the parameters that
maximized the sensitivity and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-detection assays.

Study design
Sera collection
True negative sera were collected between 2011 and 2019 from 519 adults who were healthy
(2016-2019, n = 377) or collected from suspected hanta virus patients (2016-2019, n = 101), HIV
(2011-2012, n = 21), hepatitis B virus (2011-2012, n = 10), or HCV positive (2011-2012, n = 10).
Sera from hantavirus sera were used because cases had respiratory virus infections and found
to be hantavirus negative. They, therefore, represent negative controls with recent respiratory
virus infections. Convalescent sera from PCR+ COVID-19 cases were collected at day 10 postsymptom onset or later (n = 99). Additionally, acute and convalescent paired sera from PCRconfirmed commonly circulating coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1)- infected patients
were collected as previously described [11].
Ethics
All serum specimens were de-identified. The investigation was determined to constitute nonhuman subjects research by CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases
(project 0900f3eb81b07602).

ELISA
The pre-fusion stabilized ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) was expressed in suspension
adapted HEK-293 cells as previously described [1]. Coating conditions were optimized by
antigen dilution and testing with convalescent sera collected from two COVID-19 patients at
days 15 and 23 post symptom onset. Coating concentrations ranging from 0.019– 5 µg / ml
were tested. Antigen was diluted in PBS to 0.15 µg / ml. The top half of Immulon 2 HB (Thermo
Fischer) 96 well-plates were coated with antigen, and the bottom half with PBS overnight at 28°C in a humidified chamber. The next day, 5 X Stabilcoat blocker (Surmodics) was diluted 1:1 in
PBS. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS tween 20 (PBS-T)diluted from a 10 X stock pH 7.4 –
7.6 (KD Medical catalog # 0125) using a Biotek plate 405 washer and were blocked with 2.5 2.5
X Stabilcoat blocking buffer at 37° C for one hour. During the hour blocking plates, sera were
diluted 1:25 in serum diluent (PBS-T / 5% skim milk), including positive and negative controls.
After blocking, plates were washed 3 Xs with PBS-T, and 100 µl serum diluent was added to all
wells. Thirty three point three µl serum diluted to 1:25 was added to rows A and E and mixed by
pipetting. Four-fold serially dilutions were achieved by pipetting 33.3 ul diluted sera down the
plates in rows A-D, and E-H, discarding 33.3 ul from rows D and H after dilutions. Plates were
incubated at 37°C in a humidified chamber for one hour and washed 3 Xs with PBS-T. HRPconjugated goat anti-human antibodies (KPL) diluted at 1:2000 in serum diluent were added to
washed plates and incubated at 37°C in a humidified chamber for 1 hour. During secondary
antibody incubation, ABTS peroxidase substrate system (KPL) components were brought to
room temperature and prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were

washed 3 Xs with PBS-T, 100 µl prepared substrate was added to each well, and were incubated
for 30 minutes at 37°C. During substrate incubation, ABTS stop solution was prepared according
to the manufacturer instruction. After 30 minutes, 100 µl prepared stop solution was added to
each well, and each plate was read at 405 and 490 nm using a PerkinElmer Victor XV plate
reader. Final background corrected ODs were calculated as 490-405, antigen coated – PBS
coated well for each dilution of each specimen. Statistics were performed using GraphPad
Prism software (7.04).

Results
Coating with 0.15 µg / ml of antigen was found to produce a saturated signal in convalescent
sera that titrated with serum dilution (data not shown). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
analyses of spike protein ELISAS were conducted using anti-human pan Ig, anti-human IgG, and
anti-human IgM secondary antibodies (Figure 1A). Two dilutions, 1:100 (Figure 1A) and 1:400
(Figure 1B), were analyzed using the pan-Ig secondary antibody. At a background corrected OD
of 0.4 with serum diluted 1:100, specificity was 99.3% (confidence interval 98.32 – 99.88%) and
sensitivity was 96% (confidence interval 89.98 – 98.89%) (Figure 1A). Using anti-IgG secondary
antibodies at the same OD cutoff, sensitivity was 94.74% (confidence interval 85.38 – 98.9%),
and 76.19% sensitivity (confidence interval 63.79 – 86.02%) using anti-IgM secondary antibody
(Figure 1A). Diluting sera to 1:400 reduced the sensitivity to 86.7% (Figure 1B). These data
indicate diluting sera at 1:100 and using pan Ig secondary antibody maximizes specificity and
sensitivity.

To examine potential cross reactivity with common coronavirus sera, healthy donor sera, and
convalescent immune sera SARS-1 (n =4), MERS-CoV (n = 1), SARS-CoV-2 (n = 9), NL63 (n = 8),
OC43 (n = 17), and HKU1 (n = 14), and 229E (n = 3) patients were tested using the same ELISA
conditions and pan-Ig secondary antibody. SARS-1 and MERS-CoV sera exhibited cross reactivity
to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, while NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E sera did not (Figure 2A). To
examine rising cross reactivity that may be present in sera from confirmed common
coronavirus cases, acute and convalescent paired sera were examined. There were not rising
signals between acute and convalescent timepoints in any of 8 paired NL63 or 2 pairs of 229E
sera (Figure 2B and E). There were 2 of 17 OC43 paired specimens that exhibited rising signals
between acute and convalescent timepoints, though still below the set cutoff (Figure 2C).
Similarly, there were 2 of 14 HKU1 paired specimens that exhibited rising signals between acute
and convalescent timepoints, though still below the set cutoff (Figure 2D). These data indicate
that there may be significant cross reactivity to MERS-CoV and SARS-1 sera, though prior
infections with those viruses are extremely rare and should not contribute to background
reactivity in large scale serosurveillance or in contact investigations. More common coronavirus
infections do exhibit some cross reactivities, however they are below the limits of detection.

Conclusions
We have optimized an ELISA against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is sensitive and specific.
Diluting sera 1:100 and use of goat anti-human Pan Ig secondary antibody maximized sensitivity
and specificity of the assay. While we did see some cross reactivity with SARS1 and MERS-CoV
sera, there was minimal cross reactivity using sera against commonly circulating coronaviruses.

With specificity >99%, and a sensitivity of 96%, this assay can be used to identify prior SARSCoV-2 infections without molecular diagnostic confirmation. This assay can be adjusted for use
in higher throughput serosurveys and in combination with confirmatory testing could be used
in an algorithm for informing individuals of prior infection.
