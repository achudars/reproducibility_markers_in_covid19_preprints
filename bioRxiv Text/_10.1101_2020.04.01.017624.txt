Abstract:
Background: The outbreak of SARS CoV-2 has caused ever-increasing attention and
public panic all over the world. Currently, there is no specific treatment against the SARS
CoV-2. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently
needed. Previous studies found that indomethacin has the ability to inhibit the replication
of several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV.
Methods: SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus-infected African green monkey kidney VERO E6 cells
treated with different concentrations of indomethacin or aspirin at 48 hours post infection
(p.i). The level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity. Anti-coronavirus
efficacy in vivo was confirmed by evaluating the time of recovery in canine coronavirus
(CCV) infected dogs treated orally with 1mg/kg body weight indomethacin.
Results: We found that indomethacin has a directly and potently antiviral activity against
the SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus (reduce relative light unit to zero). In CCV-infected dogs,
recovery occurred significantly sooner with symptomatic treatment + oral indomethacin (1
mg/kg body weight) daily treatments than with symptomatic treatment + ribavirin (10-15
mg/kg body weight) daily treatments (P =0.0031), but was not significantly different from
that with symptomatic treatment + anti-canine coronavirus serum + canine hemoglobin +
canine blood immunoglobulin + interferon treatments (P =0.7784).
Conclusion: The results identify indomethacin as a potent inhibitor of SARS CoV-2.

was named Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). As of March 20, 2020, SARS CoV-2 has
been reported in 76 countries and 308,613 cases and 13,844 deaths have been
confirmed, with an estimated mortality risk of 4%. Common symptoms at onset of illness
were fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue; fewer common symptoms were sputum
production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhea. Complications included acute
respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury 1.
It is currently believed that SARS CoV-2 may be transmitted from bats to humans2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main host cell receptor of SARS CoV-2
and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause infection3-5. High ACE2
expression was identified in type II alveolar cells (AT2) of lung, esophagus upper and
stratified epithelial cells, absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, and bladder
urothelial cells6-8.
New interventions are likely to require years to develop. Given the urgency of the SARS
CoV-2 outbreak, we focus here on the potential to repurpose existing drugs approved for
treating infections caused by RNA virus, based on therapeutic experience with two other
infections caused by human coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)9. Cyclooxygenases (COXs) play a
significant role in many different viral infections with respect to replication and
pathogenesis10. Cyclopentone COX inhibitor indomethacin has been widely used in the
clinic for its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties11. In addition to the
anti-inflammatory/analgesic action, indomethacin has been known to also possess
antiviral properties, including canine coronavirus (CCV) and SARS-CoV12-14.
CCV has certain sequence homology with SARS CoV-212. CCV-infection in dogs are
common in winter and spread rapidly. Puppies have higher morbidity and mortality than
adult dogs 15. The main symptoms of dogs with CCV-infection are those of the digestive
system, such as vomiting and diarrhea, and sometimes respiratory symptoms16.
In the present report we described how indomethacin was found to potently inhibit SARS
CoV-2 in vitro, and efficiently treat CCV-infected dogs.
Methods:
Cell culture and treatment
VERO E6 cells were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in Modified Eagle
Medium (MEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Indomethacin was
dissolved in absolute ethanol at a concentration of (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 µM) and
diluted in culture medium immediately before use. Unless otherwise specified,
indomethacin and Aspirin were added immediately after the 1 h adsorption period and
maintained in the medium for the duration of the experiment. Controls received equal

cells in 24-well plates (4–8 104 cells/well), and treated with different concentrations (0, 0.1,
1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 µM) of indomethacin or Aspirin after the 1 h adsorption period. The
cells were lysed at 48 h post infection (p.i). Twenty microliters of lysate was tested for
luciferase activity by the addition of 50 µl of luciferase substrate and measured for 10 s in
a Wallac Multilabel 1450 Counter. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, 100 µl mixtures
were added to VERO E6 cells in 96-well plates. The cells were lysed at 48 h p.i and tested
for luciferase activity as described above19.
Animal maintenance
The enrolled dogs were confirmed for diagnosis of CCV infection with a Canine
Coronavirus test kit and between 2-3 days of the onset of symptoms. We enrolled 26 dogs
which were 3-6 months old and medium-sized. There were several types of these dogs,
including poodles and Pekingese dogs. Dogs were grouped into three populations based
on the treatment scheme as follows: (1) symptomatic treatment + ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg
body weight) daily, 8 dogs; (2) symptomatic treatment + anti-canine coronavirus serum +
canine hemoglobin + canine blood immunoglobulin + interferon, 9 dogs; (3) symptomatic
treatment + oral indomethacin (1 mg/kg body weight) daily20, 9 dogs. The time of recovery
was determined by the disappearance of symptoms and a negative diagnosis by the
canine coronavirus test kit. Humane standards were adhered to for all assessments. The
study procedure was approved by Animal Ethics Committee of United Animal Hospital.
Statistical analysis
In virus titration experiments, statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test for
unpaired data. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD and P-values of <0.05 were

To investigate the effect of indomethacin on SARS CoV-2 replication, African green
monkey kidney VERO E6 cells were infected with SARS CoV-2 and treated with different
concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 µM) of indomethacin or Aspirin after the 1 h
adsorption period. The level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity at 48 h
p.i. Surprisingly, indomethacin was found to possess a remarkable antiviral activity,
reducing viral particle production dose-dependently with an IC50 (inhibitory concentration
50%) of 1 µM, and selective index of 500, and caused a dramatic reduction relative light
unit to zero at 48 h p.i, in VERO E6 cells (Figure 1A). Oral administration of 50 mg of
indomethacin generates a peak plasma concentration of the drug ranging from 7µM to
11µM, a concentration which is 10 times of the drug’s IC5021. These concentrations of
indomethacin did not affect VERO E6 cell proliferation (Figure 1B) indicating that even at
500 µM indomethacin still does not show any cytotoxicity to VERO E6 cell.
2. Antiviral activity of indomethacin in CCV-infected dogs
In order to evaluate whether indomethacin could also be effective against CCV in vivo, we
analyzed the rate of recovery in dogs with treatment schemes as follows: (1) symptomatic
treatment + ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg body weight) daily; (2) symptomatic treatment +
anti-canine coronavirus serum + canine hemoglobin + canine blood immunoglobulin +
interferon; (3) symptomatic treatment + oral indomethacin (1 mg/kg body weight) daily.
The results showed that recovery occurred significantly sooner with the (3) treatments
than with the (1) treatments (P =0.0031, Fig.2A), but was not significantly different from
that with the (2) treatments (P =0.7784, Fig.2B). Moreover, in the group of with the (1)
treatment scheme were 8 dogs, and 3 died (3/8); with the (2) scheme were 9 dogs, and 1
died (1/9); with the (3) scheme were all survived from this disease (9 dogs).
Discussion: Given the urgency of the SARS CoV-2 outbreak, we focus here on the
potential to repurpose existing agents approved or in development for treating infections
caused by HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and influenza9,22.
Indomethacin has been known to possess antiviral properties12-14, and used for a long
time as a potent anti-inflammatory drug, acting by blocking the activity of
cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COXs), activity and inhibiting pro-inflammatory prostaglandin
synthesis23. Indomethacin reduces the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) by inhibiting
cyclooxygenase, and inhibiting the formation of painful nerve impulses in inflammatory
tissues thus suppressing the inflammatory response10.
In our experiments, we tested the COX inhibitors indomethacin and aspirin. Our results
show that indomethacin has potent, direct antiviral activity against the SARS CoV-2
(reduce the relative light unit to zero) in VERO E6 cells (Figure 1A), and does not show
cytotoxicity to VERO E6 cells (Figure 1B). The current study, and reported by others,
suggest that indomethacin has strong anti-Coronavirus activity in vitro12,13, including
SARS COV-2, while aspirin does not. This suggests that indomethacin’s antiviral activity is
not achieved by some mechanisms other than COX inhibition.

In our study of CCV-infected dogs, the results show that in items of anti-CCV efficacy,
indomethacin can achieve a similar efficacy as treatment with anti-canine coronavirus
serum, canine hemoglobin, canine blood immunoglobulin and interferon treatments effect
(P =0.7784, Fig.2B), and superior efficacy than the treatment with ribavirin (P =0.0031,
Fig.2A). These findings were consistent with other report and revealed that indomethacin
also shows significant anti-CCV in vivo12. Its mechanism, however, remains largely
unknown.
Although the underlying mechanism requires further investigation, the results of
indomethacin anti-SARS-CoV show that indomethacin does not affect virus infectivity,
binding or entry into target cells, but acts early on the coronavirus replication cycle,
selectively blocking viral RNA synthesis12. The only clear indomethacin antiviral
mechanism is that, instead, triggers a cellular antiviral defense mechanism by rapidly and
effectively activating PKR in an interferon- and dsRNA-independent manner13. PKR plays
a critical role in the antiviral defense mechanism of the host, acting as a sensor of virus
replication and24, upon activation, leading to eIF2α phosphorylation and block of protein
synthesis in virally infected cells 25.
To investigate possible antiviral mechanisms not related to COX inhibition, we utilized
Plex Research’s AI search engine platform26. A Plex analysis of indomethacin identified
additional targets that are directly modulated by indomethacin or its close analogs:
aldo-keto reductase (AKR1C3, AKR1C4, AKR1C2)27-29, aldose reductase (AKR1B1)30,
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG)31-33, and cannabinoid
receptor 2 (CB2)34. Of these, only AKR1B1 and PPARG are expressed in VERO cells35.
There are few reports about the role of aldo-keto reductases in inflammation. Aldo-keto
reductase was found to reduce peroxidation derived lipid aldehydes, such as
4-hydroxytrans-2-nonenal and their glutathione conjugates, to corresponding alcohols,
1,4-dihydroxy-nonene and glutathionyl-1,4-dihydroxynonene, respectively, which take part
in the inflammatory signaling36. Inhibition of aldose reductase was found to significantly
prevent the transfer of the inflammatory signals induced by multiple factors including
allergens, cytokines, growth factors, endotoxins, high glucose, and autoimmune reactions
at the cellular level as well as in animal models37.
It has been demonstrated that PPARG agonists inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-638. Macrophages loss of PPARG leads to altered
differentiation kinetics39. PPARG has been described to be important for resolving
inflammation and maintaining homeostasis.
Cannabinoids receptor 2 (CB2), which is influences the immune system, viral
pathogenesis, and viral replication. The anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory action of
cannabinoids are CB2 dependent40. Activated CB2 receptors play a significant role in
leukocyte and endothelial migration, activation, and interaction, which is related to the
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of CB241. CB2 receptors suppress

chemokine induced chemotaxis of neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes,
and microglia by inhibiting leukocyte migration mediated by RhoA activation42,43. In addition,
CB2 can also inhibit the recruitment of neutrophils44. Therefore, CB2 plays a crucial role in
maintaining immune homeostasis and controlling the magnitude of the immune response
through negative regulation.
IL-6 is a soluble mediator with a pleiotropic effect on inflammation and immune response45.
It is generally known as endogenous pyrogens which can induce fever. It was shown that
an increase in intrahypothalamic concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-like activity during
LPS-induces fever46. A recent report indicates that indomethacin can reduce the
cytokine-mediated IL-6 release by reducing LPS47. COVID-19 patients show a "cytokine
storm" phenomenon, while IL-6 in the body is significantly increased47,48. The latest
treatment guidelines for COVID-19 include the reduction of concentration of IL-6.
During the preparation of this manuscript, a preliminary report emerged describing a
proteomic analysis of interactions between SARS CoV-2 viral proteins and 332 human
proteins 49. In this report, the viral NSP7 protein was found to interact with human PTGES2.
PTGES2 is expressed in VERO cells50 and is inhibited by indomethacin (IC50 = 750 nM)51.
It is also inhibited by aspirin, however much less potently (IC50 = 35 μM)51. NSP7, together
with NSP8, forms the viral primase complex, which is part of the viral RNA polymerase
machinery52,53. Inhibition of NSP7/NSP8 complex function through inhibition of PTGES2
would be consistent with the selective blockage of viral RNA synthesis observed after
indomethacin treatment of SARS-CoV12.
Although the mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of indomethacin against
coronavirus infection require further investigation, our results herein show that
indomethacin inhibits SARS CoV-2 both in vitro and in vivo.
Previously, we have used nebulized indomethacin to treat patients with bronchorrhea or
excessive phlegm caused by bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma or COPD and found that
indomethacin can dramatically reduce the bronchorrhea sputum and abate dyspnea. Due
to patients with COVID-19 often exhibit excessive phlegm which may causes severe
dyspnea, indomethacin not only directly inhibit virus as our current study identified, but it
also may reduce sputum secretion and relieve symptoms.

Community-acquired pneumonia. In some survey or observational study, up to half of the
patients diagnosed with CAP were treated with NSAIDs54-56. Among these NSAIDs,
indomethacin is used less frequently than other paracetamol, fenbufen, ibuprofen or
aspirin, mainly due to the relatively frequent gastrointestinal side effects of oral
indomethacin, but indomethacin rarely causes serious side effects. Given the fact that
indomethacin has been widely used in the clinic for several decades and its safety profile
is well defined57, we suggest that indomethacin should be assessed further in a
prospective clinical study as a treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Figure legend:
Figure 1. Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of SARS CoV-2 in vitro replication. (A). VERO
E6 cells were infected with SARS CoV-2 and treated with different concentrations of the
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) indomethacin (INDO, red line) (0, 0.1, 1, 5,
10, 50, 100, 500 µM) or Aspirin (black line) (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 µM) after the 1 h
adsorption period. The level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity in the
supernatant of infected cells at 48 h p.i. (B). Cell viability (black line) determined by MTT
assay in uninfected indomethacin-treated cells is expressed as percentage of MTT
conversion in untreated control, and (red line) indicates relative light unit treated with as
(A). Data expressed in relative light unit represent the mean ± SD of triplicate samples
from a representative experiment of three with similar results. P <0.05 indicates a
significant difference.
Figure 2. Antiviral activity of indomethacin in CCV-infected dogs. This figure shows the
rate of recovery in CCV-infected dogs with the treatment schemes as follows: (1)
symptomatic treatment + ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg body weight) daily; (2) symptomatic
treatment + anti-canine coronavirus serum + canine hemoglobin + canine blood
immunoglobulin + interferon; (3) symptomatic treatment + oral indomethacin (1 mg/kg
body weight) daily. The time of recovery was determined by the symptoms disappeared
and the diagnosis of CCV test paper turned negative. Both in (A) and (B) red line indicates
treatment with the (3) scheme. Blue line indicates treatment with the (1) scheme in (A),
however indicate treatment with the (2) scheme in (B). P <0.05 indicates a significant
difference.
