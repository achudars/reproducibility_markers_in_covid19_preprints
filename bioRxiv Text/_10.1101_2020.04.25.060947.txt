Abstract

33

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a serious public health

34

risk. Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

35

CoV-2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral

36

evolution, as well as for vaccine development. Existing sample preparation methods for

37

viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal

38

for time-sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high

39

performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment

40

VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic

41

and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation

42

of RNA/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library

43

construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes

44

with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on

45

pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID-19 patients, successfully

46

obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high-depth high-coverage SARS-

47

CoV-2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA

48

is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened

49

hands-on time from sample to virus-enriched sequencing-ready library, this rapid,

50

versatile, and clinic-friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations

51

during outbreaks, both current and future.

Introduction

55

As of May 22, 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 viral pandemic has affected 5 million people

56

in over 200 countries and territories around the world, and has claimed more than 320

57

thousand lives1. Closely monitoring the genetic diversity and distribution of viral strains at

58

the population level is essential for epidemiological tracking, and for understanding viral

59

evolution and transmission; additionally examining the viral heterogeneity within a single

60

individual is imperative for diagnosis and treatment2. The disease-causing pathogen,

61

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified from

62

early disease cases and its draft genome sequenced within weeks, thanks to the rapid

63

responses from researchers around the world3-6. The initial SARS-CoV-2 draft genome

64

was obtained independently from the same early COVID-19 patient samples using

65

various conventional RNA-seq sequencing library construction methods. Although these

66

library construction methods successfully generated a draft genome, several drawbacks

67

hinder the use of these methods for routine viral genome sequencing from the surge of

68

clinical samples during an outbreak.

69
70

One direct library construction approach which was used to generate the SARS-CoV-2

71

draft genome3-6 essentially captures each sample’s entire metatranscriptome, in which

72

SARS-CoV-2 is just one species among many. The abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical

73

swabs, sputum, and stool samples is often low2,7, therefore this catch-all method requires

74

deeper sequencing of each sample in order to obtain sufficient coverage and depth of the

75

whole viral genome, which increases the time and cost of sequencing. Target enrichment

76

with spiked-in primers can improve SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage8, but the reliance on

77

specific primers inherently limits this approach for the profiling of fast evolving viruses

78

such as coronaviruses. The same limitation applies to multiplex RT-PCR-based

79

strategies9. Additionally, once the sample is subject to targeted amplification during the

80

initial reverse transcription (RT) steps, its metatranscriptomic information is lost forever.

81
82

Currently, the most comprehensive strategy is the combination of metatranscriptomics

83

profiling with post-library SARS-CoV-2 target enrichment9. However, in most conventional

84

RNA-seq methods, the double-strand DNA ligation (dsDL) portion of the protocol is

3

85

usually the most demanding on hands-on time and user technique10. When superimposed

86

on the target enrichment process, these labor-intensive and lengthy protocols become

87

impractical for routine use in the clinic, much less for the timely monitoring of viral genetics

88

and evolution on large volumes of samples during an outbreak. Furthermore, due to the

89

low molecular efficiency of dsDL, these protocols also require a high amount of input

90

material, further restricting their application on clinical samples.

91
92

Summarily, although next generation sequencing platforms are high-throughput and have

93

short turn-around time, library construction from samples – whether including targeted

94

enrichment or not – remains a major bottleneck. To broadly apply viral sequencing on

95

clinical samples, especially during outbreaks when biomedical resources are already

96

limited, a rapid, simple, versatile, and scalable sample library construction method that

97

does not compromise on performance is urgently needed.

98
99

Recently, we reported a new RNA-seq library construction strategy that aims to address

100

some of these challenges: SHERRY avoids the problematic dsDL step in library

101

construction by taking advantage of the newly discovered Tn5 tagmentation activity on

102

RNA/DNA hybrids, to directly tag RNA/cDNA fragments with sequencing adapters10. As

103

such, SHERRY has minimal sample transfers and greatly reduced hands-on time, making

104

it simple, robust, and suitable for inputs ranging from single cells to 200 ng total RNA. We

105

now combine the advantages of a tailored SHERRY protocol, which improved coverage

106

of whole metatranscriptome, with a simplified post-library target enrichment protocol.

107

MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment VirAl sequencing or MINERVA, is an easy-to-use,

108

versatile, scalable, and cost-effective protocol that yields high-coverage high-depth

109

SARS-CoV-2 genome, while preserving the sample’s rich metatranscriptomic profile. The

110

hands-on time required from clinical sample to sequencing-ready library using

111

conventional approaches without enrichment is 190 min; MINERVA requires only 100 min

112

hands-on time, and if deep viral coverage is desired, an additional 90 min for post-library

113

enrichment, totaling 190 min for the entire workflow (Fig. S1), making MINERVA practical

114

for high-volume, routine clinical use. We applied MINERVA to various types of COVID-19

115

samples and successfully obtained up to 10,000-fold SARS-CoV-2 genome enrichment.

This strategy will facilitate all studies regarding SARS-CoV-2 genetic variations in the

117

current pandemic, and can also be applied to other pathogens of interest.

Results

120

Metagenomic RNA enrichment viral sequencing (MINERVA). To analyze both

121

metagenomics and SARS-CoV-2 genetics from COVID-19 patient samples, we

122

developed a two-stage metagenomic RNA enrichment viral sequencing strategy termed

123

MINERVA (Fig. 1A).

124

metagenomic analysis. Since clinical samples may contain DNA, RNA, and possibly

125

carrier RNA, MINERVA starts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) removal and optional

126

simultaneous carrier RNA removal, followed by DNase I treatment. The remaining RNA

127

is then subject to standard SHERRY. Previously we observed 3’ bias in SHERRY libraries;

128

to address this, we used 10 ng mouse 3T3 cell total RNA as starting material, and tested

129

whether adding random decamers (N10) during RT could improve coverage evenness

130

(Fig. S2). Compared with the standard SHERRY protocol, which uses 1 µM T30VN primer

131

during RT, the supplement of 1 µM N10 indeed improves gene body coverage evenness,

132

presumably by improving the RT efficiency. When the N10 concentration was further

133

increased to 10 µM, we observed almost no coverage bias in the gene body. The high

134

N10 concentration can result in an increased rRNA ratio in the product, sometimes as

135

high as 90%, but MINERVA employs rRNA removal as the first step prior to RT, thus

136

negating this problem. We also performed enzyme titration with homemade and

137

commercial Tn5 transposomes. Based on these N10 and Tn5 titration results, we used

138

10 µM N10 during RT and 0.5 µl V50 for each 20-µl tagmentation reaction in all following

139

experiments. The whole procedure from nucleic acid to metagenomic sequencing-ready

140

library, including wait time, takes 5.5 hours (Fig. S1).

First, we employed a SHERRY-based RNA-seq pipeline for

141
142

For target enrichment, we first quantified SARS-CoV-2 abundance in each metagenomic

143

sequencing library using an N gene qPCR assay, and pooled eight libraries based on

144

quantification results. Then we performed standard in-solution hybridization on the pooled

145

library with biotinylated RNA probes covering the whole viral genome. The enrichment

146

procedure takes 7~13 hours; the entire MINERVA pipeline can be completed within 12~18

149

MINERVA is compatible with COVID-19 samples. To evaluate its performance on

150

clinical samples, we applied MINERVA on 143 samples collected from 91 COVID-19

151

patients, with samples types including pharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, and semen.

152

These patients were admitted to Ditan Hospital within a three-month period from January

153

to April 2020, presenting different symptom severity (Fig. 1B and Table S1-S3). Some

154

patients were re-sampled longitudinally to investigate temporal and intra-host viral

155

heterogeneity. We first tested the effect of sample input volume on MINERVA results.

156

Using just 2.7-ul of sample input led to satisfactory SARS-CoV-2 coverage, and scaling

157

up the reaction volume to 5.4-ul further improved the MINERVA data quality (Fig. 1C).

158

Using the same samples and at the same sequencing depth, more input in a higher

159

reaction volume generated deeper SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage.

160
161

Carrier RNA, which is widely used in viral DNA/RNA extraction before RT-qPCR assays,

162

severely impacts high-throughput sequencing analysis. Therefore, most RT-qPCR

163

positive clinical samples are not amenable to further viral genetic studies. We explored

164

the effect of adding polyT oligos during the rRNA removal step to simultaneously remove

165

spike-in polyA RNA and carrier RNA. By incorporating this step in MINERVA, we

166

successfully avoided the overwhelming representation of unwanted RNA sequences

167

while retaining desired metagenomic and SARS-CoV-2 information (Fig. 1D and 1E).

We

benchmarked MINERVA against conventional dsDL strategies in head-to-head

171

comparisons of the first 79 clinical samples sequenced. On average, we sequenced 1-3

172

Gbp for each MINERVA library, and nearly 100 Gbp for each dsDL library (Fig. S3). The

173

metagenomic compositions of SHERRY and dsDL libraries were comparable: total virus,

174

fungus, and bacteria ratios were highly concordant between the two methods (Fig. S4);

175

bacterial heterogeneity as measured by entropy is also correlated between the two.

176
177

We performed various analyses to explore the metagenomic composition of different

178

samples types, and to assess whether metagenomic signatures correlate with disease

179

severity. First and foremost, we observed that the metagenomic composition of different

180

sample types show body site-specific features. Principle components analysis of bacterial

181

sequences showed a clear separation between stool samples and the other sample types

182

along PC1 (Fig. 2A), and this is reflected in analysis at both the genus and species levels,

183

conveying the unique microbial environment of this body site. This phenomenon is most

184

prominently reflected by the bacterial composition, but is also somewhat reflected in the

185

viral composition (Fig. S5). We then identified the specific microbes that drive this

186

separation of sample types, and found some microbes to be body site-specific. For

187

example, stool samples contained Bacteroides, whereas the pharyngeal and sputum

188

samples were rich in Streptococcus (Fig. 2B and S5); a few samples are highly abundant

189

in known pathogenic species such as Candida, which is only found in orally obtained

190

samples (Fig. S5). There also appears to be separation between samples by COVID-19

191

symptom severity along PC2 (Fig. 2A), which is supported by our analysis of specific

192

microbial species (Fig. 2B). We found the bacterial metagenomic signature could be used

193

to cluster most of the samples from “Critical” patients: samples from severe and critical

194

condition patients are abundant in Pseudomonas, whereas Streptococcus is abundant in

195

less severe condition samples.

196
197

To further explore how bacterial composition reflects disease severity, we computed the

198

bacterial ratio, bacterial species richness, and the Shannon Diversity Index for each

199

sample type, and segmented samples by symptom severity (Fig. S6). Indeed, the

200

bacterial abundance and composition in different sample types generally reflects disease

201

severity. In particular pharyngeal swab samples show a statistically significant difference

202

in bacterial ratio and species richness when comparing critical patients (“critical” group)

203

with non-critical patients (“mild”, “moderate”, and “severe” groups) (Fig. 2C). The

204

Shannon Diversity Index, however, is similar for all disease severities, indicating that

205

although the overall bacterial abundance is reduced in critical patients, the relative

206

abundance of different species remains stable. Interestingly, this phenomenon appears

207

to also correlated with patient age – In elderly patients above the age of 60, both bacterial

208

ratio and species richness are significantly reduced in critical patients as compared to

7

209

non-critical; this trend is not observed in patients younger than 60 years of age (Fig S6).

210

To further assess the relationship between bacterial metagenomic composition and

211

disease severity, we calculated the pairwise Bray-Curtis similarity for pharyngeal swab

212

samples, and found that mild, moderate, and severe patient samples are clustered

213

together and intermixed, while critical samples cluster separately with each other (Fig.

214

2D). The bacterial metagenomic composition is similar among critical patients and

215

suggests that they share common features distinct from non-critical patients. In light of

216

recent studies of the role of host immunity responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients11-

217

14

218

impact of the host immune response on commensal microbes, fungi, and other viruses in

219

the body. Currently, the number of critical patient samples in the younger group is limited,

220

but the trend is worth further investigation as more samples are collected over time.

, our observations of the metagenomic signature could be indicative of the systemic

221
222

In addition to the bacterial metagenomic signature, we also assessed the association

223

between viral composition and disease severity, and found a different trend presented in

224

the viral component. While bacterial abundances are reduced in critical patients as

225

compared to non-critical patients, viral abundances in critical patients are higher than in

226

non-critical patients (Fig. 2E and S7). Also different from the bacterial signature, the viral

227

species richness does not significantly change, but the Shannon diversity of viral species

228

in critical patients is significantly lower (Fig. 2E). This effect is partly contributed by a

229

greater abundance of SARS-Cov-2 sequences, which could then lead to a lower Shannon

230

Index as signals from low abundance viruses could be drowned out. Intriguingly, several

231

other viral families display increased abundance in critical patients as compared to non-

232

critical (Fig. 2F), including many dsDNA viruses that are known to establish latency such

233

as herpesviruses and papillomaviruses. One speculation is that the correlation of

234

abundance of these viral families with disease severity could be due to reactivation of

235

latent viruses under immunosuppressive medication, changes in host immune activity, or

236

direct SARS-CoV-2 activity15-17. The effect of age that we observed for bacteria is less

237

pronounced in viruses (Fig. S8), and is only observed for some viral families. Additional

238

sampling and deeper viral sequencing, as well as systematic experimental designs are

239

needed to further investigate these phenomena.

240
241

For severe viral pneumonia, co-infections can greatly affect patient outcomes18-20. One

242

recent study has showed that 50% of patients with COVID-19 who have died in this

243

pandemic had secondary bacterial infections21. By surveying the metagenomic landscape

244

of these samples, we observed several patient samples with exceptionally high

245

abundance of known pathogens, which could indicate a co-infection with SARS-Cov-2 in

246

those patients. We found ten cases of S. aureus and nine cases of C. albicans co-

247

infections, and the rate of co-infection for both pathogens is generally correlated with

248

disease severity (Fig. 2G).

249
250

MINERVA

achieves

better

SARS-CoV-2

genome

coverage

compared

to

251

conventional dsDL strategies. In both SHERRY and dsDL data, we detected low yet

252

significant levels of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The viral ratio is between 10-7 and 10-1. It is

253

worth noting that the SARS-CoV-2 sequence ratio is higher in SHERRY data than in dsDL

254

data (Fig. 3A and 3B), suggesting that SHERRY libraries capture more SARS-CoV-2

255

sequences. Though SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage and depth was not high in SHERRY

256

results due to low viral ratio and low sequencing depth, performing MINERVA

257

subsequently can enrich the SARS-CoV-2 sequence ratio up to 10,000-fold (Fig. 3C and

258

S9). As a result, MINERVA gives more complete and deeper coverage of SARS-CoV-2

259

genomes (Fig. 3D and 3E), despite sequencing dsDL libraries to two orders of magnitude

260

more depth (Fig. S3).

261
262

The superior quality of MINERVA data became clearer when we included clinical RT-

263

qPCR results. Both dsDL and MINERVA libraries detect SARS-CoV-2 sequences for

264

samples with various Ct values, but MINERVA produced more complete and deeper

265

genome coverage than dsDL methods (Fig. 3F and 3G), and this advantage is more

266

pronounced for low viral load samples, including two samples with negative qPCR results,

267

and stool samples. By studying the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 qPCR results and

268

read ratio, we identified two groups of samples that resulted in low SARS-CoV-2 genome

269

coverage when processed using dsDL (Fig. 3H). The first group had low SARS-CoV-2

270

read ratio, which prohibited the acquisition of enough SARS-CoV-2 sequencing reads.

271

The second group, which included most stool samples, had relatively high SARS-CoV-2

272

Ct values and read ratio, suggesting these samples had low total nucleic acid amount.

273

Since dsDL approaches are less sensitive and require more input, this may explain why

274

MINERVA outperforms dsDL most evidently in stool samples.

275
276

MINERVA can facilitate multiple facets of COVID-19 research. As a novel virus, little

277

is known about the evolutionary features of SARS-CoV-2. Using 143 samples, we

278

constructed a SARS-CoV-2 mutational profile (Fig. 4A), which was distinct from the

279

Guangdong profile22. A few mutation sites, including the two linked to S and L strains23,

280

were found in multiple samples. Aided by the deep genome coverage in MIVERVA data,

281

we not only detected strong linkage between position 8,782 and 28,144, but also

282

observed high concordance of allele frequencies between these two positions.

283

Furthermore, we detected strong linkage and high allele frequency concordance among

284

four other positions, 241, 3,037, 14,408 and 23,403. Such allele frequency information

285

offers additional layers of evidence supporting co-evolution of positions within the SARS-

286

CoV-2 genome, in two distinct groups of samples. It is worth noting that in some samples,

287

not all linked alleles are simultaneously detected, due to low coverage at some positions

288

in those samples; these alleles can indeed be observed at low coverage in the raw data

289

for these samples, but is missing from the post-processing data as they do not pass the

290

stringent quality filtering steps. Nonetheless, the linkage was established by observing

291

such linkage over many samples.

292
293

Several studies have examined the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 across different organs

294

and tissues7. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the reproductive system is still

295

under debate24,25. Aided by the high sensitivity of MINERVA, we detected a high

296

abundance of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in semen samples from COVID-19 patients (Fig.

297

4B); several semen samples also had high SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage. SARS-CoV-

298

2 SNV analysis demonstrated high similarity between semen and non-semen results (Fig.

299

4C).

302

challenging due to the existence of asymptomatic infected individuals26. Though RT-

303

qPCR can be used to identify these individuals, elucidation of the chain of transmission

304

requires the complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences. To evaluate the performance of

305

MINERVA for tracking SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we sequenced the samples of several

306

asymptomatic individuals and their infected family members. SARS-CoV-2 SNV analysis

307

revealed that asymptomatic individuals each harbor viral sequences with unique

308

signatures, however, these individuals are clustered by the viral SNV signature with their

309

respective family members rather than other asymptomatic individuals, which indicates

310

that viral SNVs within infected families are similar to each other and unique from other

311

families (Fig. 4D). Summarily, despite the asymptomatic phenotype of some infected

312

individuals, the viral SNV signature generated by MINERVA can be used to accurately

313

place these individuals in the chain of transmission, enabling better epidemiological

314

tracking.

315
316

Recent studies have identified genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2 and raised the

317

possibility that multiple variants could co-exist in the same host individual. The intra-host

318

SNVs (iSNVs) detected in many samples (Fig. 4A) suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly

319

evolving within the hosts2. Through longitudinal sampling, we confirmed that iSNVs were

320

generally relatively stable across time and body sites (Fig. S10), but found that some

321

patients harbored greater variations in iSNVs (Fig. 4E). For P40 and P41, iSNVs were

322

stable within the same sample type across time, but varied across different sample types.

323

Comparing the two semen samples from Patient 152, changes in iSNV were clearly

324

observed. These results support the co-existence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in the

325

same individual, and further investigation is warranted to understand this phenomenon.

326
327

In summary, MINERVA effectively converts metagenomes and SARS-CoV-2 sequences

328

into sequencing libraries with a simple and quick experimental pipeline, and subsequent

329

target enrichment can further improve SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage and genetic

330

variation detection. MINERVA can facilitate the study of SARS-CoV-2 genetics, and be

331

easily implemented to fight future RNA pathogen outbreaks.

Discussion

334

As of today, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 is still preliminary and much of it extrapolated

335

from past studies of other beta coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. However, the

336

epidemiology, physiology, and biology of COVID-19 are evidently unique27. To speed up

337

our investigation of this virus and the disease it causes, a practical protocol for viral

338

genome research of clinical samples is urgently needed. Currently, methods for

339

transforming clinical samples into sequencing libraries are laborious and painstaking,

340

while clinical personnel at the frontlines are already strained for time and energy.

341

MINERVA minimizes the need for expert technique and hands-on operation; we believe

342

it will be pivotal in accelerating clinical research of SARS-CoV-2.

343
344

Recent evolutionary tracing studies suggest the emergence of multiple novel, evolved

345

subtypes of SARS-CoV-228, including the S/L-subtypes23 and the A/B/C-variants29. New

346

variants will likely continue to emerge as the virus mutates, and to uncover them requires

347

deep, complete coverage of viral genomes from a large number of patients. With the

348

existence of asymptomatic carriers26 and possible recurrent infections in the same

349

individual30, longitudinal re-sampling of patients is also important to uncover intra-host

350

viral heterogeneity, but as viral load decreases with time31, the sensitivity of the sample

351

processing method becomes critical. These studies all require processing large volumes

352

of clinical samples with a highly robust and scalable method that does not compromise

353

on sensitivity. We have demonstrated that MINERVA libraries from clinical samples can

354

generate deep and complete coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that can be used for

355

evolutionary tracing and variant characterization research. Furthermore, the high

356

sensitivity, high coverage, and high depth of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes obtained by

357

MINERVA can reveal unique viral SNV signatures in each patient, even if they are

358

asymptomatic. We showed that these viral SNVs allows families of infected individuals to

359

be co-clustered, but are unique between families, which enables each individual to be

360

accurately placed in the chain of transmission. As MINERVA is easily scalable and

361

implementable in a clinical lab setting, it can serve as a robust strategy for timely and

362

critical epidemiological tracking and monitoring during a pandemic.

364

It is well-established now that SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple organ systems, tissue

365

compartments, and cell types2,7,32,33. In our profiling of COVID-19 clinical samples from

366

multiple body sites of the same patient, we found that the viral load and viral subtypes

367

vary across different body sites, possibly affected by interactions between microbial and

368

other viral species as well as overall metagenomic diversity present in different

369

microenvironments of each body site. The effects of metagenomic diversity and inter-

370

compartment heterogeneity on SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 symptom severity

371

are also not understood. In particular, it is difficult to obtain high-quality unbiased

372

metagenomic using conventional library construction methods from low-quantity samples,

373

as well as samples such as stool in which bacteria dominate the metagenomes, as

374

conventional methods are not sufficiently sensitive. The versatility of MINERVA as a two-

375

part protocol integrating a tailored SHERRY and post-library virus enrichment provides

376

flexibility for sample processing that uses one standard sample pipeline for both highly

377

sensitive metagenomic analysis and targeted deep sequencing of specific transcripts.

378

Using MINERVA, we have demonstrated the first large scale profiling of metagenomic

379

composition of different body sites in the context of COVID-19. One pre-print study

380

investigated the relationship between gut microbes and COVID-19 severity, and

381

purportedly found links between gut microbe composition with blood proteomic

382

biomarkers that predict symptom severity34, however, there is no discussion of

383

metagenomic composition of other body sites. As we show here with MINERVA data from

384

a wide range of sample types, there are large body site-specific differences, and our data

385

suggests that microbial and viral metagenomic composition in pharyngeal swab samples

386

also significantly correlates with disease severity. The metagenomic profile of these other

387

body sites that are arguably more directly involved in the viral infection, have not been

388

reported or investigated elsewhere. Using MINERVA we highlight several new directions

389

of clinical and basic research, and with further investigation, these could shed light on the

390

complex interactions between SARS-CoV-2 pathology, host microbial communities, host

391

immunity, and disease progression. We also showed that MINERVA metagenomic profiles

392

can identify potential co-infections of bacteria, fungi, and other viruses, which is

393

challenging to do with conventional approaches. In our samples, we found a co-infection

394

rate of ~ 20% (16/79 patients), which is higher than the rate reported by one secondary

395

study of COVID-19 co-infections35. In this secondary study, although they found 8% of

396

patients experiencing bacterial/fungal co-infection, the rate of broad spectrum antibiotic

397

use for COVID-19 patients is much higher (72%). It is well-known that co-infections in

398

severe pneumonia can greatly affect patient outcomes19,20, and it is estimated that 50%

399

of patients with COVID-19 who have died in this pandemic had secondary bacterial

400

infections21. Our result shows the utility of MINERVA in identifying non-viral co-infections,

401

and further primary studies using MINERVA could help to elucidate true co-infection rates

402

to guide better strategies for antibiotic use.

403
404

MINERVA was not created to be a rapid diagnostic assay; rather, we hope its ease-of-

405

use, versatility, scalability, sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness will drive adoption of routine

406

sequencing of COVID-19 clinical samples, and thereby facilitate multiple areas of much-

407

needed SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research for clinicians and researchers.

Optimization of SHERRY protocol

654

We used the total RNA extracted from 3T3 cells to optimize experimental protocols. RNA

655

extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat.No.74104). DNA was then

656

removed through DNase I (NEB, Cat.No.M0303) digestion. The resulting total RNA was

657

concentrated by RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, Cat R1015), and its

658

quality was assessed by the Fragment Analyzer Automated CE System (AATI). Its

659

quantification was done by Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen). To optimize the SHERRY protocol,

660

different amount of random decamer (N10) (0, 10, or 100 pmol) was used to set up

661

reverse transcription reactions. Titration of Tn5 transposome (0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 µl Vazyme

662

V50; 0.05 or 0.25 µl home-made pTXB1) was performed in tagmentation procedure. In

663

all tests, 10 ng 3T3 total RNA was used, and all reagents except for N10 or Tn5

664

transposome remain unchanged. All libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500

665

with 2x75 paired-end mode. Clean data was aligned to GRCm38 genome and known

666

transcript annotation using Tophat2 v2.1.1. Ribosome-removed aligned reads were

667

proceeded to calculate FPKM by Cufflinks v2.2.1 and gene body coverage by RSeQC

668

v.2.6.4.

Patients and clinical samples

671

From January 23, 2020 to April 20, 2020, 91 patients were enrolled in this study according

672

to the 7th guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 from the National Health

673

Commission of the People's Republic of China. All patients, diagnosed with COVID-19,

674

were hospitalized in Beijing Ditan Hospital and classified into four severity degrees, mild,

675

moderate, severe, and critical illness, according to the guideline. We collected 143

676

samples (60 pharyngeal swabs, 52 sputum samples, 25 stool samples, and 6 semen

677

samples) from these patients.

RNA extraction and rRNA removal

680

For all the clinical samples, nucleic acids extraction was performed in a BSL-3 laboratory.

681

Samples were deactivated by heating at 56°C for 30 min before extraction. Total RNA

682

was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s

683

instructions. In most samples (79 out of 85) we specifically omitted the use of carrier RNA

684

due to its interference on the most prevalent sample preparation protocols for high-

685

throughput sequencing. After nucleic acids extraction, rRNA was removed by rDNA probe

686

hybridization and RNase H digestion, followed by DNA removal through DNase I digestion,

687

using MGIEasy rRNA removal kit (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The final elution volume was

688

12-20 µl for each sample. For carrier RNA removal tests, 1.7 µg polyA carrier RNA was

689

spiked into 18 µl of elute from QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. To remove the carrier RNA from

690

these spike-in samples and other samples extracted with carrier RNA, 2 µg poly(T) 59-

691

mer (T59) oligo was added during the rDNA hybridization step.

692
693

dsDL Metagenomic RNA library construction and sequencing

694

The libraries were constructed using MGIEasy reagents (BGI, China) following

695

manufacture’s instruction. The purified RNA, after rRNA depletion and DNA digestion,

696

underwent reverse transcription, second strand synthesis, and sequencing adaptor

697

ligation. After PCR amplification, DNA was denatured and circularized before being

698

sequenced on DNBSEQ-T7 sequencers (BGI, China).

699
700

MINERVA library preparation

701

Totally, 2.7 µl RNA from rRNA and DNA removal reaction was used for standard SHERRY

702

reverse transcription, with the following modifications: 1) 10 pmol random decamer (N10)

703

was added to improve coverage; 2) initial concentrations of dNTPs and oligo-dT (T30VN)

704

were increased to 25 mM and 100 µM, respectively. For 5.4 µl and 10.8 µl input, the entire

705

reaction was simply scaled up 2 and 4 folds, respectively. The RNA/DNA hybrid was

706

tagmented in TD reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% DMF)

707

supplemented with 3.4% PEG8000 (VWR Life Science, Cat.No.97061), 1 mM ATP (NEB,

708

Cat.No. P0756), and 1U/µl RNase inhibitor (TaKaRa, Cat.No. 2313B). The reaction was

709

incubated at 55°C for 30 min. 20 µl tagmentation product was mixed with 20.4 µl Q5 High-

710

Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB, Cat.No. M0492L), 0.4 µl SuperScript II reverse transcriptase,

711

and incubated at 42°C for 15 min to fill the gaps, followed by 70°C for 15 min to inactivate

712

SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Then index PCR was performed by adding 4 µl 10

713

µM unique dual index primers and 4 µl Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, with the following

714

thermo profile: 98°C 30 s, 18 cycles of [98°C 20 s, 60°C 20 s, 72°C 2 min], 72°C 5 min.

715

The PCR product was then purified with 0.8x VAHTS DNA Clean Beads (Vazyme, Cat.

716

No. N411). These SHERRY libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 with 2x75

717

paired-end mode for metagenomic analysis.

718

For preparing MINERVA libraries through SARS-CoV-2 enrichment, 1µl SHERRY

719

metagenomic library was first quantified with N gene using quantitative PCR (F:

720

GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT, R: CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG) after 1:200

721

dilution, then multiple libraries were pooled together based on qPCR results and

722

processed with TargetSeq One Cov Kit (iGeneTech, Cat.No.502002-V1) following

723

manufacturer’s instruction. The iGeneTech Blocker was replaced by the IDT xGen

724

Universal Blockers (NXT). These MINERVA libraries were sequenced on Illumina

725

NextSeq 500 with 2x75 paired-end mode for deep SARS-CoV-2 analysis.

726
727

Data processing

728

For metagenomic RNA-seq data, raw reads were quality controlled using BBmap (version

729

38.68) and mapped to the human genome reference (GRCh38) using STAR (version

730

2.6.1d) with default parameters. All unmapped reads were collected using samtools

731

(version 1.3) for microbial taxonomy assignment by Centrifuge (version 1.0.4). Custom

732

reference was built from all complete bacterial, viral and any assembled fungal genomes

733

downloaded from NCBI RefSeq database (viral and fungal genomes were downloaded

734

on February 4th, 2020, and bacterial genomes were downloaded on November 14th,

735

2018). There were 11,174 bacterial, 8,997 viral, and 308 fungal genomes respectively.

736

Bacterial Shannon diversity (entropy) was calculated at species level, and the species

737

abundance was measured based on total reads assigned at the specific clade normalized

738

by genome size and sequencing depth. Bacterial genus composition was analyzed based

739

on reads proportion directly assigned by Centrifuge. For dsDL sequencing data, sub-

740

sampling was performed for each sample to obtain ~12M paired-end nonhuman reads,

741

which is the median of SHERRY datasets. Same workflow was performed as described

742

above for the removal of human reads and microbial taxonomy assignment.

743

For SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis, raw reads were trimmed to remove sequencing

744

adaptors and low-quality bases with Cutadapt v1.15. BWA 0.7.15-r1140 was used to align

745

reads to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2). Then we removed

746

duplicates from the primary alignment with Picard Tools v2.17.6. We used mpileup

747

function in samtools v1.10 to call SNP and InDel with parameter -C 50 -Q 30 -q 15 -E -d

748

0. We called mutation if the depth >=10 and strand bias >0.25. The strand bias is defined

749

as the value that minimum of positive strand depth and negative strand depth divided by

750

the maximum.
