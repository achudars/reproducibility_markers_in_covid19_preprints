Abstract
The aim of this study is to understand adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of B cell
epitope and neutralizing activity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We obtained serum from
thirteen COVID-19 patients. Most individuals revealed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 assessed by
a pseudotype virus-neutralizing assay. The antibody production against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) or
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was elevated, with large individual differences, as assessed
by ELISA. In the analysis of the predicted the linear B cell epitopes, two regions (671-690 aa. and 1146-1164
aa.), which were located in S1 and S2 but not in the RBD, were highly reactive with the sera from patients. In
the further analysis of the B cell epitope within the S protein by utilizing a B cell epitope array, a hot spot in
the N-terminal domain of the S protein but not the RBD was observed in individuals with neutralizing activity.
Overall, the analysis of antibody production and B cell epitopes of the S protein from patient serum may
provide a novel target for the vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented health crisis that was declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organization (WHO) (Wang et al, 2020). To fight against COVID-19, the rapid development
of a vaccine is required. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus, and SARS-CoV-1 and Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two highly pathogenic viruses (Lu et al, 2020; Chan
et al, 2020; Wu et al, 2020a). The spike glycoprotein (S) on the SARS-CoV-2 surface plays an essential role
in receptor binding and virus entry, and previous studies on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have revealed the
importance of the S protein as a potential antigen target for vaccines (Lu et al, 2015; Wu et al, 2020b;
Hoffmann et al, 2020). The S protein has been found to induce robust and protective humoral and cellular
immunity, including the development of neutralizing antibodies and T cell-mediated immunity (Vabret et al,
2020; Du et al, 2009).
To understand the immune response to COVID-19, the analysis of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells is required. Grifoni et al (2020b) recently demonstrated that using HLA class I and II predicted peptide
‘megapools’, circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were identified in ~70% and 100% of
COVID-19 convalescent patients, respectively. CD4+ T cell responses to S protein were robust and correlated
with the magnitude of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA titers. Importantly, the antibody titer for the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein correlated well with an increase in spike-specific CD4+ T cell
responses but not non-Spike-specific CD4+ T cell responses. In other reports, RBD-specific antiviral T cell
responses have also been detected in people who have recovered from COVID-19 (Vabret et al, 2020).
Here, we addressed the humoral immune response by measuring antibody production against S
protein and the neutralizing ability in convalescent patients from two different hospitals. In addition, the B
cell epitope of S protein was analyzed by peptide epitope array. These results will assist vaccine design and
evaluation of candidate vaccines.

Results
Antibody production and neutralizing activity in thirteen serum samples
To investigate the humoral immunoreaction to SARS-CoV-2, we assessed 13 serum samples collected from
COVID-19 patients. Out of 13 patients, seven patients were in the intensive care unit of Osaka University
Hospital (OU samples), and six patients were in Osaka City Juso Hospital (Ju samples). To estimate the
existence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we performed 75% plaque-reduction neutralization tests
(PRNT75) using pseudotyped VSVs. At an evaluation point of the PRNT75 (Fig 1 and Table 1), we confirmed
neutralizing activity in most of the samples, especially high in OU #2, #3, and #6; however, in a few samples
(OU #5 and #7 and Ju #3), neutralizing activity was not detected. We speculate that the disease phase and
severity of patients may be correlated with these neutralizing activities because most of the patients in Osaka
University Hospital are treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and are more severe than those in Juso Osaka
City Hospital.
We also tested serum samples with several antibody test kits as a screening test for SARS-CoV-2specific IgG or IgM antibodies. Table 1 shows that most of the samples tested positive for IgG and were
correlated with neutralizing antibody activity, except for a few samples (OU #7 and Ju #3). The results of the
IgM antibody test, in contrast, varied among antibody test kits.
In the analysis of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, we focused on portions of S protein, such
as the S1 subunit, S2 subunit, and RBD in the S1 subunit, as candidate antigens. ELISA showed that several
sera collected from COVID-19 patients strongly reacted with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins (Table 2
and Appendix Table S1), and we selected spike S1+S2 recombinant protein from Beta Lifescience and RBD
recombinant protein from Beta Lifescience for further experiments. As shown in Fig 2A and 2B, increased
antibody titers to spike (S1+S2) IgG were observed in most of the COVID-19 patients; however, this increase
was not observed in a few patients. Interestingly, one sample (#6) from a patient in Osaka University Hospital
indicated an extremely high titer of antibody. The average antibody titer of the patients in Osaka University
Hospital was higher than that of the patients in Juso Osaka City Hospital. We speculate that the disease phase
and severity of patients may be also correlated with the total anti-spike IgG titer because most of the patients
in Osaka University Hospital were treated in the ICU and were more severe than those in Juso Osaka City

Hospital. We additionally analyzed the IgM and IgG subclasses of anti-spike (S1+S2) antibodies. IgG1 was
mainly detected, and IgG3 was less detected (Fig 2C and 2D). Neither IgG2 nor IgG4 were detected (Appendix
Fig S1A and S1B). Compared with the IgG titer, the IgM titer was much lower in all of the patients (Fig 2E
and 2F) because all of the samples were obtained from the patients in the recovery phase, not in the acute
phase.
Since the RBD in the S1 subunit is the major target for neutralizing antibodies, we next focused on
anti-spike RBD antibodies. Similarly, an increased IgG titer but not IgM titer was observed in most of the
samples (Fig 2G, 2H, 2K, and 2L). Interestingly, the average anti-spike RBD IgG titer of the patients in Osaka
University Hospital was lower than that of the patients in Juso Osaka City Hospital, which was the opposite
result from the anti-spike (S1+S2) IgG titer. We speculate that anti-RBD antibody titers may be correlated
with good progression because some of the patients in Juso Osaka City Hospital recovered and were in the
convalescent phase. In terms of IgG subclasses, IgG1 was mainly detected, and IgG3 was less detected (Fig
2I and 2J), but neither IgG2 nor IgG4 were detected (Appendix Fig S1C and S1D).

Analysis of B cell epitopes in S protein in thirteen serum samples
Furthermore, we predicted linear B cell epitopes by BepiPred-2.0, a prediction tool of B cell epitopes
assessed by the characterization of amino acid sequences. Five regions (AH-531, 346-365 aa.; AH-526, 413432 aa.; AH-527, 442-460 aa.; AH-532, 491-509 aa.; and AH-533, 518-537 aa.) were selected from the RBD,
and three regions (AH-528, 146-164 aa.; AH-529, 671-690 aa.; and AH-530, 1146-1164 aa.) were selected
from other regions (Fig 3A and Appendix Table S2). In the analysis of IgG (Fig 3B), two regions, AH-529
(including the S1/S2 cleavage site) and AH-530 (heptad repeat 2, HR2), reacted with sera from most of the
patients. Four regions of the RBD (AH-526, AH-527, AH-532 and AH-533) mildly reacted with sera from
some of the patients, and the other regions, AH-528 (N-terminal domain, NTD) and AH-531 (RBD), did not
react. In the analysis of IgM (Fig 3C), in contrast, four regions (AH-526, AH-527, AH-529, and AH-530)
mildly reacted with sera from some of the patients, and the other four regions hardly reacted.
We further evaluated the linear B cell epitope within spike protein using a CelluSpots peptide array
composed of a series of 15-mer peptides overlapping by five amino acids (i.e., 1-15 aa., 5-20 aa., 10-25 aa.,

etc.). The lists and maps of the top 20 peptides with high intensity values for each sample (Fig 4 and Table 3)
show that a large number of strongly binding B cell epitopes were located in the regions outside the RBD,
such as the NTD, fusion peptide (FP), HR2 and cytoplasm domain (CP). For instance, several strongly binding
epitopes in samples OU #1, #2, and #6 were located in the CP, NTD, and FP, respectively. Moreover, we
evaluated the linear B cell epitope within nucleocapsid, membrane and envelope proteins using a CelluSpots
peptide array. As shown in Appendix Table S3, most of the strongly binding B cell epitopes were located in
nucleocapsid protein.

Discussion
Here, we report a screening and validation of predicted B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 utilizing human serum
from convalescing COVID-19 patients. We focused on S protein, especially on the RBD, because it has been
reported that anti-RBD antibodies correlate well with an increase in spike-specific CD4+ T cell responses.
In the present study, patient sera were obtained from two different hospitals. Osaka University
Hospital primarily admits severe patients requiring the ICU, and patient status might be in the subacute phase.
Juso Osaka City Hospital, in contrast, usually admits mild or moderate patients, and patient status might be in
the convalescent phase. Interestingly, the average antibody titer to S protein was higher in samples from Osaka
University Hospital, which was consistent with the high titers in severe patients. Of importance, several
patients possessed neutralizing activity with a high titer of IgG for S protein, which may suggest the functional
importance of IgG for S protein as neutralizing antibodies. In addition, based on previous findings (Grifoni et
al, 2020b), these results also suggest that the antibody titer to the RBD of S protein may predict an increase
in spike-specific CD4+ T cell responses.
Antibodies targeting the RBD and S protein have enhanced potential for providing cross-protective
immunity. The bioinformatics approach has been rapidly reported to identify potential B and T cell epitopes
in S protein, which has provided data regarding antigen presentation, antibody-binding properties, and the
predicted evolution of epitopes (Ahmed et al, 2020; Baruah & Bose, 2020; Bhattacharya et al, 2020; Grifoni
et al, 2020a; Zheng & Song, 2020). A list of glycoprotein amino acid positions having a high probability of

predicted B cell epitopes has been compiled. Based on the location of the relevant amino acid positions in the
model structure, several epitope regions were predicted, i.e., 491-505 aa. and 558-562 aa. in the RBD, and the
calculated surface of the amino acid residues of B cell epitopes are shown, i.e., 491-505 aa. and 558-562 aa.
in the RBD and 1140-1146 aa. in other regions. We also performed predictions for linear B cell epitopes by
BepiPred 2.0, the characterization of amino acids and the predicted structure. Seven regions (346-365 aa.,
413-432 aa., 442-460 aa., 491-509 aa., and 518-537 aa. in the RBD and 671-690 aa. and 1146-1164 aa. in
other regions) were prepared as B cell epitopes, which partially overlapped with previous reports (Ahmed et
al, 2020; Baruah & Bose, 2020; Bhattacharya et al, 2020; Grifoni et al, 2020a; Zheng & Song, 2020). In this
study, antibodies against the RBD were not evident, and only a few antibodies recognized these B cell epitopes
in the RBD. These results indicate that the RBD region of S protein is not highly immunogenic, and the
neutralizing antibodies against the RBD region may not be evident in individuals with COVID-19.
In this study, we evaluated linear B cell epitopes within nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein and
envelope protein using a CelluSpots peptide array. Consistent with previous findings (Chow et al, 2006), most
of the strongly binding B cell epitopes were located in nucleocapsid protein. These results suggest that
nucleocapsid protein may be more immunogenic than S protein. However, a detailed analysis of antibody
production by peptide array for S protein showed us possible candidate antigens in addition to the RBD. A
few individuals (#2, #3, and #4) possessed neutralizing antibodies and showed several strongly binding
epitopes in the NTD of S protein. Interestingly, Chie et al (2020) recently reported that a neutralizing human
antibody binds to the NTD of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 but does not block the interaction between ACE2 and
S protein. In their structural model, the monoclonal antibody interacts with the five loops for the NTD,
especially between N3 (141-156 aa.) and N5 (246-260 aa.), and three glycosylation sites (Asn17, Asn61, and
Asn149) were identified in this structure. Interestingly, as shown in Table 3, several epitopes in #2, #3, and #4
overlapped these regions in the NTD. Although our predicted epitope in the NTD (AH-528; 146-164 aa) did
not react with the sera from the individuals in this study, we speculate that the NTD in S protein may be
another candidate region for neutralizing antibodies.
As a study limitation, this study protocol has been approved to analyze only human serum samples
without any clinical information. Because the onset of infection or severity of patients cannot be known, we

cannot discuss the time course of antibodies with the clinical status of the patients. Although the magnitude
of IgG production might be dependent on the duration of COVID-19, we can evaluate the dominant B cell
epitope of each patient. There have been concerns regarding vaccine enhancement of disease by certain
candidate COVID-19 vaccine approaches via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This phenomenon is
observed when non-neutralizing virus-specific IgG facilitates entry of virus particles into Fc-receptorexpressing cells, leading to inflammatory activation of macrophages and monocytes (Taylor et al, 2015). A
study in SARS-CoV-1-infected rhesus macaques found that anti-S IgG contributes to severe acute lung injury
(ALI) and massive accumulation of monocytes/macrophages in the lung (Liu et al, 2019). To avoid this
phenomenon, a specific neutralizing antibody is required, which can also be achieved by a B cell epitope
vaccine. Therefore, we speculate that the next generation of vaccines for COVID-19 should consider the B
cell epitope in terms of safety and efficiency.
In summary, we conducted full B cell epitope mapping and validated the predicted B cell epitope of
S protein, utilizing human sera from patients with COVID-19. Based on the analysis of neutralizing activity,
anti-S antibodies might be correlated with the neutralizing action of the antibodies. The results may provide a
novel target for the vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods
Production of pseudotyped VSVs with S protein and transfection experiments
Pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) and recombinant VSVs in which the G gene is replaced by
a foreign reporter gene, such as luciferase, were generated. Either 293T or BHK cells were grown to 90%
confluence on 35-mm tissue culture plates. The cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding
the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. After incubation at
room temperature for 1 h, the cells were transfected with helper plasmids, pBS-N, pBS-P, pBS-L, and pBS-G,
and template plasmids, pVSVΔG–Luci, using a cationic liposome reagent. After 4 h, the supernatants were
replaced with 10% FBS DMEM, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The supernatants were then
filtered through a 0.22-μm pore-size filter to remove vaccinia virus and were applied to 293T or BHK cells
that had been transfected with pCAGVSVG 24 h previously. Recovery of the virus was assessed by examining

the cells for the cytopathic effects that are typical of a VSV infection after 24 h. Stocks of *G-complemented
viruses, i.e., VSVΔG virus or recombinant viruses transiently bearing VSV G protein on the virion surface,
were grown from a single plaque on BHK cells transfected with pCAGVSVG and then stored at −80°C. The
infectious titers of the recovered viruses were determined by a plaque assay. To generate pseudotype virus,
293T, BHK, or some other type of cells that exhibit a high competency of transfection were transfected with
a plasmid expressing the envelope protein using a cationic liposome reagent. After 24 h of incubation at 37°C,
cells were infected at an MOI of 0.5 with *G-VSVΔG–Luci. The virus was adsorbed for 2 h at 37°C and then
extensively washed four times or more with serum-free DMEM. After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, the culture
supernatants were collected, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and stored at −80°C. To generate pseudotype
VSVs bearing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we transfected an expression plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 S
protein. The pseudotype VSVs was prepared as described previously (Tani et al, 2007). Pseudotyped particles
were harvested 24 h post-inoculation and clarified from cellular debris by centrifugation. For transfection,
target cells were grown in 96-well plates until they reached 50-75% confluency before they were inoculated
with the respective pseudotyped VSV.

Serum samples
The serum samples of COVID-19 patients were obtained from Osaka University Hospital and Osaka City Juso
Hospital. The protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Osaka University Hospital (No. 19546).
Control serum was obtained from pooled human serum (#BJ11787, Tennessee Blood Services, TN, USA)
mixed from five males and five females, which were collected in February 2019 and confirmed to be
noninfected.

Antibody test kits
SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies of serum samples collected from COVID-19 patients were
detected using a rapid immunochromatographic test for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (IgM; RFNC001, IgG; RF-NC002, KURABO, Japan), a 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM detection kit (C6603C, Vazyme, China),
a COVID-19 Human IgM/IgG Rapid Test (DC0301, Abnova, Taiwan), and a coronavirus (COVID-19)

IgM/IgG rapid test kit (CG-CoV-IgM/IgG, RayBiotech, GA, USA), according to the manufacturers’
instructions.

Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 peptides
Based on high antigenicity analysis of the three-dimensional predicted structure and B cell epitope information
(BepiPred-2.0), eight different antigenic peptides were selected from the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV2 (Fig 3A and Appendix Table S2). The synthetic peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC (>98% purity)
(Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan.). The synthetic SARS-CoV-2 peptide was reconstituted at 5 mg/ml in
sterile PBS and stored below −20°C.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins, such as Recombinant 2019-nCoV Spike S1+S2 Protein (ECD; Beta
Lifescience), Recombinant 2019-nCoV Spike Protein (RBD; Beta Lifescience), and other recombinant
proteins (Appendix Table S1), were diluted in 50 mM carbonate buffer to a concentration of 1 μg/ml and
coated at 50 ng/well on 96-well ELISA plates (MaxiSorp Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., Japan)
overnight at 4°C. Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 peptides (Appendix Table S2; Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan)
were diluted to a concentration of 10 μg/ml and coated at 500 ng/well. After blocking with 100 μl of sheep
serum (16070-096, Gibco), the sera from COVID-19 patients were serially diluted from 10- to 31,250-fold in
blocking buffer, added to each well, and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing each well with 0.05% PBS
Tween-20 (PBS-T), the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies
specific for human IgG (1:10,000; AP004, Binding Site, U.K.) or IgM (1:5,000; AP012, Binding Site) with
PBS containing 5% skim milk for 3 h at room temperature. For the IgG subclass determination assay, antihuman IgG subclass-specific HRP-conjugated antibodies (1:10,000; IgG1 (AP006), IgG2 (AP007), IgG3
(AP008), and IgG4 (AP009), Binding Site) were used. After washing the wells with PBS-T, color was
developed with the peroxidase chromogenic substrate 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma Aldrich,
MO, USA), and the reactions were terminated with 0.9 N sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450
nm using an iMark microplate absorbance reader (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and analyzed with MPM6 version 6.1

in PBS containing 5% skim milk overnight at 4°C on an orbital shaker, incubated with diluted serum samples
(1:10) overnight at 4°C on an orbital shaker, washed with PBS-T buffer with 0.05% Tween-20, and incubated
with diluted HRP-conjugated antibodies specific for human IgG (1:10,000; AP004, Binding Site) for 3 h at
room temperature. A chemiluminescent signal visualized by Chemi-Lumi One L (07880-70, Nacalai Tesque)
was detected with a ChemiDoc Touch imaging system (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with Image Lab software
version 6.0.1 (Bio-Rad).

Statistical analyses
All values are presented as the mean ± SEM. The statistical significance of differences between two groups
was assessed by two-tailed unpaired t-test. A difference was considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism GraphPad version 6.07 (GraphPad Software).

Problem
To fight against COVID-19, the rapid development of a vaccine is required. For this puroise, it is important
to understand adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of antibody production in coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The spike glycoprotein (S) protein has been found to induce robust and
protective humoral and cellular immunity, including the development of neutralizing antibodies and T cellmediated immunity. We obtained serum from thirteen COVID-19 patients in Osaka University Hospital and
Juso Osaka City Hospital who were diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we addressed
the humoral immune response by measuring antibody production against S protein and the neutralizing ability
in convalescent patients from two different hospitals.

Results
We analyzed the neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 assessed by a pseudotype virus-neutralizing
assay. Most individuals revealed neutralizing activity; however, they were not observed in a few patients. The
antibody production against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARSCoV-2 was elevated, with large individual differences, as assessed by ELISA. The titer for anti-S IgG in
patients from Osaka University Hospital was relatively higher than that of anti-RBD antibodies in patients
from Juso Osaka City Hospital. However, the titer for anti-RBD antibodies was higher in patients from Juso
Osaka City Hospital. As most of the patients in Osaka University Hospital were cared for in the intensive care

unit, the disease phase or severity may affect their titers. We also predicted the linear B cell epitopes assessed
by the characterization of the predicted amino acid structure. Two regions (671-690 aa. and 1146-1164 aa.),
which were located in S1 and S2 but not in the RBD, were highly reactive with the sera from patients.

Impact
The analysis of antibody production and B cell epitopes of the S protein from patient serum provided important
information for the protective effect against SAR-CoV-2. Although the magnitude of IgG production might
be dependent on the duration of COVID-19, we can evaluate the dominant B cell epitope of each patient.
We further addressed the B cell epitope within the S protein by utilizing a B cell epitope array. Although there
were large individual differences, a hot spot in the N-terminal domain of the S protein but not the RBD was
observed in individuals with neutralizing activity. These results provided a novel target for the vaccine
development against SARS-CoV-2.
