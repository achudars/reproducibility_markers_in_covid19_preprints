ABSTRACT (172):

47

Infections with SARS-CoV-2 lead to mild to severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)

48

with systemic symptoms. Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory

49

system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is

50

observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.

51

To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used

52

mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed

53

of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.

54

Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral

55

loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the

56

adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus

57

replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are

58

damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to

59

overbear.

60

In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the

61

epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g.,

62

by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier

63

function and viral dissemination.

INTRODUCTION

67

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly

68

pathogenic virus causing severe respiratory infections, described as coronavirus

69

disease-19 (COVID-19) (Bar-On et al., 2020). Patients suffer from various symptoms as

70

fever, cough, breath shortness, headache, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal

71

symptoms. Hallmarks of severe COVID-19 courses are pneumonia, pulmonary

72

edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure. In

73

most patients, the disease has a mild course, but in some cases, e.g., elderly with

74

comorbidities, the infection can develop into a life-threatening condition. In particular

75

preexisting lung pathologies and systemic diseases such as diabetes predispose to

76

severe infection courses described by George et al. (2020).

77

Clinical studies revealed that the virus primarily replicates in the lung, which can

78

cause severe lung damage up to necrotic destruction of large areas of the lung tissue

79

(Carsana et al., 2020). In autopsies of deceased COVID-19 patients, it has been

80

observed that particularly in severe cases viral particles can disseminate throughout

81

the body (Deinhardt-Emmer et al., 2020b; Wichmann et al., 2020). Additionally,

82

systemic complications have been reported, such as the massive release of

83

proinflammatory cytokines and thromboembolic events in various organs (Becker,

84

2020). Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 is regarded as a pneumotropic virus that infects the

85

patient via the lung but can also cause a systemic infection that affects different organs

86

with a high mortality rate.

87

Little is known about the initial infection process in the alveolar lung tissue,

88

particularly about mechanisms that destroy the lung and mechanisms that allow the

89

virus to affect different organs in the body. Infection models that closely reflect the

90

patient's situation are mainly lacking in part due to the challenges to infect mice and

91

the difficulty of accessing and analyzing infected human alveolar lung cells. Up to

92

now, SARS-CoV-2 infection models have been mainly performed with human airway

93

(non-alveolar) cells or non-human cell lines that naturally express the ACE2 viral

94

receptor, such as the African Green Monkey Vero 76 cell line (Hoffmann et al., 2020).

95

These cells lack organ- and species-specific characteristics of human lung epithelial

96

cells. For this purpose, cancerous lung epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells), can at least to some

97

extent, reflect the response of the lung epithelium to viral infection (Bestle et al., 2020).

98

In our study, we present a human-specific in vitro, alveolus-on-a-chip model

99

composed of cells of human origin susceptible for a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This model

100

was only recently developed in our lab (Deinhardt-Emmer et al., 2020a). Within the

101

present study, it was modified by using SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells (Calu-

102

3 cells). The epithelial and vascular (primarily isolated human umbilical vascular

103

endothelial cells; HUVECs) cells were co-cultured with macrophages (primarily

104

isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBMCs) resembling the human alveolus

105

architecture and function. This composition is not only relevant for the gas exchange

106

but also for an adequate immune response.

107

We were able to show that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the epithelial layer while

108

inducing an acute and robust inflammatory response followed by the destruction of

109

the epithelial layer. Interestingly, in this infection scenario, the endothelial cells were

110

not invaded by SARS-CoV-2 and did not propagate the virus, but nevertheless the

111

epithelial/endothelial barrier integrity was disrupted.

RESULTS

115

Efficient SARS-CoV-2 isolation from patients and propagation in cell-culture

116

To gain fully infectious viral particles for our studies, we collected three respiratory

117

specimens from qRT-PCR-proven COVID-19 patients and performed SARS-CoV-2

118

propagation in cell culture systems (Vero-76 cells). By repeated infection of host cells

119

and viral replication, we were able to isolate high viral titers originating from three

120

different patients. Within our studies, the SARS-CoV-2 isolates SARS-CoV-

121

2/hu/Germany/Jena-vi005159/2020

122

vi005187/2020 (5587) and SARS-CoV-2/hu/Germany/Jena-vi005588/2020 (5588) were

123

employed. Sequencing of virus isolates verified that all three viral strains belong to

124

SARS-CoV-2 (species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, genus

125

Betacoronavirus) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020). Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close

126

relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to the SARS-related coronaviruses RaTG13, bat-SL-

127

CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45 (Figure 1A). Within the SARS-CoV-2 clade, the

128

sequences of strains 5587 and 5588 exhibit two base substitutions T8,782C (nsp1ab:

129

synonymous) and C28,144T (nsp8: S84L), which are characteristic of the all strains of

130

lineage L ((Tang et al., 2020) nomenclature) or lineage B ((Rambaut et al., 2020)

131

nomenclature). Accordingly, 5587 and 5588 clustered with lineage L/lineage B strains

(5159),

132

in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1B). Furthermore, both strains exhibit deletion of

133

nsp1ab D448 and two synonymous substitutions (T514C, C5512T). Beside the nsp8

134

S84L substitution, strain 5159 has accumulated three additional amino acid

135

substitutions (S: D614G, nsp1ab: P4715L and N: R203K/G204R) which place this virus

136

in lineage B.1.1 according to the proposed SARS-CoV-2 nomenclature of Rambaut et

137

al. (2020) (Figure 1B).

138
139

Mono-culture cells can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and produce replication

140

complexes at ER-derived membranes.

141

At first, we infected mono-cell culture systems with SARS-CoV-2 and compared the

142

infection rate between Vero-76 cells and Calu-3 cells. It is already well known that

143

Vero-76 cells can be efficiently infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Shang

144

et al., 2020). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we could demonstrate

145

that Vero-76 cells host and efficiently propagate the virus (Figure 2A). Figure 2A

146

(upper panel) illustrates infected Vero-76 cell containing viral replication organelles.

147

In the lower-left panel, protein accumulation and generation of double-membrane

148

vesicles are visible. In the middle panel, virion assembly in the ER–Golgi-intermediate

149

compartment (ERGIC) and a Golgi complex are imaged containing morphologically

150

complete viral particles. Here, the particles are packed to be transported to the cellular

151

surface for virus release, which is demonstrated in the right panel. Some particles are

152

still attached to the host cell membrane, whereas some viral particles are already fully

153

released. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 induces replication complexes at ER6

154

derived membranes, which were already shown for other types of coronaviruses

155

(Stertz et al., 2007) and also confirm the findings for Vero E6 cells (Ogando et al., 2020).

156

To better mimic the situation in the human pulmonary alveoli, we performed the

157

infection in Calu-3 cells. In Figure 2B, immunofluorescence measurements compare

158

infected Vero-76 cells with infected Calu-3 cells. In both cell types, viral particles can

159

be visualized to a similar extent using specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike

160

proteins. These results are confirmed by western blot analysis, demonstrating

161

increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the cell lysates after 8h and 24h

162

(Figure 2C).

163

Additionally, we could verify progeny virus particles by performing plaque assays

164

from supernatants of both cell types indicating increased replication during ongoing

165

infection (Figure 2D). Measuring viral RNA-loads in different infected host cell types,

166

we found high RNA levels in Vero-76 and Calu-3 cells (Figure S1A). By contrast,

167

HUVEC mono-cell cultures could not be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S1B).

168

We further analyzed the host response to the infection by measuring the cytokine

169

mRNA expression of Calu-3 cells. 24h post-infection, many inflammatory cytokines

170

were significantly increased compared to control cells (Figure 3). These results reflect

171

the high cytokine levels found in COVID-19 patients (Costela-Ruiz et al., 2020),

172

indicating that infected epithelial cells contribute to the “cytokine storm” in severe

173

COVID-19 cases. Since different cytokines and chemokines are involved in the

174

infection process, a robust immune response has been associated with a severe clinical

175

course (Coperchini et al., 2020). Our results clearly show that the epithelial cell line

176

Calu-3 can be efficiently infected by SARS-CoV-2, propagates the virus and answer to

177

the viral infection with a strong cytokine release.

178
179

SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells within the alveolus-on-a-chip model causing a

180

strong IFN-response

181

In the next step, we modified our alveolar-on-a-chip model (Deinhardt-Emmer et al.,

182

2020a) by seeding Calu-3 cells on the epithelial side, primarily isolated HUVECs on

183

the endothelial side and integrated PBMCs to represent the immune response.

184

However, macrophages not show an productive viral replication (Yip et al., 2014), they

185

are mainly involved in inflammatory response (Kumar et al., 2020).

186

The applied system is ventilated and perfused and can be infected with SARS-CoV-2

187

via the epithelial side. Using the viral particles isolated from the three COVID-19

188

patients’ specimens, an infection by SARS-CoV-2 on the epithelial cells was proven

189

and the viral particles were propagated (Figure 4A). This effect was still visible after

190

40h post-infection (Figure S2A). In response to the infection the epithelial cells reacted

191

with a robust cytokine response, demonstrated by elevated IFN-levels in the cell

192

culture supernatants of the epithelial side (Figure 4C).

193

In general, the production of IFN is the most efficient way of fighting viral infections;

194

e.g. secretion of type I IFN (IFN-/) exhibits direct antiviral effects by inhibiting viral

195

replication (Thiel and Weber, 2008) among many other interferon effects that promote

196

the immune response to infection (Kindler 2016). Yet, evasion strategies for different

197

types of coronaviruses have been described. The viruses express factors and posses

198

strategies to inhibit IFN induction/expression (Thoms et al., 2020) or IFN signaling or

199

to increase IFN resistance, which is reviewed by E. Kindler et al. (2016). Consequently,

200

SARS-CoV-2 is apparently able to cope with the interferon response of epithelial cells,

201

which is reflected by our measurements, demonstrating efficient viral replication and

202

persistence for up to 40h despite a strong epithelial interferon response (Figure 3 and

203

4).

204

By contrast, we did not detect viral propagation and did not measure an interferon

205

response at the endothelial side of the biochip (Figure 4C). We could not visualize viral

206

components within endothelial cells neither at 28h (Figure 4B) nor at 40h post-infection

207

(Figure S2B) demonstrating that the viral particles do not productively infect

208

endothelial cells in the human alveolus-on-a-chip model. Additionally, endothelial

209

mono-cell culture systems could not be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S1A, B)

210

confirming the cell-type specificity of the viral pathogens for lung epithelial cells. This

211

is in line with in vivo studies that describe only a weak IFN-response in the serum of

212

COVID-patients (Hu et al., 2020). In animal models with mouse-adapted SARS virus a

213

delayed onset of the IFN-response resulting in immune dysregulation was described

214

(Channappanavar et al., 2016). The weak and delayed IFN-levels in the serum are

215

probably due to the host cell specificity of SARS-CoV-2, as lung epithelium represents

216

the main infection focus and endothelial cells are only hardly/not infected.

217

Taken together, these results indicate that endothelial cells of the lung model are not

218

the primary target cells of SARS-CoV-2 which is in agreement with previous studies

219

(Bar-On et al., 2020). Further, it is in line with the observation that endothelial layer of

220

the alveolar capillaries of deceased COVID-19 patients were still intact but epithelial

221

tissue was found seriously damaged (Deinhardt-Emmer et al., 2020b). Although the

222

mechanism is not clear the increased proinflammatory cytokine release might cause

223

an endothelial dysfunction. In addition to the origin of endothelial cells from different

224

organs,

225

susceptible to be infected as recently described (Huertas et al., 2020; Pons et al., 2020).

226

There is clinical evidence for severe courses of COVID-19 in particular, when

227

preexisting endothelial damage can be suspected (Varga et al., 2020).

228

Further studies are required to elaborate the impact of the endothelial phenotype and

229

the infection conditions at which these cells are targeted by SARS-CoV-2. In the model

230

used in this study, the pneumotropic features of SARS-CoV-2 could be confirmed

231

based on viral uptake and replication in epithelial cells accompanied with an

232

interferon response described in previous studies. The viral particles were not

233

transferred to the neighboring endothelial layer, although the cells were co-cultivated

234

in a bioinspired manner to recreate the alveolar structure.

comorbidities like obesity and diabetes might render endothelial cells

235
236

SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the alveolar barrier within the alveolus-on-a-chip model

237

Next, we analyzed the barrier function of the epithelial-endothelial cell layers in our

238

biochip model. Many clinical case reports and studies describe that critical ill COVID-

239

patients develop severe lung destructions and a systemic sepsis-like syndrome

240

(Ackermann et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020) that could be partly explained by a disrupted

241

barrier function in the lung. From the immunofluorescence image (Figure 4), we could

242

observe some destruction of the epithelial or endothelial layer, in particular 40h post-

243

infection (Figure S2). To better visualize the cell-layers during the infection, we

244

performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the surface structures

245

following 28h post-infection. On the epithelial side we found dead cells and remnants

246

attached to the cell layer. Dying cells are identified by shrinking, balling, disruption of

247

the plasma membrane, and the loss of microvilli, which can be observed in the upper

248

and middle panel of the infected cells, but to a much lesser extent in mock-treated cells

249

(Figure 5A, upper panel). Interestingly, at a higher magnification we could display the

250

viral particles on the surface of the dead cells (Figure 5A, lower panel).

251

It is well known that respiratory viral pathogens induce cell death (including

252

apoptosis) in the respiratory epithelium, such as the influenza virus (Atkin-Smith et

253

al., 2018). Already the 2003 SARS-CoV led to apoptotic cell death induced by

254

membrane proteins via modulation of the Akt-pathway (Chan et al., 2007).

255

Additionally, prolonged stress of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was identified as a

256

trigger for apoptosis (Fung and Liu, 2014). Within the recent pandemic, it has been

257

shown that the largest unique open reading frame (ORF) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

258

ORF3a is associated with a pro-apoptotic activity (Ren et al., 2020). These studies

259

indicate that the induction of an apoptotic process in the course of SARS-CoV2

260

infection is highly probable.

261

By contrast, on the endothelial side, we could not observe differences in the

262

morphological appearance between SARS-CoV-2-infected and mock-treated cells.

263

Here, the cell integrity of the cell layers appeared intact apart from shrinking artefacts

264

due to the drying procedure (Figure 5B). At the high magnification (lower panel) dead

265

cell remnants show granular residues of the cytoplasm indicating the loss of the

266

plasma membrane, but no viral particles could be visualized.

267

To measure the epithelial and endothelial cell viability we performed LDH-assays on

268

cells grown in the biochip. 28h post-infection we observed in the infected epithelial

269

layer a significantly enhanced release of LDH, whereas SARS-CoV-2 did not induce an

270

enhanced LDH release in endothelial cells (Figure 5D). However, after more extended

271

infection periods (40h; Figure 5D), the barrier function on the endothelial side was also

272

affected. These results suggest that even if the endothelial layer is not infected the cell

273

integrity gets disturbed, most likely by cytokines released by macrophages. In this

274

respect, it is known that high cytokine/interferon levels can induce the disruption of

275

the alveolar barrier function (Broggi et al., 2020; Gustafson et al., 2020; Pelaia et al.,

276

2020).

277

To further analyze the barrier integrity of the biochip system on a functional level, we

278

performed permeability assays using FITC-dextran to investigate the endothelial and

279

epithelial cell barrier integrity. We were able to show that SARS-CoV-2 significantly

280

increased the tissue permeability with its barrier function severely impaired (Figure

281

5C). As a consequence of the disrupted barrier, we detected viral particles by

282

performing plaque assays of the cell supernatants in the endothelial chamber at the

283

late time point of 40h (Figure 5E). These results show that endothelial cells are affected

284

by the viral infection at late time points and that the disturbed cell integrity results in

285

translocation of the viral particles over the alveolar barrier.

286
287

DISCUSSION

288

In this manuscript, we present an in vitro human alveolus-on-a-chip model based on

289

human cells that closely mimics alveolar structures and can be efficiently infected by

290

SARS-CoV-2. The epithelial of the alveolar models was demonstrated to be prone to

291

SARS-CoV2 infection and to propagate viral replication with high viral loads. These

292

findings are in line with clinical observations that in lung tissue by far, the highest viral

293

burdens are measured (Carsana et al., 2020). This phenomenon can be explained by

294

the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to airway cells that contribute to the high shedding of

295

viral particles in the respiratory system and the high infectivity of patients via aerosols.

Nevertheless, due to the systemic symptoms in severe COVID-patients, it has been

297

discussed, whether other cell types besides the airway epithelium, are targeted by

298

SARS-COV-2, as well. In particular, vascular complications, such as thrombotic events

299

(Helms et al., 2020), could result from the dissemination and propagation of viral

300

particles in the endothelial system. In our model system, we could not confirm viral

301

invasion into endothelial cells, although the cells were cultured in close proximity to

302

the infected epithelium.

303

Yet, with increased time of infection (40h), the endothelial cells become damaged

304

resulting in a decline in tissue barrier function. This effect is most likely mediated by

305

the cytokine release of the infected neighboring epithelium. Cytokine release is known

306

to disturb various cellular functions, such as protein biosynthesis and barrier integrity.

307

Many studies reveal that most severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections are not only due

308

to enhanced viral burden, but to a large extent due to aberrant immune responses

309

(Broggi et al., 2020).

310

In our manuscript, we present an infection model that could be further used to study

311

several aspects during the SARS-CoV-2 infection: (i) At first, the cellular interaction

312

can be analyzed in detail with increasing complexity. Here, the interaction between

313

endothelial and epithelial cells, and the role of different immune cells that can be

314

integrated into the biochip could be elaborated. (ii) Another crucial aspect is

315

preexisting damage, such as diabetic vascular changes or inflammatory foci that may

316

promote a COVID-19 infection. These factors can be mimicked in the biochip model to

317

investigate their impact on infection development. (iii) A third important issue are

318

novel therapeutic agents. Antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies can be tested in

319

the biochip model to obtain initial results on their mode of action.

320

Consequently, our biochip model represents a valuable tool to study many aspects

321

during COVID-19 infections.

328

approvement of the Jena University Hospital, no.: 2018-1263) by using Vero-76 cells.

329

For this, cells were washed 12 h after seeding and infected with 200 µl filtered patient

330

sample (sterilized syringe filter, pore size 0,2 µm) under the addition of Panserin 401

331

(PanBiotech, Germany). After five days, the cytopathic effect was notable. Then, cells

332

were frozen, centrifuged, and clear supernatants were obtained.

333

To generate well-defined viral stocks, plaque purification procedures were performed.

334

For this, confluent Vero-76 cell cultures were infected with serial dilutions of virus

335

isolates diluted in EMEM for 60 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. Thereafter, inoculum was

336

exchanged with 2 ml MEM/BA (medium with 0.2 % BSA) supplemented with 0.9 %

337

agar (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany), 0.01 % DEAE-Dextran (Pharmacia Biotech, Germany)

338

and 0.2% NaHCO3 until plaque formation was observed. Single plaques were marked

339

using inverse microscopy. Contents of these plaques were used to infect confluent

340

Vero-76 cell monolayers in T25 flasks. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 until

341

pronounced cytopathic effects were visible. Then, cell cultures were frozen again and

342

clear supernatants were obtained. This plaque purification procedure was repeated

343

again. Finally, virus stocks were generated and titrated using plaque assays. For this,

344

Vero-76 cells were seeded in 6-well plates until a 90 % confluency and infected with

345

serial dilutions of the supernatants in PBS/BA (1 mM MgCl2, 0,9 mM CaCl, 0,2 % BSA,

346

100 U/ml Pen/Strep) for 90 min at 37°C. After aspiration of the inoculum, cells were

347

incubated with 2 ml MEM/BA (medium with 0.2 % BSA) supplemented with 0.9 %

348

agar (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany), 0.01 % DEAE-Dextran (Pharmacia Biotech, Germany)

(https://artic.network/ncov-2019). Briefly, viral RNA was isolated for SARS-CoV-2

358

virus strains 5159, 5587, and 5588 via the QIAmp viral RNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,

359

Germany) according to the manufacturers' guide. The cDNA preparation was

360

performed using the SuperScript IV (Thermofisher), followed by a multiplex PCR to

361

generate overlapping 400 nt amplicons using version 3 of the primer set

362

(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-

Cell culture and virus infection. Vero-76 cells were cultured in EMEM with HEPES

371

modification, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. Calu-3 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640

372

supplemented with 10 % fetal calves’ serum (FCS). M199 was purchased from Lonza

373

(Verviers, Belgium), fetal calf serum (FCS), human serum and endothelial growth

374

supplement were from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany).

375

PBMCs were isolated and cultivated as previously described (Deinhardt-Emmer et al.,

376

2020a). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from

377

anonymously acquired human umbilical cords according to the Declaration of

378

Helsinki, “Ethical principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects” (1964).

379

After rinsing the cord veins with 0.9 % NaCl, endothelial cells were detached with

380

collagenase (0.01 %, 3 min at 37 °C), suspended in M199/10 % FCS, washed once (500

381

x g, 6 min) and seeded on a cell culture flask coated with 0.2 % gelatin. 24 h later, full

382

growth medium was added (M199, 17.5 % FCS, 2.5 % human serum, 7.5 µg/ml

383

endothelial mitogen, 7.5 U/ml heparin, 680 µM glutamine, 100 µM vitamin C, 100 U/ml

384

penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin). HUVEC from the second passage were seeded on

385

30-mm dishes or on 90-mm dishes at a density of 27,500 cells/cm². Experiments were

386

performed 72 h after seeding. For the cultivation of the human alveolus-on-a-chip

387

model we used Calu-3 cells and macrophages at the epithelial side, and HUVECs at

388

the endothelial side. The Multiorgan tissue flow (MOTiF) biochips were manufactured

389

and obtained from microfluid ChipShop GmbH (Jena, Germany), as explained

390

previously (Deinhardt-Emmer et al., 2020a).

391

For infection of Vero-76 or Calu-3 cells, cells were washed with PBS and either left

392

uninfected (mock) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 with a multiplicity of infection (MOI)

393

of 1 for 120 min in medium (EMEM with HEPES modification and 5 mM L-Glutamine

394

for Vero-76 cells and RPMI 1640 for Calu-3 cells) supplemented with 10 % FCS.

395

Subsequently, supernatants were removed, and cells were supplemented with fresh

396

medium supplemented with 10 % FCS and further incubated for the times indicated

397

at 37°C, 5 % CO2.

398

For the infection of the human alveolus-on-a-chip, cells were washed with PBS once,

399

followed by treatment with PBS (mock) at 37°C and RPMI (0.2 % autologous human

400

serum, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM CaCl2) or infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus (1 MOI). After

401

90 min incubation cells were washed and supplemented with medium. Afterwards,

402

cells were incubated for the indicated times at 37°C, 5 % CO2.

Transmission electron microscopy. Confluent monolayers of Vero-76 cells (9 cm petri

405

dishes) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate 5159) using an MOI of 1. After 24 h,

406

supernatants were removed, and samples were fixed with freshly prepared modified

407

Karnovsky fixative consisting of 4 % w/v paraformaldehyde and 2.5 % v/v

min. During the following dehydration in ascending ethanol series, post-staining with

414

1 % w/v uranyl acetate was performed. Afterwards, the pellets were embedded in

415

epoxy resin (Araldite) and ultrathin sectioned (70 nm) using a Leica Ultracut S (Leica,

416

Wetzlar, Germany). Finally, the sections were mounted on filmed Cu grids, post-

417

stained with lead citrate, and studied in a transmission electron microscope (EM 900,

418

Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 80 kV and magnifications of 3,000x to 85,000x. For

419

image recording, a 2K slow-scan CCD camera (TRS, Moorenweis, Germany) was used.

420
421

Immunofluorescence microscopy. Membranes of the human alveolus-on-a-chip were

422

fixed for at least 30 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 37°C and permeabilized with

423

0.1 % saponin buffer for one hour at room temperature. For the alveolus-on-a-chip

424

model the membrane was removed from the chip after fixation and before

425

permeabilization and cut in two halves to analyze either the epithelial or the

426

endothelial side. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 was visualized using mouse anti-SARS-

427

CoV-2 spike (GeneTex; #GTX632604) IgG monoclonal, primary antibodies and

428

AlexaFluor® goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies (Dianova; # 115-545-146). The

429

nuclei were stained with bisBenzimide H 33342 trihydrochloride (Hoechst 33342)

430

(Merck; #14533). Rabbit anti-E-cadherin IgG monoclonal (CellSignaling; 3195S) or

431

rabbit anti-VE-cadherin polyclonal, primary antibodies (CellSignaling; 2158S) and Cy5

432

goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies (Dianova; #111-175-144) were used to

433

detect cell borders of Calu-3 or HUVEC cells on the membrane of the alveolus-on-a-

434

chip model, respectively. Primary antibodies were added 1:100, overnight at 4°C.

435

Afterwards, secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 were added 1:100 and 1:1000 for

436

1 h, at room temperature and in the dark. Cells and membranes were mounted with

437

fluorescence mounting media (Dako; #S3023).

438

Images were acquired using an Axio Observer.Z1 microscope (Zeiss) with Plan

439

Apochromat 20x/0.8 objective (Zeiss), ApoTome.2 (Zeiss) and Axiocam 503 mono

440

(Zeiss) and the software Zen 2.6 (blue edition; Zeiss). Apotome defolding with phase

441

error correction and deconvolution was done by the software Zen 2.6 as well. Fiji V

442

1.52b (ImageJ) was used for further image processing, including Z-stack merging with

443

maximum intensity projection and gamma correction. Parameters were kept the same

444

for all pictures which were compared with each other.

446

Scanning electron microscopy. The ﬁxation of the cells was performed inside the

447

human alveolus-on-a-chip model by using the same fixative as for TEM for 60 min at

448

room temperature as described previously (Deinhardt-Emmer et al., 2020a; Maurer et

449

al., 2019; Rennert et al., 2015). Afterwards, the chips were rinsed three times with fresh

450

cacodylate buffer for 10 min each and the membranes were cut out. After post-fixation

451

with 2 % w/v osmiumtetroxide for 1h the samples were dehydrated in ascending

452

ethanol concentrations (30, 50, 70, 90 and 100 %) for 15 min each. Subsequently, the

453

samples were critical-point dried using liquid CO2 and sputter coated with gold

454

(thickness approx. 2 nm) using a CCU-010 sputter coater (safematic GmbH, Zizers,

455

Switzerland). The specimens were investigated with a field emission SEM LEO-1530

Permeability Assay. To test the permeability of the epithelial and endothelial barrier,

480

1 mg ml−1 of 3–5 kDa fluorescein isothio-cyanate (FITC)-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich,

481

Germany) in phenol-red free DMEM/F12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was

482

injected into the upper chamber of the chip. The lower chamber contained only phenol

483

red free DMEM/F12. The alveolus model was incubated for 60 min under static

484

conditions. Afterwards, the media from the lower and upper chambers were collected,

485

and fluorescence intensity (exc. 488nm; em. 518 nm) was measured in a 96-well μClear

486

black plate (Greiner BioOne, Frickenhausen, Germany) by a BMG Labtech FLUOStar

487

Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany). The

488

permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated according to Papp (cm s−1) = (dQ/dt)

489

(1/ACo). For this, dQ/dt represent the steady-state flux (g s−1), A the culture surface area

490

(cm2) and Co the initial concentration (mg ml−1) (Thomas et al., 2017).

495

Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was

496

measured using the Nano Drop Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (preqlab/vwr, Radnor,

497

USA).

498

For cDNA synthesis, the QuantiNova Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo,

to the diluted RNA; followed by incubation at 45°C for 2 min. After incubating the

502

samples for at least 1 min on ice, 5 μl of RT master mix (containing 4 μl Reverse

503

Transcription Mix and 1 μl Reverse Transcription enzyme per sample) were added.

504

The resulting mixture was incubated for 3 min at 25°C, followed by incubation at 45°C

505

for 10 min and an inactivation step at 85°C for 5 min. The cDNA was either directly

506

used for the subsequent experiments or stored at -20°C.

507

qRT-PCRs were performed using the QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN,

508

Venlo, Netherlands). 1 μl cDNA was added to 19 μl master mix (containing 10 μl SYBR

509

Green, 1.5 μl Forward Primer (10 μM), 1.5 μl Reverse Primer (10 μM) and 6 μL RNase

510

511

reaction was started using the following cycle conditions: 95l°C for 2 min, followed by

512

40 cycles of 95°C for 5 sec and 60°C for 10 sec. The qPCR cycle was ended by a stepwise

513

temperature-increase from 60°C to 95°C (1°C every 5 sec).

693

(A) Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to the SARS-

694

related coronaviruses RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45. Sequences of

695

strains 5587 and 5588 exhibit two base substitutions T8,782C (nsp1ab: synonymous)

696

and C28,144T (nsp8: S84L). (B) Accordingly, 5587 and 5588 clustered with lineage

697

L/lineage B strains in the phylogenetic analysis. Both strains exhibit deletion of nsp1ab

698

D448 and two synonymous substitutions (T514C, C5512T). Beside the nsp8 S84L

699

substitution, strain 5159 has accumulated three additional amino acid substitutions (S:

700

D614G, nsp1ab: P4715L and N: R203K/G204R) which place this virus in lineage B.1.1.

Figure S2: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in the disruption of the epithelial-

788

and endothelial barrier.

789

The epithelial side of the alveolus-on-a-chip model was left uninfected (mock) or

790

infected with three different SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates (5159, 5587, 5588) (MOI=1).

791

Immunofluorescence staining was performed 40h p.i., (A) The E-cadherin of the

792

epithelial layer and the (B) VE-cadherin of the endothelial layer were visualized by an

793

anti-E-Cadherin-specific antibody or an anti-VE-Cadherin antiserum, respectively,

794

and a Cy5 goat anti-rabbit IgG (red). (A, B) The SARS-CoV-2 was visualized by

795

detection of the spike protein via a spike-specific antibody and an Alexa Fluor™ 488-
