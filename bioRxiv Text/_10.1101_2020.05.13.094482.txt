Abstract: In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, the capital of the Chinese province Hubei. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has
been responsible for a worldwide pandemic resulting in over 4 million infections and over 250,000
deaths. The pandemic has instigated widespread research related to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease
that it causes, COVID-19. Research into this new virus will be facilitated by the availability of clearly
described and effective procedures that enable the propagation and quantification of infectious
virus. Because work with the virus is recommended to be performed at biosafety level 3, validated
methods to effectively inactivate the virus to enable safe study of RNA, DNA and protein from
infected cells are also needed. Here, we report methods used to grow SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cell
lines and to measure virus infectivity by plaque assay using either agarose or microcrystalline
cellulose as an overlay as well as a SARS-CoV-2 specific focus forming assay. We also demonstrate
effective inactivation by TRIzol, 10% neutral buffered formalin, beta propiolactone, and heat.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID19), belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which also includes the highly pathogenic SARS CoV and
MERS CoV. SARS-CoV-2, a close relative of bat betacoronaviruses emerged at the end of 2019 in
Wuhan, China, and has caused a pandemic [1]. The pandemic and the public response has greatly
impacted public health and caused profound social and economic disruption. As of May 11, 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 had caused more than 4 million infections and more than 250,000 deaths worldwide
[2]. The emergence of this new virus has prompted urgent worldwide efforts to develop diagnostics,
vaccines and antivirals, to define the natural history of human infection; and to better characterize
the virus.
The expanded interest in studying SARS-CoV-2 to address the current pandemic requires
that many laboratories acquire the capacity to work with the virus. However, despite the rapidly
growing body of literature either deposited on preprint servers or in peer-reviewed scientific
journals, and the need for high quality data, there remains a lack of information regarding
standardized protocols for work with the virus. Among these needs are the means to grow and
quantify infectious virus. Additionally, the recommendation that experiments involving the
propagation of SARs-CoV-2 be performed at biosafety level 3 (BSL3) necessitates the development of
methods to safely inactivate the virus and validate inactivation methods for emerging highlypathogenic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, to allow an array of studies to be performed at lower
biocontainment levels [3-6]. Examples include the isolation of RNA from virus and virus-infected

2.1 Cells and Virus

and to characterize host responses to infection. Removal of intact, virus-infected cells is critical for
studies involving microscopy aimed at understanding the SARS-CoV-2:host interplay at the cellular
level, and also for high-throughput analysis of the progression of viral replication in response to
antivirals. Whole inactivated virus and viral proteins are needed for the development of inactivated
whole-virus vaccine preparations and also as a source of antigen for immunoassays.
To help address these needs and to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research efforts, we describe here
methods for the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cell lines. We have also determined a more
efficient method for quantifying virus by plaque assay and have developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific
focus forming assay which can enhance throughput of assays requiring quantification of viral titers.
Additionally, we describe validation if methods for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 through the use
of TRIzol, 10% neutral buffered formalin, beta-propiolactone, and heat. Taken together, the data
presented here will serve to provide researchers with a helpful basis of information to aid in their
work on SARS-CoV-2.

Vero E6 (ATCC# CRL-1586), Calu-3 (ATCC# HTB-55), Caco-2 (ATCC# HTB-37), Huh7, A549
(ATCC# CCL-185), and 293T cells were maintained in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% heat
inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO). Cells were kept in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator without
antibiotics or antimycotics. SARS-CoV-2, strain USA_WA1/2020, was obtained from the World
Reference Collection for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical
Branch-Galveston.
2.2 Virus Propagation
A lyophilized ampule of SARS-CoV-2 was initially resuspended in DMEM supplemented
with 2% FBS. VeroE6 cells were inoculated in duplicate with a dilution of 1:100 with an adsorption
period of 1 hour at 37°C and shaking every 15 minutes. Cells were observed for cytopathic effect
(CPE) every 24 hours. Stock SARS-CoV-2 virus was harvested at 72 hours post infection (h.p.i) and
supernatants were collected, clarified, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C. For replication kinetic
experiments, cells were seeded into 24 well plates at confluency in DMEM supplemented in 10% FBS.
The next day, cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in
DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Supernatants were harvested at the indicated timepoints and
stored at -80C until analysis.
2.3 SARS-CoV-2 Plaque Assay
Vero E6 cells were seeded into 6, ,12, or 24-well plates 24 hours before infection. 10-fold
serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 samples were added, adsorbed for 1 hour at 37C with shaking at 15minute intervals. After the absorption period, 2 mL of 0.3% agarose in DMEM supplemented with
2% FBS or 3 mL of 0.6 or 1.2 percent microcrystalline cellulose (MCC; Sigma 435244) in serum-free

DMEM was added. To stain plaque assays performed with an agarose overlay, 10% Neutral Buffered
Formalin (NBF) was added on top of the agarose and incubated for one hour at room temperature.
The agarose plug was then removed with a pipette tip, and the fixed monolayer was stained with
0.4% crystal violet in 20% methanol. For plaque assays performed with MCC overlay, the MCC was
aspirated out, 10% NBF added for one hour at room temp and then removed. Monolayers were then
washed with water and stained with 0.4% crystal violet. Plaques were quantified and recorded as
PFU/mL.
2.4 Focus Forming Assay
Vero E6 cells were plated into 96 well plates at confluency (75000 cells/well) in DMEM
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Prior to infection, virus stocks
were thawed and serially diluted to obtain dilutions in the range of 10-2 to 10-9. Growth media was
removed from the Vero E6 cells and 50 µL of virus dilutions was plated. Virus was adsorbed for 1
hour at 37C/5% CO2. After adsorption, 50 µL of 2.4% MCC overlay supplemented with DMEM
powdered media to a concentration of 1X (Gibco) was added to each well of the 96 well plate to
achieve a final MCC overlay concentration of 1.2%. Plates were then incubated at 37C/5% CO2 for 24
hours. The MCC overlay was gently removed and cells were fixed with 10% NBF for 1 hour at roomtemperature. After removal of NBF, monolayers were washed with ultrapure water and 100%
methanol/0.3% H2O2 was added to permeabilize cells and quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
Monolayers were then blocked for 1 hour in PBS with 5% non-fat dry milk (NFDM). After blocking,
monolayers were incubated with SARS-CoV N primary antibody (Novus Biologicals; NB100-56576 –
1:2000) for 1 hour at RT in PBS/5% NFDM. Monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated with
an HRP-Conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at RT in PBS/5% NFDM. Secondary was removed,
monolayers were washed with PBS, and then developed using TrueBlue substrate (KPL) for 30
minutes. Plates were imaged on a Bio-Rad Chemidoc utilizing a phosphorscreen and foci were
quantified.
2.5 TRIzol® Treatment
To validate the effectiveness of Trizolâ Reagent in the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, stock
virus was separated into the following validation test groups: non-infected control (sterile media),
Trizol treated non-infected control (sterile culture media+Trizol), duplicate SARS-CoV-2 positive
controls (SARS-CoV-2; 1x106 pfu), and triplicate SARS-CoV-2 Trizol treated samples (SARS-CoV-2;
1x106 pfu +Trizol). Trizol was added to a final concentration of 10%. All test groups were then
incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Samples were then diluted in 25mL media, and plated
onto VeroE6 cells in a 15cm tissue culture dish and incubated at 37C and 5% CO2 and monitored
daily for CPE. At 48 hours post infection, media was removed and the plates fixed with 10% NBF. To
determine integrity of the cell monolayer, plates were stained with crystal violet.

To validate inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with formalin, 21 wells of a 24-well plate seeded to
confluency with VeroE6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1. Three wells served as
mock-infected control. At 24 hours post infection, media was removed from wells and treated as
follows, using 3 wells per condition: uninfected control, SARS-CoV-2 infected control, SARS-CoV2+2% formaldehyde, SARS-CoV-2+1% formaldehyde, SARS-CoV-2+0.5% formaldehyde, SARS-CoV2+0.1% formaldehyde, and SARS-CoV-2+0.05% formaldehyde. Formaldehyde treatment was carried
out at room temperature for 1 hour. The cells were then washed with fresh media, scraped off the
plate, and overlaid onto uninfected Vero E6 cells. Samples were then incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 and
monitored daily for CPE. At 72 hours post infection, media was removed and the plates fixed with
10% NBF. To determine integrity of the cell monolayer, plates were stained with crystal violet.
2.7 Beta-propiolactone Treatment
To test treatment of viral particles with beta-propiolactone as means of inactivation , stock SARSCoV-2 virus was separated into the following validation groups: non-infected control, 4C control
(1x106 pfu per replicate), 0.5% beta-propiolactone (1x106 pfu per replicate), 0.1% beta-propiolactone
(1x106 pfu per replicate), and 0.05% beta-propiolactone (1x106 pfu per replicate). After incubation at
4C for 16 hours, samples were transferred to 37C for two (2) hours to hydrolyze all residual betapropiolactone. This step ensures complete hydrolysis of beta-propiolactone to prevent cytotoxicity to
mammalian cells [7]. After hydrolysis, samples were inoculated onto Vero E6 cells, and incubated at
37C, 5% CO2 incubator and monitored daily for CPE. At 72 hours post infection, media was removed
and plates were fixed with 10% NBF. To determine integrity of the cell monolayer, plates were stained
with crystal violet.
2.8 Heat Inactivation
To validate heat treatment as method to inactivate SARS-CoV-2,

SARS-CoV-2 virus was

separated into the following validation groups: non-infected control, room temperature control
(1x106 pfu per replicate), 100C for 5 minutes (1x106 pfu per replicate), 100C for 10 minutes (1x106 pfu
per replicate), and 100C for 15 minutes (1x106 pfu per replicate). 1.5 ml microcentrifuge
polypropylene tubes containing the virus (500 µL total volume) were exposed to direct heat in a heat
block (Fisher Scientific). After heating, all samples were left to cool to room temperature and
centrifuged to collect condensation within the tube. Each sample was then inoculated in 5-fold serial
dilutions onto VeroE6 cells. Samples were then incubated at 37C, 5% CO2. At 72 hours post infection,
supernatants were harvested, and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells.
2.9 Electron Microscopy
Resuspended purified beta-propiolactone treated SARS-CoV-2 virus preps were adsorbed onto
300 mesh formvar-carbon coated nickel grids for 10 minutes, washed with 0.2 µM filtered ultrapure
water, and negative-stained with UranyLess stain for 15 seconds. Grids were then washed with 0.2
µM ultrapure water, allowed to dry, and imaged on a LEO 960 TEM at 80 kV.

3.1 Propagation and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture

Resuspended purified beta-propiolactone treated SARS-CoV-2 virus preps were separated by
SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad TGX Mini) and transferred to 0.2 µM PVDF membrane according to the
manufacturer’s protocols (Bio-Rad Tansblot Turbo). After blocking in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST
(10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20, pH8) for one hour, membranes were incubated overnight
at 4C with antibodies targeting SARS-CoV N (Novus Biologicals; NB100-56576) or SARS-CoV S (Sino
Biological; 40150-T62). Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated with an HRP-conjugated
rabbit secondary antibody (Cell signaling; 7074) for 1 Hr at room temperature. Membranes were then
washed, developed with ECL, and imaged on a Bio-Rad Chemidoc imaging system.

Despite the number of recent reports in which SARs-CoV-2 has been propagated and quantified,
there still remains a lack of general information regarding the temporal cytopathology of SARS-CoV2 in cell culture. Here, we set out to determine the most appropriate times post-infection to harvest
SARS-CoV-2 infected cultures for generation of stock virus, and the quantification thereof. To
generate stock virus, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.001 and monitored
daily by light microscopy for the appearance of CPE. We determined that the cytopathic effect (CPE)
caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells is most apparent at 48 hours post infection (Figure 1A).
However, despite CPE being nearly complete at 48 hours post-infection in the absence of an overlay,
we determined that for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 using traditional plaque assays with a 0.4%
agarose overlay 72 hours post-infection results in clearer, more easily quantifiable plaques (Figure
1B).
In addition, we wanted to determine the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in several commonly used cell
lines to determine suitable cell culture systems for studying SARS-CoV-2 biology. Vero E6, Calu-3,
Caco-2, Huh7, A549, and 293T cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 and
supernatants were harvested at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infection and quantified by traditional
plaque assays. As shown in Figure 1C, SARS-CoV-2 replicated to high titers in Vero E6 and Calu3
cells at all times post-infection. Caco-2 cells clearly support SARS-CoV-2 replication yet seem to
propagate the virus more slowly that Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells. Only modest replication was observed
in Huh7 and 293T cells, and A549 cells did not support SARS-CoV-2 growth at any time postinfection. These results suggest that the cellular tropism for SARS-CoV-2 is fairly restricted; however
overexpression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 or the protease responsible for cleaving SARSCoV-2 spike protein can aid infection in non-permissive cell lines [8,9].
3.2 Microcrystalline cellulose is a suitable substitute for agarose for SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays
Traditionally, viral plaque assays are performed utilizing low concentrations of agarose as an
overlay medium. While agarose generally performs well as an overlay medium for numerous
different viruses, the requirement of having to remove agarose plug from within multi-well cell
culture dishes can prove laborious. This is especially the case when plaque assays are performed in

24 well plates. Recently, a novel low-viscosity overlay medium for viral plaque assays has been
described [10].

This assay replaces traditional solid (agarose) and semi-solid (methylcellulose)

media with a microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) suspension as the overlay media. To determine
whether the MCC approach is suitable for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 by plaque assay, we overlaid
SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells with two concentrations of MCC (0.6% and 1.2%) in 6, 12, and 24

well formats. Our results indicate that MCC performs exceptionally well as an overlay medium for
SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays as uniform and countable plaques are readily apparent 72 hours postinfection, even in the 24 well plate format (Figure 2 A-B). We have also determined that either of the
two concentrations of MCC tested yielded plaques of comparable size. Based on this we would
recommend the use of 0.6% MCC overlay media (Figure 2A) for SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays as it
produces uniform and easily identifiable plaques for quantification. While it is possible to identify
plaques at 48 hours post-infection with 0.6% MCC overlay, similar to the 0.4% agarose overlay (Figure
1B), the plaques are small and difficult to accurately quantify until 72 hours post-infection. Taken

together these data demonstrate that using MCC as an overlay media is an effective and far more
efficient method than the use of traditional agarose overlays.
3.3 Development of a foci forming assay for SARS-CoV-2
For viruses like SARS-CoV-2 which produce significant CPE in permissive cell lines, traditional
plaque assays are the standard for virus quantification. However, traditional plaque assays require
waiting for a particular virus to produce significant enough CPE for quantifiable plaque formation.
As described above, SARS-CoV-2 is most readily quantifiable by plaque assay at 3 days postinfection. Here, we set out to develop and immunohistochemical assay to reliably determine SARSCov-2 titers using a 96 well plate-based foci forming assay. Our results indicate that after only 24
hours post infection, SARS-CoV-2 foci are readily detectable and quantifiable (Figure 3A). Although
the titers obtained by the foci forming assay after 24h incubation are approximately 1 log lower than
titers obtained from traditional plaque assays at 72h,, both data sets share similar trends (Figure 3B).

3.4 Validation of inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by TRIzol, formalin, beta-propiolactone, and direct heat
Currently, there is limited data published on methods that successfully inactivate SARS-CoV-2.
To help fill this gap in knowledge, we tested the ability of TRIzol, formalin, beta-propiolactone, and
direct heat to successfully inactivate SARS-CoV-2.
3.4.1 TRIzol
TRIzol is a well-known and widely used reagent for the isolation of nucleic acids and in some
cases protein from cells. TRIzol treated samples are generally very stable, and the ability to isolate
RNA/DNA/protein without the need for column-based extraction kits with proprietary task-specific
lysis buffers makes it an attractive option for processing SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. We
determined that addition to SARS-CoV-2 stock virus (1x106 pfu; see Materials and Methods) of TRIzol
to a final concentration of 10% resulted in the successful inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 as treated
samples resulted in no detectable cytopathic effect on Vero E6 cells 72 hours post-infection (Table 1).
3.4.2 Formalin
10% neutral buffered formalin is a commonly used fixative for processing infected cells for
downstream analysis such as microscopy. In order to determine the effectiveness of formaldehyde in
inactivating SARS-CoV-2, Vero E6 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 and incubated at 37C for 24
hours. After incubation, media was removed, and cells were treated with varying concentrations of
formaldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature. Fixed cells were then scraped off the dish and

transferred to freshly plated Vero E6 cells. Our results indicate that formalin is effective in
inactivating SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 2% (total formaldehyde
concentration) after 1 hour at room temperature (Table 1). While the exact viral load inactivated was
not determined, the impressive viral titers observed on Vero E6 cells at 24 hours post-infection (Figure

Given that 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) contains 4% formaldehyde, treatment of SARS-CoV2 containing samples with 10% NBF for 1 hour at room temperature is more than adequate for SARSCoV-2 inactivation. Our data also indicates that lower concentrations (down to 0.5% total
formaldehyde concentration) will effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 for the purposes of processing
of liquid samples, such as isolation of whole virions.

3.4.3 Beta-propiolactone
Beta-propiolactone (BPL) is a commonly used reagent for the inactivation of viruses for use in
vaccine preparations [11-14] and it has recently been used in the development of an inactivated SARSCoV-2 vaccine preparation [15]. Our results indicate that incubation of SARS-CoV-2 (1x106 pfu) in
solution with 0.5% BPL for 16 hours at 4C followed by a 2-hour incubation at 37C results in complete
inactivation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). Examination of control cells treated with 0.5% BPL
by light microscopy and crystal violet staining indicated no apparent cytotoxicity 72 hours posttreatment.
Given its use in the preparation of vaccines, we wanted to determine if BPL could provide a
rapid method for the purification of inactivated viral particles. Our results indicate that after
purification of BPL treated SARS-CoV-2 stocks over a 20% sucrose gradient (Figure 4A) that intact
viral particles are readily apparent by electron microscopy (Figure 4B). We also identified that both
nucleoprotein and spike of SARS-CoV-2 are detectable by western blot in these samples. These results
indicate that BPL inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and their subsequent purification will
yield inactivated, intact viral particles.

3.4.4 Heat
To determine the effectiveness of heat in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 with respect to time, we
heated virus stocks at 100C for 5, 10, and 15 minutes and 56C for 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. After
heating, remaining infectious SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by plaque assay. Treatment of SARS-CoV2 (1x106 pfu) for 5 minutes at 100C and 45 minutes at 56C resulted in complete inactivation of
infectious virus (Figure 5).

4. Discussion
The ability to grow and accurately quantify infectious virus is critical for virological studies.
Here, we sought to determine the growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in several commonly used cell lines
as well as the most appropriate time post-infection to accurately quantify SARS-CoV-2 by plaque
assay. Significant growth was achieved in both Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells at the time points tested. We
also observed that the colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell line was able to propagate SARS-CoV2, albeit to lower titers than Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells. Based on the replication kinetics observed in
Caco-2 cells, it is likely that if the infection were allowed to progress past 72 hours that higher titers
would have been achieved. Huh7 and 293T cells exhibited modest growth of SARS-CoV-2, and A549
cells did not support SARS-CoV-2 replication at any of the tested timepoints. Therefore, these cell
lines are not ideal hosts for virological studies with SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of modifications such

as overexpression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 or the cellular protease TMPRSS2 which
is necessary for Spike processing [8,9].
Plaque assays are among the most commonly used techniques for the accurate
quantification of infectious virus. To establish reliable plaque assays for SARS-CoV-2 we compared
two separate approaches. One used an agarose overlay and the other used microcrystalline cellulose
(MCC). In our hands, both approaches yielded comparable data. However, the MCC overlay
approach has significant advantages over the more traditional agarose overlay. MCC overlays do not
require heating prior to use which significantly expedites the processing of large numbers of plaque
assays and also alleviates concerns of overheating cell monolayers. Additionally, MCC overlays do
not require the removal of a “plug” like in the use of agarose overlays as MCC overlays remain liquid
throughout their use. They can simply be aspirated, and monolayer can be further processed.
However, due to the fact that MCC overlays remain liquid throughout the course of the assay, it is
important to take care that plaque assays utilizing MCC as an overlay are not moved until harvested
to ensure reliable data. Our data presented here demonstrate that MCC is an effective and efficient
overlay alternative to agarose for SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays.
While plaque assays are perhaps the most commonly used technique for the quantification
of infectious virus, immunohistochemical focus forming assays are also commonly used for the
quantification of virus [10,16-18]. We have established that SARS-CoV-2 can be reliably quantified by
a 96 well plate-based focus forming assay in only 24 hours. When compared to traditional plaque
assays for SARS-CoV-2 which require 72 hours for easily quantifiable plaques, the ability to quantify
infectious SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours in a 96 well plate format represents a significant advantage
for studies requiring higher-throughput. While it is important to acknowledge that titers acquired
with a focus forming assay will generally be one log lower than those acquired by traditional plaque
assay, the focus forming assay described here is fully capable of differentiating log-scale changes in
virus titer. Taken together, the focus forming assay described here is a rapid and efficient method for
quantifying infectious SARS-CoV-2.
Currently the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
is for studies involving the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 to be performed within BSL3 laboratories
with standard BSL3 practices. While an official risk group determination has not been made for
SARS-CoV-2, the related viruses SARS-CoV and MERS are classified as risk-group 3 pathogens. As a
BSL3 pathogen, having validated methods to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is important so as to ensure
safety while also allowing removal of samples to lower biosafety levels for analysis. For example,
whole inactivated virus can serve as antigen for immunological assays, vaccine preparations, and for
the analysis of virus composition. We chose to examine beta-propiolactone as a means to inactivate
SARS-CoV-2. This method was chosen because it preserves virus structure and antigenicity, and it
has recently been used to generate an inactivated vaccine preparation for SARS-CoV-2 [15]. Our data
show that treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with beta-propiolactone at a concentration of 0.5% for 16 hours
at 4C followed by 2 hours at 37C will yield intact viral particles that can be utilized safely for
downstream purposes.
The isolation of viral RNA and protein from virus or virus infected cells or the isolation RNA
from host cells is critical to characterize virus sequence variation and to study the impact of infection
on host gene expression. TRIzol is a commonly used reagent for RNA isolation that can also be used
to for DNA and protein isolation. Our data show that treatment of SARS-CoV-2 containing samples

with TRIzol following the manufacturer’s instructions is an effective method of inactivating SARSCoV-2.
Formaldehyde is a ubiquitously used reagent in life sciences and has numerous applications
such as the fixation of cells for microscopy studies such as indirect immunofluorescence of infected
cells and as a disinfectant for scientific equipment. Here, we demonstrate that treatment of SARSCoV-2 infected cells with formaldehyde at a concentration at or above 0.5% for one hour at room
temperature effectively inactivates SARs-CoV-2. Given the wide ranges of uses for formaldehyde, we
hope this data will assist in the safe processing of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 containing
samples.
Analyses of host responses to viral infection either through the use of Western blotting or the
determination of virus specific antibodies in patient sera generally require heating of the sample prior
to downstream analysis. To this end, we have determined that heating of SARS-CoV-2 containing
samples at 100C for longer than 5 minutes is a safe and effective method for the downstream analysis
of samples by western blot. Likewise, our data demonstrate that heat treatment of laboratory or
clinical samples at 56C for one hour will serve to effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2.
Taken together, we hope the methods and data reported here will serve to expedite the muchneeded research required to address this unprecedented pandemic.
