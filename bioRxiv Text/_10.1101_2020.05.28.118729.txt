Abstract

27

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

28

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 and has since become a global

29

pandemic. Pathogen-specific antibodies are typically a major predictor of protective

30

immunity, yet B cell and antibody responses during COVID-19 are not fully understood.

31

Here, we analyzed antibody-secreting cell (ASC) and antibody responses in twenty

32

hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19, and

33

presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation.

34

Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific ASCs

35

in all twenty COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot assay. Out of the 20 patients,

36

16 had developed SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies by the time of inclusion in the study.

37

SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG and IgM antibody levels positively correlated with SARS-

38

CoV-2-neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels

39

may reflect the titers of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase

40

of infection. Lastly, we showed that interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP)

41

concentrations were higher in serum of patients who were hospitalized for longer, supporting

42

the recent observations that IL-6 and CRP could be used to predict COVID-19 severity.

43

Altogether, this study constitutes a detailed description of clinical and immunological

44

parameters in twenty COVID-19 patients, with a focus on B cell and antibody responses, and

45

provides tools to study immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.

Introduction

51

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

52

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 and has since become a global pandemic

53

(1). SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory tract and can cause severe respiratory

54

illness, which sometimes requires mechanical ventilation (2). The world is racing to

55

understand the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in order to identify correlates of

56

protection, and to aid treatment and vaccine development. In the majority of infections,

57

pathogen-specific antibodies are one of the main contributors to protective immunity, yet B

58

cell and antibody responses during COVID-19 are currently not fully understood.

59
60

B cells are one of the key players of the adaptive immune system and can provide sterilizing

61

immunity against pathogens through the secretion of pathogen-specific antibodies. B cells

62

carry immunoglobulin (Ig) surface receptors with a high range of specificity that can directly

63

recognize different antigens. Early during acute infections upon the encounter with the

64

antigen, B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), including plasmablasts and

65

plasma cells, which produce large quantities of pathogen-specific antibodies (3).

66
67

ASCs can expand to very high levels during some acute human infections (4-7). For example,

68

during human dengue virus infection, ASCs expand to constitute an average of 47% of all

69

circulating B cells (5). Meanwhile, at steady state conditions in healthy individuals, ASCs

70

comprise only up to around 1% of all circulating B cells (5). The ASC response is typically

71

transient, peaking at around day 7 of the febrile stage of infection (8). However, during acute

72

human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, ASC response could be detected for as

73

long as 22-45 days after the onset of symptoms, which was found to be associated with

74

prolonged shedding of RSV in the airways (9). Thus, the kinetics of ASC response may be

75

dependent on pathogen persistence.

76
77

In humans, ASCs can be identified using flow cytometry as CD19+CD20low/– isotype-

78

switched B cells with high cell surface expression of CD38 and CD27 molecules, as well as

79

intracellular expression of proliferation marker Ki-67 (10, 11). Although flow cytometry is a

80

valuable tool to measure the frequencies of total ASCs in peripheral blood, it only allows

81

phenotypic characterization. Functional antibody secretion capacity and antigen-specificity of

82

ASCs are typically described using the gold standard enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot)

83

assay (12). ELISpot is a highly sensitive method allowing for detection of ASCs producing

84

different antibody isotypes at single-cell level, including IgA, IgG and IgM, against different

85

antigens. Flow cytometry and ELISpot can therefore be used in combination to

86

comprehensively describe the magnitude and specificity of B cell responses to infectious

87

agents.

88
89

Antigen-specific antibodies can contribute to pathogen control either by (i) directly

90

interfering with the entry of a pathogen into the target cells (referred to as neutralization); or

91

by (ii) assisting the effector cells in recognizing and eliminating infected target cells (known

92

as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) (13). Neutralizing antibodies are typically

93

considered to be the strongest predictor of protective immunity following natural infection or

94

vaccination. Therefore, it is of great importance to evaluate the neutralizing capacity and

95

persistence of specific antibodies in acute viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.

96
97

Here, we provide a detailed description of early B cell and antibody responses to SARS-CoV-

98

2 infection in a cohort of twenty hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. We found a

99

substantial level of ASCs expansion in all patients, and that not all patients developed

100

detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies at the time of

101

sampling. We also show increased levels of adaptive immune system activation and increased

102

serum concentrations of inflammatory markers interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein

103

(CRP), the latter two correlating with the duration of hospitalization in the present COVID-

104

19 patient cohort. This study constitutes a detailed description of clinical and immunological

105

B cell-related parameters in COVID-19 patients, and describes tools to study immune

106

responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.

Ethics statement

112

The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden and

113

by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. All COVID-19 patients and healthy controls

114

included in this study provided a written informed consent for participation.

115
116

Study subjects and sampling of peripheral blood

117

Peripheral blood samples were collected from 20 adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized in

118

April 2020 at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden (5 females and 15

119

males; age range between 34 and 67 years; median age 53 years) (Table I). Patients were

120

diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in either nasopharyngeal swabs

121

(18/20 patients) or sputum (2/20 patients). Diagnostics were performed at the diagnostic

122

laboratory at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Peripheral blood

123

samples from patients were taken at a median of 15 days after self-reported onset of

124

symptoms (range 7-19 days). Peripheral blood samples of 7 healthy controls were collected

125

in parallel (2 females and 5 males; age range between 26 and 53 years; median age 31 years).

126
127

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized anti-coagulated

128

blood using density gradient Lymphoprep medium (Stemcell Technologies) following the

129

manufacturer’s instructions, and immediately used for flow cytometry and FluoroSpot assays.

130

Serum was collected from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in BD Vacutainer serum

131

tubes with spray-coated silica (BD Biosciences). After coagulation for up to 2 hours at RT,

132

serum was isolated by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min and immediately stored at -80 ºC

133

for later analysis.

Absolute counts of lymphocytes in peripheral blood

136

Absolute numbers of CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells in peripheral blood were

137

measured using BD Trucount Tubes (BD Biosciences). 50 µL of anti-coagulated whole blood

138

were added into Trucount Tubes within 3 hours after blood extraction and stained with either

139

anti-CD45-PerCP (2D1), anti-CD3-FITC (SK7), anti-CD4-APC (SK3) and anti-CD8-PE

140

(SK1), or anti-CD45-PerCP (2D1) and anti-CD19-AF488 (HIB19) (all from BioLegend).

141

After 15 minutes of incubation at RT, stained whole blood was fixed and red blood cells

142

lysed with 2X BD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences). Samples were acquired on a BD

143

Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer. Bead number recorded was used to quantify absolute CD45+,

144

CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cell counts per microliter of blood. ASC numbers per

145

microliter of blood were calculated based on CD19+ B cell numbers measured by absolute

146

cell counting and on frequencies of ASCs within CD19+ cells measured by flow cytometry.

147
148

Flow cytometry

149

Staining with fluorescently-labelled antibodies was performed on freshly isolated PBMCs.

150

Briefly, cells were incubated with surface staining antibodies diluted in PBS for 30 min at

151

4°C in the dark, followed by 3 washes with flow cytometry buffer (2% FCS and 2 mM

152

EDTA in PBS). Cells were then fixed and permeabilized using eBioscience

153

Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and later

154

incubated with antibodies diluted in PBS for intracellular staining for 30 min at 4°C in the

155

dark. Finally, samples were incubated in a 2% formaldehyde solution (Polysciences) for 2 h,

156

washed and resuspended in flow cytometry buffer, and data subsequently acquired on a BD

157

LSRFortessa flow cytometer equipped with 355, 405, 488, 561, and 639 nm lasers and BD

FluoroSpot assay for antibody-secreting cells

173

The number of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein-specific IgA, IgG and IgM antibody-

174

secreting cells (ASCs), as well as the total number of IgA-, IgG- and IgM-ASCs in freshly

175

isolated PBMCs were measured using a multicolor B cell FluoroSpot kit with modifications

176

(Mabtech). Briefly, ethanol-activated IPFL membrane plates were coated overnight with

177

either: (i) anti-IgG, anti-IgA, and anti-IgM capture antibodies (15µg/mL of each) for the

178

detection of all ASCs, or (ii) SARS-CoV-2 N protein (10 µg/mL) for the detection of SARS-

179

CoV-2-specific ASCs. The plates were washed with PBS and blocked with R10 media

180

(RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS, 1% Pen/Strep, 2mM L-Glutamine (all from Thermo Fisher

181

Scientific)) for 30 minutes at RT before the addition of freshly isolated PBMCs. Plates were

182

then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 20 hours and then developed with anti-human IgG-550

188

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein

189

A full-length nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein nucleotide sequence (1293 base-pairs) of the

190

SARS-CoV-2 virus was optimized and synthesized (Genscript). The synthesized sequence

191

was cloned into a PET-30a(+) vector with a carboxyterminal His tag for detection of protein

192

expression in E.coli. The E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) was transformed with the

193

recombinant plasmid and a single colony was inoculated into TB medium containing

194

antibiotic and cultured at 37°C at 200 rpm and then induced with IPTG. Protein purity and

195

molecular weight were determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot according to standard

196

procedures (Genscript).

197
198

SARS-CoV-2 isolation from serum

199

50 µL of serum were mixed with 150 µL of EMEM (Gibco) and added to confluent Vero E6

200

cells seeded in 24-well plates. Cells were incubated with diluted serum for 1 hour, and 1 mL

201

of Vero E6 medium was added after the incubation. Cells were subsequently incubated

202

further for 10 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE) by

203

optical microscopy.

208

cells, and then seeded on microscope slides. Twelve hours later, slides were fixed in acetone

209

and stored at -80˚C until further use. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56˚C for 30

210

minutes prior to analysis. For analysis of total SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers, serum

211

samples were serially diluted from 1:20 to 1:5120. 25 µL of diluted serum was then added to

212

fixed cells and incubated at 37˚C for 30 min, after which the slides were washed in NaCl for

213

30 min. Bound SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were then detected by incubating for 30 min at

214

37˚C with a secondary AF488-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson

215

Immunoresearch), diluted 1:200 in 0.1% Evan’s Blue. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive cells were

216

visualized using a Nikon Eclipse Ni fluorescence microscope (x40 magnification). The titer

217

of IgG in each serum sample was determined by the inverted dilution factor value for the

218

highest dilution with positive staining.

219
220

ELISAs

221

SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in serum were detected using anti-SARS-

222

CoV-2 ELISA kits (both from Euroimmun), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

223

SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies were detected using EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-

224

19 IgM ELISA kit (Epitope Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serum

225

samples were heat-inactivated at 56˚C for 30 minutes prior to analysis.

226
227

IL-6 levels in serum from patients and healthy controls were measured in freshly thawed

228

serum using human IL-6 ELISA development kit (Mabtech), according to the manufacturer's

229

instructions. Serum samples were diluted 1:2 in ready-to-use ELISA diluent (Mabtech) prior

230

to performing the IL-6 ELISA assay.

Micro-neutralization assay

234

Two-fold dilution series from 1:10 to 1:10240 in EMEM (Gibco) + 5% FCS (Thermo Fisher

235

Scientific) were performed on the serum samples, which were previously heat inactivated at

236

56˚C for 30 minutes. Each dilution was subsequently mixed with equal volume of 4000

237

TCID50/ml SARS-CoV-2 (50 µl serum plus 50 µl virus) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C

238

and 5% CO2. Each sample was prepared in duplicates. After incubation, the mixtures were

239

added on confluent Vero E6 cells seeded on 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C 5% CO2.

240

Four days later the cells were inspected for signs of cytopathic effect (CPE) by optical

241

microscopy. Each well was scored as either 'neutralizing' if less than 50% of the cell layer

242

showed signs of CPE, or 'non-neutralizing' if ≥50% CPE was observed. Results are shown as

243

the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the highest neutralizing dilutions from the two

244

duplicates for each sample.

245
246

Real-time RT-PCR

247

RNA was extracted from freshly thawed serum samples using the MagDEA Dx SV reagent

248

kit and the magLEAD instrument (Precision System Science). The assay used to detect

249

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was modified from (14): forward primer 5'-

250

CATGTGTGGCGGTTCACTATATGT-3', reverse primer 5'-

251

TGTTAAARACACTATTAGCATAWGCAGT-3', and RdRp_SARSr-P2 probe. The assay

252

was carried out in 25 µL reaction mixtures containing 5µL RNA template, TaqMan Fast

253

Virus 1-Step Master Mix, 0.6 µM forward primer, 0.8 µM reverse primer, and 0.2 µM probe

254

(Applied Biosystems). Thermal cycling was performed at 50°C for 5 min, 95°C for 20 sec,

255

followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 sec, and 60°C for 30 sec in a StepOne Plus real-time

256

PCR (Applied Biosystems).

Statistics and data analysis

259

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software 7.0 for MacOSX

260

(GraphPad Software). Correlation analyses were performed using Spearman’s correlation

261

test. Statistical significance for differences between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls

262

was determined by two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. P values of < 0.05 were considered

263

statistically significant. FlowJo software version 10.5.3 (Tree Star) was used to analyze all

264

flow cytometry data. FluoroSpot data was analyzed with Apex software (Mabtech).

Results

266

Twenty COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study during hospitalization at Karolinska

267

University Hospital, Sweden. All twenty patients exhibited typical COVID-19 symptoms of

268

fever, cough and breathing difficulties, and a few also experienced chest pain, myalgia and

269

diarrhea (Table I). Some of the patients presented with common co-morbidities such as

270

overweightness, hypertension, asthma, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus type II.

271

According to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (Version 7) released

272

by the National Health Commission and State Administration of Traditional Chinese

273

Medicine, 19 out of the 20 patients were classified as severe, and 1 out of the 20 as critically

274

ill (15). While all patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized at the infectious diseases

275

wards at the time of sampling, two patients were treated at the intensive care unit (ICU)

276

before inclusion in this study, while one patient required ICU treatment after the inclusion.

277

Peripheral blood samples from the twenty COVID-19 patients were collected at a median of

278

15 days after the self-reported onset of symptoms, and at a median of 3 days after

279

hospitalization (Table I, Fig. 1A and B). In parallel, seven donors without an ongoing

280

respiratory disease or signs of inflammation were included in the study as healthy controls.

281
282

Clinical chemistry parameters in COVID-19 patients

283

Blood cell counts and clinical chemistry parameters in peripheral blood of COVID-19

284

patients were measured at the Diagnostics Laboratory of the Karolinska University Hospital

285

on the same day as the inclusion in this study (+/– 24 hours). Clinical chemistry tests showed

286

increased levels of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate

287

dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin (Fig. 1C). Some patients also presented with increased

288

levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and D-dimer, while

289

values in the majority of patients (Fig. 1C). Numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils,

291

monocytes and platelets in peripheral blood were within the normal range in the majority of

292

COVID-19 patients at the time of sampling (Fig. 1C). In contrast, we observed reduced

293

lymphocyte numbers, with the median lymphocyte numbers falling below or within the lower

294

range of reference values (Fig. 1C). Reduced lymphocyte numbers in peripheral blood of

295

COVID-19 patients were confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of absolute cell counts. We

296

found significantly lower CD45+ lymphocyte numbers in the patients compared to healthy

297

controls (Fig. 1D). CD3+ T cell and CD3+CD8+ T cell numbers were also significantly lower

298

in patients compared to the controls, while no significant difference in the numbers of

299

CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells was observed between COVID-19 patients and healthy

300

controls (Fig. 1D).

T cells and B cells are activated in COVID-19 patients

303

We next assessed the overall activation level of the adaptive immune system in COVID-19

304

patients. T cell and B cell activation levels were measured based on the expression of the

305

activation marker CD38 and the proliferation marker Ki-67 using multicolor flow cytometry

306

on freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Fig. 2A). We observed

307

significantly higher frequencies of activated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells in

308

COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Fig. 2B). Additionally, there was a strong

309

positive correlation between the frequencies of activated CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells in

310

COVID-19 patients (rs = 0.699, P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 2A).

315

cell (ASC) frequencies were also increased in peripheral blood. ASCs were identified as

316

isotype-switched B cells expressing high levels of surface CD38 and CD27 (CD19+CD20low/–

317

IgD-CD38highCD27high) (Fig. 3A). As expected, low frequencies and numbers of ASCs were

318

detected in peripheral blood of healthy controls (Fig. 3B and C). However, significantly

319

higher ASC frequencies and numbers were observed in COVID-19 patients compared to

320

healthy controls, constituting up to 31% of all circulating B cells (Fig. 3B and C).

321
322

Next, we assessed the expression of immunoglobulins (Ig) by the ASCs in COVID-19

323

patients and healthy controls (Fig. 3A). IgA has previously been shown to be expressed by

324

80% of all ASCs at steady state (16). In agreement with this, the largest proportion within the

325

ASC compartment in healthy controls was IgA+ ASCs, whereas the majority of ASCs in

326

COVID-19 patients expressed IgG (Fig. 3D). IgM+ ASCs were present at comparable

327

frequencies in both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls (Fig. 3D). Noteworthy, a

328

substantial ASC expansion was detected as early as 7 days, and as late as 19 days after the

329

onset of symptoms (Supplementary Fig. 2B).

330
331

Detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-secreting cells in COVID-19 patients

332

The expansion of ASCs is usually a result of an ongoing infection and is characterized by

333

high specificity towards the infectious agent (17). To investigate if the ASCs identified by

334

flow cytometry were SARS-CoV-2-specific, we developed a FluoroSpot assay - a

335

fluorescence-based variant of the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay, which allows

336

for simultaneous detection of total and antigen-specific IgA-, IgG- and IgM-ASCs. To detect

337

SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA-, IgG- and IgM-ASCs, we generated recombinant SARS-CoV-2

338

nucleocapsid protein (N protein).

340

The FluoroSpot assay confirmed the ASC expansion detected by flow cytometry, as the total

341

numbers of IgA-, IgG-, and IgM-ASCs in COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than

342

in healthy controls (Fig. 3E and G). Moreover, the total ASC frequencies and numbers

343

detected by flow cytometry positively correlated with total numbers of ASCs measured by

344

FluoroSpot (rs = 0.537, P = 0.01; and rs = 0.636, P = 0.003, respectively). Consistent with

345

flow cytometry data, IgG-ASCs constituted the predominant subset of all ASCs in COVID-

346

19 patients, followed by IgA-ASCs (Fig. 3D and G).

347
348

Importantly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 N protein-specific ASCs in all twenty COVID-19

349

patients, but not in controls, suggesting an active SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell response in

350

acute COVID-19 (Fig. 3F and H). We detected IgA-, IgG- and IgM-ASCs that are specific

351

for SARS-CoV-2 N-protein, yet at highly variable numbers among the patients. Overall, N-

352

protein-specific ASCs constituted a small fraction of total ASCs [median (IQR) = 3.47%

353

(2.5-4.9)]. Nonetheless, total ASC frequencies determined by flow cytometry positively

354

correlated with N protein-specific ASC numbers (rs = 0.574, P = 0.008), suggesting that the

355

ASC expansion detected by flow cytometry may reflect the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 N

356

protein-specific ASC response.

357
358

Generation of SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients

359

The expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific ASCs in all of the patients in our cohort suggested

360

that the patients had developed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in response to the infection.

361

To investigate this in detail, we next analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels.

362
363

First, we measured SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgA and IgG, as well as N-protein-

364

specific IgM antibody levels by ELISAs. We found detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA

16

365

(15/20 patients), IgG (15/20 patients) and IgM (16/20 patients) antibody levels in most of the

366

COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4A and B). Next, we determined total anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG

367

antibody levels measured towards SARS-CoV-2-infected cells using an immunofluorescence

368

assay (IFA) (Fig. 4C). We found that 16 out of the 20 patients were positive in this assay,

369

with titers ranging from 40 to 5120 (Fig. 4C). As expected, none of the healthy controls were

370

positive in any of the antibody assays (Fig. 4A). Higher IgG levels were detected in patients

371

who were sampled late compared to early after the onset of symptoms, as total and spike S1-

372

specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels positively correlated with the number of days

373

since symptom onset (rs = 0.577, P = 0.01, and rs = 0.603, P = 0.005, respectively)

374

(Supplementary Fig. 2C and D).

375
376

Next, using a micro-neutralization assay we assessed if the COVID-19 patients had generated

377

SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (18). This assay measures the ability of COVID-19

378

patient serum to reduce the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of

379

susceptible cells in vitro. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in most of the patients

380

(16/20), but at heterogeneous titers ranging from 10 to 1920 (Fig. 4D). Three of the four

381

patients with undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies were also below

382

the level of detection for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in IFA and all ELISAs (Fig. 4A).

383
384

Interestingly, we observed a strong positive correlation between total SARS-CoV-2-specific

385

IgG antibody levels and neutralizing antibody titers in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4E). Both

386

S1-specific IgA and IgG, as well as N-specific IgM levels also correlated with SARS-CoV-2-

387

neutralizing antibody titers suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers may reflect

388

the levels of neutralizing antibodies during the acute phase of COVID-19 (Fig. 4E).

390

Next, we assessed if the frequencies of activated T cells and B cells correlate with SARS-

391

CoV-2-neutralizing antibody responses. We found that CD8+ T cell activation level, but not

392

CD4+ T cell or CD19+ B cell activation level, positively correlated with neutralizing antibody

393

titers (rs = 0.544, P = 0.01; rs = 0.271, P = 0.25, and rs = -0.136, P = 0.57, respectively)

394

(Supplementary Fig. 2E - G).

395
396

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum of COVID-19 patients

397

An important role of neutralizing antibodies is to limit the spread of the virus. We screened

398

all serum samples by real time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (14). Three COVID-19

399

patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (Fig. 4A). Notably, 2 out of the 3

400

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients lacked detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies,

401

which might allow for a more efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 in those patients (Fig. 4A).

402

However, our attempts to isolate live SARS-CoV-2 from patient serum on Vero E6 cells were

403

unsuccessful (data not shown), suggesting absence or low levels of live SARS-CoV-2 in

404

serum of COVID-19 patients.

405
406

Inflammatory makers, neutralizing antibodies and disease severity in COVID-19

407

The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and CRP serum levels have been shown to correlate

408

with disease severity in COVID-19 patients (19, 20). We measured IL-6 serum concentration

409

in all COVID-19 patients at the time of inclusion in this study using ELISA. We found

410

heterogenous, yet significantly higher median concentration of IL-6 in COVID-19 patients

411

compared to the controls (Fig. 5A).

412
413

There was a strong positive correlation between the IL-6 and CRP levels at the time of

414

inclusion in this study (Fig. 5B). Higher serum concentrations of both IL-6 and CRP were

415

higher in patients with longer duration of hospitalization (Fig. 5B). Notably, IL-6 and CRP

416

serum concentrations negatively correlated with neutralizing antibody titers in COVID-19

417

patients, indicating a possible link between inflammation and humoral responses in COVID-

418

19 (Fig. 5B).

421

Discussion

422

Here, we demonstrated that COVID-19 patients elicit a SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell

423

response, indicated by the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific ASCs. Although not all

424

patients in the present cohort had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies at the

425

time of sampling, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific ASCs could be detected in all

426

patients using the FluoroSpot assay. In addition, we showed a clear relationship between the

427

levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and total SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies.

428

This suggests that standard serological assays may inform about the levels of neutralizing

429

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, which may offer protection from a re-infection.

430

Additionally, tools employed in this study may be of relevance in the assessment of long-

431

lasting immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.

432
433

The expansion of ASCs in the present cohort of COVID-19 patients highlights an active B

434

cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The frequencies of ASCs within the total circulating

435

B cell population were highly variable between COVID-19 patients, ranging from 3 to 31%.

436

Although the patients in this cohort were sampled at different timepoints following the onset

437

of symptoms, a high variability in ASC frequencies have also been observed among patients

438

infected with influenza or dengue virus sampled at normalized timepoints (e.g., 7 days after

439

febrile illness) (4, 5). Although ASCs have been shown to expand to very high levels in some

440

viral infections, constituting up to 50-80% of all peripheral B cells, the highest ASCs

441

frequency in this cohort of COVID-19 patients was 31% (5, 7, 21). Healthy controls in this

442

study had very low frequencies of ASCs in the circulation, a finding consistent with previous

443

observations (5, 6, 16).

444

445

The ASC response in peripheral blood is usually transient and peak at around 7 days after the

446

onset of febrile illness, dropping to steady-state levels 2-3 weeks later (8). Interestingly, we

447

observed a substantial ASC expansion as late as 19 days following symptom debut. This

448

finding highlights the similarity between COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

449

infection, where a significant ASC expansion could be detected as late as 22-45 days after the

450

onset of symptoms (9). The prolonged ASC expansion in RSV infection was associated with

451

longer RSV shedding in the airways. Thus, the kinetics of ASC response may be dependent

452

on pathogen persistence. In support of our findings, a recent report on longitudinal immune

453

responses in a single COVID-19 patient with mild disease showed the peak of ASC

454

expansion at day 8 after symptom onset, but a substantial ASCs response could still be

455

detected by day 20 (22). Thus, it remains to be investigated whether SARS-CoV-2

456

persistence in the airways may lead to a prolonged ASC response in circulation.

457
458

The expansion of ASCs is usually characterized by high specificity towards the infectious

459

agent (17). Here, we successfully demonstrated that COVID-19 patients generate SARS-

460

CoV-2-specific ASC responses using a FluoroSpot assay. We were able to successfully

461

identify SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA-, IgG- and IgM-ASCs in all COVID-19 patients. The

462

frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific ASCs within the total ASC population in this patient

463

cohort was relatively low. However, since only the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was used to

464

detect specific ASCs in this study, the numbers of N protein-specific ASCs do not reflect the

465

overall magnitude of the specific ASC response. The use of SARS-CoV-2 viral lysate or

466

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in combination would allow for the evaluation of the

467

overall ASC response. Furthermore, the FluoroSpot assay described in this study could be

468

adapted to evaluate memory B cell responses to various SARS-CoV-2 proteins in

469

convalescent COVID-19 patient samples.

470
471

The protective level of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 has not yet been

472

determined. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients showed a

473

strong SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing capacity in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice expressing

474

human SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (23). However, extensive longitudinal studies in

475

humans are required to investigate if recovered COVID-19 patients are protected from re-

476

infection with SARS-CoV-2. Seroconversion in COVID-19 patients, measured by detectable

477

SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels, has been recently shown to take place within nineteen days

478

after the onset of symptoms (24). The four patients in the present COVID-19 cohort without

479

detectable neutralizing antibody titers were sampled at days 7, 8, 9, and 15 after symptom

480

debut. Although these four patients did not have detectable neutralizing antibody titers,

481

SARS-CoV-2 specific ASCs were detected. This indicates that the FluoroSpot assay may be

482

a more sensitive method to detect early B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, compared to

483

standard serological assays.

484
485

In this cohort of patients, 2 out of the 4 patients with undetectable neutralizing antibody

486

levels had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum. Currently, the extent to which neutralizing

487

antibodies contribute to the control of viremia in COVID-19 is unclear. Our results seem to

488

suggest that neutralizing antibodies may not be the only player in SARS-CoV-2 control in

489

circulation, as one patient with substantial levels of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in

490

this cohort had detectable serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A pilot study assessing the

491

effectiveness of COVID-19 patient treatment with convalescent plasma containing SARS-

492

CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies found that the treatment reduced viral load in patients within a

493

few days after administration, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies have a role in the

494

management of viremia in COVID-19 (25).

495
496

Rapid serology tests are essential for COVID-19 diagnostics and for national serosurveillance

497

programs. Neutralizing antibody tests, however, are usually laborious and time-consuming.

498

Therefore, diagnostic tests often rely on other methods such as ELISA. Antibody levels

499

detected by ELISA, however, do not necessarily reflect the neutralization capacity of patient

500

serum. Here, we demonstrated a strong correlation between SARS-CoV-2-specific and

501

SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody titers. These data suggest that the levels of SARS-CoV-

502

2-specific antibodies measured with ELISA may reflect the capacity of serum from COVID-

503

19 patients to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

504
505

COVID-19 patients generally present with decreased lymphocyte numbers in peripheral

506

blood, which is particularly pronounced in severe cases (19, 26, 27). T cells appear to be the

507

most affected lymphocyte subset. In agreement with these observations, we found decreased

508

numbers of lymphocytes, and significantly lower T cell numbers in the present cohort of

509

COVID-19 patients.

510
511

In addition to lymphopenia, COVID-19 patients typically display increased concentrations of

512

inflammatory cytokines in serum, especially in severe cases (19, 27). The levels of

513

inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP, in particular, have been shown to correlate with disease

514

severity in COVID-19 patients (19, 20). In this cohort of COVID-19 patients we also

515

observed increased levels of IL-6 and CRP, with comparable median values to those

516

measured by Liu et al. in severe COVID-19 patients (20). We show that higher IL-6 and CRP

517

levels were observed in patients who were hospitalized for longer, suggesting that these

518

markers may be of use in predicting the duration of COVID-19.

520

Lastly, we observed an inverse correlation between IL-6 levels and SARS-CoV-2-

521

neutralizing antibody titers in COVID-19 patients. This relationship may indicate that the

522

lack of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies leads to higher inflammation, or that high levels

523

of inflammation impair or delay antibody responses. Further studies where a longitudinal

524

patient sampling at controlled timepoints is performed are required to describe the

525

relationship between inflammation and humoral responses in COVID-19.

526
527

Taken together, we provided a detailed description of clinical and immunological parameters

528

in twenty COVID-19 patients, with a focus on B cell and antibody responses. We

529

demonstrated that COVID-19 patients elicit a SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell response,

530

indicated by the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific ASCs. In addition, we showed a clear

531

relationship between the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and total SARS-CoV-2-

532

neutralizing antibodies. The tools employed in this study may be of relevance in the

533

assessment of long-lasting immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.

(A) Correlation between CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation levels, as measured by CD38 and Ki-67
co-expression using flow cytometry. (B) Graph displaying the antibody-secreting cell (ASC)
frequencies within the total pool of CD19+ B cells and the number of days since symptom onset
of COVID-19. (C) Correlation between total IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 (measured by IFA)
and the number of days since symptom onset of COVID-19. (D) Correlation between levels of
SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein-specific IgG levels and the number of days since symptom onset of
COVID-19. (E-G) Correlations between activated T cells and B cells with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers. Correlations were examined by Spearman’s correlation test. rs: Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
