Abstract

19

We screened steroid compounds to obtain a drug expected to block host inflammatory responses and

20

MERS-CoV replication. Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed replication of MERS-CoV

21

and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, in cultured cells. The

22

effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial

23

tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 μM. Ciclesonide inhibited formation of double membrane vesicles,

24

which anchor the viral replication-transcription complex in cells. Eight consecutive passages of 43

25

SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single

26

amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide still

27

suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot

28

completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of

29

ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the

30

treatment of COVID-19 patients.

31
32

Importance

33

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. To identify the effective antiviral

34

agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that an inhaled

35

corticosteroid, ciclesonide suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses

36

(MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in

37

cultured cells. The inhaled ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high

38

concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective

39

against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of MERS,

40

and COVID-19.

Introduction

43

The COVID-19 outbreak began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China(1). The causative virus, severe

44

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread rapidly worldwide and was declared

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.22.258459; this version posted August 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

45

a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. Thus, effective antiviral agents to

46

combat the disease are urgently needed. Several drugs are effective against SARS-CoV-2 in cultured

47

cells(2–4). Of these, Remdesivir has undergone clinical trials in COVID-19 patients, with both

48

positive and negative results (5, 6). Lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are of no

49

benefit (7, 8).

50

The virus can have inflammatory effects; therefore, steroids are used to treat severe inflammation,

51

with beneficial effects in some cases. For example, high-dose steroids reduce symptoms in those with

52

influenza encephalopathy(9). It would be highly beneficial if a virus-specific inhibitor was identified

53

among the many steroid compounds that have been well characterized. However, systemic treatment

54

with steroids is contraindicated in cases of severe pneumonia caused by Middle East respiratory

55

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV);

56

this is because steroids suppress innate and adaptive immune responses(10, 11), resulting in increased

57

viral replication. In fact, for SARS (2003) and MERS (2013), systemic treatment with cortisone or

58

prednisolone is associated with increased mortality(12, 13). Therefore, if steroid compounds are to be

59

used to treat patients suffering from COVID-19, their tendency to increase virus replication must be

60

abrogated. Here, we reconsidered the use of steroids for treatment of pneumonia caused by

61

coronavirus.

62

In the preprint of this study (posted in BioRxiv)(14), we showed that a corticosteroid, ciclesonide, is a

63

potent blocker of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Based on the data in our preprint study, clinical trials of a

64

retrospective cohort study to treat COVID-19 patients were started in Japanese hospital in March

65

2020. The treatment regime involves inhalation of 400 μg ciclesonide (two or three times per day) for

66

2 weeks. Three cases of COVID-19 pneumonia treated successfully with ciclesonide have been

67

reported(15), as have several case reports(16–18). None of these studies reported significant side

68

effects. The aim of the present study is to outline the scientific rationale for conducting these clinical

69

trials.

Results

73

Antiviral effect of steroid compounds on MERS-CoV

74

The 92 steroid compounds chosen from the Prestwick Chemical Library were examined to assess the

75

inhibitory effects of MERS-CoV-induced cytopathic effects. Vero cells treated with steroid

76

compounds were infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI = 0.1 and then incubated for 3 days. Four

77

steroid compounds, ciclesonide, mometasone furoate, mifepristone, and algestone acetophenide,

78

conferred a > 95% cell survival rate (Fig. 1). Interestingly, a structural feature of these compounds is a

79

five- or six-membered monocycle attached to the steroid core.

80
81

Next, we assessed the ability of eight steroid compounds (denoted by arrows in Fig. 1) to suppress

82

both growth of MERS-CoV and virus-mediated cytotoxicity in Vero cells over a range of drug

83

concentrations (0.1–100 µM). Ciclesonide exhibited low cytotoxicity and potent suppression of viral

84

growth (Fig. 2a). Algestone acetophenide, mometasone, and mifepristone also suppressed viral

85

growth; however, at 10 μM, the percentage viability of cells treated with algestone acetophenide and

86

mometasone was lower than that of cells treated with ciclesonide, and the ability of mifepristone and

87

mometasone to suppress viral growth was lower than that of ciclesonide. Cortisone and prednisolone,

88

which are commonly used for systemic steroid therapy, dexamethasone, which has strong

89

immunosuppressant effects, and fluticasone, a common inhaled steroid drug, did not suppress viral

90

growth (Fig. 2a). A time-of-addition assay to compare the viral inhibition efficacies of the steroids

91

with those of E64d, a cathepsin-dependent virus entry inhibitor, and lopinavir, a viral 3CL protease

92

inhibitor, previously reported for SARS-CoV(19, 20), demonstrated that ciclesonide functions at the

93

post-virus entry stage (Supplemental Fig. S1).

94
95

The antiviral effects of mometasone and ciclesonide against various viral species were tested by

96

quantifying propagated virus in the culture medium of infected cells. Ciclesonide and mometasone

97

suppressed replication of MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and SARS-CoV-2 (all of

98

which have a positive strand RNA genome), but did not affect replication of respiratory syncytial

99

virus (RSV) or influenza virus (which have a negative strand RNA genome) (Fig. 2b). In addition,

100

ciclesonide slightly, but significantly, inhibited replication of rubella virus (which has a positive strand

101

RNA genome) (Fig. 2b).

102
103

Target of ciclesonide during MERS-CoV replication

104

In an attempt to identify a druggable target for viral replication, we performed 11 consecutive

105

passages of MERS-CoV in the presence of 40 μM ciclesonide or 40 μM mometasone. A mutant virus

106

displaying resistance to ciclesonide (but no virus displaying resistance to mometasone) was generated.

107

Viral replication in the presence of ciclesonide was confirmed by measuring the virus titer in the

108

culture medium of infected Vero cells at 24 h post-infection (hpi) and the amount of viral RNA in

109

infected cells at 6 hpi (Fig. 3a and 3b). Next-generation sequencing revealed that an amino acid

110

substitution at A25V (C19647T in the reference sequence NC_019843.3) in non-structural protein 15

111

(NSP15), a coronavirus endoribonuclease (21–23), was predicted to cause resistance to ciclesonide.

112

Subsequently, a recombinant virus carrying the A25V amino acid substitution in nsp15 (Re-Nsp15-

113

A25V) was generated from the parental MERS-CoV/EMC strain (Re-EMC/MERS) using a bacterial

114

artificial chromosome (BAC) reverse genetics system(24). The titer of recombinant virus in the

115

culture medium of infected Vero cells at 24 hpi, and the amount of viral RNA in the cells at 6 hpi,

116

were quantified. As expected, the Re-Nsp15-A25V strain was much less susceptible to ciclesonide

117

than the parental strain (Fig. 3c and 3d).

118
119

Antiviral effect of steroid compounds on SARS-CoV-2

120

In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, our study target changed from MERS-CoV to

121

SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of ciclesonide on replication of the latter. First, the

122

effective concentration of ciclesonide required to inhibit virus propagation was assessed by

123

quantifying the virus titer in the supernatant of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells at 24 hpi (Fig. 4a and 4b); this

124

cell line is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2(25). We also examined human bronchial epithelial

125

Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4c and 4d). Ciclesonide blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in a concentration-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.22.258459; this version posted August 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

126

dependent manner (EC90=5.1μM in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells; EC90=6.0μM in Calu-3 cells).

127

In addition, differentiated primary human bronchial tracheal epithelial (HBTE) cells at an air-liquid

128

interface (ALI) (HBTE/ALI cells) were prepared and SARS-CoV-2 replication was evaluated in the

129

presence of ciclesonide. At 3 days post-infection, real-time PCR revealed a 2,000-fold increase in the

130

amount of viral RNA in cells (Fig. 4e); ciclesonide suppressed replication of viral RNA at a low

131

concentration (Fig. 4f) (EC90=0.55μM in HBTE/ALI cells). The amount of viral RNA detected

132

in the liquid phase was low, indicating that less virus is secreted via the basolateral surface (Fig. 4f).

133

To assess the effect of ciclesonide at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 replication, we measured the

134

amount of viral RNA in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells over time. The quantitative level of RNA replication

135

was observed at 6 h post-infection (Fig. 5a). Nelfinavir and lopinavir, strong inhibitors of SARS-CoV-

136

2 RNA replication (4, 26), were used for comparison. At 6 hpi with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 1),

137

mometasone and ciclesonide suppressed viral RNA replication with an efficacy similar to that of

138

nelfinavir and lopinavir; however, fluticasone and dexamethasone did not suppress replication (Fig.

139

5b).

140
141

Target of ciclesonide during SARS-CoV-2 replication

142

To identify the molecule targeted by ciclesonide to suppress viral RNA replication, we used 43 SARS-

143

CoV-2 isolates from infected patients to generate ciclesonide escape mutants. Consecutive passage of

144

these isolates in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of 40 μM ciclesonide. After eight passages,

145

three viral plaques from each passage of the 43 cell supernatants were isolated in a limiting dilution

146

assay; the viral RNA was then isolated for next-generation sequencing. We obtained 15 isolates

147

harboring a single mutation in the viral genome when compared with that of the parental virus (Table

148

1). We examined replication of these mutants in the presence of ciclesonide. First, one of these

149

isolates was tested in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. At 6 hpi, the amount of viral RNA derived from the

150

parental virus fell by 1000-fold in the presence of ciclesonide; by contrast, the amount of RNA

151

derived from the escape mutant increased 50-fold compared with that of the parent virus (Fig. S2).

152

There was no difference between the parental virus and the escape mutant in the presence of other

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.22.258459; this version posted August 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

153

steroid compounds (i.e., cortisone and algestone acetophenide) (Fig. S2). Furthermore, when we tested

154

all 15 mutants in the presence of ciclesonide, we found a 6- to 50-fold increase in the amount of

155

mutant viral RNA compared with that of the parental virus (Fig. 6a). Importantly, ciclesonide

156

suppressed replication of all escape mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot

157

completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. Mutations in the ciclesonide escape mutants were

158

identified at three positions in nsp3 and at one position in nsp4 (Fig. 6b). Of note, the amino acid

159

substitution N1543K in nsp3 was caused by a different base change (T7348G and T7348A) (Table 1).

160

Nsp3 and nsp4 are involved in formation of double membrane vesicles (DMV), which anchor the

161

coronavirus replication-transcription complex within cells (27, 28). In VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, DMVs

162

were observed at 5 hpi using an anti-SARS-CoV nsp3 antibody and an anti-double strand RNA

163

antibody (Fig. 7). The fluorescence intensity of these molecules fell in the presence of ciclesonide in a

164

concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7).

165
166
167

Discussion

168

Inhaled ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Because it

169

remains primarily in the lung tissue and does not enter the bloodstream to any significant degree(29),

170

its immunosuppressive effects are weaker than those of cortisone and prednisolone(29, 30). The data

171

presented herein suggest that inhaled ciclesonide has the potential to reduce both viral replication and

172

inflammation in the lungs.

173
174

We found that ciclesonide suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses

175

(MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and alpha-coronaviruses (HCoV-229E) in

176

cultured cells. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective

177

against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of common

178

colds, MERS, and COVID-19. The concentration of ciclesonide that effectively reduced replication of

179

SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated HBTE cells was 10-fold lower than that required to suppress

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.22.258459; this version posted August 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

180

replication in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 or Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4b, 4d and 4f). It is speculated that ciclesonide is

181

a prodrug that is metabolized in lung tissue to yield the active form (31); therefore, it may be

182

converted into its active form in differentiated HBTE cells. Furthermore, this study predicts the

183

occurrence of ciclesonide escape mutants in patients treated with ciclesonide; however, the drug

184

suppresses replication of these mutants by >90% (Fig. 6a). Until now, the mutations identified in these

185

mutants have not been detected in SARS-CoV-2 sequences posted in the GISAID and NCBI

186

databases.

187
188

A ciclesonide escape mutant of MERS-CoV harbored an amino acid substitution at the dimerization

189

site of the NSP15 homo-hexamer(32)(32)(32). Nsp15 is an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, an

190

RNA endonuclease, which plays a critical role in coronavirus replication(32, 33). Recently, an in

191

silico study suggested direct interaction between ciclesonide and nsp15 of SARS-CoV-2(34).

192

However, we did not identify mutations in nsp15 of the ciclesonide escape mutants of SARS-CoV-2;

193

rather, we identified mutations in the C-terminal cytosolic region (next to the transmembrane domain

194

or within the Y1&CoV-Y domain) of nsp3 or in the large lumenal loop of nsp4 (Fig. 6b). Nsp3

195

contains a papain-like protease and, due to the large number of interactions with other nsps (including

196

nsp4 and nsp15), is believed to be part of the central scaffolding protein of the replication-

197

transcription complex (33, 35, 36). In addition, like coronavirus DMV, the rubella virus (which has a

198

positive strand RNA genome and forms a spherule-like structure in cells) was slightly suppressed by

199

ciclesonide, suggesting that ciclesonide may interact with the replication-transcription complex, a

200

structure common to rubella and coronavirus. It is difficult to identify the mechanism by which

201

ciclesonide targets the nsps complex because little is known about the construction and interaction of

202

nsps in the replication-transcription complex. The result in Figure 7 was unable to be ascertain

203

whether DMV formation or RNA replication was inhibited first by ciclesonide. We anticipate that

204

further experiments using mutant nsps may reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the antiviral

205

effect of ciclesonide.

Materials and Methods

209

Cells and viruses. Hep-2, HeLa229, MDCK, Calu-3, Vero, Vero/TMPRSS2 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2

210

cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium high glucose (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich,

211

USA), and DBT cells were maintained in DMEM (Nissui, Japan), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine

212

serum (Gibco-BRL, USA). MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were propagated in Vero and

213

VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, respectively. HBTE cells (KH-4099; Lifeline cell technology, USA) were

214

plated on 6.5-mm-diameter Transwell permeable supports (3470; Corning, USA), and human airway

215

epithelium cultures were generated by growing the cells at an air-liquid interface for 3 weeks,

216

resulting in well-differentiated, polarized cultures. For treatment of HBTE cells in the experiments,

217

ciclesonide was mixed in liquid phase medium at the indicated concentrations and virus was

218

inoculated onto the air-phase.

219
220

Steroids and inhibitors. The following compounds were used: cortisone, prednisolone, fluticasone,

221

dexamethasone, algestone acetophenide, mifepristone, mometasone furoate, ciclesonide (all from the

222

Prestwick Chemical Library; PerkinElmer, USA), E64d (330005; Calbiochem, USA); nelfinavir

223

(B1122; ApexBio, USA); and lopinavir (SML1222; Sigma-Aldrich).

224
225

Quantification of viral RNA. Confluent cells in 96-well plates were inoculated with virus in the

226

presence of steroid compounds. Cellular RNA was isolated at 6 hpi using the CellAmp Direct RNA

227

Prep Kit (3732; Takara, Japan). The RNA was then diluted in water and boiled. Culture medium was

228

collected at the indicated time points, diluted 10-fold in water, and then boiled. Real-time PCR assays

229

to measure the amount of coronavirus RNA were performed using a MyGo Pro instrument (IT-IS Life

230

Science, Ireland). The primers and probes are described in Supplemental Table S1. Viral mRNA

231

levels were normalized to the expression levels of the cellular housekeeping gene GAPDH.

233

Cytotoxicity Assays. Confluent cells in 96-well plates were treated with steroid compounds. After

234

incubation for 24 or 27 h, a cell viability assay was performed using WST reagent (CK12; Dojin Lab,

235

Japan), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

236
237

Generation of recombinant MERS-CoV from BAC plasmids. A BAC clone carrying the full-

238

length infectious genome of the MERS-CoV EMC2012 strain, pBAC-MERS-wt, was used to generate

239

recombinant MERS-CoV, as described previously(24, 37) The BAC DNA of SARS-CoV-Rep (38),

240

kindly provided by Luis Enjuanes, was used as a backbone BAC sequence to generate pBAC-MERS-

241

wt. The BAC infectious clones carrying amino acid substitutions in nsp15 was generated by

242

modification of the pBAC-MERS-wt (as a template) using a Red/ET Recombination System Counter-

243

Selection BAC Modification Kit (Gene Bridges, Heidelberg, Germany). BHK-21 cells were grown in

244

a single well of a six-well plate in 10% FCS-MEM and transfected with 3 μg of BAC plasmid with

245

Lipofectamine 3,000 (Thermo Fisher, USA). After transfection, Vero/TMPRSS2 cells were inoculated

246

to transfected BHK-21 cells. The co-culture was then incubated at 37°C for 3 days. The supernatants

247

were collected and propagated once using Vero/TMPRSS2 cells. Recovered viruses were stored at

248

−80°C.

249
250

Generation of ciclesonide escape mutant. To obtain ciclesonide escape mutants, virus passage was

251

repeated at least eight times in the presence of 40 μM ciclesonide. At the first passage, about 107 PFU

252

of virus was inoculated onto 106 cells and incubated for 3 h. Next, the cells were washed twice with

253

culture medium and incubated for 2 days in the presence of ciclesonide. The incubation period was 2

254

days for the first three passages and 1 day for the following passages. Cells were inoculated with 100

255

μl culture medium at each successive passage. The amount of replicating virus in the presence of

256

ciclesonide was quantified using real-time PCR. Vero and VeroE6/TMPSS2 cells were used to passage

257

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively.

259

Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. Extracted viral RNA was reverse transcribed and

260

tagged with index adaptors using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New

261

England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting

262

cDNA libraries were verified using the MultiNA System (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and quantified

263

using a Quantus Fluorometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Indexed libraries were then converted

264

and sequenced (150-bp paired-end reads) using the DNBSEQ-G400 (MGI Tech., Shenzhen, China;

265

operated by GENEWIZ, South Plainfield, NJ, USA). After sequencing, reads with the same index

266

sequences were grouped. Sequence reads were trimmed by Ktrim (39) and mapped onto the viral

267

genomes of parental strains using Minimap2 (40). The consensus sequences of the mapped reads were

268

obtained using ConsensusFixer (Töpfer A. https://github.com/cbg-ethz/consensusfixer).

270

Immunofluorescence Microscopy. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells cultured on 96 well plates (Lumos

271

multiwell 96; 94 6120 096; Sarstedt, Germany) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (WK-521) at an

272

MOI = 0.1 and incubated for 5 h. Next, the cells were fixed for 30 min at 4°C with 4%

273

paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After washing once with PBS, the cells were

274

permeabilized for 15 min at room temperature (RT) with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. The cells

275

were then incubated with a mixture of rabbit anti-SARS-nsp4 (1:500; ab181620; Abcam, USA) and

276

mouse anti-dsRNA (1:1000; J2-1709; Scicons, Hungary) antibodies for 1 h at RT, washed three times

277

with PBS, and incubated for 1 h at RT with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG

278

(1:500; A11012; ThermoFisher, USA) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:500;

279

A10680; ThermoFisher, USA). Next, the cells were washed three times with PBS and cell nuclei were

280

stained with DAPI (1:5000; D1306; ThermoFisher, USA). Cells were observed under an inverted

281

fluorescence phase contrast microscope (BZ-X810; Keyence, Japan).

mutants listed in Table 1 was assessed in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Viral RNA was isolated at 6 hpi and

484

measured by real-time PCR using the E gene primer/probe set. The results were compared with those for

485

the parental virus in which the viral RNA level after treatment with DMSO was set to 1, and that after

486

treatment with nelfinavir was set to 1/1000. Relative reductions of viral RNA in the presence of ciclesonide

487

were plotted at the corresponding mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. The amino acid

488

substitutions in nsp3 and nsp4 are shown at the bottom of the panel. (b) Topological diagram. The C-

489

terminal region of nsp3 and full-length nsp4 are depicted on the lipid bilayer of the endoplasmic reticulum

490

membrane.

Figure 7. Ciclesonide suppresses DMV formation. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were infected with SARS-

493

CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of DMSO or ciclesonide, and then incubated for 5 h. Next, cells

494

were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20. Nsp3 and double strand

495

RNA were stained with a rabbit anti-SARS-nsp4 antibody and a mouse anti-dsRNA antibody, followed by

496

Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Cell nuclei

497

were stained with DAPI.
