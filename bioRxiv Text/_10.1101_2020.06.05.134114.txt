SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, a coronavirus disease that
has infected more than 6.6 million people and caused over 390,000 deaths
worldwide1,2. The Spike (S) protein of the virus forms projections on the virion
surface responsible for host cell attachment and penetration. This viral
glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor in infected cells and, to be active,
must be cleaved to two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2(3,4). For SARS-CoV-

2 the cleavage is catalysed by furin, a host cell protease, which cleaves the S
protein precursor at a specific sequence motif that generates a polybasic ArgArg-Ala-Arg (RRAR) C-terminal sequence on S1. This sequence motif
conforms to the C-end rule (CendR), which means that the C-terminal
sequence may allow the protein to associate with cell surface neuropilin-1
(NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors5. Here we demonstrate using
immunoprecipitation, site-specific mutagenesis, structural modelling, and
antibody blockade that, in addition to engaging the known receptor ACE2, S1
can bind to NRP1 through the canonical CendR mechanism. This interaction
enhances infection by SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. NRP1 thus serves as a host
factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provides a therapeutic target for COVID19.
A striking difference in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is the presence,
in the former, of a polybasic sequence motif, RRAR, at the S1/S2 boundary. It
provides a cleavage site for a proprotein convertase, furin, a membrane-bound host
cell protease3-5 (Figure 1A). The resulting two proteins, S1 and S2, remain noncovalently associated, with the serine protease TMPRSS2 further priming the S2
protein by proteolytic cleavage6. Several observations indicate that the furinmediated processing of the S protein increases the infection and affects the tropism
of SARS-CoV-2(3-5). Proprotein convertase inhibitors that target furin robustly
diminish SARS-CoV-2 entry into Calu-3 and HeLa cells exogenously expressing
ACE2(7). Moreover, furin knockdown impairs S processing, and abrogation of the
polybasic site in the S reduces syncytia formation in infected cells4,7.
We noticed that the C-terminus of the S1 protein generated by furin has a polybasic
amino acid sequence (682RRAR685), that conforms to a [R/K]XX[R/K] motif, termed
the ‘C-end rule’ (CendR) (Figure 1B)8. CendR motifs bind to neuropilin-1 (NRP1)
and NRP2, dimeric transmembrane receptors that regulate pleiotropic biological
processes, including axon guidance, angiogenesis and vascular permeability8-10.
To explore the possible association of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein with neuropilins
we engineered a HEK293T cell line to stably express SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In this
line we transiently expressed full length NRP1 tagged at the C-terminus with GFP

(NRP1-GFP). Following a GFP-nanotrap, the isolates were probed with an antibody
raised against S1. It was found that NRP1-GFP was associated with a number of
proteins some of which could be S1-processed versions of the S protein (Figure 1C).
To test this possibility, we transiently co-expressed HEK293T cells with GFP-tagged
S1 (GFP-S1) and mCherry-tagged mouse Nrp1 (Nrp1-mCherry). mCherry-nanotrap
established that Nrp1 associated with the S1 protein (Figure 1D – comparable
binding was also observed with NRP2-mCherry (Extended Figure 1A). That
deletion of the terminal

682RRAR685

residues reduced S protein binding indicated the

association largely depended on the CendR motif (Figure 1D). Residual binding was
observed with the ΔRRAR mutant indicating an additional CendR-independent
association between Nrp1 and the S1 protein.
To establish the functional relevance of this interaction, we first generated HeLa wild
type and NRP1 knock out cell lines stably expressing ACE2, designated as
HeLaWT+ACE2 and HeLaNRP1KO+ACE2, respectively. The two cell lines were then
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ001/2020)
and the cells fixed 16 hours post infection (h.p.i.) (Figure 1E). The level of ACE2
protein expression was comparable between these lines (Figure 1F). Infection was
visualized and quantified by staining with an anti-SARS nucleocapsid (N) polyclonal
antibody (Figure 1G). The percentage of infected cells was 73% lower in the
HeLaNRP1KO+ACE2 cells compared to HeLaWT+ACE2 cells (Figure 1G).
We also noted that SARS-CoV-2-infected HeLaWT+ACE2 cells displayed a distinct
multi-nucleated syncytia cell pattern, as reported by others5. We developed an image
analysis algorithm using supervised machine learning to distinguish and quantify the
multi-nucleated and single-cell infections of SARS-CoV-2 (Extended Figure 2)11. Of
infected HeLaWT+ACE2 cells, the majority (83%) formed syncytia while in
HeLaNRP1KO+ACE2 cells this multi-nucleated cell phenotype was less prevalent
(Figure 1H). Together these data establish that NRP1 promotes SARS-CoV-2
infection.
The extracellular regions of NRP1 and NRP2 are composed of two complementary
binding CUB domains (a1 and a2), two coagulation factor domains (b1 and b2), and
a MAM domain (c1). Of these, particularly important is the b1 domain that contains

the specific binding site for CendR motifs, with the b2 domain further stabilising this
interaction (Figure 2A)12. When we co-expressed the mCherry-b1 domain of human
NRP1 together with GFP-S1, the single domain alone was sufficient for
immunoprecipitation by the viral protein (Figure 2B). A construct with both b1 and b2
(mCherry-b1b2) displayed elevated association compared to b1 alone and full-length
Nrp1-mCherry (Figure 2B). The S1 C-terminal residues 493-685 immunoprecipitated
mCherry-b1b2 to a greater extent than full length S1, further narrowing the binding
interface between the S1 C-terminus and NRP1 b1b2 domains (Extended Figure
1B). Based on the crystal structure of NRP1 bound to the CendR motif of VEGFA164(12), we generated molecular models of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 C-terminus
(678TNSPRRAR685) bound to the b1 domain of NRP1 (Figure 2C). The S1 Cterminus model closely resembled that of endogenous CendR motifs bound to NRP1,
consistent with the guanidino group of S1 R685 establishing a salt-bridge with the
NRP1 carboxylate of D320(12). In the NRP1 b1 domain, T316 sits at the base of the
CendR binding pocket, which in the case of VEGF-A164 controls ligand occupancy12.
The S1 C-terminal carboxylate was predicted to interact mainly with the backbone
amides of NRP1, namely K347 and E348 (Figure 2C).
Based on this model, we investigated whether two key residues (R685 of S1 and
T316 of NRP1) contributed to the interaction between S1 and NRP1. Site-directed
mutagenesis of R685 of S1493-685 to aspartic acid reduced S1 association with the
NRP1 b1 domain by greater than 75 % (Figure 2D). Site-directed mutagenesis of
T316 to arginine within mCherry-b1 reduced association with GFP-S1493-685, more
than 80%, consistent with its inhibitory impact on VEGF-A164 binding12 (Figure 2E).
Finally, to evaluate the interaction of NRP1 with trimeric S on the surface of virions,
we incubated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviral particles harbouring
SARS-CoV-2 S protein with wild type mCherry-b1 or mCherry-b1(T316R)
immobilised on mCherry-nanotrap beads (Figure 2F). Wild type mCherry-b1
immunoprecipitated proteins that could correspond to processed forms of S1,
whereas the T316R mutant did not (Figure 2F).
To test the functional relevance of this association, we transiently expressed GFP,
NRP1-GFP or NRP1(T316R)-GFP in HeLaNRP1KO+ACE2 cells. Wild type and
NRP1(T316R) mutant expression and ACE2 expression levels were comparable

(Figure 3A) and like wild type NRP1, NRP1(T316R)-GFP retained a localisation to
the cell surface (Figure 3B). When these cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2, viral
infection was significantly enhanced in cells expressing NRP1-GFP compared to
GFP control, whereas cells expressing the T316R mutant failed to rescue infection
(Figure 3C). This established that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 CendR (682RRAR685) and
NRP1 interaction promotes infection.
To evaluate the biological importance of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 interaction with NRP1,
we turned to analysing infection of Caco-2 (human colon adenocarcinoma) and Calu3 (human lung cancer) cells. Incubation of these cells with recombinant ACE2
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by greater than 75%, presumably by binding to S1
and inhibiting interaction with ACE2 on the cell surface (Figure 3D). To establish the
importance of the interaction with NRP1, we screened a series of monoclonal
antibodies (mAb#1, mAb#2, mAb#3) raised against the NRP1 b1b2 ectodomain. All
three monoclonal antibodies bound to the NRP1 b1b2 domain but only mAb#3
bound to the CendR-binding pocket (Figure 3E, Extended Figure 3A), as defined
by a reduced ability to bind to a b1b2 mutant that targets residues (S346, E348,
T349) at the opening of the binding pocket12 (Figure 2C). All three monoclonal
antibodies displayed staining by immunofluorescence in NRP1-expressing PPC-1
human primary prostate cancer cells but not in M21 human melanoma cells that do
not express NRP1(8) (Extended Figure 3B). Using mAb#3 and a control monoclonal
antibody targeting avian influenza A virus (H11N3) hemagglutinin we found that
mAb#3 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells by 38% (Figure
3F).
The molecular and cell biological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain
largely unexplored. Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on priming by host cell
proteases, including at the S1/S2 site, and the S2’ site which drives fusion with
cellular membranes5,6,14. Our data indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binds to
cell surface receptor NRP1 via the S1 CendR motif generated by the furin cleavage
of S1/S2. This interaction promotes infection by SARS-CoV-2 in physiologically
relevant cell lines widely used in the study of COVID-19. The molecular basis for the
effect is unclear, but neuropilins are known to mediate the internalisation of CendR
ligands through an endocytic process resembling macropinocytosis, and additionally

serve as activators of receptor tyrosine kinases to mediate cell signalling 8,15. S1
binding to NRP1 may therefore contribute to viral entry and survival within the host
cell. Interstingly, gene expression analysis of lung tissue from COVID-19 patients
recently revealed an up-regulation of NRP1 and NRP2(16).
A SARS-CoV-2 virus with a natural deletion of the S1/S2 furin cleavage site
demonstrated attenuated pathogenicity in hamster models, causing less alveolar
damage17. NRP1 binding to the CendR-motif in S1 is thus likely to play a role in the
increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. The interaction
between S1 and NRP1 can be reduced by monoclonal antibodies that bind to the
CendR-binding pocket of NRP1 b1. Disrupting CendR-peptide binding to neuropilins
by antibodies and oligopeptide/peptidomimetics has been recognised as a potential
anti-cancer strategy18-25, and the same approach may provide a route to COVID-19
therapies.
It is noteworthy that many other viruses including highly pathogenic influenza, alpha-,
flavi- and retroviruses undergo furin cleavages and acquire a C-terminus that
conforms to the CendR, which make them potential ligands for neuropilin binding 26-28.
They also include certain human β-coronaviruses of separate lineages such as
Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS)-CoV, and human
coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1)(28). Taken together, we conclude that neuropilins
are emerging targets in the urgent research and treatment of COVID-19 and, more
broadly, important host factors to be considered in the wider context of viral entry
mechanisms.

IFA 1:2000), mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody [1A9] (S2 epitope) (GeneTex,
GTX632604, WB 1:1000). Recombinant human ACE2 was purchased from Sino
Biological (10108-H08H). The monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin of
influenza A/duck/New Zealand/164/76(H11N3) was a kind gift of Robert Webster.
Cell culture and transfection
Calu-3, Caco-2 (a kind gift from Dr Darryl Hill), HeLa, HEK293T and Vero E6 cell
lines were originally sourced from the American Type Culture Collection.
Authentication was from the American Type Culture Collection. We did not
independently authenticate the cell lines. Cells were grown in DMEM medium
(Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS (Sigma-Aldrich) and
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) with the exception of Calu-3 cells that were grown in
Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM+GlutaMAX; GibcoTM, ThermoFischer)
supplemented with 10% FCS 0.1mM non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 1mM
sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml streptomycin and 100 μg/ml penicillin. Caco-2 cells were
maintained in DMEM+GlutaMAX, 10% FCS and 0.1mM NEAA. FuGENE HD
(Promega) was used for transient transfection of DNA constructs for infection assays
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PPC-1 human primary prostate cancer cells were obtained from Erkki Ruoslahti
laboratory at Cancer Research Center, Sanford-Burnham-Prebys Medical Discovery
Institute. M21 human melanoma cells were obtained from David Cheresh at
University of California San Diego. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing
100 IU/mL of streptomycin, penicillin, and 10% FBS in 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.
To generate a NRP1-null HeLa cell line, the following guide RNA was cloned into
pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459): 5’-GATCGACGTTAGCTCCAACG-3’. gRNA was
transfected into HeLa cells using FuGENE HD. 24 hours later, transfected cells were
selected with puromycin. Selected cells were trypsinised and diluted to a
concentration of 2.5 cells mL-1 in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich). 200 µL of this suspension
was plated into 96-well plates to seed single cell colonies. After three weeks,
colonies were expanded and lysed, and knockout was validated by immunoblotting
for NRP1.

SARS-CoV-2 isolation and infection
A clinical specimen in viral transport medium, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive by
qRT-PCR (kindly proved by Dr Lance Turtle, University of Liverpool), was adjusted to
2 ml with OptiMEM (Gibco™, ThermoFisher), filtered through a 0.2 µm filter and
used to infect Vero E6 cells. After 1 h the inoculum was diluted 1:3 (vol/vol) with
MEM supplemented with 2% FCS and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for
5 days. The culture supernatant was passaged twice more on Vero E6 cells until
cytopathic effect was observed and then once on Caco-2 cells to produce the stock
used in the experiments. The intracellular viral genome sequence and the titre of
virus in the supernatant were determined as previously described 29 and the virus
termed SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020. For virus infections, virus
was added directly to culture medium of the target cells in a 96-well plate at the
required infectious dose and the plates incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The culture
supernatant was removed, and the cells fixed with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 1 h at room temperature. All work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 was done
inside a class III microbiological safety cabinet in a containment level 3 facility at the
University of Bristol.
Pseudotyped virus generation
The VSVΔG system was used to generate pseudovirus particles decorated with
SARS-2-S as described previously5,30 with some modifications. Briefly, HEK293T
cells were grown in 100 mm diameter dishes to 90% confluency and were

g for 10 minutes. For immunoprecipitation experiments, VSV pseudoviral particles
were concentrated 10-fold using 100KDa Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filter units.
Infection assays, indirect immunofluorescence, automated confocal imaging
For infection assays, cells seeded in Clear 96-well Microplates (Greiner Bio-one)
were infected with SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ001/2020 isolate in MEM,
2% FCS, supplemented with 0.1mM NEAA and fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 16 h.p.i.
After permeabilisation with 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS, 1% BSA, the cells were
blocked and stained in 1% BSA in PBS containing anti-SARS Nucleocapsid (N)
rabbit polyclonal antibody or anti-SARS Spike (S) monoclonal antibody and further
stained with Hoechst (1:10000) and appropriate Alexa Fluor (488/594/647)conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The stained plates were
imaged using an automated high-content spinning-disk microscope CQ1 (Confocal
Quantitative Image Cytometer, Yokogawa, Japan) using UPlanSApo 10x/0.4na,
UPlanSApo 20x/0.75na or UPlanSApo 40x/0.95na objectives (Olympus, Japan). To
capture a single 96-well, 20 fields (with 10x objective) or 80 fields (20x) were imaged
by z-stacks at 5 μm intervals and maximum intensity projected for analysis.

coverslips and allowed to grow until the next day. The medium was removed, the
cells were washed twice with PBS pH 7.4, and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min
at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS and once with PBST
(PBS with 0.05 % Tween-20). Blocking buffer (5% BSA, 5% FBS, 5% goat serum in

temperature. After three washes with PBS, the cells were mounted on glass slides
with mounting media (Fluoromount-G; Electron Microscopy Sciences) and sealed
with nail polish. A confocal microscope FV1200MPE (Olympus, Japan) was used for
cell imaging with an UPlanSApo 60x/1.35na objective (Olympus, Japan). The images
were analyzed using Olympus FluoView Ver.4.2a Viewer software.
Image analysis
Projected images taken with a 20x objective were used for image analysis for singlecell and multinucleated cell infection image analysis with supervised machine
learning. Image processing was performed using the BIAS software (Single-Cell
Technologies Inc., Hungary). Firstly, images of each fluorescence channel were
corrected using the CIDRE illumination correction method31. Individual cell nuclei
were detected by a deep machine learning-based segmentation algorithm
NucleAIzer11. Cellular cytoplasm were detected both on the green and red channels
using UNET to enhance fluorescence images32. The method was trained to precisely
delineate often faint signals in the cytoplasm. Cellular phenotypes were assigned to
each individual nucleus. These are infected cells which contain a single nucleus
(Single Cell Infection), those that contain more multiple nuclei (Multi Nuclei Infection)
as observed in the distinct cell-cell fusion syncytia phenotype. Supervised machine
learning was used for phenotypic assignment. The decisions were based on singlecell and its microenvironment’s morphology and intensity features33. Final statistics
include the number of multi-nucleated cells, the average number of nuclei in these
cells and the count of other phenotypic classes. Yokogawa CQ1 was also used for
image quantification.
Generation of Stable Lentiviral Cell Lines
The genes of interest were subcloned into the lentiviral vector pLVX for the
generation of lentiviral particles. Lentiviral particles were produced and harvested in
HEK293T cells. HeLa cells were transduced with lentiviral particles to produce stably
expressing cell lines. Transduced HeLa and HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS and penicillin/streptomycin and grown at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following transduction, pLVX-expressing cells were selected
with puromycin or blasticidin accordingly.

Immunoprecipitation and Quantitative Western Blot Analysis
Cells were lysed in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail for
western blotting. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and equal amounts were resolved on NuPAGE 4–12%
precast gels (Invitrogen). Blotting was performed onto polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes (Immobilon-FL, EMD Millipore), followed by detection using the Odyssey
infrared scanning system (LI-COR Biosciences). When using the Odyssey, we
routinely performed western blot analysis where a single blot was simultaneously
probed with antibodies against two proteins of interest (distinct antibody species),
followed by visualization with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to
distinct spectral dyes.
For the GFP- and mCherry-based immunoprecipitations, HEK293T cells were
transfected with GFP or mCherry constructs using polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich).
The cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50mM Tris–HCl, 0.5% NP-40
PBS with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) 24hr after transfection and subjected to
GFP-trap

beads.

Following

immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed twice in 50mM Tris-HCl, 0.25% NP40
PBS with protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5, and once in 50mM Tris-HCl PBS with
protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5, before boiling in 2X LDS sample loading buffer for
elution. Immunoblotting was performed using standard procedures. Detection was
performed on an Odyssey infrared scanning system (LI-COR Biosciences) using
fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies.
For immunoprecipitation of the VSV-Spike pseudotyped virus, mCherry, mCherry-b1
and mCherry-b1 T316R were transfected into HEK293T cells the day before
immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in 50mM Tris-HCl 0.5% NP40 PBS with
protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000
g for 10 minutes at 4°C. From the resulting supernatant, an input fraction was
reserved, and the rest incubated with mCherry-nanotrap beads to rotate for 1 hour at
4°C. Following enrichment of mCherry constructs, the beads were washed twice in
50mM Tris-HCl 0.25% NP40 PBS with protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5, and twice
in 50mM Tris-HCl PBS with protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5, to removed residual

immunoprecipitation, the beads were again washed twice in 50mM Tris-HCl 0.25%
NP40 PBS with protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5, and twice in 50mM Tris-HCl PBS

ELISA assay with monoclonal antibodies
High affinity protein-binding 96-well plates (NuncTM MaxisorpTM Cat No. 442404)
were coated with 1 µg of protein (100 µL of 10 µg/mL of protein solution in PBS)
overnight at 37°C. The wells were washed 5 times with PBS and blocked for 1 h at
37°C with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.1%Tween-20 in PBS). The mAb dilutions in
blocking buffer were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The wells
were washed 5 times with blocking buffer and the peroxidase-conjugated affinity
pure donkey anti-mouse IgG (Immuno Research Laboratories) was added (diluted 1
in 20.000 in blocking buffer). The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37°C and washed 5
times with blocking buffer. The peroxidase substrate (TMB Peroxidase EIA Substrate
Kit #1721067, Bio-Rad) was added as described in the manufacturer instructions.
The absorbance of the samples was read at 655 nm using Tecan Sunrise microplate
reader (Tecan, Switzerland).
Plasmids
The SARS-CoV-2 S gene was cloned into pLVX vectors using a commercially
synthesized EGFP-S gene fusion plasmid (the S gene sequence was that of SARSCoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank: MN908947.3; GeneArt, ThermoFischer) as a
template by Gibson assembly (NEB). For the untagged version, in brief, the S gene
was amplified using overlapping primers and cloned into a ‘pLVX-MCS-T2A-Puro’
vector previously digested with EcoRI/BamHI. The isolated S1 constructs and S1
truncations were amplified from commercially synthesized plasmids (GeneArt,
ThermoFischer) encompassing nucleotides 20021 – 22960 and 22891 – 28830 of
the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) and cloned
in pEGFP.C1 using KpnI/BamHI. Mouse Nrp1-mCherry was a kind gift from
Donatella Valdembri. pEGFP-NRP1 and pEGFP-NRP2 were kind gifts from MuSheng Zeng.

Molecular Modelling of NRP1 b1 Domain Binding to S1 TNSPRRAR Peptide
The 4DEQ.pdb crystal structure of the VEGF-A peptide attached to the type C1
domain of NRP1 via a linker was used to model the potential for the furin-cleaved S
protein from SARS-CoV-2 to bind. A model of the S protein with loops intact had
been previously assembled from the cryo-EM structures pdbs 6VXX and 6VSB.
From this model, the TNSPRRAR residues pertaining to the post-furin cleaved, Cterminus of the S1 domain of the S protein from SARS-CoV2 were placed into the
NRP1 binding site, guided by the position of the VEGF-A PRR residues in 4DEQ.pdb.
System setup: Gromacs was used to prepare and run the simulation. Hydrogen
atoms were added to the NRP1/S peptide complex consistent with pH 7 and
surrounded by a box 2 nm larger than the polypeptide in each dimension and filled
with TIP3P water. Random water molecules were replaced by sodium and chloride
ions to give a neutral (uncharged overall) box and an ionic strength of 0.15 M. The
system was subjected to 1000 steps of energy minimisation prior to a positionrestrained trajectory to produce velocities in which the protein atoms were restrained,
but the water molecules allowed to move.
Simulation details: The resulting system was subjected to a short molecular
dynamics simulation to see if the peptide remained bound and to allow the peptide to
adopt a comfortable binding position. This simulation was performed as an NPT
ensemble at 310 K using periodic boundary conditions. Short range electrostatic and
van der Waals’ interactions were truncated at 1.4 nm while long range electrostatics
were treated with the particle-mesh Ewald’s method and a long-range dispersion
correction applied. Pressure was controlled by the Berendsen barostat and
temperature by the V-rescale thermostat. The leap-frog algorithm was used to
integrate over a 2 fs time step, constraining bond vibrations with the P-LINCS
method. Structures were saved every 0.1 ns for analysis and run over 20 ns.
Simulation data were accumulated on the Bristol BrisSynBio supercomputer
Bluegem.
Software: The GROMACS-2019.1 suite of software was used to set up and perform
the molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular graphics manipulations and
visualisations were performed using VMD-1.9.3 and Chimera64-1.14.
The peptide remained bound throughout and appeared to settle into an eminently

plausible binding pose. There was room to easily accommodate the rest of the S1
spike protein domain when aligned with the TNSPRRAR peptide in complex with
NRP1.

ACE2 in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells. Cells were pre-treated with recombinant ACE2 (10
µg/mL) for 1 h prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 16 h.p.i. the cells were fixed and
stained for SARS-CoV-2-N, and infection was quantified. Two-tailed unpaired t-test;
P <0.001 (n=3 independent experiments) (E). ELISA of anti-NRP1 monoclonal
antibodies (mAb#1, mAb#2, mAb#3) diluted 1/10 using plates coated with NRP1
b1b2 wild type, b1b2 mutant (S346A, E348A, T349A) or BSA, used as control. No
mAb was also used as a control. Binding is represented as arbitrary units of
absorbance at 655 nm. (F). mAb#3 reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in Caco-2 and
Calu-3 cells. Cells were pretreated with 50 µg/mL of anti-avian influenza A virus
hemagglutinin (H11N3) (Ctrl) mAb or mAb#3 for 1 h followed by infection with SARSCoV-2. Cells were fixed at 16 h.p.i. and stained for SARS-CoV-2-N and Hoechst to
stain nuclei. p=0.002 (Caco-2) and p=0.032 (Calu-3) (n=3 independent experiments).
The bars, error bars and circles represent the mean, s.e.m. and individual data

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
Extended Figure 1. a. SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein also interacts with NRP2. Coimmunoprecipitation of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein by Nrp1 and NRP2 in HEK293T
cells. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with combinations of GFP-tagged S1 and
mCherry-tagged Nrp1 or NRP2 and subjected to a mCherry-trap based
immunoprecipitation. Summary of the relative levels of binding. The band intensities
were measured from n= 3 independent experiments using Odyssey software. The
band intensities, normalized to mCherry expression, are presented as the average
fraction relative to the amount of S1 immunoprecipitated by Nrp1-mCherry. two-tailed
unpaired t-test; P= 0.2421. b. The 493-685 portion of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein has
enhanced interaction with NRP1 b1b2. HEK293T cells were co-transfected to express
GFP-tagged S1 or GFP-tagged S1 493-685 and mCherry-tagged NRP1 b1b2.
Extended Figure 2. Image processing and phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2 infected
cells. a) Original image of SARS-CoV-2 N signal (green) and enhanced image (red)
using UNET deep learning algorithm. b) Single-cell segmentation of the nuclei using
the nucleAIzer deep learning algorithm, and the cytoplasmic region based on global
thresholding of the UNET enhanced image. c) Morphology, shape and intensity
features of single-cells and their microenvironment are extracted. d) Machine learningbased phenotyping of single cells into non-infected, single-nuclei infected and multinucleated cells. Features include morphology, intensity and texture descriptor
numbers. Ci: features of the i_th cell, Cj: features of the j_th cell.
Extended Figure 3
A) Binding of mAbs to wild type and mutant NRP-1. The binding, tested by ELISA at
two different dilutions of mAbs, is represented as arbitrary units of absorbance. BSA
was used as a negative control. B) Fluorescence confocal images of NRP1-positive
prostate cancer cells (PPC-1) and NRP1-negative melanoma cells (M21) incubated
with the monoclonal antibodies. Fixed cells on coverslips were incubated with the
mAbs for 1 h and immunostained with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 546 goat
anti-mouse IgG. Representative images from three independent experiments are
shown. Blue: DAPI (nuclei staining); Red: antibody signal. Scale bar; 20 µm.
