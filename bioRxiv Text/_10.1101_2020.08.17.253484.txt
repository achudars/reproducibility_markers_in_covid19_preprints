Abstract
This study aims to highlight SARS-COV-2 mutations which are associated with increased or
decreased viral virulence. We utilize, genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and
countries’ regional information such as deaths and cases per million as well as covid-19-related
public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of
specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By
applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from
standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of
selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N
(P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased
deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing
association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure
prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that
significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.

Introduction
First cases of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were
reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China[1] last December 2019. Since then, SARS-CoV2 has become the cause of the severe respiratory corona virus disease (COVID-19)[2], an
epidemic initially declared in China[3], that over the course of 2-3 months spread globally to
become a pandemic with grave repercussions (March 11th 2020, WHO publicly declared
pandemic). The World Health Organization (WHO) reported: over 4.8 million confirmed cases
of COVID-19, and over 316,000 deaths (report date: May 18th).
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, with a non-segmented, positive-sense (+ssRNA)
genome of ~30 kb, amongst the largest identified riboviria RNA genomes[4,5]. It is believed
to have originated from the bat coronavius Bat CoV RaTG13 (~96% identity)[6]. This is third
outbreak of pathogenic zoonotic betacoronaviruses[6–10] within the last two decades,
following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002[11], and
the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS-CoV in 2012. However, these two predecessors
were confined to epidemic proportions. So, what makes SARS-CoV-2 the cause of a pandemic
unmatched by the previous two recent respirator syndromes (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV)?
The efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to a delicate balance between its transmission
rate (high); and mortality rate (moderately high – compared to other two recent syndromes). It
is difficult to accurately estimate differences in transmissibility and mortality because they are
dependent on multiple factors which, vary significantly from one region to another. These
factors include regional factors such as (i) access to testing, (ii) differences in clinical care, (iii)
population demographic differences such as age and (iv) differences in weather conditions (e.g.
heat and humidity). Nevertheless, current estimates for the basic transmissibility, commonly
range between 2-5[12,13]. Estimates of mortality, deaths per confirmed cases average at 3.6%
globally[14,15] SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although both had higher death rates than SARS2

CoV-2 11%[16] and 35% mortality respectively[10,11], their transmission rates were
significantly lower 1.5-2[12,17] and <1[17] respectively.
The transmission and mortality rates described above, provide clues as to how to study SARSCoV-2 and devise strategies to investigate its genome taking under reconsideration its overall
efficiency. Although the observed sequence diversity among SARS-CoV-2 strains is low, its
rapid transmission rate provides ample opportunity for natural selection to act upon a range of
viral mutations. High mutation frequency of a given position can be the consequence of one of
two reasons: (i) either the mutation is in a neutral genomic region that allows for leniency in
the frequency of changes with little or no impact virulence. (ii) The mutation is beneficial and
actually provides a selective advantage to a viral strain enhancing its efficiency and overall
propagation.
It is known that an “efficient” virus does not result in death for the underlining host. Therefore,
the overall high transmission and moderate mortality rates of SARS-CoV-2 are what make this
virus pandemic material.
The first SARS-CoV-2 strain to be sequenced was the index strain from Wuhan[18]. Currently
the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database, stores >23,000 SARSCoV-2 strains (some of which are full-length sequences with high-coverage).
In this study, we capitalize on the ample amount of COVID information currently available
through GISAID database and utilize it to develop a combined phylogenetic and statistical
analysis that entails modelling the virulence of all mutations found across the SARS-CoV-2
strains sequenced to date. Our approach makes use of multiple sequence alignment (msa) tools
(MAFFT)[19] and phylogenetic tree reconstruction methods (RAxML)[20] to obtain a map of
all mutations in a variant calling format (vcf). The latter was done using snp_sites[21] tool
maintained by sanger-pathogens, which characterizes genotypes for all the mutations (SNPs)
found across all available sequenced strains in the msa. Our main objective is to highlight
mutations which are associated with increased or decreased virulence, by using genetic data

and countries’ regional information on deaths and cases per million. Initial indications of
selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies
across viral strains, which are obtained throughout the months of the COVID pandemic. These
indicators include: (i) an increased frequency of strains that display a particular mutation over
time in one region. (ii) Frequent recurrence of a specific mutation across different geographical
regions. This would also be observed as nodes found on different branches of a phylogenetic
tree. (iii) The existence of silent mutations, where a change at the nucleotide level (or codon),
does not results in a subsequent change in the amino acid or the function of the overall protein.
The threshold for identifying significant mutations can be set arbitrarily as done in[22] for the
spike protein. However, by employing generalized linear models (GLMs) we reach an
informed way to select mutations and provide additional information that is not evident from
standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. Subsequently, we select informative
mutations and perform structural and conformational predictions of mutated and reference
(according to initial Wuhan strain) proteins in order to investigate their effect on tertiary and
quaternary protein structure. We propose two interesting mutations found in the nucleocaspid
(N) (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H) genes; that appear to be significantly associated with either
increased or decreased deaths and cases per million according to our GLMs. Moreover, we
show that the predicted conformations of the mutated protein are substantially different to the
predicted reference structure.

Results
Statistical modelling for predicting key mutations for SARV-COV-2
The approach employed in this study provides an informed way of selecting mutations by
applying GLMs fitted on various outcome and predictor variables. These include outcome
variables: (i) deaths and (ii) cases per million information derived from the GISAID metadata
file and predictor variables: (i) percent of occurrence of each mutation in strains found across

different countries, (ii) binary mutation information (“0” absence of mutation, “1” presence of
mutation), and (iii) country austerity measure response time. Our models are specifically
designed to provide statistical evidence for fitting outcome variables that characterize the
efficiency of the viral strains (e.g. death rates, transmission rates) with predictor variables such
as the specific mutation occurrence found in populations and genotype information across all
available strains. We are aware that genetic factors such as mutations frequencies are not the
only variables that govern country death rates and transmission rates. Therefore, in addition to
aforementioned predictor variables, we also consider the individual countries’ austerity
measure response time as reported by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response tracker
data[23]. Two different types of models were constructed using: a) cases per million as the
outcome variable and b) deaths per million as the outcome variable. Both generated unique
results and ranked mutations in different order. Differences between model predictions provide
valuable information on specific mutations (see next sections). We report the results from using
both models types (a,b). Observing the top scoring mutations (see Tables 1 and 2) and
analysing them with respect to their frequency across populations, provides valuable
information with respect to their effect on viral virulence (see next section). In addition,
excluding the response time from our predictor variables significantly alters the top ranked
mutations and furthermore results in omission of some mutations from the top ranked
significance lists seen in Tables 1 and 2 (see supplementary Table S1 and S2 for full list of
ranked mutations using GLMs excluding response time from the predictor variables). To
provide GLMs that characterize the circumstances responsible for changes in deaths and cases
per million as accurately as possible, we decided to include response time as a predictor variable
in all of our GLM fitting applications.

in genomic plots for the SARS-CoV-2 virus strains[26]. Notable examples include: 1)
Mutations at position 14408 (codon 314), 3037 (codon 924) and 11083 (codon 3606) on the
ORF1ab[25], that show a high frequency of occurrence (0.65, 0.65 and 1.3 respectively) across
viral strains sequenced to date. 2) The very cosmopolitan mutation on position 23403 (codon
614[22], frequency 0.65) of the S protein (see Fig 1). 3) The highest frequency peeks found in
the N protein at positions 28881-28883[25] (codons 203, 204 respectively). 4) Well known high
frequency mutations found in the ORF3a gene such as mutation at position 26144 (codon
251)[25].
Mutations of interest for studying the efficiency of SARS-COV-2
What we consider as the most significant contribution of our model, is that it also highlights
less studied mutations that appear to correlate with death and contamination rates. We highlight
two mutations of relatively low global frequencies (see Fig 1): 1) Mutation at position 28311
characterized by a P to L change on codon 13 (P13L) in the N protein. 2) Mutation at position
25563 on codon 57 of the ORF3a protein characterised by a Q to H (Q57H) amino acid change.
These mutations were selected because of their highly significant ranking according to our
GLMs (see Tables 1 and 2). In the case of P13L, this mutations attained high significance (pvalues: 0.002 and 0.005) according to our models. In addition, what rendered this mutation
interesting for further analysis, was its negative correlation with both deaths and cases per
million (see Fig 2A,B). Albeit it showed a lower frequency of occurrence across different
countries and in the general population (see Fig 1). In the case of Q57H, this mutation showed
high significance according to type a models (p-value: 0.007) however, it was not deemed
significant according to type b models. It was, however, selected due to its unique correlation
patterns showing opposing decreasing and increasing death and transmission rates respectively
(see Fig 3A,B). Q57H has an elevated frequency level across countries and in the overall
population (see Fig 1). Our highlighted mutations were also compared to the well-studied
D614G mutation in our consecutive detailed analyses (see Fig S1).

The P13L mutation tracking analysis
The P13L mutation is characterized by a change from C-to-T,Y(C or T),G base change at
position 28311 in the Wuhan reference strain. It is a highly significant mutation according to
our GLMs and moreover appears to be significant even when taking in consideration the
country austerity measures response time. P13L is being tracked by the GISAID, we refer to
the clade of sequences that constitute this mutation as the “P13L” clade (see Fig S2 for the
P13L phylogenetic clade position on our ML tree). It is present in 1.9% of the global samples,
and shows a global distribution appearing in Asia, America and Australia and the UK. It has
not yet been analysed in depth and we propose an important role for this mutation in viral
stability and overall virulence. The data available for study (12/05/2020), are in accordance
with a founder effect in Asia, followed by an increase in Australian samples. During March and
April, sampling of the data from GISAID showed that the mutation frequency was further
spreading in Asia and then shifting to the UK and the Americas. The observed geographic
spread is consistent with that of a mutation showing early signs of an expanding global
frequency (Fig 4A).

Mutation tracking across countries with available adequate sampling, revealed a consistent
pattern of mutation spreading. In countries where sequences were sampled before March (e.g.
Korea, Australia, UK, USA), the reference P13L (REF-P13L) form appeared to be dominate in
this early period of the pandemic (Fig 4A). The introduction of alternate P13L (ALT- P13L) in
the population, was followed by a rise in its frequency, and in some cases ALT-P13L
constituted ~50% of the population (Fig 4A).
In the UK, the ALT-P13L form began circulating later in the pandemic (April). Through March,
ALT-P13L became documented in South America, and it constituted a substantial percent of
contemporary sampling (Fig 4A). In North America, initial infected samples across the
continent showed an establishment of the original REF-P13L form, as the pandemic progressed,
the ALT-P13L appeared in both USA and Canada, becoming a well-documented form in both
nations by the end of March.
Australia follows a similar transition pattern, from REF-P13L to ALT-P13L, as described
above, however the introduction of the mutation in the Australian population appears to have
preceded that of USA and Canada. In fact the earliest ALT-P13L mutation outside of Asia was
identified in Australia (NSW25.2020.EPI_ISL_417388.2020.03.05.Oceania). This can account
for the much higher frequencies (~10 times) of the ALT-P13L form observed in Australia
compared to the former two countries. Most Asian samples showed a dominance of the original
Wuhan REF-P13L form in early in the pandemic (February), however for Asian countries
outside of China, the ALT-P13L form was well-documented and becoming established by
March (Fig 4A). It is difficult to track the P13L mutation in China due to the lack of available

Chinese sequences in GISAID after March 1st. Sparse sampling, as observed in South America
and Africa, can affect mutation tracking, and this has to be taken under consideration when
analysing frequency plots (Fig 4A). In summary, our analysis of the data shows that the REFP13L form may be under selective advantage as shown by persistent, recurring transitions to
the ALT-P13L form in multiple regional geographical location throughout the pandemic.

The Q57H mutation tracking analysis
The Q57H mutation has previously been studied in detail[24] so we do not perform a detailed
mutation tracking for this mutation. For completion we show relative frequencies of the
mutation across time (Fig 4B) consistent with its founder effect in Europe and its transmission
across the globe. Although previously studied, the Q57H mutation has not been associated with
virulence and the precise mechanism for its selective advantage and increased frequency across
populations has not been investigated. It has a relatively high frequency of occurrence
according to the GISAID data analysed in this study (>0.26). The observed opposing
correlations with deaths and cases reported per million according to demographic data,
presented in our study may provide clues for the increased frequency of this mutation. As
previously mentioned, the choice for highlighting this mutation is: 1) a consequence of the
significant scores obtained by Q57H by both our model types (see Tables 1 and 2) its unique
pattern of correlation with respect to death and transmission rates. Notably, this mutation is one
of the few (4/100) top significant mutations that exhibit a negative correlation with deaths per
million and a positive correlation with cases per million. This is a suitable pattern for
delineating viral mutation fitness, as preferably a competent virus should have high
transmission rates and relatively moderate death rates to secure its persistence.
For comparison, mutation tracking of the well-studied D614G mutation[22] is also performed
(Fig S3).

P13L and viral transmission and virulence
We hypothesize that if the P13L mutation can affect transmissibility and death rates, it might
also impact severity of disease. High-throughput clinical outcome data for COVID are not
readily available at the moment, therefore we focused on geographic regional data reporting
death and transmission rates according to the Worldometers.info website. Populations
harbouring the mutation show a higher mean death rate compared to the converse. Statistical
analysis of the populations with and without the P13L mutations shows substantial evidence
that the two distributions are significantly different (Wilcoxon test – p-value 2.2e-16) (see Fig
5A). This is in contrast to the results obtained by our model. This discrepancy can be attributed
to the differences between performing univariate statistics to using GLMs. Our models have
the additive advantage to incorporate multiple quantitative factors in consideration, such as the
percent value for each country, while box plot statistics only looks at presence or absence of
mutation in a population. For example Spain has a high death rate shifting the mean up but
only a small percent (0.35%) of the mutation is actually present throughout the population. Our
GLMs are specifically suited to quantify this type of information and provide a more accurate
depiction of the quantitative realm studied here. For comparison reasons we also perform the
analysis performed on the D614G mutations, which shows similar results, with the population
comprising the mutation showing significantly different (Wilcoxon test – p-value 6.1e-15)
increased death rates compared to the referenced-based population (see Fig S4). Similar
phenomena where observed when comparing results using the cases per million parameter to
assess the different distributions (see Fig 5B, and Fig S4B).

Q57H and viral transmission and virulence
The transmissibility and death rates patterns of Q57H mutation are consistent with the high
contamination and low lethality of SARS-CoV-2. Geographic regional data reporting deaths

rates compared to reference populations. However, statistical analysis of the deaths for
populations with and without the Q57H mutations shows evidence that the two distributions
are marginally not different (Wilcoxon test – p-value 0.069 - see Fig 6A). The converse was
observed when comparing results using the cases per million parameter to assess the different
distributions (Wilcoxon test – p-value 1.6e-8 - see Fig 6B). Results here are in total agreement
to our model which predicts a correlation with mutation percent found in each country and cases
per million, while a negative correlation with the deaths per million.
To investigate patterns of the effect of country response time with respect to the death
and transmission rates as well as the mutation genotype, we performed a similar distribution
analysis including the response time in months. The overall analysis for the Q57H mutation
showed both death and transmission rates increased with response times, however there was
significant drop in deaths per million for populations with the ALT-Q57H compared to cases
per million (see Fig 6C,D). This decrease in death rates was especially documented for the 1225 month response group, which also comprised of most of the countries studied (see Fig 6C).
A phenomenon which was observed at a much lesser effect when investigating cases per million
(see Fig 6D). Moreover, it is clear that countries that delayed their response time ultimately
attained more cases and deaths per million[23]. It is evident that these countries also had a
higher occurrence of the ALT-Q57H mutation. This can possibly be attributed to the increased
number of cases in these countries, providing the virus with greater opportunity for natural
selection to act upon this specific mutation.

P13L and potential mechanisms for enhanced fitness
In order to provide an explanation for the reasons why the P13L mutation appears to be
associated with decreased transmission and death rates, we turn to structural prediction and
docking tools. P13L is located on the surface of the Nucleocapsid (N) protein known to form
helical ribonucleocapsids (RNPs) with the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of the

SARS-CoV-2 virus. It also interacts with virus membrane (M) protein and subsequently plays
a fundamental role during virion assembly. The QHD43423 structure of the N protein and
QHD43419 structure of the M protein, were retrieved from the I-TASSER repository
containing the 3D structural models of all proteins encoded by the genome of SARS-CoV-2.
Structures of the REF-P13L and ALT-P13L mutations, exhibited significant differences in
protein stability, with the later presenting a decrease in stability, compared to the REF-P13L
compound (ΔΔG = 0.629±0.012kcal/mol). Both amino acids are exposed to the surface with
RSA values 76.4% and 75.6% for the neutral Proline (P) and hydrophobic Leucine (L) residues,
respectively.
The native 7mer-RNA duplex (PDB ID: 4U37) was used for RNA-protein docking, as
described by Dinesh et al.[27]. RNA-protein docking with HDOCK and MPRDock algorithms,
revealed changes on the assembly of RNP complexes (RMSD 2.719±3.068Å) (Fig 7A,B).
Investigation of the N-M interaction was also carried out. The REF-P13L – M protein complex
exhibited an increase of the binding affinity (ΔG -13.050±0.495kcal/mol and Kd 2.95E10±2.192E-10M)

Q57H and potential mechanisms for enhanced fitness
Structural prediction analysis for the Q57H mutation provides evidence to support its
association with decreased death rates and increased transmission. The ORF3a protein forms
homotetrameric potassium sensitive ion channels (viroporin) and may modulate virus release.
The Q57H mutation is located on the outer surface of the protein and specifically in the binding
domain that is directly involved in the tetramerization process. We performed a structural
analysis using I-Tasser[28] and created high quality tertiary and quaternary structure

predictions for the ORF3a protein (C-score=-3.14, Estimated TM-score = 0.36±0.12, Estimated
RMSD = 13.5±4.0Å). The Gln57 residue is a charge-neutral, polar amino acid, which resides
2 amino acids far the transmembrane region (35-55) of the ORF3a protein. The ALT-Q57H is
defined by a substitution to a positively-charged and polar Histidine (His). Comparison of the
structures obtained using the REF-Q57H mutation and the ALT-Q57H (see Fig 8A,B) show
significant differences both in structural conformation as well as stability. With the later
exhibiting a more stable (-29.0ΔG, Kd = 5.6E-22M) structure affinities for the overall ORF3a
viroporin compared to the former (-26.8ΔG, Kd = 2.3E-20M). Further, in depth molecular
analysis reveals disruption of hydrogen bonds and hampering and shifts in other inter-molecular
interactions in the ALT-Q57H compared to the REF-Q57H structure of the protein (see Fig 8
C,D). The ORF3a protein is known to be involved in the pathway implicated in pore formation
in the host cellular membrane and is crucial in viral budding and release into the external
cellular space. The generation of a more stable structure that can ultimately lead to a more
sustainable viral cycle can be the functional aetiology for observing a greater correlation with
transmission of the virus. However, the fact that the ORF3a protein is not involved in host
receptor recognition and binding, could be the reasoning behind the observation that overall
death rates are not increased as a consequence of this mutation.

Discussion
Investigating viral strain mutation virulence can be a delineating factor in predicting viral
transmission and mortality at a population level. Diagnostic tests that can sequence targeted
viral genomic regions for specific mutations can provide invaluable information to countries
for taking fast and efficient actions in dealing with a pandemic such as that created by the
SARS-CoV-2. This study shows that regression models can be used to provide information at
the SNP level that allows inferences on how mutations are correlated with death rates and
transmission rates.

Frequency level information can only provide information on more

cosmopolitan mutations and less frequent mutations are largely neglected. The use of

generalized linear regression models presented in this study allows for the assessment of all
mutations irrespective of their current frequency, highlighting mutations of interest that are
correlated or anti-correlated with viral virulence. This permits inference on mutations that are
on the rise and potentially can alter strain virulence affecting the overall progression of the virus
across populations. Moreover, external (non-genetic factors) such as countries’ response times
to reach stringent austerity measures can be incorporated in the models, allowing for an accurate
examination of the genetic factors under investigation. A less frequent mutation such as the
P13L mutation on the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, is highlighted using the GLMs constructed
in this study and shows a negative correlation with respect to country deaths and cases per
million. The crystal structure of the N protein has been the focus of other studies revealing
potential drug targeting sites[29]. RNA-protein docking performed in this study show a
potential impact of the ALT-P13L on RNA binding affinity. Furthermore, investigation of the
N-M interaction reveals that the ALT-P13L – M protein complex exhibited a decrease in
binding affinity. These observational allude to a possible affect on virion assembly.
The more frequent but not so well studied Q57H mutation shows patterns that are in
accordance to optimal viral fitness and persistence. At present time statistical analysis
comparing different populations, with and without the aforementioned mutation, appear to
agree with our GLMs in accordance to non-parametric tests, it will be interesting to track this
mutation in future population distributions and examine whether they will exhibit similar
patterns. Moreover, structural analysis of the Q57H shows significant conformational changes
in the ORF3a protein. According to free energy calculations, these are potentially accountable
for a more stable quaternary structure of the protein, possibly leading to an enhanced release of
viral particles, in accordance to its role in host cell pore formation and budding.
Taking the frequently occurring D614G as an example it is evident that this mutation
is becoming the dominant mutation across populations and its rapid spread denotes a natural
selection pressure that shows increased fitness for this mutation. Fitness for a viral mutation
can be governed by factors such as increase of viral transmission, such as that observed for

D614G. However, a successful virus will not evidently kill its host, so increased contamination
rates have to be coupled with decreased deaths rates. This is exactly what is observed for the
Q57H and P13L mutations, which provide a counter balance to mutations (e.g. D614G) that are
positively correlated with both death rates and transmission rates.

Methods
Datasets
Sequence data for all available SARS-COV-2 strains were obtained from The Global Initiative
for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), at https://gisaid.org. Individual country austerity
measure responses were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response tracker
data[23].
Overall approach
Full genomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences of high sequencing resolution were obtained from
GISAID. The nextstrain[26] pipeline was downloaded locally and the commands for filtering,
aligning and constructing phylogeny were used according to the nextstrain’s best practices.
MAFFT[19] was used to construct a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Phylogeny was
estimated using the RAxML[20] maximum likelihood algorithm for phylogenetic tree
construction. The vcf was generated using the snp_sites tool available through github
(https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/snp-sites). The vcf file is available as supplementary
Table S3.
Generalized linear model (GLM) construction (see equations 1 and 2), statistical analysis and
tree visualizations was performed using R packages: dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, ggtree, phytools,
phangorn, lme4, dfoptim, car, reshape2, ggplot2, gridExtra, PredictABEL, dplyr, tidyr, scales,
ggpubr.
Model = glm(Deaths_Per_Mil ~ Percent + Response_time + Mutations, data = data) (1)
Model = glm(Cases_Per_Mil ~ Percent + Response_time + Mutations, data = data) (2)

The Percent for each country i denotes the percentage occurrence for a specific mutation for
that country and is calculated using the following formula:
Percenti = StrMUTi/StrMUTi + StrMUTi+1 ..+ StrMUTi+n * 100 (3)
Where: StrMUT are the number of strains with the specific mutation for country i and n is the
number of countries with at least one strain with the underlining mutation.
Mutation tracking analyses
Relative frequencies across countries with at least one occurrence of the selected mutations of
interest was visualized as bar plots across time (months). This provides an indication of the
spread of the studied mutations across the general population. Analysis was performed using R
(see packaged above).
Additional Statistical analyses
Distributions of deaths per million for countries with the selected mutations and the reference
mutation were visualized using box plots. Further statistical analysis was performed using
standard non-parametric Wilcoxon test for comparing paired groups. The same analysis was
performed for cases per million. Similarly, we performed the box plot visualizations for the
same data but further separated by response time. We then applied the Kruskal–Wallis test for
non-parametric method for testing whether the multiple groups originated from the same
distribution. Analyses were performed using R (see packaged above).

Structural prediction
Comparative structural modelling was carried out for unknown protein structures using the
template-based web server, I-TASSER[28]. The accuracy of the method was assessed based on
the I-TASSER confidence score (C-score), which indicates the quality of the predicted models.
The C-score is calculated based on the significance of the sequence to structure alignments and

the parameters of convergence obtained by the structure assembly simulations. It typically
ranges between -5 and 2, and a value higher than -1.5 signifies a high accuracy of the predicted
model[28]. I-TASSER was selected for protein structure modelling, since it outperformed other
servers according to results from the 13th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical
Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)[30]. Protein structures
were fixed, global energy (ΔG) was lowered when necessary, and mutagenesis was performed,
using

the

FoldX4.0

suite

(http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/).

The

PyMOL

software

(https://pymol.org/2/) was used for the visualization of the protein molecules.
RNA-protein docking simulations were carried out using the HDOCK[31] and MPRDock[32]
algorithms. For docking simulations, as active and passive residues we selected residues
described as such by Dinesh et al[27]. Protein-protein complexes were constructed using the
ClusPro (v2.0)[33] and HDOCK[31] algorithms and binding affinities were calculated using
the PRODIGY webserver[34]. Relative solvent accessibility (RSA) was calculated using the
Missense3D[35] algorithm. Structural alignment was performed using the align tool of PyMOL
and all-atom RMSD values were calculated without any outliers’ rejection, with zero cycles of
refinement.
The DynaMut webserver[36], was used to visualize non-covalent molecular interactions,
calculated by the Arpeggio algorithm[37]. SymmDock, a geometry-based docking algorithm
for the prediction of cyclically symmetric complexes, was used for symmetric docking
simulations of the REF-Q57H and ALT-Q57H homotetramers[38]. All docking simulations
were performed in triplicates. Finally, binding affinities and dissociation constants (Kd) were
calculated using the PRODIGY webserver[34].
