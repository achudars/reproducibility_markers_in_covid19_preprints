Abstract: The entire world has recently witnessed the commencement of coronavirus disease 19
(COVID-19) pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus (n-CoV) generally distinguished as
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has exploited human
vulnerabilities to coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease
followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven
vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide.
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the
virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has ~89%
genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the
identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network
characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for
defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are
identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also
validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed
method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human
protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked
in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network
attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes
when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality
(DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC)
is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.
Keywords: Spreader nodes, Spreader edges, Spreadability Index, Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus, Protein-Protein Interaction Network, Node Weight, Neighborhood
Density, Edge Ratio, Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model.

1. Introduction
The pandemic COVID-19 registered its first case on 31 December 2019 [1]. It laid its foundation
in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) [2]. Soon, it made several countries all over the
world [3] as its victim by community spreading which ultimately compelled World Health
Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency on 30 January 2020 [4] for the
massive outbreak of COVID-19. Owing to its expected fatality rate, which is about 4%, as
projected by WHO [5], researchers from nations, all over the world, have joined their hands to
work together to understand the spreading mechanisms of this virus SARS-CoV-2 [6]–[9] and to
find out all possible ways to save human lives from the dark shadow of COVID-19.
Coronavirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae. This single stranded RNA virus not only
affects humans but also mammals and birds too. Due to coronavirus, common fever/flu
symptoms are noted in humans followed by acute respiratory infections. Nevertheless, corona
viruses like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) have the ability to create global pandemic due to their infectious nature. Both
of these corona viruses are the member of genus Betacoronavirus under Coronaviridae. SARS
created a major outbreak in 2003 originating from Southern China. 774 deaths were reported
among 8098 globally registered cases resulting in an estimated fatality rate of 14%–15% [10].
While MERS commenced in Saudi Arabia creating an endemic in 2012. The world witnessed
858 deaths among 2494 registered positive cases. It generated high fatality rate of 34.4% in
comparison to SARS [11].
SARS-CoV-2 is under the same Betacoronavirus genus as that of MERS and SARS coronavirus
[12]. It comprises of several structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins
includes the envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and the spike
(S) protein. Though SARS-CoV-2 has been identified recently but there is an intense scarcity of
data as well as necessary information needed to gain immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Studies
has revealed the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV based on
several experimental genomic analyses [9], [12]–[14]. This is also the reason behind the naming
of SARS-CoV-2 by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [15]. Due to this
genetic similarity, immunological study of SARS-CoV may lead to the discovery of SARS-CoV2 potential drug development.
In the proposed methodology, Protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) has been used as the
central component in identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV. PPIN has been found to be
very effective module for protein function determination [16]–[18] as well as in the identification
of central/essential or key spreader nodes in the network [19]–[23]. Compactness of the network
and its transmission capability is estimated using centrality analysis. Anthonisse et al. [23]
proposed a new centrality measure named as Betweenness Centrality (BC) . BC is actually
defined as the measure of impact of a particular node over the transmission between every pair of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038216; this version posted April 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

nodes with a consideration that this transmission is always executed over the shortest path
between them. It is defined as:
( )

( , , )

=∑

( , )

where ( , ) is the total number of shortest paths from node

to node

and ( , , ) is the

number of those paths that pass through . Another centrality measure, called as closeness
centrality (CC), was defined by Sabidussi et al. [24]. It is actually a procedure for detecting
nodes having efficient transmission capability within a network. Nodes which have high
closeness centrality value are considered to have the shortest distance to all available nodes in
the network. It can be mathematically expressed as:
( )

=∑

|

|

∈

( , )

where |

| denotes the number of neighbors of node u and
( , ) is the distance of the
shortest path from node to node . Two other important centrality measures: Degree centrality
(DC) [19] and Local average centrality (LAC) [21] are also found to be very effective in this
area of research. DC is considered to be the most simplest among the available centrality
measures which only count the number of neighbors of a node. Nodes having high degree is said
to be highly connected module of the network. It is defined as:
( )
! =|

|

where | | hold the same meaning as state above. LAC is defined to be the local metric to
compute the essentiality of node with respect to transmission ability by considering its modular
nature, the mathematical model of which is highlighted as:

"# ( ) =
where

is the subgraph induced by

directly connected in

∑' ∈(

and

|

$%&'

)*+, is the total number of nodes which are

.

Due to high morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV2, it has been felt that there is a pressing need
to properly understand the way of disease transmission from SARS-CoV-2 PPIN to human PPIN
[16]–[18]. But since SARS-CoV-2 PPIN is still not available, SARS-CoV PPIN is considered for
this research study due to its high genetic similarity with SARS-CoV-2. In the proposed
methodology, at first SARS-CoV-Human PPIN (up to level 2) is formed from the collected
datasets [25]–[27]. Once it is formed, spreader nodes are identified in each of SARS-CoV
proteins, its level 1 and level 2 of human network by the application of a new network attribute

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038216; this version posted April 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

i.e. spreadability index which is a combination of three terminologies: 1) edge ratio [28] 2)
neighborhood density [28] and 3) node weight [29]. The detected spreader nodes are also
validated by the existing SIS epidemic disease model [30]. Then the edges connecting two
spreader nodes are ranked based on the average of spreadability index of spreader nodes
themselves to access to the spreading ability of the corresponding edge. The ranked edges thus
highlight the path of entire disease propagation from SARS-CoV to human level 1 and then from
human level 1 to human level 2 proteins.

2. Methodology
Spreader nodes and edges both play a crucial role in transmission of infection from one part of
the network to another. Generally in a disease specific PPIN models, at least two entities are
involved: one is pathogen/Bait and the other is host/Prey [31]. In this research work, SARS-CoV
takes the role of the former while human later. SARS-CoV first transmits infection to its
corresponding interaction human proteins which in turn affect its next level of proteins. So, the
transmission occurs through connected nodes and edges. Not all the nodes or proteins in the
PPIN transmit infection. So, proper identification of nodes transmitting infection (spreader
nodes) is required. It is simultaneously also true that the transmission is not possible without the
edges connecting two spreader nodes. Thus these connecting edges are called spreader edges.
The proposed methodology involves a proper study and assessment of various existing
established PPIN features followed by the identification of spreader nodes, which has been also
verified by SIS model.
2.1 Basic Network Characteristics
2.1.1 Ego Network
Ego network of node (- ) [28] is defined as the grouping of node itself along with its
corresponding level 1 neighbors and interconnections. N (- ) [28] consists of the set of nodes
which belong to the ego network, - i.e. { } ∪ 1( ).
2.1.2 Edge ratio
Edge ratio of node [28] is defined by the following equation:
2 *) 34 5 ( ) =
9

6∑;∈(:) |7 (8)
?

(9: )|<=

>@ ∑;∈C (;) |7A: (B)|D=

A

=

EF : G =
A

E:H: =

9

where 2I : is the total number of outgoing edges from the ego network - and 2 J: is the total
number of interactions among node ’s neighbors, respectively. Γ ( ) denotes the level 1
neighbors of node . - is considered to be Ego network. 19: (K) denotes node K’s neighbors which

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038216; this version posted April 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

9

belongs - . In the edge ratio, 2I : is positively related to the non-peripheral location of node .
Large number of interactions resulting from the ego network actually denotes that the node has
9

high level of interconnectivity between its neighbors. On the other hand, 2 J: is negatively
related to the inter-module location of node . It represents the fact that the interconnectivity
between neighbors is usually connected to the number of structural holes available around the
node. When neighbor’s interconnectivity is low, the root or the central node gain more control
of the flow of transmission among the neighbors.
2.1.3 Jaccard Dissimilarity
Jaccard dissimilarity [32] of node and K (

L M43 N ( , K)) is defined as:
L( , K) =

L M43 N ( , K) = 1−

|7( ) ∩ 7(8) |
|7( ) ∪ 7(8)|

where |Γ(i) ∩ Γ(j) | refers to the number of common neighbors of neighbors of and K.
|Γ(i) ∪ Γ(j)| is the total number of neighbors of and K. Similarity between two nodes is
determined by Jaccard similarity based on their common neighbors. The similarity degree
between and K is considered to be more when they have more number of common neighbors.
Whereas, when dissimilarity between the neighbors of a node is high, it guarantees that the only
common node among the neighbors is the central node, which is termed as structural hole
situation [28].
2.1.4 Neighborhood Density
The neighborhood diversity [28] is defined as:
S) *ℎU53ℎ55 _

)3

N ( ) = ∑8,X∈( )

L M43 N(K, W)

When a node’s neighborhood density reaches its greatest value, it reveals the fact that the
neighbors have no other closer path. Hence, the neighbors should transmit or communicate
through this node.
2.1.5 Node weight
Node weight Y of node ∈ Z in PPIN [29] is interpreted as the average degree of all nodes in
[\ ] , a sub-graph of a graph [\ . It is considered as another measure to determine the strength of
connectivity of a node in a network. Mathematically, it is represented by
Y =

∑

∈Z′′

^_`( )

|\ ]] |

where, Z" is the set of nodes in [\ ] . ∣ Z dd | is the number of nodes in [\ ] . And )*( ) is the
degree of a node ∈ Z".

2.2 Spreadability Index and Spreader nodes
Spreadability index of node is defined as the ability of node to transmit an infection from one
node to another. Mathematically it can be defined as:
-e3)4 4U M N_ S )f ( ) g (2 *) 34 5 ( ) h S) *ℎU53ℎ55 _
5 ) Y) *ℎ (Y )

)3

N( ))i

Nodes having high spreadability index are termed as spreader nodes i.e. these nodes have the
capability to transmit the infection to its maximum number of interconnected neighbors in a
much short amount of time in comparison to the other nodes in PPIN.

Figure 1 Synthetic PPIN1 consisting of 33 nodes and 53 edges where each node represents a
protein and its interaction is represented by edges.
Figure 1 represents a sample PPIN where each protein is denoted as nodes while its interaction
by edges. In this network, spreadability index is computed by using basic network characteristics
as stated earlier which has been highlighted and compared to DC, BC, CC and LAC in Table 1 to
Table 5.

In Figure 1, it can be observed that nodes 1, 24 are clearly the most essential spreaders. Node 1
connects the four densely connected modules of the network which turns this node to stand in the

first position having highest spreadability index by our proposed methodology. This node has
been correctly ranked by all the methods except LAC and DC. Node 24 though has moderate
edge ratio and node weight, but is one of the most densely connected modules itself in spite of
getting isolated from the main network module of node 1. Moreover, node 24 has the highest
neighborhood density. It establishes the fact that the only path of transmission for nodes 26, 27,
25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33 is node 24. Thus if node 24 gets affected, then all the connected
nodes with it will be immediately affected due to the lack of the connectivity of the neighbors
with other central nodes. So, node 24 holds the second position with respect to spreadability
index in our proposed methodology. Node 24 is not properly identified as the second most
influential spreader nodes by the other methods. Further assessment of the remaining nodes
highlights the fact that the performance of the new attribute spreadability index in our proposed
methodology is relatively better in comparison to the others.
2.3 Validation of spreader nodes by SIS model
The SIS Epidemic Model [30] is used in this proposed methodology as a way of modeling
SARS-CoV epidemic by classifying the proteins in SARS-CoV-human PPIN based on their
disease/infection status. SIS actually refers to Susceptible, Infected and Susceptible states which
are generally considered as the three probable states of a protein in a PPIN. 1) S - The
susceptible proteins who are not yet infected but are at risk for getting infected. In general every
protein in PPIN is initially in susceptible state. 2) I - Infected proteins who are infected and are
capable of transmitting the disease to other proteins. 3) S - proteins who have recovered and
again become susceptible. Infection rate of the network, recovery rate ( general assumption is
any one out of the infected proteins gets recovered in one day) and total number of proteins are
usually provided as input to SIS. If a protein gets infected and it has many neighbors, then any
neighbor can get infected or may not be. So the final result is generated after 50 iterations for
each infected protein. The total number of susceptible proteins after 50 iterations in the
neighborhood of each infected protein divided by the total number of proteins in the network
gives the infection capability of the infected protein. Thus the spreader nodes identified by
spreadability index are validated by the infection rate as generated by SIS for them. It can be
observed from Table 1 to Table 5 that the proposed methodology has the highest SIS infection
rate of 2.46 (see Table 1) in comparison to others for their corresponding top 10 spreader nodes
in the synthetic network as shown in Figure 1.
2.4 Ranking of Spreader edges
To show the ranking of interacting spreader edges, another synthetic PPIN 2 has been considered
as network 1 while the previous synthetic PPIN 1 in section 2.2 (Figure 1) has been represented
as network 2 in Figure 2. Node D, E and F are the selected top spreader nodes in network 1 by
spreadability index in the same way as that of synthetic PPIN 1 in Figure 1 while to avoid the
complexity in the diagram, top 5 nodes in network 2 (see Table 1) are selected as spreader nodes
in network 2. Red colored edges are the interconnectivities between the nodes of network 1 while

black colored edges show the interconnectivity between nodes of network 2. Green colored
spreader edges (i.e. edges connected with spreader nodes) show the interconnectivity between
network 1 and 2. Ranking of a spreader edge measures the effectiveness of transmission ability
of a spreader edge i.e. how many interactive nodes gets infected through that edge. Thus all the
spreading edges are ranked based on the average of the spreadability index of its connected
spreader nodes. The ranked spreader edges in Figure 2 are highlighted in Table 6.

3. Experimental Result
The proposed methodology leads to the identification of spreader nodes and edges through a
network characteristic, called spreader index which has been also checked and validated by SIS
model. Initially the whole working module is implemented on synthetic networks as shown in
Figure 1 and Figure 2 in section 2 and then on SARS-CoV-human dataset. To visualize the
infection transmission from SARS-CoV to human, PPIN of the both needs to be formed for
which three datasets have been curated. They are: 1) SARS-CoV PPIN [25] 2) SARS-CoVHuman PPIN [25] 3) Human PPIN [26], [27]. After the removal of self-loops and data
redundancy, the final SARS-CoV PPIN consists of 17 interactions among SARS-CoV proteins
along with the involvement of 7 unique proteins after the removal of self loops and data
redundancy. Only the densely interconnected SARS-CoV proteins having direct connections
(level 1) with human proteins are considered rather than the isolated ones. SARS-CoV-Human
PPIN includes 118 interactions between SARS-CoV and human. It is used to fetch the level 1
interaction of human proteins for the corresponding SARS-CoV proteins in SARS-CoV PPIN.
Human PPIN consists of 314384 interactions. It is utilized for getting the indirect interactions
(level 2) of level 1 human proteins formed earlier. The application of the proposed methodology
in SARS-CoV-human PPIN is highlighted in Figure 3.
In Figure 3A, at first SARS-CoV PPIN is displayed in which each protein is marked in red.
Thereafter spreader nodes in SARS-CoV PPIN are identified by spreadability index which are
denoted as blue nodes among red. Once the spreader nodes are active (in Figure 3B), it transmits
the infection to its corresponding direct partners i.e. human level 1proteins (marked in green). In
Figure 3C, spreader nodes are identified in SARS-CoV level 1 human proteins (marked in blue)
and the disease will be transmitted further. The same will continue till SARS-CoV level 2 human
proteins in which green nodes are the spreaders and thus the infection will penetrate further in
human PPIN resulting in a significant fall in human immunity level followed by severe acute
respiratory syndrome.
In Figure 4, the PPIN of SARS-CoV network has been highlighted. There are mainly 9 proteins
which include E, M, ORF3A, ORF7A, S, N, ORF8A, ORF8AB, and ORF8B. The computed
spreadability index of each of this protein and its corresponding validation by SIS model is
highlighted in Table 7. It is also compared with other central/ influential spreader node detection
methodologies like DC, CC, LAC and BC which are shown in Table 8, Table 9, Table 10 and
Table 11 respectively. Similarly spreader nodes are also identified in SARS-CoV’s level 1
neighbors and level 2 neighbors (see Figure 5 and Figure 6).

Spreadability index definitely plays an important role in this proposed methodology. In fact,
spreader nodes are successfully identified by the virtue of this scoring technique which covers all
the aspects of transmitting infection from one node to another in a PPIN. It should be mentioned
here that while identifying spreader nodes in SARS-CoV level 2 human proteins, it has been
noted that the number of nodes are getting increased largely with the increment of successive
levels. So, high, medium and low threshold [33] have been applied and the entire disease
transmission through spreadability index is computationally assessed at each threshold.

The network statistics of spreader nodes at each level of threshold is shown in Table 12. It can be
observed that threshold application is only implemented at SARS-CoV level 2 human proteins
not on others. This is because of the availability of very less number of nodes and edges. Only
nodes and edges having extremely low spreadability index have been discarded at the first level.
Beside identification of spreader nodes, spreader edges are also identified. The ranked edges
between SARS-CoV spreaders and its level 1 human spreaders is highlighted in Table 13 while
the ranked edges between SARS-CoV s level 1 and level 2 human spreaders at high, medium and
low threshold are highlighted in A-Table 1, A-Table 2 and A-Table 3 in the appendix
respectively.

In the above generated network views, the blue, yellow and green color represent SARS-CoV
spreaders, its level 1 human spreaders and its level2 human spreaders respectively. The
remaining nodes are in indigo.

4. Conclusion
Spreadability index is thus proved to be effective in the detection of spreader nodes and edges in
SARS-CoV-human PPIN along with the cross validation by SIS model. Spreader nodes are the
most critical nodes in the network which actually transmit the infection to its successors.
Simultaneously it is also true if the spreader nodes are not connected with spreader edges
infection transmission would not have been possible.
In a nutshell, it can be said that the proposed work exploits the possibility of understanding the
entire disease propagation/transmission from SARS-CoV network to human network. It should
be borne in mind that SARS-CoV2 is ~89% genetically similar to its predecessor SARS-CoV
[34], [35]. It strongly reveals the fact that the human proteins chosen as spreaders of SARS-CoV
might be the potential targets of SARS-CoV 2 also. If our future research work reveals this
assumption, then it will definitely explore a new direction in the identification of essential
drugs/vaccine for SARS-CoV2.
