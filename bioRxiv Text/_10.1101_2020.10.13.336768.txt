Abstract
Background: The need for safe and effective antiviral treatments is pressing given the number of
viral infections that are prevalent in animal and human populations, often causing devastating
economic losses and mortality. Informal accounts of anecdotal use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a
well-known disinfectant and antiseptic, in COVID-19 patients has raised concern about potential
toxicity, but also raises the question that ClO2 might elicit antiviral effects, a possibility that has
never been examined in vivo in any animal model. Here, we challenged the hypothesis that ClO2
decreases the viral load and virus-induced mortality in a vertebrate model. For this, we
determined viral load, virus-induced lesions and mortality in 10-day old chick embryos inoculated
with 104 mean EID50/mL of attenuated Massachusetts and Connecticut avian coronavirus (IBV)
strains.
Results: The ClO2 treatment had a marked impact on IBV infection. Namely, viral titres were 2.4fold lower and mortality was reduced by half in infected embryos that were treated with ClO2.
Infection led to developmental abnormalities regardless of treatment. Lesions typical of IBV
infections were observed in all inoculated embryos, but severity tended to be significantly lower in
ClO2-treated embryos. We found no gross or microscopic evidence of toxicity caused by ClO2 at the
doses used herein.
Conclusions: Our study shows that ClO2 could be a safe and viable way of treating and mitigating
the effects of avian coronavirus infections, and raises the possibility that similar effects could be
observed in other organisms.

Background
To date, despite advances in the identification of compounds with antiviral activity, the available
repertoire of antiviral drugs is insufficient. Given the number of endemic viruses that impact the
health of wild and domestic animals as well as human populations the need for effective and safe
antivirals is urgent. The COVID19 pandemic has evidenced this need; since its start in January
2020, a steep rise in cases and associated mortality, mounting pressure on health services
worldwide, and a marked damage to the economy of most countries [1, 2] warrants rigorous,
unbiased investigation of compounds with potential antiviral action.
The surge in COVID19 cases and the lack of effective treatments have led to a growing number of
informal reports and testimonials across social networks regarding the oral and intravenous use of
chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solution as an efficacious treatment of COVID19. In an unprecedented
move, the Senate of Bolivia authorized the extraordinary use of ClO2 to “manufacture, sell, supply
and use ClO2 to prevent and treat COVID19” (law PL N° 219/2019-2020 CS approved 15 July 2020).
This situation has sparked concern from health agencies of various countries regarding the
potential toxicity of using this disinfectant as a treatment, given that ClO2 has strong oxidative
properties. Chlorine dioxide has been known since 1946 for its broad antimicrobial properties [3],
and it is commonly used to purify water for human consumption, decontaminate produce and
other food items [4], and disinfect surgical instruments [5]. According to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) of the US, consuming ClO2 can lead to adverse effects such as 'vomiting,
diarrhoea, dehydration, abdominal pain, metahemaglobinemia and systemic failures that could
potentially lead to death'. However, an impartial review of the scientific peer-reviewed literature
reveals few case reports of human patients presenting adverse effects after consumption of ClO2,
none of which were fatal, and reversed completely after treatment [6–9]. Published studies on

ClO2 toxicity have reported null to mild effects in adult humans and other animals [10–12] and
have stressed that toxicity is strongly dose-dependent [12–14].
There is evidence of virucidal activity of ClO2 against echovirus [15], enterovirus [16], poliovirus
[17], rotavirus [18], norovirus [19, 20], calicivirus [19], and coronavirus [21]. However, there are
few publications that explore antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo. One of the few published studies
found that mice exposed to influenza A virus in an environment that contained aerosolized ClO2
had significantly lower mortality than mice that were solely exposed to Influenza A virus [22]. The
authors reported that the antiviral effect was due to denaturation of hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase glycoproteins, a finding that concurs with previous studies that explain the
virucidal mechanism of action of ClO2 due to oxidation of amino acid residues that are key for cell
entry [23–25]. More recently, the antiviral mechanism of action of ClO2 was investigated in vitro
using pig alveolar macrophages and MARC-145 cells exposed to the porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV1), finding that the chemical also inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory molecules that contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease [26]. The authors
concluded that viral synthesis of RNA and proteins was impeded by ClO2, leading to a reduction in
viral replication. Despite these studies, to date there has been no published report of an in vivo
assessment of the antiviral effect of ClO2. Here, we have investigated the effect of a ClO2 solution
in 10-day old chick embryos inoculated with attenuated avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus
(IBV) Massachusetts and Connecticut vaccine strains, which are pathogenic for birds during their
embryonic stages of development [27].
Results
Avian coronavirus RNA was detected in all of the embryos that were inoculated with the vaccine
(n=15, in all cases Cq <40). The viral load decreased significantly with increasing ClO2 (p=0.009 for

linear trend; Fig. 1), doses being 2.4 times higher in the untreated embryos. The average viral load
of ClO2-treated chicks was 104.3/mL, range: 103.66 – 105.03 and of untreated chicks was 104.83/mL,
range: 104.52 – 105.01, respectively (Tukey HSD, Group E vs. F, p = 0.03). There were no differences in
the viral load between both ClO2-treated groups (p>0.05).
Mortality differed significantly between virus-inoculated (46.7%) and virus-free embryos (6.7%)
(Fisher's exact p = 0.018), (Fig. 2). In the viral-inoculated groups, 3/10 (30 %) embryos treated with
ClO2 and 4/5 (80 %) untreated embryos died (Groups D, E and F, respectively). (Fisher's exact p =
0.119).
Body mass, embryonic axis length and femur length differed between the virus-inoculated and
virus free-groups, regardless of ClO2 treatment. All of the virus-inoculated embryos exhibited
dwarfing and had, on average, 38% lower mass (t = 21.15, df = 29.40, p = 2.2 x 10-16; Fig. 3A), 10%
shorter axis length (t = 58.43, df = 29.26, p = 2.2 x 10-16; Fig. 3B), and 20% shorter femur length (t =
8.49, df = 23.34, p = 1.4 x 10-8; Fig 3C) than the virus-free groups. When analysing growth in the
virus-inoculated groups, mass was significantly higher in embryos that were treated with ClO2 (t = 2.74, df = 12.98, p = 0.017). Body length of virus-inoculated chicks did not vary according to ClO2
treatment (p > 0.1). See supplementary material for photographs of the embryos.
Lesions previously described in embryos infected with avian coronavirus were observed at post
mortem examination. Namely, curling, the presence of white caseous material (urates), thickened
amnion and allantoic membranes that adhered to the embryos, oedematous serous membranes,
epidermal congestion, and subcutaneous haemorrhage (Table 2). Virus-inoculated embryos
treated with ClO2 had a lower risk of epidermal congestion (RR = 0.4; Wald 95% CI: 0.187- 0.855; p
= 0.04), haemorrhage (RR = 0.1; Wald 95% CI: 0.016 - 0.642; p = 0.002), curling (RR = 0.019; Wald
95% CI: 0.125 - 0.844; p = 0.017) and thickened membranes (RR = 0; p = 0.003) than untreated

infected embryos. All the embryos had a pale liver and mildly congested lungs, regardless of their
experimental group. Pale enlarged kidneys were observed in the virus-inoculated groups but not in
the virus-free groups, regardless of ClO2-treatment (see Table 2).
Microscopic lesions compatible with avian IBV infection were observed in various organs in all
virus-inoculated groups (Fig. 4). The severity of the lesions was either similar or slightly lower in
the embryos that had been treated with ClO2 than in the embryos that did not receive any
treatment (Table 3). Two exceptions were the kidneys and the duodenum. In the kidneys, swelling
and degeneration of renal tubular epithelium was more common and more severe in the infected
chicks that were administered ClO2 than in the infected embryos that did not receive ClO2,
although the former presented mitotic cells. The duodenal villi of the embryos in the IBV-infected
groups were longer (ANOVA; F5,18 = 5.62, p = 0.003), and their base was wider (ANOVA; F5,18 =
13.65, p = 1.39 x 10-05) than embryos from the none-infected groups, and they were moderately
congested. Duodenal villous atrophy varied amongst groups (ANOVA; F5,18 = 5.71, p = 0.003) and
post-hoc comparisons revealed that the significant differences were E vs. B (p = 0.021) and E vs. C
(p = 0.001). The percent of bursal lymphoid tissue decreased markedly in the virus-inoculated
embryos (ANOVA; F5,12 = 3.58, p = 0.033; see Fig. 4). Virus-inoculated embryos showed mild
apoptosis in the thymus and heterophilic infiltration. Amongst the six experimental groups, all of
the embryos examined presented subacute heterophilic bursitis, and pulmonary interstitial
multifocal heterophilic foci with congestion (Table 3).
There were no observable alterations to the architecture and integrity of the tissues of noninfected embryos that were administered ClO2 (Experimental groups B and C), nor was any
difference in the area (µm2) of the thyroid (p>0.1). ClO2-treated groups showed a slightly higher
myeloid to erythroid ratio in the bone marrow than the experimental control group and the viral

control group, although the difference was not statistically significant (ANOVA; F5,15 = 2.33, p =
0.094).
Discussion
We have investigated the antiviral effect of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) using avian infectious bronchitis
coronavirus (IBV)-infected chick embryos as models. At the concentrations used (30 ppm and 300
ppm), both below the reported NOAEL [13], we observed a reduction in viral titre in infected
embryos that were treated with ClO2. Furthermore, mortality decreased substantially in the ClO2treated embryos, although alterations to chick development were prevalent regardless of
treatment.
Virulent avian IBV strains typically have a burst size of 10 to 100 infective units per cell [28], which
can reach peak virus titres of 106.5–108.5 TCID50 after 36 hours [29]. The vaccine strains used here
have lower replication efficiencies as they are attenuated [30], but they are capable of replicating
and causing damage in chick embryos [27]. With 2,000 infective units (200 µl of 104 infective
units/mL) inoculated into each embryo, the ClO2 treatments decreased viral load 2.4-fold
compared to the infected non-treated embryos, representing an average difference of 42,711
infective units. This result could be explained by two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. Firstly,
direct destruction or neutralization of the virions exposed to ClO2 could have occurred by
denaturing of envelope glycoproteins following oxidation of amino acid residues [22, 23, 25].
Secondly, viral replication efficiency could have decreased due to ClO2–induced biochemical
changes in the extra- or intracellular milieu, impeding the synthesis of viral RNA and proteins [26,
31].
The effects of reduced viral titres in the infected embryos were evident, with a 50 to 75%
reduction in mortality in the treated embryos treated with 300 ppm and 30 ppm of ClO2,

respectively. However, developmental abnormalities were observed in the majority of the infected
embryos, including those that received ClO2 treatment. Namely, dwarfing, assessed by body mass,
axis length, and femur length were significantly lower in all infected embryos, as expected to occur
in IBV infections [32]. In contrast, curling [33, 34] was virtually absent in the embryos that received
ClO2 after infection. Lesions associated con IBV infection [35, 36] were observed in most of the
infected embryos, including those that were administered ClO2. However, for most of these
lesions, severity was lower or similar in the ClO2-treated groups. One exception was in the kidneys,
where nephrosis was more severe and frequent in the IBV-infected embryos treated with ClO2.
Nephrosis is unlikely to have occurred due to ClO2 treatment per se, given that none of the
uninfected embryos that were administered ClO2 showed kidney abnormalities. Similarly, atrophy
of the duodenal villi was highest in the inoculated group that was administered a high dose of
ClO2, but absent in the non-infected groups that only received ClO2. If duodenal atrophy and
nephropathogenicity in IBV-infected embryos are mitigated by inflammatory responses [37], it is
possible that the observed damage is due to ClO2-driven downregulation of acute inflammation
that allowed virion replication in the tubular epithelium and in the duodenal villi. This scenario
could be plausible if we consider that ClO2-treated pig alveolar macrophages and African green
monkey kidney cells infected with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV1) downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α [26]. There are two drugs,
based on chlorite, whose describe mechanism of action might be similar to that elicited by ClO2.
One is the drug NP001 (a pH-adjusted stabilized form of NaClO2) exerts strong anti-inflammatory
responses by inhibiting macrophage activation in humans, even after a single dose [38]. In turn,
WF10 (tetrachlorodecaoxyde, Cl4H2O11), an oxidizing agent that contains 63.0 mmol/L chlorite and
56.4 mmol/L chloride [39] induces apoptosis of inflammatory cells and downregulates proinflammatory genes [40, 41]. More studies will be needed to establish whether the effect of ClO2

on IBV-infected chicks is due to similar mechanisms. Interestingly, the affected renal tubules of the
chick embryos had mitotic cells, suggestive of regeneration as a reparative response to damage of
the renal tubular epithelium [42–44]. This possibility will need to be explored further in the animal
model used in our study. Unfortunately, knowledge of IBV pathogenesis, immune responses and
tissue reparation in the embryonated egg is limited. In hatched birds, IBV can impact lymphocyte
populations by inducing apoptosis, thus impeding virus clearance [45]. We found some evidence of
this effect, as the virus-inoculated embryos had a reduced percent of bursal lymphoid tissue.
It is plausible that even though ClO2 limited viral replication, given that the embryos were only
administered a single dose of ClO2 solution, not all virions were eliminated. The viruses that
remained viable after administration of the ClO2 were able to replicate, yielding lower viral titres,
and the damage that they caused to the embryos was less severe and ultimately led to less
mortality than in the untreated infected embryos. Repeated administrations of ClO2 solution might
have reduced the viral load further, plausibly leading to even less virus-induced damage, a
possibility that we could not explore in this model. However, an important result of our study was
the lack of evidence of tissue damage caused by ClO2 itself. Only one (20%) of the uninfected
embryos treated with the high dose of ClO2 died, and this difference was not statistically
significant to the experimental control. It is possible that the death was due to other causes, as a
20% embryo mortality rate is considered normal in aviculture [46, 47].
Conclusions
Chlorine dioxide had an unequivocal antiviral effect in the model system used in this study, with a
reduction in viral RNA, virus-induced lesions and mortality and no evidence of toxicity at the doses
used herein. Further studies should aim to test the antiviral effect of ClO2 in hatched chicks, which
have a more mature immune system, and where repeated administrations are easier to procure.

However, it is promising that we found an evident effect against IBV without any significant
adverse effect or evidence of toxicity to the chick embryos. Much research needs to be done
before it is possible to generalize and extrapolate our findings to other viruses and animal hosts.
Methods
We aimed to examine whether chlorine dioxide elicits a measurable antiviral effect in vivo, and
investigate toxicity associated with the administration of this chemical compound. For this, we
selected the chicken embryo as a vertebrate model and avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus
(IBV) as a virus model. The protocol that is described below was registered at the School of Natural
Sciences of the Autonomous University of Queretaro (Mexico). The study was carried out in
compliance with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) guide for humane
treatment of chick embryos and approved by the Autonomous University of Queretaro Research
Ethics Committee
Ultrapure ClO2 solution (3,000 ppm) was prepared by electrolysis of NaClO2, according to the
following reaction:

!"#$%& + )& % + * + → #$%&(./0) + )&(./0)

The solution was kept at 4 °C and was used within 5 days of production. Two working solutions
were prepared with sterile 0.9% saline solution: a high dose (HD, 300 ppm) and a low dose (LD, 30
ppm). Final concentration was verified using test strips (LaMotte Insta-Test 3002) which allowed
qualitative detection between 0 and 500 ppm.
We used 30 10-day old SPF RossxRoss chick embryos (Pilgrims, Mexico) incubated at 38°C and 6570% humidity [48]. Five chick embryos were assigned to each of the six experimental groups at
random and treated according to their group (Table 1). Total sample size in the experimental

group was determined in order to achieve power 80% (type II error: 0.20) with allocation ratio 2/1,
effect size of 0.7 and a significance level < 0.05. Embryos were placed at random in the incubator
to avoid potential variations in temperature and humidity between the edges and the centre of
the incubator. All embryos were inoculated via the chorioallanotic sac, as recommended for avian
coronavirus replication [49, 50]. Details on inoculation can be seen as Supplementary Materials.
Seven days after inoculation, embryos were sacrificed according to guidelines on humane
treatment and euthanasia of chick embryos over 13 days of age (AVMA 2020). The embryos were
placed at 4 °C for 4 h to ensure blood coagulation and avoid contamination of the allantoic fluid
[48]. The eggshell over the air chamber was disinfected with 70% ethanol and 3.5% iodine [48] and
removed together with the chorioallantoic membrane. Allanotic fluid (750 µl) was collected and
stored at −70 °C.
Each embryo was cleaned with distilled water to remove any remaining albumin, vitellus and
amniotic fluid. Body mass was determined with a precision scale (±0.1 mg). Embryonic axis length
was measured with digital callipers (± 0.1 cm). The body was examined for macroscopic lesions
typically caused by avian coronavirus, such as cutaneous haemorrhages, stunting, curving, urate
deposits in the kidney and feather alterations [49, 51]. Chick embryos were considered to have
died during the experiment when there was evidence of disconnected or detached blood vessels
of the chorioallantoic membrane or their organs exhibited imbibition of haemoglobin. Further
evidence of mortality was determined by examining the presence of autolysis at microscopic
examination.
Both femurs were dissected and their length was determined and averaged with a digital calliper
as a surrogate measure of chick development. Samples of all organs and tissues were collected,
including those known to be affected by the Massachusetts and Connecticut strains of avian

coronavirus, namely trachea, lung, proventricle, duodenum, liver, kidneys and the Bursa of
Fabricius [27, 49, 52, 53], and those reportedly affected by exposure to ClO2 [13, 54, 55].
Samples were cut longitudinally, immersed in 10% buffered formalin (pH 7.4), paraffin-embedded
and sectioned at 3 µm, stained with haematoxylin-eosin and observed under the microscope at
40X and 100X. To assess haematopoietic status, bone marrow preparations were used for a 200cell differential count to classify the marrow precursors and to determine the myeloid:erythroid
(M/E) ratio for each embryo. This ratio was obtained by dividing the sum of all the granulocytic
cells by the sum of all the erythrocytic cells [56].
The virus was quantified in the allantoid fluid with an RT-qPCR protocol that targeted a 100 bp
fragment of the avian coronavirus N gene with primers IBV-pan_FW-1 (5'-CAG TCC CDG ATG CNT
GGT A) and IBV-pan_RV (5'-CC TTW SCA GMA ACM CAC ACT)[57]. Details on the protocol can be
seen as Supplementary Materials. We used a cDNA sample extracted from 500 µL of the vaccine
as a positive control (the vaccine contained 104 mean embryo infective dose (EID50)/mL of
coronavirus strains Massachusetts and Connecticut). A linear regression was used to calculate the
correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99) and the slope value (b = -5.062) of the RNA copy number and Cq
values using a 10-fold dilution of the vaccine (104 to 10-1; see standard curve in Supplementary
material). The number of viral RNA copies (hereafter viral load) was determined by comparing the
Cq against this standard curve [57].
Contingency tables were built to investigate differences in the proportion of dead vs. live chick
embryos between experimental groups. The risk of developing virus-related lesions between
treated and un-treated embryos was calculated using Fisher exact tests. Body mass,
morphometrics, viral load, and lesion severity were compared among groups by one-way ANOVA
and post-hoc Tukey HSD tests. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3 [58].

Evaluation of the antiviral effect of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) using a vertebrate model inoculated with
avian coronavirus
Zambrano-Estrada, X.et al.

Highlights
•
•
•
•

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) reduces mortality in chick embryos inoculated with avian infectious
bronchitis coronavirus.
Viral RNA was 2.4-fold lower in the embryos that were treated with ClO2.
Microscopic lesions were less severe in ClO2-treated embryos.
There was no evidence of toxicity caused by ClO2 at the doses used.
