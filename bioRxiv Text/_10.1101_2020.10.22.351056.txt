ABSTRACT
Inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2,
which acts as a ligand-receptor pair that initiates the viral attachment and cellular entry of this
coronavirus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are of considerable interest as potential
antiviral agents. While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than with
antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and
mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable / less
immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compoundlibrary that is focused on the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates
identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel drug-like compounds
(DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARSCoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50s
of 0.2-3.0 μM); whereas, control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and
suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs identified here
bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not ACE2. Selected promising compounds inhibited the entry of a SARSCoV-2-S expressing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells in concentration-dependent manner
with low micromolar IC50s (6-30 μM). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility
of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for coronavirus attachment/entry and serves as a first
guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment
of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19, which reached pandemic levels in early 2020 (WHO; March 11, 2020), is caused
by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1-3). SARS-CoV-2 is the
most infectious agent in a century (4), having already caused more than forty million infections
and a million deaths worldwide. This coronavirus (CoV) is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus
with a large RNA genome of roughly 29.9 kilobases and a diameter of up to about 120 nm,
characterized by club-like spikes emerging from its surface (5, 6). It is the most recently emerged
among the seven CoVs known to infect humans. They include four CoVs that are responsible for
about a third of the common cold cases (HCoV 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) and three that
caused epidemics in the last two decades associated with considerable mortality: SARS-CoV-1
(2002–2003, ~10% mortality), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; 2012,
~35% mortality), and now SARS-CoV-2 (2019–2020), which seems to be less lethal but more
transmissible (7, 8). While the SARS-CoV-2 situation is still evolving, current estimates indicate
that about 3% of infected individuals need hospitalization and the average infection fatality ratio
(IFR, percentage of those infected that do not survive) is around 0.5% but in a strongly agedependent manner, i.e., increasing from 0.001% in <20 years old to 8.3% in those >80 years old
(9) (to be compared with an IFR of <0.1% for influenza). This created unprecedented health and
economic damage and a correspondingly significant therapeutic need for possible preventive
and/or curative treatments. As future CoVs that are highly contagious and/or lethal are also likely
to emerge, novel therapies that could neutralize multiple strains are of particular interest
especially as the large WHO Solidarity trial suggests that repurposed antiviral drugs including
hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, and interferon-β1, appear to have little or no effect

on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and
duration of hospital stay (10).
Viral attachment and entry are of particular interest among possible therapeutic targets
in the life cycle of viruses (7) because they represent the first steps in the replication cycle and
take place at a relatively accessible extracellular site; they have indeed been explored for
different viruses (11). CoVs use the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of their glycosylated S protein
to bind to cell specific surface receptors and initiate membrane fusion and virus entry. For both
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, this involves binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
followed by proteolytic activation by human proteases (3, 5, 12, 13). Hence, blockade of the RBD–
hACE2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) can disrupt infection efficiency, and most vaccines and
neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) aim to abrogate this interaction (14, 15). CoV nAbs, including those
identified so far for SARS-CoV-2, primarily target the trimeric S glycoproteins, and their majority
recognizes epitopes within the RBD that binds the ACE2 receptor (15-19). It would be important
to have broadly cross-reactive nAbs that can neutralize a wide range of viruses that share similar
pathogenic outcomes (17). The S proteins of SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV, and SARS-CoV‐2 have similar
structures with 1100–1300 amino acids and RBDs spanning about 200 residues and consisting of
core and external subdomains, with the RBD cores being responsible for the formation of S
trimers – similarities that allow the possibility of broad neutralization (20, 21). SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 share ~80% amino acid identity in their S proteins (15, 20); nevertheless, most
current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV antibodies are not cross-reactive for SARS-CoV-2 (22).
For example, one study found that none of the 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived
from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals cross-reacted with SARS-CoV or

MERS-CoV RBDs (23). Antibody-like monobodies designed to bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
also did not bind that of SARS-CoV (24). As a further complicating factor, RNA viruses accumulate
mutations over time, which yields antibody resistance and requires the use of antibody cocktails
to avoid mutational escape (25).
In addition to being too highly target-specific, antibodies, as all protein therapies, are
hindered by problems related to their solubility, unsuitability for oral or inhaled administration,
and immunogenicity. By being foreign proteins, they themselves can act as antigens and elicit
strong immune response in certain patients (26-28), and this is only further exacerbated by their
long elimination half-lives (29). Even among FDA approved therapeutics, there were more postmarket safety issues with biologics than with small-molecule drugs (30). Hence, peptides or small
molecules can offer alternative approaches. Some peptide disruptors of this PPI have also been
reported, but so far none have been very effective (22, 31-33). More importantly, because of
bioavailability, metabolic instability (short half-life), lack of membrane permeability, and other
issues, developing peptides into clinically approved drugs is difficult and rarely pursued (34, 35).
Small molecules traditionally were not considered for PPI modulation because they were
deemed unlikely to be successful due to the lack of well-defined binding pockets on the protein
surface that would allow their adequate binding. During the last decade, however, it has become
increasingly clear that SMIs can be effective against certain PPIs. There are now >40 PPIs targeted
by SMIs that are in preclinical development (36-42), and two of them (venetoclax (43), lifitegrast
(44)) were recently approved by the FDA for clinical use (45, 46). Notably, the success of two
small-molecule drugs that target HIV-1 entry and are now approved for clinical use, enfuvirtide
and maraviroc, validates this strategy of antiviral drug discovery. Maraviroc targets the C-C motif

chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a host protein used as a co-receptor during HIV-1 entry, and it is a
noncompetitive allosteric inhibitor that stabilizes a conformation no longer recognized by the
viral envelope (11, 47). Hence, it is an allosteric SMI of a PPI, highlighting the feasibility of such
an approach to prevent viral entry. Interestingly, maraviroc has been claimed recently to inhibit
the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein mediated cell fusion in cell culture (6). Therefore, SMIs could yield
antiviral therapies that are more broadly active (i.e., less strain- and mutation-sensitive), more
patient friendly (i.e., suitable for oral or inhaled administration), less immunogenic, and more
controllable (shorter half-life / better biodistribution) than antibodies (48). Oral bioavailability
offers a major advantage for access, wide-spread usage, and compliance (49) a requisite for longterm and broadly acceptable preventive use (50-52). For COVID-19, the possibility of direct
delivery into the respiratory system via inhaled or intranasal administration is also important and
unlikely to be achievable for antibodies. Broadly specific activity could make possible multi-strain
or even pan-CoV inhibition, and while it is unlikely with antibodies (22, 23), it is possible for SMIs.
For example, we have shown that while the corresponding antibodies did not cross-react for the
human vs mouse CD40–CD40L PPI, our SMIs did so and had about similar potencies (53, 54).
Since previously we found that starting from organic dyes one can identify SMIs for cosignaling PPIs as potential immunomodulatory agents (48, 53-59), we initiated a screen of such
compounds for their ability to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2-S–ACE2 PPI. This led to the identification of
several organic dyes (1–5, Figure 1) that show promising inhibitory activity of this PPI in vitro,
including methylene blue (6), a phenothiazine dye approved by the FDA for the treatment of
methemoglobinemia, which we have described separately (60). More importantly, it also led to

the identification of new and more potent SMIs (7–13) that are more drug-like and no longer
contain color-causing chromophores as summarized below.
RESULTS
As part of our work to identify SMIs for co-signaling PPIs that are essential for the
activation and control of immune cells, we discovered that the chemical space of organic dyes,
which is particularly rich in strong protein binders, offers a useful starting point. Accordingly, it
seemed logical to explore it for possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein – ACE2 PPI that is
an essential first step for the viral entry of this novel, highly infectious coronavirus. We were able
to set up a cell-free ELISA-type assay to quantify the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (as well as
its SARS-CoV analog) to their cognate receptors (human ACE2) and used this to screen our
existing in-house compound library containing a large variety of organic dyes and a set of
colorless analogs prepared as potential SMIs for costimulatory PPIs. These maintain the main
molecular framework of dyes but lack the aromatic azo chromophores responsible for the color
as they are replaced with amide linkers (58, 59).
Chemistry and Synthesis
All new compounds used here were synthesized as described before as part of our effort
to identify novel SMIs for the CD40–CD40L costimulatory PPI (58, 59). Synthesis involved one or
two amide couplings (using a modified version of the procedure from (61)) and a hydrogenation
(using a modified version of the procedure from (62)). These steps were used with different
linkers and naphthyl moieties as needed for each structure; all corresponding details are

summarized in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary
Schemes S1-S6). All structures tested here (1–13) are shown in Figure 1.
Screening Assays
As a first step, we explored the feasibility of setting up screening assays using a cell-free
ELISA-type format similar to those used in our previous works with Fc-conjugated receptors
coated on the plate and FLAG- or His-tagged ligands in the solution (53, 56-58). Concentrationresponse assessments of binding to ACE2 indicated that both the S1 and RBD portions of SARSCoV-2-S bind strongly and follow classic sigmoid patterns corresponding to the law of mass action
(63) with a slightly stronger binding for RBD than S1 (Figure 2). Fitting of data gave median
effective concentrations (EC50s) and hence binding affinity constant (Kd) estimates of 3.7 and 14.7
nM, respectively (98 and 1125 ng/mL) – in good agreement with the specifications of the
manufacturer (SinoBiological; Wayne, PA, USA) and published values indicating a low nanomolar
range (4–90 nM) typically based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies (5). Because we are
interested in possible broad-spectrum inhibitors, we also performed concentration-response
assessments of the binding of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 S proteins (using their S1&S2 and S1
domains, respectively) as they also use ACE2 as their cognate receptor. SARS-CoV bound with
about similar potency as SARS-CoV-2 (13.9 nM; 1843 ng/mL), whereas HCoV-NL63 had
significantly lower affinity (45.8 nM, 3610 ng/mL) (Figure 2).
Based on this, we first used this assay to screen for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding,
which showed the strongest affinity to hACE2. In fact, this assay setup is very similar to one
recently shown to work as a specific and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test
based on antibody-mediated blockage of this same PPI (CoV-S–ACE2) (64). We screened our in8

house library of organic dyes plus existing analogs together with a few additional compounds
that are or have been considered of possible interest in inhibiting SAR-CoV-2 by different
mechanisms of action, e.g., chloroquine, clemastine, and suramin (22, 65-68). Screening at 5 µM
indicated that most have no activity and, hence, are unlikely to interfere with the S-protein –
ACE2 binding needed for viral attachment. Nevertheless, some showed activity (Supplementary
Material, Figure S1). Compounds showing the strongest activity, i.e., rose Bengal, erythrosine B
(ErB), and phloxine B, are known promiscuous SMIs of PPIs (56). As such, they are of no value
here being nonspecific; they were included as positive controls. This screening also identified
methylene blue (MeBlu, 6), a phenothiazine dye approved by the FDA for the treatment of
methemoglobinemia and also used for several other therapeutic applications in the developed
world (69-71) and with additional potential for certain developing world applications such as
malaria (72), as showing promising inhibitory activity for the SARS-CoV-2-S–hACE2 PPI, likely
contributing to its anti-CoV activity (73); this has been discussed separately (60).
Binding Inhibition (Concentration-Response)
Next, detailed concentration-response assessments were performed to establish
inhibitory activity (IC50) per standard experimental guidelines in pharmacology and experimental
biology (74, 75). These confirmed that indeed several organic dyes as well as non-dye DRI
compounds inhibited this PPI in a concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50s
(Figure 3). For example, among tested dyes, Congo red (CgRd, 1), direct violet 1 (DV1, 4), Evans
blue (EvBl, 2), chlorazol black (ChBk, 3), and calcomine scarlet 3B (CSc3B, 5) had IC50s of 0.99,
1.44, 2.25, 2.57, and 4.25 µM, respectively. Further, we also found several DRI compounds of low
micromolar activity including some, such as DRI-C91005 (13) and DRI-C23041 (8), with even
9

better submicromolar IC50s (160 and 520 nM, respectively). For the compounds tested here,
concentration dependencies were adequately described by a standard log inhibitor vs response
model (i.e., a classical sigmoid binding function with a Hill slope of 1 (63)). Sunset yellow FCF
(FD&C yellow #6), an azo dye and an FDA approved food colorant included as a possible negative
control, showed no inhibitory activity. Notably, neither chloroquine nor suramin showed
inhibitory activity in this assay. We tested chloroquine, an anti-parasitic and immunosuppressive
drug primarily used to prevent and treat malaria, because it was the subject of considerable
controversy regarding its potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (65). We also tested
suramin, an antiparasitic drug approved for the prophylactic treatment of African sleeping
sickness (trypanosomiasis) and river blindness (onchocerciasis), because it was claimed to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture by preventing binding or entry of the virus (68) and because
it was one of the first compounds we found to inhibit the CD40–CD40L PPI (55). On the other
hand, erythrosine B (ErB, FD&C red #3), an FDA approved food colorant that we found earlier to
be a promiscuous PPI inhibitor and have been using as positive control in such assays, inhibited
with an IC50 of 0.4 µM, similar to its activity found for other PPIs tested before (1–20 µM) (56).
For a few representative compounds, we also tested their ability to inhibit not just the
binding of SARS-CoV-2-RBD but also that of SARS-CoV-2-S1 to hACE2. We obtained similar
potencies; e.g., DRI-C23041 had an IC50 of 1.88 µM (95% CI of 1.32–2.68 µM) for S1
(Supplementary Material, Figure S2) vs 0.52 µM (95% CI of 0.42–0.63 µM) for RBD (Figure 3). This
confirms that these are indeed real inhibitory activities relevant for the S protein – hACE2 PPI of
interest. More importantly, we also assessed the ability of selected promising compounds to
inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-S to ACE2 using a similar setup. As shown in Figure 4, several of
10

the same compounds including organic dyes (CgRd, DV1, and others) as well as DRI compounds
showed similar activity against SARS-CoV as against SARS-CoV-2. For compounds tested in this
assay such as CgRd, CVN, EvBl, CSc3B, DRI-C23041, and DRI-C91005 the IC50s were 3.9, 2.6, 1.3,
9.9, 3.4, and 0.24 µM (Figure 4), respectively – values that are similar to those obtained for SARSCoV-2 inhibition (Figure 3), raising the possibility of broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity.
Besides activity, it is also important to achieve adequate selectivity, specificity, and safety.
To become promising lead candidates, small-molecule compounds are usually expected to show
>30-fold selectivity over other possible pharmacological targets of interest (76, 77). As a counterassay, here we assessed inhibitory activity against the TNF-R1–TNF-α interaction, as we have
done before (58, 59). Most of the dyes found here to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2–ACE2 PPI (Figure 3)
seem to be relatively promiscuous as they also inhibited the TNF-R1–TNF-α PPI (Figure 5) showing
only some limited selectivity, e.g., 6-fold for CgRd (0.99 vs 6.0 µM) as one of the best and only
1.4-fold for DV1 (1.5 vs. 2.1 µM). On the other hand, several DRI-C compounds showed good,
more than 100-fold selectivity, e.g., >400-fold for DRI-C23041 (0.52 vs 233 µM). The symmetric
DRI-C91005 seems an exception that was the most potent in all assays but showed no selectivity
(0.16 vs 0.16 µM). As these DRI-C compounds were designed to target CD40–CD40L, they all
inhibit that PPI with high nanomolar – low micromolar potency (see Discussion).
Binding Partner (Protein Thermal Shift)
To establish whether these SMIs bind to CoV-S or ACE2, we used a protein thermal shift
assay (differential scanning fluorimetry or ThermoFluor assay) (78, 79) as we did before for CD40L
(59). This assay quantifies the shift in protein stability caused by binding of a ligand via use of a
11

dye whose fluorescence increases when exposed to hydrophobic surfaces, which happens as the
protein starts to unfold as it is heated and exposes its normally buried hydrophobic core residues.
It allows rapid and inexpensive evaluations of the temperature-dependence of protein stability
using real-time PCR instruments and only small amounts of protein. It is sensitive enough to
assess small-molecule PPI interference and can be used even as a screening assay (80). As shown
in Figure 6, the presence of

CgRd or DRI-C23041 caused clear left-shifts in the melting

temperature (Tm) of the protein for SARS-CoV-2-RBD, but not ACE2 (purple vs. blue lines)
indicating the former as the binding partner. This is encouraging, as SMIs targeting the S-protein
are much more likely to (1) not cause undesirable side effects than ACE2-targeting ones, which
could interfere with ACE2 signaling, and

(2)

be more broadly specific due to the structural

similarity of the different CoV S glycoproteins. Binding of a ligand usually results in an increase
(right-shift) of the melting temperature due to stabilization of the protein; however, cases with
a decrease (hence, destabilization) have also been reported (81) including for the Ebola virus
glycoprotein (82).
Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Pseudo-Virus Entry
For a set of selected active compounds, we were able to confirm that they also inhibit
viral entry. This has been done with pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV-2 S spike protein (plus
fluorescent reporters) and generated using BacMam-based tools. These allow quantification of
viral entry, as they express bright green fluorescent protein that is targeted to the nucleus of
ACE2- (and red fluorescence reporter) expressing host cells (here, HEK293T), but can be handled
using biosafety level 1 containment, as they do not replicate in human cells. A day after entry,
host cells express green fluorescence in the nucleus, indicating pseudovirus entry. If entry is

blocked, the cell nucleus remains dark. In this assay, several of our SMIs tested, for example,
CgRd, DV1, and DRI-C23041 showed good concentration-dependent inhibition as illustrated by
the corresponding images and bar graphs in Figure 7. Fitting with regular concentration response
curves indicated a very encouraging IC50 of 5.8 µM for DRI-C23041. CgRd and DV1 also inhibited,
but with higher IC50s (26 and 64 µM for, respectively), which is not unexpected for such azo dyes
as they tend to lose activity in cell-based assay due to nonspecific binding (Figure 7C).
As a first safety assessment, in parallel with the cell assays, we also evaluated cytotoxicity
for several compounds in the same cells and at the same concentrations using a standard MTS
assay to ensure that effects are present at non-toxic concentration levels. Notably, chloroquine
already showed noticeable cytotoxicity at 45 µM concentrations in this assay with HEK293T cells,
so its effect on pseudovirus entry could not be reliably evaluated there and hydroxychloroquine
was used. We have shown before that compounds such as DRI-C21041 (7) or DRI-C24041 (9) did
not have significant effects on the viability of THP-1 human cells for concentrations of up to 200
µM (58, 59). In line with that, DRI-C23041 (8) was the least cytotoxic among tested compounds
here and showed no significant effects on HEK293T at 45 µM (Supplementary Material, Figure
S3), whereas it had a strong effect on viral entry (Figure 7).
DISCUSSION
Results obtained here confirm again that the chemical space of organic dyes can serve as
a useful starting platform for the identification of SMI scaffolds for PPI inhibition. Organic dyes
need to be good protein binders; hence, their contain privileged structures for protein binding
(83-85) and can provide a better starting point toward the identification of SMIs of PPIs than

most drug-like screening libraries, whose chemical space has been shown to not correspond well
with that of promising PPI inhibitors (86-88). Using this strategy, we have identified promising
SMIs for the CD40–CD40L costimulatory interaction (53, 58, 59) and even some promiscuous
SMIs of PPIs (56). Of course, because most dyes are unsuitable for therapeutic applications due
to their strong color and, in the case of azo dyes, their quick metabolic degradation (89, 90),
structural modifications are needed to optimize their clinical potential (58, 59).
Here, we explored the potential of this approach to identify SMIs for the PPI between
ACE2 and CoV spike proteins as potential antivirals inhibiting attachment. Since SARS-CoV-2 uses
its S protein via its RBD to bind ACE2 as the first step of its entry (3, 5, 12, 13), targeting these
proteins is a viable therapeutic strategy, and work with prior zoonotic CoV has demonstrated
proof-of-concept validity for such approaches. By screening our compound library spanning the
chemical space of organic dyes, we identified several promising SMIs including dyes, such as
Congo red and direct violet 1, as well as novel drug-like compounds, such as DRI-C23041, that (1)
inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S–hACE2 PPI with low micromolar activity (Figure 3), (2) seem to bind
to SARS-CoV-2-S and not ACE2 (Figure 6), and

(3)

inhibited entry of SARS-CoV-2-S displaying

pseudoviruses into ACE2 expressing cells (Figure 7). Importantly, there is clear indication of a
consensus structural motif present in the active compounds identified here: a biphenyl linker
with a naphthyl at one end and another aromatic naphthyl or phenyl at the other end, both with
at least one but preferably multiple polar substituents (Figure 1).
Following the emergence of SARS-CoV in the early 2000s, a limited number of groups
performed high-throughput screening (HTS) assays to identify inhibitory drug candidates for
targeting various early steps in its cell invasion. Identified candidates included some putative

SMIs of viral entry, for example, SSAA09E2 (91) and VE607 (92). Inhibitory candidates acting by
other mechanism identified included, for example, SSAA09E1, SSAA09E3 (91); MP576, HE602
(92); ARB 05-018137, ARB 05-090614 (93); KE22 (94); and others (reviewed in (22, 31, 32)). Most
of these showed activity only in the low micromolar range, e.g., 3.1, 0.7, and 1.6 µM for
SSAA09E2, K22, and VE607, respectively (22). Even if these compounds showed some evidence
of inhibiting CoV infection, no approved preventive or curative therapy is currently available for
human CoV diseases. In addition to the relatively low (micromolar) potency, a main reason for
this is that these compounds were not suitable for clinical translatability. They could not pass the
pre-clinical development stage and enter clinical trials due to their poor bioavailability, safety,
and pharmacokinetics (22). Note that by starting from a different chemical space and not from
that of drug-like molecules typically used for HTS, our best SMIs identified here are already well
within this low micromolar range for SARS-CoV-2. There also was a recent attempt at identifying
possible disruptors of the SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD–ACE2 binding using AlphaLISA assay based HTS of
3,384 small-molecule drugs and pre-clinical compounds suitable for repurposing that identified
25 possible hits (95). However, these were also of relatively low potency (micromolar IC50s). None
of them shows resemblance with the scaffold(s) identified here – highlighting again the known
lack of overlap between the chemical space of existing drugs / drug-like structures and that of
PPI inhibitors.
The S protein is a homotrimer with each of its monomer units being about 180 kDa, and
it contains two subunits, S1 and S2, mediating cell attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular
membrane, respectively (16, 96). The RBD of the S protein is located within the S1 domain and is
known to switch between a standing-up position for receptor binding and a lying-down position

for immune evasion (12, 31). CoVs can utilize different receptors for binding, but several CoVs,
even from different genera, can also utilize the same receptor. SARS-CoV-2 is actually the third
human CoV utilizing ACE2 as its cell entry receptor, the other two being SARS-CoV and the αcoronavirus HCoV NL63 (3). MERS-CoV recognizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (3-5), while
HCoV 229E recognizes CD13 (97). Some β-coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV OC43) bind to sialic acid
receptors (98). Having access to broadly cross-reactive agents that can neutralize a wide range
of antigenically disparate viruses that share similar pathogenic outcomes would be highly
valuable from a therapeutic perspective (17), and SMIs are less specific and could yield therapies
that are more broadly active (i.e., less strain- and mutation-sensitive) than antibodies, which tend
to be highly specific. We have shown before that while the corresponding antibodies are species
specific for the CD40–CD40L PPI, our SMIs could inhibit both the human and mouse system with
similar potencies (53, 54). Hence, it is feasible that SMI structures can be identified that in
addition to inhibiting SARS-CoV-2, also inhibit other CoVs, including the high lethality SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV as well as the common cold causing HCoVs. Along these lines, it is very
encouraging that SMIs identified here target the CoV-S protein and not ACE2 (Figure 6) and they
show similar potency in inhibiting SARS-CoV (Figure 4) and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). Such inhibitory
effects on viral attachment can translate into antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and possibly
other ACE2-binding CoVs such as SARS-CoV and the α-coronavirus HCoV NL63.
While the SMIs identified here are not very small structures (MW in the 550 to 700 Da
range), they are still relatively small compared to typical SMIs of PPIs. These tend to have larger
structures to achieve sufficient activity, and they often severely violate the widely used “rule-offive” criteria, which, among others, requires MW < 500 (99). In the last two decades, this “rule”

has been used as a guide to ensure oral bioavailability and an adequate pharmacokinetic profile.
Nevertheless, an increasing number of new drugs have been launched recently (including the
two small-molecule PPI inhibitors discussed earlier) that significantly violate these empirical rules
proving that oral bioavailability can be achieved even in the “beyond rule-of-five” chemical space
(100). Hence, our results provide further proof for the feasibility of SMI for CoV attachment and
provide a first map of the chemical space needed to achieve this.
Finally, these DRI-C structures (8–13) were originally intended to modulate co-signaling
interactions, specifically to inhibit the CD40–CD40L costimulatory interaction, and they do so
with low micromolar potency in cell assays (≈10 µM) (58, 59). While some show good selectivity
vs TNF (e.g., DRI-C23041, DRI-C24041), others seem more promiscuous (e.g., DRI-C91005). TNFinhibitory activities here were somewhat stronger than those we obtained before, e.g., IC50s of
0.6 vs 5 (56) for ErB or 181 vs >1000 (59) for DRI-C21041, possibly due to the use of a different
blocking buffer. We hope that these PPI inhibitory activities can be ultimately separated, but even
if not and they still retain some activity in modulating co-signaling interactions, this might not
necessarily be counterproductive. It could provide a unique opportunity to pursue dual-function
molecules that on one hand, have antiviral activity by inhibiting the interaction needed for CoV
attachment (e.g., SARS-CoV-2-S–ACE2) and, on the other, possess immunomodulatory activity to
rein-in overt inflammation (inhibiting CD40–CD40L) or to unleash T cell cytotoxicity against virusinfected cells (inhibiting PD-1–PD-L1). Targeting of the PD-1 co-signaling pathway could be
particularly valuable for its potential in restoring T cell homeostasis and function from an
exhausted state (101, 102), which is of interest to improve viral clearance and rein-in the
inflammatory immune response and the associated cytokine storm during anti-viral responses

such as those likely implicated in the serious side effects seen in many COVID-19 patients (1, 103105). Notably, the overexuberant immune response seen in COVID-19 has raised the possibility
that the lethality related to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 is possibly related to an uncontrolled
autoimmune response induced by the virus (106), and the presence of auto-antibodies against
type I IFNs in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 has now been confirmed (107).
In conclusion, screening of our library of organic dyes and related novel drug-like
compounds led to the identification of several small-molecule compounds showing promising
broad-spectrum inhibition of the PPI between coronavirus spike proteins and their cognate ACE2
receptor. For several of them, including dyes, such as Congo red and direct violet 1, but especially
novel non-dye compounds, such as DRI-C23041, we have confirmed that they are able to inhibit
the entry of a SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells in a
concentration-dependent manner. While activities might require further optimization, these
results provide clear proof-of-principle evidence that this PPI, critical for CoV attachment and
entry, is susceptible to small-molecule inhibition, making it feasible to pursue such alternative
therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as oral or inhaled
medications.

FT-IR spectrophotometer Paragon 1000 (PerkinElmer). Mass spectra were obtained at the Mass
Spectrometry Research and Education Center, Department of Chemistry, University of Florida
(Gainesville, FL, USA). Low-resolution ES (electron spray) mass spectra were carried out with
Finnigan LCQ DECA/Agilent 1100 LC/MS mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent 6220 ESI TOF (Santa Clara,
CA, USA) mass spectrometer. Analysis of sample purity was performed on an Agilent (Palo Alto,
CA, USA) 1100 series HPLC system with a Thermoscientific Hypurity C8 (5 μm; 2.1 × 100 mm +
guard column). HPLC conditions were as follows: solvent A = water with 2 mM ammonium
acetate, solvent B = methanol with 2 mM ammonium acetate, and flow rate = 0.2 mL/min.
Compounds were eluted with a gradient of A/B = 80:20 at 0 min to 0:100 at 50 min. Purity was
determined via integration of UV spectra at 254 nm, and all tested compounds have a purity of ≥
95%. All synthesized target compounds were tested as triethylamine salts unless otherwise
stated. Details of the synthesis and structure conformation for all DRI-C compounds used here
are summarized in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary

Binding Assays
SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD (cat. no. 40591-V08H and 40592-V08H), SARS-CoV S1+S2 (cat. no.
40634-V08B), HCoV-NL63 S1 (cat. no. 40600-V08H; all with His tag) and ACE2-Fc (cat. no. 10108H05H) used in the binding assay were obtained from SinoBiological (Wayne, PA, USA).

were performed in a 96-well cell-free format similar to the one described before (53, 56-58).
Briefly, microtiter plates (Nunc F Maxisorp, 96-well; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μL/well of Fc-conjugated ACE2 receptor diluted in PBS pH
7.2. This was followed by blocking with 200 μL/well of SuperBlock (PBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for 1 h at RT (60). Then, plates were washed twice using washing solution (PBS pH 7.4, 0.05%
Tween-20) and tapped dry before the addition of the tagged ligand (SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD) and
test compounds diluted in binding buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) to give a total volume of 100
μL/well. After 1 h incubation, three washes were conducted, and a further 1 h incubation with
anti-His HRP conjugate (BioLegend; San Diego, CA, USA; cat. no. 652504) diluted (1:2500) in
SuperBlock (PBS) was used to detect the bound His-tagged ligand. Plates were washed four times
before the addition of 100 μL/well of HRP substrate TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) and
kept in the dark for up to 15 min. The reaction was stopped using 20 μL of 1M H2SO4, and the
absorbance value was read at 450 nm. The plated concentrations of ACE2 receptor and
corresponding concentrations of the ligand used in the inhibitory assays were: 1.0 μg/mL ACE2
with 0.5 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 RBD, 2.0 μg/mL ACE2 with 1.5 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S1, and 1.0 μg/mL
ACE2 with 1 μg/mL SARS-CoV S1S2. . These values were selected following preliminary testing to
optimize response (i.e., to produce a high-enough signal at conditions close to half-maximal
response, EC50). Binding assessments for TNF-R1–TNF-α were performed as previously described
using TNF-R1 at 0.3 μg/mL and TNF-α at 0.02 μg/mL (59), with the exception of using SuperBlock
as the blocking buffer here. Stock solutions of compounds at 10 mM in DMSO were used.

Protein Thermal Shift (Differential Scanning Fluorimetry)
This assay was used as described before (59) and following standard protocols from
literature (78, 79) to establish which protein binds our compounds. SYPRO Orange
(ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA) was used as the fluorescence detection dye with an RT-PCR
machine (StepOnePlus, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA; detection on ROX channel,
575/602 nm) programmed to equilibrate samples at 25 °C for 90 s and then increase temperature
to 99 °C by 0.4 °C every 24 s before taking a reading. Melting point of the protein is considered
the lowest point of the first derivative plot, as calculated by the software included with the RTPCR machine. Optimal concentrations were determined by performing a series of preliminary
scans at various concentrations of protein, compound, and dye (SARS-CoV-2-RBD 0.05 mg/mL,
hACE2-Fc 0.05 mg/mL, SYPRO Orange 4×, 100 mM HEPES buffer, 10 μM of test compound).
SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus Assay
Fluorescent biosensors from Montana Molecular (Bozeman, MT, USA; cat. no. C1100R
and C1100G) were used per the instructions of the manufacturer with minor modifications.
Briefly, HEK293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA; cat. no. CRL-1573) were seeded onto 96-well
plates at a density of 50,000 cells per well in 100 µL complete medium (DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum). A transduction mixture containing ACE2 BacMan Red-Reporter
virus (1.8×108 Vg/mL) and 2 mM sodium butyrate prepared in complete medium was added (50
µL per well) and incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Medium was removed, washed once
with PBS, and replaced with 100 µL fresh medium containing the compound under study, preincubating for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. A transduction mixture containing Pseudo SARS-CoV22

2 Green-Reporter pseudovirus (3.3×108 Vg/mL) and 2 mM sodium butyrate prepared in complete
medium was added (50 µL per well) and incubated for 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Medium was
removed, washed once with PBS, replaced with 150 µL fresh medium, and cells incubated for
additional 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cell fluorescence was detected using an EVOS FL microscope
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and quantified using the Analyze Particles tool after
thresholding for the corresponding colors in ImageJ (US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD, USA; (109)).
Cytotoxicity Assay
For the MTS assay, HEK293T cells were cultured and prepared in the same manner as for
the pseudovirus assay (up until the removal of test compounds there). Briefly, cells were added
to a 96-well microtiter plate at a density of 50,000 cells/well in the absence or presence of various
concentrations of compounds diluted in the same media. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 48
h. After washing three times with culture media, 20 µL per well of MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) was added to the plate at a final volume of 200 µL, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 2
h. Formazan levels were measured using a plate reader at 490 nm.
Statistics and Data Fitting
All binding inhibition assays were performed as at least duplicates per plates, and all
results shown are average of at least two independent experiments. As before (56-58), binding
data were converted to percent inhibition and fitted with standard log inhibitor vs. normalized

Figure 3. Concentration-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD binding to ACE2 by compounds of
the present study. Concentration-response curves obtained for the inhibition of the PPI between SARSCoV-2-RBD (His-tagged, 0.5 µg/mL) and hACE2 (Fc-conjugated, 1 µg/mL) in cell-free ELISA-type assay with
dye (A) and non-dye (B) compounds tested. The promiscuous PPI inhibitor erythrosine B (ErB) and the
food colorant FD&C yellow no. 6 (sunset yellow, SY) were included as a positive and negative controls,
respectively. Data are mean ± SD from two experiments in duplicates and were fitted with standard
sigmoid curves for IC50 determination. Estimated IC50s are shown in the legend indicating that while
suramin and chloroquine were completely inactive (IC50 > 500 µM), several of our in-house compounds
including organic dyes (CgRd, DV1, and others) as well as proprietary DRI-C compounds (e.g., DRI-C23041,
DRI-CC91005) showed promising activity, some even at sub-micromolar levels (IC50 < 1 µM).

Figure 7. Concentration-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into hACE2 expressing
host cells by selected compounds. Quantification of entry of pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein (plus green fluorescent protein reporters; BacMam-based) in ACE2 (plus red fluorescence)
expressing host cells (HEK293T). Representative images (bottom row) and their quantification for
pseudovirus (green) and ACE2 expression (red) using ImageJ (top row) are shown from one experiment
for CgRd and DRI-C23041 in A and B, respectively; average data from three experiments fitted with typical
concentration-response curves are shown in C. The amount of green present is proportional with the
number of infected cells as green fluorescence is expressed only in pseudovirus infected cells, while
amount of red is proportional with the number of ACE2-expressing cells. The organic dye CgRd (A), but
especially DRI-C23041 (B) showed concentration-dependent inhibition with activities corresponding to
low micromolar IC50 values, whereas hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) showed no effect (C).

SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS
8-(4′-Nitrobiphenyl-4-ylcarboxamido)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (16) and the general procedure
for coupling
4′-Nitro[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid (14) was synthesized by two steps as described
in the literature (110). As described before (58), for the synthesis of 16 and as a general procedure
of coupling a modified version of the coupling reaction from reference (61) was used (Scheme
S1). Under an argon atmosphere, trimethylamine (1.74 mL, 12.5 mmol) was added dropwise to
a mixture of 4′-nitro[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid (14) (1.63 g, 6.7 mmol), O-(6chlorobenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate HCTU (2.7 g, 6.5
mmol) and DMF (10 mL) at 0 °C and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at the same
temperature. Subsequently, 8-amino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid 15 (1.50 g, 6.7 mmol) was
added at the same temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight at
room temperature (RT). Diethyl ether (50 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and a yellow
precipitate formed. This precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with diethyl ether (3
× 10 mL) to afford the triethylamine salt of 16 as a yellow solid (2.4 g, 66%). 1H-NMR (500 MHz,

8-(4′-Aminobiphenyl-4-ylcarboxamido)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (17) and the general
procedure for hydrogenation
For the synthesis of 17 and as a general procedure of hydrogenation a modified version
of the corresponding reaction from reference (62) was used as described before (58) (Scheme
S1). A mixture of 8-(4′-nitrobiphenyl-4-ylcarboxamido)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (16) (2.8 g, 5.1
mmol) and 10% Pd on carbon (81 mg) in a solvent mixture of EtOH (6 mL) and DMF (3 mL) was
hydrogenated (H2 balloon) at 80 °C for 3.5 h. The reaction mixture was filtered via a short pad of
Celite®, concentrated in vacuo, and recrystallized from MeOH to afford the triethylamine salt of
17 as a white solid (2.3 g, 86%). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 12.56 (s, 1H), 8.80 (br, 1H), 8.31

Figure S1. Inhibitory effect of selected compounds on SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to hACE2 in our
screening assay. Percent inhibition values obtained at 5 µM concentration shown normalized to control
(100%). Rose Bengal, erythrosine B, and phloxine B that showed the highest activity are known
promiscuous SMI of PPIs (56) and were included as positive controls. Compounds showing promising
(>40%) inhibition were evaluated in detailed concentration-response assays to establish IC50 values.

Figure S2. Concentration-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-S1 binding to ACE2 by compounds of the
present study. Concentration-response curves obtained for the inhibition of the PPI between SARS-CoV2-S1 (His-tagged, 1.5 µg/mL) and hACE2 (Fc-conjugated, 2 µg/mL) in cell-free ELISA-type assay with
compounds tested. Data are mean ± SD from two experiments in duplicates and were fitted with standard
sigmoid curves for IC50 determination as in Figure 3.
