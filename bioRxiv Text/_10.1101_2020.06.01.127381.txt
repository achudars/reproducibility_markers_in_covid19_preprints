Abstract
Background: The Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is now the international concerns
and a pandemic, since the World Health Organization declared as the outbreaks. The objective of
this study to assess the prevention knowledge and practices towards the COVID-19 among the
residents of Ethiopia.
Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among the sample of Ethiopian residents
via social platforms of the author’s network with the popular media such as Facebook, in Ethiopia
from the April 15-22, 2020 and successfully recruited 341 responses. The snowball sampling was
employed to recruit the participants. The data were analyzed using STATA version 14. Descriptive
statistics were used to summarize the level of knowledge and practices.
Results: The majority of the respondents (80.35%) were male. The overall prevention knowledge
of the participants towards the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was high. About 91.2% of the
participant was heard about the novel coronavirus disease and Social Medias’ were the main source
of the information. About 90% of the participants had a good prevention knowledge of maintaining
social distance and frequent hand washing. The practices of the participants towards the COVID19 prevention were very low. Out of 341 participants, only 61% and 84% of the participants were
practicing social distance and frequent hand washing, respectively.
Conclusions: Majority of the participants had knew the ways of protecting themselves from the
novel coronavirus. But, there was deficiencies of changing these prevention knowledge to practice.
This indicates that there was gap between knowledge and implementation of prevention strategies
in the community. The concerned body should focus on providing education for the community
regarding the implementation of the prevention knowledge to practice.
Key words: Novel coronavirus, Knowledge, Practices, Pandemic, Ethiopia

Introduction
Coronavirus is one of the major pathogens that mainly target the respiratory system of humans.
Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses were recorded in history as severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (GeoPoll 2020). The new
coronavirus identified as the cause of the acute respiratory disease since the end of December
2019, later labelled as SARS-CoV2 by World Health Organization is a different strain of
coronavirus from SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The difference is genetic make-up, clinical
presentations, case fatality and the rate of spread across the world. SARS-CoV2, the virus that
causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), become the newest virus to cause global health fear
(WHO, 2020; Nuwagira and Muzoora 2020).
The COVID-19 symptoms can range from mild (or no symptoms) to severe illness and are mainly
characterized by fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache, sore throat and rhinorrhea and sometimes
hemoptysis (Adhikari et al. 2020, Cascella, Rajnik et al. 2020). The main route of transmissions
are close contact (about 6 feet or two arm lengths) with a person who has COVID-19, respiratory
droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and touching a surface or object that
has the virus on it, and then by touching mouth, nose, or eyes (Guo et al. 2020).
Currently, more than 2.2 million people were getting infected, and more than 152 thousands died
of coronavirus globally as of 19 April 2020 (Roy et al. 2020), and the figures are still increasing
rapidly. In Africa, almost all countries have now confirmed cases and the number of deaths is
increasing. If the spread of the disease is not well managed, its impact on the African economy
will be extensive. Africa’s already fragile health systems, coupled with a high burden of Covid-19
would cost the continent greatly. The speed with which countries can detect report and respond to
outbreaks can be a reflection of their wider institutional capacity (Ikhaq, Riaz et al. 2020, Olapegba
et al. 2020). The threat of COVID-19 to health systems in Africa can be compared with a metaphor
which says “the eye of the crocodile”; which means in the lake, only the eyes of the crocodile is
visible on the surface while the rest of the body is immersed in water. In this viewpoint, the eyes
represent the public health preparedness while the body of the crocodile represents Africa’s fragile
health systems (Paintsil, 2020).

According to the Ministry of Health, Ethiopia, the number of infected cases reached 117 and 3
deaths as of 24 April 2020. In a developing country like Ethiopia, where trained human resources
and equipment for the treatment of COVID-19 are scarce, working on prevention of the viral
spread should be a priority and feasible intervention. Government of Ethiopia has declared a state
of emergency to stop the spread of the disease. These include implementation of staying home as
much as possible, avoiding close contact with others, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched
surfaces, washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer
containing at least 60% alcohol (Cascella et al. 2020). For successful implementation of these
preventive measures, knowledge of the community about coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and
practice of its preventive measures have to be optimum. However, the level of knowledge and
practice of the people is not well understood. Thus, this study is intended to identify the level of
knowledge and practice towards Covid-19 prevention among residents in Ethiopia.

Methodology
This study employed an online cross-sectional survey by using the Google Forms to collects the
data from the respondents regarding their prevention knowledge and practice towards the COVID19 pandemic from April 15-22, 2020. Since, the first cases of the COVID-19 confirmed in Ethiopia
on March 13, 2020 the government declared the state lockdown on April 5, 2020. These made
difficult to conduct the community or institutional based survey. Depending on this to select the
respondents from the population snowball sampling technique was employed through the author’s
network with residents on the popular social media such as ; Facebook, Telegram, and Email in
Ethiopia. The link of the questionnaire was posted by the author’s on the above mentioned Social
Media and to fulfill the Terms and Conditions of website regarding the responses of respondents
the following questions was added at the end of the questionnaire on the Google Forms, said that
“By submitting this form, do you agree to the Terms and Conditions of Google Forms” and if they
agreed with this Terms and Conditions of the Google Forms their responses can be submitted. So,
we are confidential that our data collection method was compiled with the Terms and Conditions
of the Google Forms website. The questionnaire contained both an open ended and closed ended
questions that focused on the respondents Socio-demographic, prevention knowledge, and practice
towards the COVID-19. The inclusion criteria of the participants used in this study was: be able

to read and understand English language, have Ethiopian nationality, and be aged ≥ 18 years.
Prior proceeding to fulfill the questionnaire objective of the study, the informed consent of
participation, the declaration of anonymity and confidentiality of their response was briefed in well
manner in the questionnaire (Roy et al. 2020).
Measurements and Data Management
The prevention knowledge and practice towards the COVID-19 were measured based on the WHO
(2020) Survey Tool and Guidance (WHO, 2020b). This study was employed descriptive statistics
to summarize the prevention knowledge and the practice of their respondents towards the Novel
coronavirus pandemic(WHO, 2020a) . The questions about prevention knowledge had 7 items as
presented in Table 2 , and the questions about the respondent’s practice of prevention knowledge
had 6 items as presented in Table 3 and the rest of the four questions was about the respondent’s
Socio-demographic information. All the questions contained the category of (“Yes”, “No”, “Don’t
know”). The prevention knowledge and the practice level was assessed by assigning one point for
each correct answer and the prevention knowledge indicated by two category: poor for ( < 5 of 7
items) and good for ( ≥ 5 of 7 items). Specially regarding of the practice of prevention knowledge
the respondents was asked about going crowded place, wearing mask in public, maintain the social
distance, hand washing, avoid handshaking, and obeying the government restriction. The practices
of participants was indicated by two category: poor practice for ( < 4 of 6 items) and good practice
for ( ≥ 4 of 6 items).
The collected data was checked manually for its completeness. The data was coded and edited in
Epi-Info version 3.5.1 and exported to STATA version 14.0 for further statistical data analysis.
The descriptive statistics was employed to summarize the data of this study.
Ethical Approval and Considerations
The study was conducted by preparing the online survey and the investigators informed the study
participants about the general objective of the study and that their answer were remain anonymous
to ensure the confidentiality of the information they provided. So, their consent of participation
was informed prior to proceeding to fill questionnaire to every respondents. The questionnaire was

The Prevention Knowledge of the respondents towards the COVID-19
In the current study, from all respondents, the majority (91.8%) had heard of Covid-19. Though
the majority of the respondents thought to avoid touching nose, eye, and face with unwashed hand
protects from getting of the COVID-19, and about 11.4% of the respondents do not agree with this
preventive measure. The 286 (83.9%) out of all the respondents thought that wearing mask can
protects from getting of the COVID-19 and rest of 16.1% of the respondent’s do not knew wearing
a face mask can protect from getting of the COVID-19. Majority, three-fourth of the respondents
reported that avoiding hugging with people can protect from getting the infection of COVID-19
and 26.7% out of all respondents thought that drinking a lot of water can protect from getting
infection of the COVID-19. More than 93% of the respondents reported that maintaining social
distance can protect from getting of the COVID-19 and 90% of them thought that frequent hand
washing for 20 seconds can protect from getting infection of the COVID-19 (Table 2)

The majority of the respondents who had highest educational level knew that avoiding touching of
eye, face, and nose with unwashed hand can reduce the risk of getting infected with the Novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19) (Figure 2).
The majority of the respondents who had highest educational level reported that they knew that
maintaining social distance can reduces the risk of getting with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID19). On other hand, respondents with secondary level of education and below had less knowledge
on maintaining social distance can reduce the risk of getting the COVID-19 (Figure 3).
The respondents practices on the prevention of the COVID-19
In this study, about 77.4% of the respondents were not obeying government restrictions, whereas;
only about 22.6% of the respondents were obeying the government restriction on the COVID-19
prevention. About 137(40.2%) of the respondents were a still going to crowded places and about
76% of them were not wearing a face masks when leave the home. About 61.1% of the respondents
were keeping themselves two meters from another person’s in the public place while 39.9% of the
respondents were not experiencing social distance in the public place. Majority (84.5%) of the
respondents wash their hand when they go to the public place and 20.8% of the respondents are
still making the handshake with people when they go to the public place (Table 3).

Majority of the respondents who live in the urban area had a good implementation of prevention
knowledge towards the COVID-19 pandemic through wearing a face mask when they went to the
public place as compared to the respondents live in suburban and rural area, respectively (Figure
4).
Those respondents with highest educational level had a good practices of prevention knowledge
towards the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining the social distance (i.e., at least keeping yourself
two meters from another person) as compared to the respondents with secondary educational level
(Figure 5).
The mean score and standard deviation of the respondents prevention knowledge of the COVID19 pandemic was 5.52 ±1.11 and the mean score and standard deviation of the respondents on the
practice of prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic was 3.09 ± 1.06 (Table 4).

As we have seen from below (Figure 6) the most main source of information the participant ever
heard about the COVID-19 pandemic were social media and television.
Discussion
This study was the first study to assess the prevention knowledge and practices of prevention
knowledge towards the COVID- 19 prevention among the residents of Ethiopia. Accordingly, the
prevention knowledge of the respondents towards the novel coronavirus was high. Because of the
government of Ethiopia was taking a lot of measurements after the first cases of the COVID-19

was confirmed and the measurement include the social media campaigns, awareness creation about
the diseases, the closing school and university ,the closing religious places, and declaring the state
lockdown was used to minimize the transmission root of the diseases.
Based on knowledge score of the participants, overall prevention knowledge towards the COVID
19 pandemic was 78.8%. It is lower than the study conducted in China among health care workers
in which the knowledge of HCW towards COVID 19 prevention was high (89%) (Zhou et al.
2020). Furthermore, this finding is lower than the finding conducted in Pakistan in which the
knowledge towards COVID 19 prevention was 92.3% (Saqlain et al. 2020). This discrepancy could
be due to the difference in the study population. The previous studies were conducted among health
professional to assess their knowledge level, but the current study is conducted among the general
population. This is due to the fact that health professional has more exposure to the information
regarding the disease.
The finding of our study was far higher than the study conducted in Nigeria among pregnant
women. The result showed that the knowledge of pregnant women regarding to the preventive
mechanism of COVID 19 was 60.9% (Nwafor et al. 2020). The difference might be due to the
time of the study and the population participated in the study. In a study conducted in Nigeria, the
disease was declared as a pandemic for the first time while our study was conducted after the
population provided with awareness about the disease. In addition, in the previous study, pregnant
women were participated, while in the current study residents were participated. Despite the
knowledge level of Ethiopia population towards coronavirus prevention was high, the practice
toward the disease prevention was poor. This could be due to various factors including the
availability of personal protective in Ethiopia is inadequate, the economic status of the population
is substandard and their life is depending on daily activity.
In our study, more than 90% of the population had a good knowledge with regards to maintaining
social distance and frequently washing hand for greater than 20 seconds. These are the two main
strategies which were recommended by WHO to prevent the transmission of the disease (WHO,
2020c). Even the knowledge regarding social distancing and frequent hand washing was good, the
practice of experiencing social support and frequent hand washing is low when compared to their
knowledge level. In our study, only 61% and 84% of participants practice social distancing and
hand washing, respectively. Furthermore, around 88% of participants have good knowledge that

wearing a mask can protect us from COVID 19. Similarly, 82 % of participants were practiced to
worn mask to prevent COVID 19 in Ethiopia.
In our finding, around 91.2% of Ethiopian Population had heard about Novel coronavirus at the
time of the study. It is comparable with a study conducted in Pakistan in which more than 90% of
medical students had heard about the disease (Ikhaq et al. 2020). Furthermore, this finding is in
line with a study conducted in Nepal in which 91.6 % of population aware all the clinical features
of Coronavirus (Vaidya et al., 2020). A survey conducted in three countries of Africa (Nigeria,
South Africa and Kenya) showed that greater than 94% of the population were heard the
coronavirus (GeoPoll, 2020).
The main source information for the participants was social media, followed by the Television,
which is in line with the multinational study done in India (Kamate, et al. 2020). But it is in
contradict with a study done in Nigeria in which the main source of information was mass media
(Olapegba et al., 2020). It is obvious that during the development of a newly emerging disease like
coronavirus, there might not be enough published literature on local or international journals. In
such cases, social medias’ such as Facebook and telegram plays a major role in providing up-todate information for the population. In addition, television and radio are the main source
information next to social media, but it depends on various factors like availability of light, cost,
and mostly available in urban town. In Ethiopia, most of the population live in rural/remote area,
and the availability of Television are very low because the coverage of the electric light is low,
hence, the population are forced to use easily accessible material such as mobile data.
Strength and limitation of the study
The strength of this study was it is the first study to assess the prevention knowledge and practice
of prevention knowledge towards the Novel coronavirus diseases among the residents of Ethiopia.
There are some limitations to this research. First, questions related to knowledge and practices are
not validated. The second and the major limitation of this study was the data collected by an online
distribution of the survey through the Social Media and only individual with the access of Social
Media and internet can participate in the study and this study cannot represent the overall
population of the country.

Conclusions
In this study, almost the prevention knowledge of the respondent towards the COVID-19 pandemic
was high. But, the practice of the respondents prevention knowledge to the implementation very
low and the practices score of the respondent was (mean=3.09), which very low and which
indicates that the practices the respondents towards the COVID-19 pandemic was poor. As far as
the result of this study shows the respondents had a good prevention knowledge of the COVID-19
pandemic. To tackle the spreads of the COVID-19 pandemic in the community the prevention
knowledge of the community should be implemented into the practices and the stakeholders should
play their significant contribution by teaching the community in ways to implementing the
prevention knowledge to combat the spread of the Novel coronavirus pandemics.
