SUMMARY
To predict the tropism of human coronaviruses, we profile 28 SARS-CoV-2 and
coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs) using single-cell RNAsequencing data from a wide range of healthy human tissues. SCARFs include cellular
factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Among adult organs, enterocytes and
goblet cells of the small intestine and colon, kidney proximal tubule cells, and gallbladder
basal cells appear most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data. Our
analysis also suggests alternate entry paths for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung, central
nervous system, and heart. We predict spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells,
but not ovarian cells, to be highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting male-specific
vulnerabilities. Early stages of embryonic and placental development show a moderate
risk of infection. The nasal epithelium looks like another battleground, characterized by
high expression of both promoting and restricting factors and a potential age-dependent
shift in SCARF expression. Lastly, SCARF expression appears broadly conserved across
human, chimpanzee and macaque organs examined. Our study establishes an important
resource for investigations of coronavirus biology and pathology.

INTRODUCTION
The zoonotic spillover of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) in the human population is causing a disease known as coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Lu et al., 2020; Paules et al., 2020). Since the first case
reported in late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 203 countries, infecting
more than 4 million humans and claiming over 300,000 lives, primarily among the elderly
(John Hopkins University and Medicine, 2020; Xu and Li, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). SARSCoV-2 is the third coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe
pneumonia in humans (Corman et al., 2018). Of these, SARS-CoV-2 is most closely
related to SARS-CoV in nucleotide sequence (~80%), but all three coronaviruses appear
to cause similar pathologies (Ding et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2016).
Emerging clinical and molecular biology data from COVID-19 patients have detected
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids primarily in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, and nasal
swabs, and less frequently in fibrobronchoscope brush biopsies, pharyngeal swabs, feces
and with even lower positive rates in blood and urine (Ling et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020d; Wu et al., 2020a; Young et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020a). Pathological
investigations, including post-mortem biopsies, remain limited for COVID-19, but have
confirmed major pulmonary damage as the most likely cause of death in the cases
examined (Huang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020b). There is also growing evidence that
SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage other organ systems including the heart, kidney, liver,
and gastrointestinal tract, as documented previously for SARS and MERS (Ding et al.,
2003; Gu et al., 2005; Ng et al., 2016). Notably, it has been reported that cardiac injury is
common in COVID-19 patients (Shi et al., 2020), as well as acute kidney injury (Cheng et
al., 2020; Diao et al., 2020; Fanelli et al., 2020; Volunteers et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020c). Severe COVID-19 patients show frequent liver dysfunctions (Zhang et al., 2020)
and evidence of gastrointestinal infection has also been reported (Gao et al., 2020; Xiao
et al., 2020). Evidence of impaired gonadal function in male COVID-19 patients was also
recently presented (Ma et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020c). Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 can
also be detected in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid and may even cause neurological
complications (Moriguchi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b). It is not yet understood what

causes the wide range of clinical phenotypes observed in people infected with SARSCoV-2. Importantly, it remains unclear which of these pathologies are caused by direct
infection of the organs affected or indirect effects mediated by systemic inflammatory
responses or comorbidities. A prerequisite to resolve these critical questions is to gain a
better understanding of the tropism of the virus (which tissues and cell types are
permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection) and of the cellular processes and genetic factors
modulating the course and outcome of an infection.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, our current knowledge of cellular factors
regulating its entry into cells is mostly derived from studies of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV,
and ‘commensal’ human coronaviruses (hCoV). The canonical entry mechanism of these
coronaviruses is a two-step process mediated by the viral Spike (S) protein decorating
the virion. First, the S protein must bind directly to a cell surface receptor and second, it
must be cleaved (‘primed’) by a cellular protease to enable membrane fusion. Thus, the
cellular tropism of a coronavirus is conditioned not only by the expression of an adequate
receptor on the cell surface, but also by the presence of a host-encoded protease capable
of cleaving the S protein, preferably at or close to the site of receptor binding (de Haan
and Rottier, 2005; Tang et al., 2020). For both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, angiotensinConverting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) have
been identified as a prime receptor and a critical protease, respectively, for entry into a
target cell (Glowacka et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003; Matsuyama et
al., 2010; Wrapp et al., 2020). These findings have prompted numerous efforts to profile
the basal expression levels of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 across healthy human tissues in
order to predict the tropism of these two closely related viruses. While studies monitoring
protein abundance in situ (e.g. immunocytochemistry) offer a more direct assessment,
and have been conducted previously to study ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 expression
(Hamming et al., 2004; Hikmet et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020), most recent
investigations have taken advantage of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to
profile the expression of these two factors at cellular resolution in a wide array of tissues
(see references in Table S1).

Collectively these studies have revealed a subset of tissues and cell types potentially
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (see Table S1 for a summary). However, they suffer from
several limitations. First, most studies (15/27) profiled a single organ or organ system,
and the majority focused on the respiratory tract. Second, most studies (19/27) restricted
their analysis to ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2, ignoring other factors potentially limiting SARSCoV-2 entry or replication. Yet, there is evidence that these two proteins alone cannot
solely explain all the current clinical and research observations. For instance, certain cell
lines (e.g. A549 alveolar lung carcinoma) can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the absence
of appreciable level of ACE2 RNA or protein (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Wyler et al., 2020).
Similarly, clinical data point to SARS-CoV-2 infection of several organs, such as lung,
bronchus, nasopharynx, esophagus, liver and stomach, where ACE2 expression could
not be detected in healthy individuals (Hikmet et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020b). Moreover,
there are discordant reports as to where and how much ACE2 may be expressed in
certain cells, including alveolar type II cells of the lung, which are widely regarded as a
primary site of infection and tissue damage. Together, these observations suggest that
either ACE2 expression levels vary greatly between individuals or during the course of an
infection (Ziegler et al., 2020) or that SARS-CoV-2 can use alternate receptor(s) to enter
certain cell types. For instance, cell surface protein Basignin (BSG, also known as
CD147) has been shown to interact with the S protein in vitro and facilitate entry of SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Vero and 293T cells (Vankadari and Wilce, 2020; Wang et al.,
2020b). In fact, SARS-CoV and other hCoVs can utilize multiple cell surface molecules
to promote their entry into cells, including ANPEP (Yeager et al., 1992), CD209 (DCSIGN) (Yang et al., 2004), CLEC4G (LSECtin) (Marzi et al., 2004), and CLEC4M
(LSIGN/CD299) (Gramberg et al., 2005). Likewise, hCoVs can use a variety of cellular
proteases to prime their S protein, in substitution for TMPRSS2 in a cell type-specific
manner. These include other members of the TMPRSS family (e.g. TMPRSS4)
(Glowacka et al., 2011; Zang et al., 2020), but also Cathepsins (CTSL/M) (Simmons et
al., 2013a) and FURIN (Mille and Whittaker, 2014; Walls et al., 2020). To our knowledge,
no single study has examined systematically the expression of these alternate hCoV entry
factors. Just as importantly, none of the previous studies have taken into account the
expression of host factors known to oppose or restrict cellular entry of hCoVs, including

SARS-CoV-2, such as LY6E (Pfaender et al., 2020) and IFITM proteins (Huang et al.,
2011). Overall, our understanding of cellular factors underlying the potential tropism of
SARS-CoV-2 remain very partial.
To begin addressing these gaps, we curated a list of 28 human genes referred to as
SCARFs for SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus-Associated Receptors and Factors (Figure
1A and Table S2) and surveyed their basal RNA expression levels across a wide range
of healthy tissues. Specifically, we mined publicly available scRNA-seq datasets using
consistent normalization procedures to integrate and compare the dynamics of SCARF
expression in human pre-implantation embryos (Yan et al., 2013), at the maternal-fetal
interface (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018), in male and female gonads (Sohni et al., 2019;
Wagner et al., 2020) and 14 other adult tissues (Han et al., 2020), as well as nasal
brushing from young and old healthy donors (Deprez et al., 2019; Garcıá et al., 2019;
Vieira Braga et al., 2019). Additionally, we use bulk transcriptomics for four organs of
interest (lung, kidney, liver, heart) from human, chimpanzee, and macaque (Blake et al.,
2020) to examine the conservation of SCARF expression across primates. This study
represents the most systematic survey of SCARF expression to date and provides a
valuable resource, including a user-friendly web browser, for interpreting and prioritizing
clinical, pathological, and biological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
RESULTS
SCARF curation
Because many cellular factors involved in viral replication, such as those involved in
transcription, translation and other housekeeping functions, are unlikely to affect the
tropism of the virus, we primarily focus on factors acting at the level of entry. Two factors
have been established most rigorously to promote cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 (and
previously SARS-CoV) in human cells (Figure 1 and Table S2): the ACE2 receptor and
TMPRSS2 protease (Hoffmann et al., 2020). BSG is a putative alternate receptor for both
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which has received experimental support (Chen et al.,
2005; Wang et al., 2020b). We also included receptors which have been confirmed

experimentally to facilitate entry of either SARS-CoV/hCoV-229E (ANPEP, CD209,
CLEC4G/M) or MERS-CoV (DPP4), and are therefore candidates for promoting SARSCoV-2 entry (Vankadari and Wilce, 2020). Next, we considered a number of cellular
proteases, in addition to TMPRSS2, as alternative priming factors. TMPRSS4 was
recently shown to be capable of performing this function for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells
(Bertram et al., 2011; Zang et al., 2020). TMPRSS11A/B has been shown to activate the
S peptide of other coronaviruses (Kam et al., 2009; Zmora et al., 2018). Additionally,
FURIN is known to activate MERS-CoV and possibly SARS-CoV-2 (Mille and Whittaker,
2014; Walls et al., 2020) and Cathepsins (CTSL/B) can also substitute for TMPRSS2 to
prime SARS-CoV (Simmons et al., 2013b). Importantly, we also enlisted several
restriction factors that are known to protect cells against entry of SARS-CoV-2 (LY6E)
(Pfaender et al., 2020) or a broad range of enveloped RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV
(IFITM1-3) (Huang et al., 2011). We also considered a few additional factors that act postentry, but relatively early in viral replication such as TOP3B and MADP1 (ZCRB1), which
may expressed in a tissue/cell type-specific fashion and are known to be essential for
genome replication of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, respectively (Prasanth et al., 2020;
Tan et al., 2012). Lastly, we included a set of proteins known to be involved in assembly
and trafficking of a range of RNA viruses and have been shown recently to interact
physically with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Gordon et al., 2020), including members
of the Rho-GTPase complex (RHOA, RAB10, RAB14, and RAB1A), AP2 complex
(AP2A2 and AP2M1), and CHMP2A. In total, our list includes 28 SCARFs we deem solid
candidates for modulating SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human cells (Figure 1).
SCARF expression during pre-implantation embryonic development
To profile SCARF RNA expression in early embryonic development, we mined scRNAseq data for human pre-implantation embryos (Yan et al., 2013). Our analysis revealed
that ACE2 mRNA is most abundant in the earlier stages of development, prior to zygotic
genome activation (ZGA, 8-cell stage), indicating maternal RNA deposition (Figure 2A
and S1A). ACE2 transcript levels are depleted post-ZGA until the formation of the
trophectoderm of the blastocyst in which they rise up again (Figure 2A and S1A). By
contrast, TMPRSS2 expression is only apparent in the primordial endoderm and

trophectoderm lineages. In fact, none of the TMPRSS family members showed significant
transcript levels (log2 FPKM >1) prior to ZGA (Figure 2A and Figure S1A-B). Pluripotent
stem cells show high expression of IFITM1-3 but no evidence of ACE2 expression (Figure
2A and Figure S1A). Furthermore, analysis of another scRNA-seq dataset profiling
~60,000 cells representing 10 cell types differentiated in vitro from pluripotent stem cells
(Han et al., 2020) show no significant ACE2 expression in any cells up to 20 days postdifferentiation (Figure S1C). Together these data suggest that pluripotent stem cells and
cells in early stage of differentiation are unlikely to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2
infection.
SCARF expression at the maternal-fetal interface
The high level of TMPRSS2, ACE2 and other coronavirus receptors such as ANPEP in
the trophectoderm, which gives rise to the placenta, combined with low levels of IFITMs
in this lineage (Figure 2A and Figure S1A) raises the possibility that the developing
placenta may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate this, we turned to
the transcriptomes of ~70,000 single cells derived from tissues collected at the maternalfetal interface during the first semester of pregnancy (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018), which
include both embryo-derived cells (fetal placenta) as well as maternal blood and decidual
cells. Our analysis of this dataset based on unsupervised clustering and examination of
known markers recapitulated the major types of trophoblasts, decidua and immune cells
(Figure 2B and S2A). Expression of ACE2 and DPP4 receptors was evident in
cytotrophoblasts (CTB) and syncytiotrophoblasts (STB). ANPEP was abundantly
expressed in all fetal lineages, while BSG was broadly expressed in maternal and fetal
cells, but at much higher density in fetal cells (Figure 2C-D). CLEC4M was the only
potential receptor highly expressed in maternal-derived cells; our analysis identified this
gene as a strong marker of decidual perivascular cells (Figure 2B-D). Interestingly,
extravillous trophoblasts (EVT), which directly invade maternal tissue, showed low level
of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, but moderate to high levels of restriction factors IFITM1-3 and
LY6E, which were also expressed by immune and decidual cells (Figure S2B).
TMPRSS2-expressing cells were comparatively less abundant within any cell types than

those expressing receptors (Figure 2C). Thus, the maternal-placenta interface displays a
complex pattern of SCARF expression.
To more finely assess the permissiveness of different placental cell types to SARS-CoV2 entry, we quantified the fraction of each cell types co-expressing different combinations
of receptors with proteases (predicted as more permissive) or with restriction factors (less
permissive). The CTB stood out for having the largest fraction of cells double-positive for
various

including

(0.05%),

ACE2+FURIN+ (~3%), BSG+TMPRSS2+ (0.8%), BSG+FURIN+ (10%), DPP4+TMPRSS2+
(0.6%), and DPP4+FURIN+ (~10%) (Figure 2D-E, S2C and Table S4). Perivascular
tissues also exhibited BSG+TMPRSS2+ and DPP4+TMPRSS2+ cells, albeit in fewer
proportion compared to CTB (0.5 %) (Figure 2E and S2B). Interestingly, a substantial
fraction of DPP4+ cells (~20-80%) were co-expressing IFITM1-3 and LY6E consistently
across the whole dataset, whereas ACE2+ and BSG+ cells rarely co-expressed these
restriction factors (Figure 2E, S2D and Table S4). Rather, ACE2+ cells tend to co-express
TMPRSS2 and FURIN, but again this was mostly confined to a small subset of CTB cells
(see also Figure 1D-E). Overall, these results suggest that the CTB is the cell type most
susceptible to coronavirus infection within the first trimester placenta.
SCARF expression in reproductive organs
Of all adult tissues surveyed via bulk RNA-seq by the GTEx consortium (Aguet et al.,
2017), ACE2 showed highest level of expression in human testis (Figure S4). To monitor
more finely the expression profile of SCARFs in male and female reproductive tissues,
we analyzed scRNA-seq datasets from testis samples collected from two healthy donors
(Sohni et al., 2019) and adult ovary from five healthy donors (Wagner et al., 2020). In
adult testis, we were able to recapitulate the expression clusters identified in the original
report (Sohni et al., 2019), which consisted of early and late stages of spermatogonia
(SPG), spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), spermatids (ST), macrophages, endothelial
and immune cells, each defined by a unique set of marker genes (Figure S3A-B). Turning
to SCARFs, we observed that TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in both early and late
SSCs, whereas CoV receptors are abundantly expressed in the early stage of SSCs

(Figure 3A). Early SSCs expressing one of the receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4, ANPEP)
were found to be consistently enriched for co-expression with TMPRSS2 across the testis
dataset (hypergeometric distribution, p-value <1e-7) (Figure 3B). Moreover, other
SCARFs interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and predicted to facilitate virus trafficking
or assembly (Table S2) also show highest transcript levels in SSC and SPG (Figure
3C). In contrast, restriction factors were lowly expressed in all four clusters of
spermatogonial cells (Figure 3A). Taken together these observations indicate
spermatogonial cells may be highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Our analysis of ovarian cortex samples from 5 donors resolve the major cell types
characteristic of this tissue, such as granulosa, immune, endothelial, perivascular, and
stromal cells, each defined by a unique set of markers (Figure S3C-D), in concordance
with the original article (Wagner et al., 2020). ACE2+ cells were generally rare across this
dataset, and most evident in granulosa, where they show a relatively high level of
expression per cell (Figure 3D). Alternate receptors were expressed at significant level in
specific ovarian cell populations. For instance, DPP4 was expressed in 4% of endothelial
cells, while CLEC4M and BSG were highly expressed in granulosa (Figure 3D). T cells
and endothelial layers were markedly enriched for ANPEP and DPP4 transcripts,
respectively (Figure 3D). Strikingly, however, we could not identify any single cell across
the entire ovarian dataset with evidence of TMPRSS2 expression, nor any of the alternate
proteases TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11A and TMPRSS11B. This pattern was corroborated by
examining the expression profile of all TMPRSS protease family members using bulk
RNA-seq data from GTEx. None of these proteases appear to be expressed in ovarian
tissue, whereas the testis expresses 7 out of 19 members including TMPRSS2 (Figure
S4 and S5). We note that the oocyte also lacks transcripts from any TMPRSS family
members (see Figure 2A, S1A). Collectively, these data reveal a stark contrast between
male and female reproductive organs: while early stages of spermatogenesis may be
highly permissive for SARS-CoV-2 entry, the ovary and oocytes are unlikely to get
infected.

Human cell landscape reveals adult organs potentially most permissive to SARSCoV-2
We analyzed a scRNA-seq dataset for ~200,000 cells generated as part of the human
cell landscape (HCL) project, which encompasses all major adult organs (Han et al.,
2020). We favored this dataset over the Human Cell Atlas project (Rozenblatt-Rosen et
al., 2017) because the HCL samples were prepared uniformly and processed through the
same sequencing platform and raw counts for unique molecular identifiers (UMI) were
publicly available, which enabled adequate normalization using our scRNA-seq analysis
pipeline (see Methods). We selected 14 distinct adult tissues and clustered them into 33
distinct cell-types annotated using the markers described in the original article (Han et al.,
2020) (Figure 4A and S6A).
We first focus our analysis on ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the two genes most robustly
established as entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 (Table S2). Transcripts for both genes were
detected (> 0.1 % of total cells) primarily in colon, intestine (ileum, duodenum and
jejunum), gallbladder, and kidney cells (Figure S6B-D). We detected little to no expression
of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 in the remaining tissues and cell types (Figure 4B), including
type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) alveolar cells of the lung. This latter observation is at odds
with earlier reports (Table S1), but in line with a recent study using a wide array of
techniques to monitor ACE2 expression within the lung, including transcriptomics,
proteomics and immunostaining (Hikmet et al., 2020). Cardiomyocytes (from the heart)
show relatively high levels of ACE2, but lacked TMPRSS2 expression (Figure 4B and
S6B-E). It is also important to emphasize that even when ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 were
detected at appreciable RNA levels in a given organ or cell type, only a very small fraction
of cells was found to express both genes simultaneously. For instance, the kidney shows
relatively high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but only 0.01% cells were double-positive
for these factors. Only three cell types stood out in our analysis for relatively elevated
levels of co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (0.5-5% of cells double-positives):
enterocytes, proximal tubule cells, and goblet cells (Figure 4B-C), which we will return to
below.

Examining alternative receptors revealed a more complex picture, in part reflecting the
tissue-specificity of these genes. For instance, CLEC4G and CLEC4M were highly
expressed in the liver as previously reported (Domínguez-Soto et al., 2009), and more
specifically in sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes (Figure 4B and S6B-C). BSG
marked the pericytes and astrocytes of the cerebellum, as well as intercalated cells of the
kidney, whereas CD209 was enriched in macrophages (Figure 4B and S6B). ANPEP and
DPP4 were often co-expressed in multiple organs and cell types, including prostate, lung,
kidney, colon and small intestine (Figure S6B). Furthermore, many of the same organs
exhibited a significant fraction (~2 to ~8%) of cells triple-positive for ANPEP, DPP4 and
TMPRSS2, albeit in variable amounts (Figure S6A-C). The prostate showed particularly
high expression level of DPP4 (~15% double-positive with TMPRSS2 or FURIN) and
moderate levels of ANPEP (~5% double-positive with TMPRSS2 or FURIN) (Table S5).
Expression of these factors within the prostate was primarily driven by endocrine cells,
which displayed the highest fraction of ANPEP+DPP4+TMPRSS2+ cells among all the cell
types defined in our analysis (Figure 4B-C, S6A-C and Table S5). Within the lung, AT2
cells also prominently expressed DPP4, BSG and ANPEP, along with TMPRSS2 and/or
FURIN (Figure 4B-C), suggesting that these receptors, rather than ACE2, could represent
the initial gateway by which SARS-CoV-2 infect AT2 cells, which are known to be
extensively damaged in SARS and COVID-19 pathologies (Qi et al., 2020). Intercalated
cells of the kidney as well as goblet cells and enterocytes of the colon were also highly
enriched for TMPRSS2+DPP4+BSG+ cells (Figure 4B-C and S6A-C).
The small intestine was rather unique among the organs represented in this dataset for
expressing high levels of ACE2, ANPEP and DPP4 (Figure S5B and S6B-C), with highest
levels in the jejunum, which also exhibited copious amount of TMPRSS2 (Figure S6 C-E
and S7). This is in slight disagreement with another study, which analyzed the Human
Cell Atlas data and suggested that the ileum displayed the highest level of ACE2
transcripts (Ziegler et al., 2020). Consistent with this study, however, we found that the
bulk of expression of these factors in the small intestine is driven by enterocytes and their
progenitors (Figure 4A-C and S5, S6B and S7). Only two other cell types were equally
remarkable for expressing the quadruple combination of ACE2, ANPEP, DPP4, and

TMPRSS2: (i) goblet cells, epithelial cells lining and producing mucus for several organs
including duodenum, ileum, colon and gallbladder, and (ii) proximal tubular cells of the
kidneys (Figure 4A-C and S6A-B, S7A-D). In addition, the enterocytes, and goblet cells
were enriched for SCARFs interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and implicated in virus
trafficking or assembly (Figure S7E).
In summary, coronavirus entry factors appear to be expressed in a wide range of adult
healthy organs, but in restricted cell types, including pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia
of the cerebellum, sinusoidal endothelium of the liver, endocrine cells of the prostate,
enterocytes of the small intestine, goblet cells, and the proximal tubule of the kidney.
Nasal epithelium
The nasal epithelium is thought to represent a major doorway to SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Sungnak et al., 2020; WU et al., 2020). Since this tissue was not included in the HCL
dataset, we analyzed another scRNA-seq dataset derived from six nasal brushing
samples from healthy donors collected by three independent studies (Deprez et al., 2019;
Garcıá et al., 2019; Vieira Braga et al., 2019) (Table S3). Our analysis of this merged
dataset reveals four major cell clusters consistent across all 6 samples, corresponding to
ciliated, secretory, suprabasal epithelial cells and natural killer cells (Figure 5A, Figure
S8). Natural killer cells express mostly DPP4, while the three epithelial cell types showed
low to moderate RNA amounts of ACE2, ANPEP, BSG and TMPRSS2 (Figure 5A, Table
S6). ACE2 RNA was most abundant in ciliated cells, while ANPEP was most highly
expressed in secretory cells. Conversely, BSG was abundant throughout all the nasal
epithelial cell types, albeit at higher level in suprabasal cells (Figure 5A, S9A and Table
S6). TMPRSS2 was also expressed in all three nasal epithelial cell types, with highest
density in ciliated cells (41%). Overall, the percentage of ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells was
relatively low within each cell type (2.3% in ciliated, 1.6% in secretory and 1% in
suprabasal cells) (Table S6). In contrast with the digestive system (characterized above,
Figure 4B-C), nasal epithelial cells rarely show co-expression of ANPEP, DPP4 and
ACE2, but rather exclusive expression of one of these three receptors (Figure 5A and
S9A). By contrast, restriction factors IFITM3 and LY6E were robustly expressed in all

three nasal epithelial cell types (Figure 5A) with highest levels in secretory and suprabasal
cells (Table S6). Lastly, we calculated the percentage of double/triple positive cells for
various combinations of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and restriction factors (Table S6). We found
that 85% and 65% of ACE2+TMPRSS2+ ciliated cells are also positive for LY6E and
IFITM3, respectively (Table S6). Together these data suggest that the nasal epithelium
expresses various combinations of factors that in principle could facilitate SARS-CoV-2
infection, but it also expresses robust basal level of restriction factors, which may act as
a strong protective barrier in this tissue.
Age may modulate SCARF expression in the nasal epithelium
To investigate a possible age-effect in the expression of CoV entry factors within the nasal
epithelium, we took advantage of the fact that three of the samples analyzed above were
collected from relatively young donors (24-30 years old), while the other three came from
older individuals (50-59 years old) (Figure S8 and Table S3). While this is a small sample,
this enabled us to split the data into a ‘young’ and ‘old’ group and compare the percentage
of secretory and ciliated cells positive for entry factors between the two groups (Table
S3). The percentage of cells positive for either ACE2, TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4 was
comparable between the two groups and these factors were most highly expressed in
ciliated cells of both groups. However, the percentage of double-positive cells
(ACE2+TMPRSS2+ or ACE2+TMPRSS4+) were significantly higher in the old group, both
within ciliated and secretory cell populations (Figure 5B, S9B and Table S6). Interestingly,
the percentage of ANPEP+TMPRSS2+ or ANPEP+TMPRSS2+ double positives cells
showed the opposite trend: they were significantly more frequent in the young group, both
within ciliated and secretory cells (Figure 5B). To examine whether these differences were
driven by an age-dependent shift in the relative expression of receptors and/or proteases
during cell differentiation within the nasal epithelium, we conducted a global differential
gene expression analysis between ciliated and secretory cells within each age group and
each independent study. We found that ANPEP, TMPRSS4 and CTSB were significantly
up-regulated in secretory cells relative to ciliated cells in all three studies, regardless of
age (Figure 5C). Conversely, TMPRSS2 levels were up-regulated in ciliated cells of the
young group, but remains unaltered in old individuals regardless of the study of origin

(Figure 5C-D, Table S7). These results suggest that there is a shift in TMPRSS2
regulation during nasal epithelium differentiation in young individuals that is not occurring
in old individuals (Figure 5C and 5D, Table S7).
Conservation of SCARF expression across primates
To examine the evolutionary conservation of SCARF expression across primates, we
analyzed a recently published comparative transcriptome dataset (bulk RNA-seq) of
heart, kidney, liver, and lung primary tissues from human (N=4), chimpanzee (N=4), and
Rhesus macaque (N=4) individuals, comprising a total of 47 samples (Blake et al., 2020).
As expected, UMAP analysis showed that the samples clustered first by tissue, then by
species (Figure 6A).
Overall, we observe a low level of tissue-specificity and high level of inter-specific
conservation in the expression of most SCARFs, with the notable exceptions of ACE2
and DPP4 receptors, which were included amongst the most variably expressed genes
across tissues and species (Figure 6B). Specifically, liver and lung samples from
chimpanzee showed relatively high DPP4 expression but very low ACE2 expression
relative to human and macaque (Figure 6C-D). Liver and lung samples from human and
chimpanzee did not express ACE2, however the macaque liver showed high expression
level for ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and TMPRSS2 genes (Figure 6D). These results suggest
that macaques may be more prone to liver coronavirus infection than humans or
chimpanzees. In agreement with our scRNA-seq analysis of the HCL dataset, we found
that ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP and TMPRSS2 genes are all expressed at higher level in the
kidney of all three primates, relative to the other three organs. Thus, out of the four organs
examined in this analysis, the kidney appears to be the most readily permissive to
coronavirus infection in all three species (Figure 6C-D).
Finally, we analyzed the pattern of SCARF expression in the blastocyst of Cynomolgus
macaques (a close relative of the Rhesus macaque) in comparison to that of the human
blastocyst (Figure 2A and S1A). Intriguingly, the two species show distinct expression
patterns for several entry factors. TMPRRS2 was highly expressed in the human

trophectoderm (TE), but transcripts for this gene were essentially undetectable in the
macaque blastocyst, including TE (Figure 6E). Also, ANPEP was downregulated in the
macaque TE compared with the rest of the blastocyst lineages, while it was upregulated
in the human TE (compare Figure S1A and Figure 6E). Thus, there may be substantial
differences in the susceptibility of human and macaque early embryos to coronavirus
infection.

DISCUSSION
COVID-19 has created a formidable health and socioeconomic challenge worldwide and
an urgency to develop treatments and vaccines. A prerequisite to the success of these
endeavors is to gain a better understanding of the biology and pathology of SARS-CoV2, a newly emerged coronavirus responsible for millions of infections and over 300,000
deaths as of mid-May 2020. While it is clear that COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory
disease which causes death via pneumonia, many unknowns remain as to the extent of
tissues and cell types vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. How host genetic factors interact with
the virus and modulate the course of an infection also remain poorly understood. Our
study, along with several others (published or preprinted over the past few weeks, Table
S1) have tapped into vast amount of publicly available scRNA-seq data to profile the
expression of host factors thought to be important for entry of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy
tissues. Because the basal expression level of these factors determines, at least in part,
the tropism of the virus, this information is foundational to predict which tissues are more
vulnerable to infection. These data are also important to guide and prioritize clinical
interventions and pathological studies, including biopsies. Finally, this type of analysis
has the potential to reveal possible routes of infection within and between individuals.
Our study distinguishes itself from all other studies reported thus far (see Table S1) by
the wider range of factors (SCARFs) examined across a large array of tissues. Many
studies focused exclusively on the respiratory tract (Sungnak et al., 2020; Zhao et al.,
2020) or other individual organ systems such as the brain, the olfactory system, or the GI
tract (see Table S1). We interrogated a wide and unbiased set of organs, largely

conditioned by public availability of raw data (e.g. UMI counts) as to apply uniform
normalization procedures across datasets. For instance, we were able to integrate HCL
samples that were prepared and processed through a single sequencing facility and
platform. Also, it is important to emphasize that only two datasets examined here
(placenta and nasal cavity from the Human Cell Atlas) were previously analyzed
elsewhere (Sungnak et al., 2020). Thus, our analyses provide an independent replication
of findings reported elsewhere for some tissues (see Table S1) as well as a trove of new
observations (detailed below). The ultimate goal is to deliver within a single study a broad
and robust foundation for future investigations, as well as a user-friendly searchable
interface.
A unique asset of this study lies in the range of SCARFs integrated in the analysis (Table
S2). Most other studies have focused exclusively on ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 (see Table
S1). A handful of studies considered one or a few additional receptors (e.g. DPP4,
ANPEP) in a subset of their analyses (Sungnak et al., 2020). To our knowledge, no other
study has included all the human coronavirus receptors considered here, even though
these alternate receptors have been experimentally confirmed to interact with and
facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (BSG) or the closely related SARS-CoV (CD209,
CLEC4G/M) (see Table S2 for references). Furthermore, our study is the first to consider
factors known or predicted to restrict SARS-CoV-2 at the level of entry, such as LY6E
and IFITMs. While these restriction factors are known to be interferon-inducible (Jia et al.,
2012; Mar et al., 2018), their basal level of expression is likely to be a key determinant of
SARS-CoV-2 tropism. Indeed, it is well established that coronaviruses are equipped with
multiple mechanisms to suppress interferon and other immune signaling pathway
(Frieman and Baric, 2008; Gralinski and Baric, 2015) and there is growing evidence that
SARS-CoV-2 infection also illicit a ‘muted’ interferon response (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020;
Wyler et al., 2020). As such, the basal level at which restriction factors are expressed in
a given target cell may be the major obstacle the virus encounters at the onset of an
infection.

Below we summarize and contrast our findings to existing studies published or available
in preprint repositories as of May 2020 (listed in Table S1) and discuss how our results
further our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathology.
The developing embryo may be at risk of infection
To our knowledge, there has been no prior description of SCARF expression during preimplantation development. While we detect high amount of ACE2 mRNA in the zygote
and up to the 4-cell stage, it precipitously drops at ZGA and remained at very low or
undetectable levels in the pluripotent cells of the early embryo. ACE2 remains silent in
pluripotent stem cells in culture, even after 20 days of in-vitro differentiation to various cell
types. These observations suggest that ACE2 RNA is heavily deposited in the zygote
(presumably from the oocyte), but the gene is subsequently silenced in stem cells and
poorly differentiated cells. The idea that ACE2 expression positively correlates with the
level of cellular differentiation has been observed in the context of the airway epithelium
(Jia et al., 2005).
The only pre-implantation lineage with substantial ACE2 expression is the trophectoderm,
where TMPRSS2 is also highly and consistently expressed. During embryonic
development, the trophectoderm gives rise to all the different types of trophoblasts
(placental fetal cells). Accordingly, we observe that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression
persists in a subset of trophoblasts at least up to the first trimester of pregnancy. Our
results extend recent observations based on an independent analysis of the same
placenta dataset, which remarked ACE2 expression in certain cell types of
placenta/decidua (Sungnak et al., 2020). We further these observations by identifying a
small population of cytotrophoblasts co-expressing TMPRSS2 with ACE2, BSG and/or
DPP4, but exhibiting very low levels of IFITM and LY6E restriction factors. We conclude
that a subset of trophoblast cells may be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 entry. Overall, our
findings for the placenta are consistent with current clinical data suggesting that vertical
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected mother to fetus is plausible, but probably rare
(Baud et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Cui et al., 2020; Hosier et al., 2020; Zeng et al.,
2020). Future studies should be directed at examining SCARF expression at different

stages of pregnancy and evaluating whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could compromise
pregnancy.
Ovarian cells may be resistant to SARS-CoV-2, but spermatogonial cells seem
highly permissive
While we found no evidence for expression of any TMPRSS genes considered in female
reproductive tissues, our analysis suggests that the early stages of spermatogenesis are
vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and likely other coronaviruses. Indeed, we observe that
spermatogonial cells (and stem cells) express high level of ACE2, TMPRSS2, DPP4,
ANPEP, and low level of IFITM and LY6E restriction factors. To our knowledge, these
observations have not been reported elsewhere. One study reported high level of ACE2
expression in spermatogonial, Sertoli and Leydig cells (Wang and Xu, 2020), but did not
investigate other SCARFs. Another study reported low level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in
spermatogonial stem cells (Sungnak et al., 2020), but analyzed a different dataset
apparently depleted for spermatogonial cells (data not shown). While it is unknown
whether SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses can infiltrate testes, it is notable that postmortem autopsy of male patients infected by SARS-CoV revealed widespread germ cell
destruction, few or no spermatozoon in seminiferous tubules, and other testicular
abnormalities (Xu et al., 2006). These and other observations (Fanelli et al., 2020; Wang
et al., 2020c), together with our finding that prostate endocrine cells also appear
permissive for SARS-CoV-2, call for pathological examination of testes as well as
investigation of reproductive functions in male COVID-19 patients.
Respiratory tract: how does SARS-CoV-2 infect lung cells?
Because COVID-19, as well as SARS, are primarily respiratory diseases, the lung and
airway systems have been extensively profiled for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression
(Table S2), two SCARFs believed to be primary determinant for SARS-CoV-2 tropism.
Paradoxically, healthy lung tissues as a whole show only modest expression for either
ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which is readily apparent in a number of expression databases
and widely available resources such as GTEx (Figure S4). Nonetheless, a number of
studies mining scRNA-seq data reported marked expression of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2

in a specific lung cell population called alveolar type II (AT2) cells (Chow and Chen, 2020;
Travaglini et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). However, these observations have been
challenged by more recent studies. For instance, Hikmet et al. could not confirm ACE2
expression in AT2 cells, neither through re-analysis of 3 different lung scRNA-seq
datasets, nor by immunohistochemistry (Hikmet et al., 2020). Ziegler et al. analyzed a
different lung scRNA-seq dataset and found only a very small fraction (>1%) of AT2 cells
expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts (Ziegler et al., 2020). Likewise, Aguiar
et al. detected only very low amount ACE2 RNA or protein in alveoli and airway
epithelium, but showed that the alternative receptor BSG was consistently expressed in
respiratory mucosa from 98 human samples (non-COVID-19) (Aguiar et al., 2020). Our
results, which stem from an independent analysis of yet another scRNA-seq dataset (Han
et al., 2020) are consistent with the notion that basal ACE2 RNA levels in lung cells,
including AT2 cells, are very low. Importantly, we observed that AT2 cells do co-express
the putative alternate receptors BSG, ANPEP and/or DPP4 along with TMPRSS2 at
appreciable frequency (0.2-0.7%). Taken together, these data question whether ACE2
is the primary receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 initiates lung infection. A non-mutually
exclusive explanation is that ACE2 expression is widely variable in the lung due to genetic
or environmental factors. Consistent with the latter, evidence is mounting that ACE2 can
be induced by interferon and other innate immune signaling (Ziegler et al., 2020).
CNS and Heart: do the clinical symptoms manifest CoV-2 infection?
Some COVID-19 patients show neurological symptoms (De Felice et al., 2020) such as
encephalitis, strokes, seizures, loss of smell, but it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV2 can actively infect the CNS. In one case diagnosed with encephalitis, SARS-CoV-2
RNA was detected in the cerebellar spinal fluid (Moriguchi et al., 2020). Some have
reported ACE2 expression in various brain cells (Chen et al., 2020b). We observed ACE2
and TMPRSS2/4 expression specifically in microglial cells, although the two genes were
rarely co-expressed within the same cells. We also found that the alternate receptor BSG
was abundantly expressed in pericytes and astrocytes, but in those cell types
TMPRSS2/4 was apparently not expressed. However, FURIN and CTSB proteases were
often co-expressed with BSG in these cells, suggesting potential alternate routes of viral

entry in those cell types. Because pericytes are located in the vicinity of the blood-brain
barrier, these cells may act as a gateway to CNS infection.
Whether the heart can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 is another open question. Severe
heart damage and abnormal blood clotting has been reported in a substantial fraction of
COVID-19 patients (Shi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). We and others (Litviňuková et
al., 2020) found that ACE2 is expressed in cardiomyocytes, but the same cell population
does not appear to express TMPRSS2/4, so it remains unclear how the virus could
infiltrate cardiomyocytes. Nonetheless, we observe that FURIN was co-expressed with
ACE2 in a very small fraction (<0.1%) of cardiomyocytes. While it is unclear whether
SARS-CoV-2 can use FURIN to prime infection (Litviňuková et al., 2020), our findings
suggest a possible path to heart infection.
Nasal epithelium: niche or battleground?
Recently, Sungnak et. al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 entry factors are highly expressed in
secretory and ciliated cells of the nasal epithelium (Sungnak et al., 2020). In agreement,
we found that the percentage of ACE2+ or TMPRSS2+ cells was higher among ciliated
cells than among secretory or suprabasal cells. Conversely, we found that the percentage
of ANPEP+ cells was higher among secretory or suprabasal cells than in ciliated cells,
while BSG was broadly expressed throughout the nasal epithelium. We also note that
19% of suprabasal cells expressed TMPRSS2. Yet, the percentage of ACE2+TMPRSS2+
cells remained rather low across the nasal epithelium while IFITM3 and LY6E restriction
factors showed high RNA levels throughout this tissue. This latter finding is consistent
with the observation of Sungnak et al. (2020) that ACE2 expression in goblet cells
correlates with that of immune genes and antiviral factors, though their study did not single
out these specific restriction factors. Collectively these observations point to the nasal
epithelium as an early battleground for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the outcome of which may
be critical for the pathological development of COVID-19.
It is clear that COVID-19 causes more severe complications in patients with advanced
chronological age. To our knowledge, the expression dynamics of SCARFs in relationship
with age has not been explored in depth yet. One study reported that, paradoxically,

TMPRSS2 expression levels tend to mildly decrease with age in human lung tissue (Chow
and Chen, 2020). We found that neither ACE2 nor TMPRSS2/4 on their own were
differentially expressed between young and old nasal epithelia, but we observed that the
percentage of ACE2+TMPRSS2+/4+ double-positive cells was significantly greater in older
donors, both within ciliated and secretory cells. Conversely, the percentage of
ANPEP+TMPRSS2+/4+ cells was significantly higher in younger donors. Considering
ANPEP association with SARS-CoV infection (Kong et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2003), these
trends fit with the observations that the median age for COVID-19 patients in China has
been reported at 51 years old (Aylward, Bruce (WHO); Liang, 2020), whereas the median
age for SARS patients in China was 33 years old (Cao et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2009). It
is tempting to speculate that the opposite susceptibility of old and young people to SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 may relate to the differential usage of ANPEP and ACE2 receptors
by these two closely-related coronaviruses. However, our analysis is limited by a small
sample size and many possible confounders such as gender, smoking status, and other
genetic and environmental factors, which could not be controlled for.
Digestive system: infection hotspot?
Our interrogation of SCARF expression in the major organs of the digestive system (GI
tract, liver, pancreas, gallbladder) provides confirmation of previous findings and yields
novel observations. Consistent with several studies (Hikmet et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020;
Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020), we found that the small intestine is one of the
‘hottest’ tissues for co-expression of TMPRSS2 with ACE2, but also for DPP4 and ANPEP
as reported previously in two other studies (Liang et al., 2020; Venkatakrishnan et al.,
2020). Within the small intestine, we found that the jejunum is where highest expression
of these factors is achieved. This is in slight deviation from Ziegler et al. who suggested
that the ileum had the maximum expression of ACE2 (Ziegler et al., 2020). Regardless of
which section of the small intestine, both studies converge on the finding that expression
of these factors is largely driven by enterocytes and their progenitors, which line the inner
surface of the intestine and are therefore directly exposed to food and pathogens.
Goblet cells represent another cell type commonly found in the digestive system that we
also predict to be permissive for SARS-CoV-2 entry. These are epithelial cells found in

the airway, intestine, and colon that specialize in mucosal secretion. We found that goblet
cells have some of the highest level of co-expression of TMPRSS2 with one or several
receptors including ACE2, ANPEP, DPP4 and CD147/BSG. The same cell type also
displayed high levels of Cathepsin B and L, which may also facilitate SARS-CoV-2
infection of the digestive system. Goblet cells within the nasal epithelium have also been
identified as potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 (Sungnak et al., 2020). Overall, our
analysis of the digestive system is concordant with several other studies pointing at the
lining of the GI tract as common site of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lamers et al., 2020). This
could explain the digestive symptoms (e.g. diarrhea) presented in COVID-19 cases
(Wang et al., 2020a) as well as the detection of viral shedding in feces (Xu et al., 2020a).
If so, fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be plausible, but it remains to be
rigorously investigated.
Concluding remarks
Overall, this study provides a valuable resource for future studies of the basic biology of
SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses as well as clinical investigations of the pathology
and treatment of COVID-19. We also established an open-access, web-based interface,
dubbed SCARFace, allowing any user to explore the expression of any SCARF (and any
other human RefSeq gene) at single-cell resolution within any of the scRNA-seq dataset
analyzed here. Our finding that SCARF expression is generally well conserved across
primate species, along with high level of sequence conservation of the ACE2 interface
with the Spike protein (Damas et al., 2020; Melin et al., 2020), suggests that non-human
primates are adequate models for the study of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of
therapeutic interventions, including vaccines. It would be desirable to obtain single-cell
resolution of SCARF expression in a broader range of tissues and species, including nonprimate models such as hamsters and ferrets. While our survey of SCARF expression
across human embryonic and adult tissues is the broadest of its kind, it remains limited
by the constraints and shortcomings of scRNA-seq. These include the lack or underrepresentation of certain cell types that are rare or undetected due to low sequencing
depth, isolation biases, or statistical cutoffs. Likewise, the expression level of any given
gene may be underestimated due to dropout effects. Hence, we strongly recommend

interpreting our results with caution, especially negative results. Furthermore, RNA
expression levels are imprecisely reflective of protein abundance and our observations
need to be corroborated by approaches quantifying protein expression in situ. Lastly, and
perhaps most critically, SCARF expression within and between individuals is bound to be
heavily modulated by genetic and environmental factors, including infection by SARSCoV-2 and other pathogens. Such variables may drastically shift the expression patterns
we observe in healthy tissues from a limited number of donors. In fact, several SCARFs
surveyed here such as IFITM and LY6E restriction factors (Jia et al., 2012; Mar et al.,
2018), and apparently ACE2 itself (Ziegler et al., 2020), are known to be modulated by
infection and the innate immune response. Our data still provide a valuable baseline to
evaluate how SCARF expression may be altered during the course of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Because we survey host factors associated with a range of zoonotic
coronaviruses, this study may also prove a useful resource in the context of other eventual
outbreaks.

A cartoon illustration of the infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and its cellular interaction with
entry factors (cell surface receptors, proteases, restriction factors) and post-entry factors
(replication and assembly/trafficking factors) considered in this study. See text and Table

B. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plot illustrating cell
clusters identified at the maternal-fetal interface. Clusters consist of three
trophoblast lineages (CTB: cytotrophoblasts, STB: syncytiotrophoblasts and
EVTB: extravillous Trophoblasts), two decidual lineages (stroma and perivascular
cells), immune cells (T cells, B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer
cells), and macrophages (Hofbauer cells and M1 macrophages). See Figure S2
for a visualization of markers’ expression for each cell type.
C. RNA transcript intensity and density of SCARFs (receptors and proteases) across
the major cell types of the maternal-fetal interface. Dot colors correspond to the
average Log2 expression level scaled to the number of unique molecular
identification (UMI) values captured in single cells. The dot color scales from blue
to red, corresponding to lower and higher expression, respectively. The size of the
dot is directly proportional to the percent of cells expressing the gene in a given
cell type. Since the percent of cells expressing the individual SCARF is much
higher for DPP4 and BSG than for the other factors (“others”, i.e. ACE2, ANPEP,
CD209, CLEC4G/M, and TMPRSS2), we use two different dot size scales for these
two gene sets.

METHODS
Pre-implantation embryos
Single-cell (sc) RNA-seq datasets from the pre-implantation stages of development were
downloaded in a raw format from ((Yan et al., 2013), GSE36552). RNAseq reads with
MAP quality score < 30 were removed. Resulting reads were mapped to the human
genome (hg19) using STAR (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) with defined settings,
i.e.

--alignIntronMin

20

--alignIntronMax

1000000

--chimSegmentMin

15

--

chimJunctionOverhangMin 15 --outFilterMultimapNmax 20, and only uniquely mapped
reads were considered for the calculation of expression. RPKM was calculated
using

bamutils

(http://ngsutils.org/modules/bamutils/count/)

for

individual

genes

annotated in the human RefSeq database. Note: Here, we used the expression matrix
generated for a previously published work (Izsvák et al., 2016), using the above
mentioned pipeline.
Maternal-fetal interface
We obtained the processed expression matrix (counts) from ((Vento-Tormo et al., 2018),
E-MTAB-6701) for ~ 70,000 single cells representing the maternal-fetal interface. We
then used Seurat (v3.1.1) (https://github.com/satija.lab/seurat) within the R environment
(v3.6.0) for the processing the dataset. We kept the cells with minimum and maximum of
1,000 and 5,000 genes expressed (≥1 count), respectively. Moreover, cells with more
than 5% of counts on mitochondrial genes were filtered out. After filtering, there were
64,782 cells. The data normalization was achieved by scaling it with the factor 10,000
followed by natural-log transformation. Clustering was performed using the “FindClusters”
function with default parameters, except the resolution was set to 0.1. We used the first
20 Principle Component (PC) dimensions in the construction of the shared-nearest
neighbor (SNN) graph to generate 2-dimensional embeddings for data visualization using
UMAP. Cell type assignment was performed based on the annotations provided by the
original publication, albeit we grouped the clusters into broader lineages. T-cell, B-cell,
Dendritic, NK-cells, and Monocytes were categorized into “blood,” all decidual cells,
except perivascular cells, were annotated as “stroma.” Fetal lineages were grouped into

the known groups as ExtravillousTrophoblast (“EVTB”), CytoTrophoblast (“CTB”), and
Syncytiotrophoblast (“STB”) cells. All the given annotations were further confirmed by
their respective markers (Figure S2).
Adult tissues
We mined the scRNA-seq of 2 tissue samples from adult Testis ((Sohni et al., 2019),
GSE124263), 31 tissue samples from 5 ovaries ((Wagner et al., 2020), GSE118127), 29
samples of 14 adult tissues from Human Cell Landscape (HCL) ((Han et al., 2020),
GSE134355) in the form of raw counts. To avoid the cross-platform batch biasedness,
we independently processed the samples taken from different studies. Datasets
corresponding to the same tissue were merged into one before the downstream
processing.

We

Seurat

(v3.1.1)

(https://github.com/satija.lab/seurat) within the R environment (v3.6.0) as described in the
previous section. We used a similar pipeline for the downstream analysis, too, except that
for merged HCL samples. We fed the first 50 PCs as input to cluster and visualize the
single cells using SNN graphs and UMAP methods. The top marker genes distinguishing
the cell types were calculated using the “FindAllMarkers” function implemented in Seurat,
(adjusted p-value < 0.01 and log(fold-change) > 0.25) using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.
We annotated the cell types using the markers obtained in this study and crossreferenced with the original article.
Nasal epithelium
In order to compare young and old nasal tissue cells, we defined samples with age ≤ 30
as young and with age ≥ 50 as old. We found no study that has healthy old and young
nasal samples within the same experiment. Therefore, six samples have been taken from
three studies ((Deprez et al., 2019; Garcıá et al., 2019; Vieira Braga et al., 2019), Table
S3). Note that cell annotations were used as provided by the original publications except
for the sample D318 (raw count matrix was available). Unless mentioned specifically,
broad annotation terms as ciliated and secretory has been used for the sake of
consistency.

Processing of samples “4”, “6”, “D353”, “D363” and “D367”: Normalized counts and celltype annotations provided by the original publications were used. “CellType” annotations
with ≥ 100 cells were considered, giving “Ciliated_2” (n=1,513), “Goblet_2” (n=1,463) and
“Goblet_1” (n=4,017) for old samples “4” and “6”, and “LT/NK” (n=185), “Multiciliated_N”
(n=855), “Secretory_N” (n=7,138) and “Suprabasal_N” (n=1,640) for young samples
“D353”, “D363” and “D367”.
Processing of sample D318 raw matrix: Firstly, cellranger (v3.1.0) reanalyze was used to
generate filtered matrix of top 5,000 cells (https://github.com/10XGenomics/cellranger).
Next, we used Scrublet (v0.2.1) (Wolock et al., 2019) for identifying doublets with
expected doublet rate of 0.03. 58 cells were discarded with scores higher than 0.2. SoupX
(v1.2.2) (Young and Behjati, 2018) was used to subtract the ambient RNA profiles from
the real expression values. Finally, we used Seurat (v3.1.1) within the R environment
(v3.6.0) for filtering, normalization and cell-type identification for sample D318. The
following data processing was done: (1) Filtering. We kept the cells with minimum and
maximum of 1,000 and 5,000 genes expressed (≥1 count), respectively. Moreover, cells
with more than 10% of counts on mitochondrial genes were filtered out. After filtering,
there were 2,987 cells. (2) Data normalization. Gene UMI counts for each cell were
divided by the total number of counts in that cell and multiplied by 10,000. These values
were then natural-log transformed. (3) Cell-type identification. Integration of sample D318
scRNA-seq data with remaining samples was performed using top 2000 variable features.
Clustering was performed using “FindClusters” function with default parameters except
resolution was set to 0.1 and first 30 PCA dimensions were used in the construction of
the shared-nearest neighbor (SNN) graph and to generate 2-dimensional embeddings for
data visualization using UMAP. Cell types were assigned based on the annotations
provided by the original publication of samples “D353”, “D363” and “D367”, giving “LT/NK”
(n=110), “Multiciliated_N” (n=62), “Secretory_N” (n=1,354) and “Suprabasal_N”
(n=1,461).
Percentage analysis: For each sample, the number of positive cells for a gene was
calculated when they had a count higher than 0. The numbers were added separately for
young and old samples. Percentage was calculated for each cell type. P-value was

calculated between the percentage of positive cells in young samples and old samples
using one-sided fisher's exact test.
Differential expression analysis: We used the “FindAllMarkers” function with default
parameters except for a minimum percentage set to 5%. Default cutoffs were used to
identify significant DE genes with log FC of |0.25| and adjusted p-value of less than 0.01.
Genes below these cutoffs are shown in volcano plots for visualization purpose only.
