Abstract

17

In recognizing the host cellular receptor and mediating fusion of virus and cell

18

membranes, the spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses is the most critical viral

19

protein for cross-species transmission and infection. Here we determined the cryo-EM

20

structures of the spikes from bat (RaTG13) and pangolin (PCoV_GX) coronaviruses,

21

which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2. All three receptor-binding domains (RBDs)

22

of these two spike trimers are in the “down” conformation, indicating they are more

23

prone to adopt this receptor-binding inactive state. However, we found that the

24

PCoV_GX, but not the RaTG13, spike is comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 spike in

25

binding the human ACE2 receptor and supporting pseudovirus cell entry. Through

26

structure and sequence comparisons, we identified critical residues in the RBD that

27

underlie the different activities of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX/SARS-CoV-2 spikes

28

and propose that N-linked glycans serve as conformational control elements of the

29

RBD. These results collectively indicate that strong RBD-ACE2 binding and efficient

30

RBD conformational sampling are required for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to gain

31

highly efficient infection.

Introduction

33

Zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses pose a tremendous threat to human

34

health, as evidenced by the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in

35

2012 and SARS-CoV-2 since the end of 20191-5. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the

36

ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused millions of infections and

37

hundreds

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/)

39

. Current data suggest that similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV6, SARS-CoV-2

40

likely originated in bats and eventually spread to humans following evolution in

41

intermediate hosts. Coronavirus RaTG13, detected in the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus

42

affinis in China's Yunnan province, was identified as the closest relative of

43

SARS-CoV-25. It shares 96.2% sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2 genome,

44

reflecting the likely origin of SARS-CoV-2 in bats5. Pangolin coronaviruses (PCoV)

45

closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have also been identified in smuggled Malayan

46

pangolins (Manis javanica) in China's Guangxi (GX) and Guangdong (GD) provinces.

47

Analyses of PCoV_GX and PCoV_GD genome sequences indicated a high level of

48

similarity with SARS-CoV-2 (85.5% to 92.4% sequence identity)7-10. Whether

49

pangolins are intermediate hosts or a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 remains a

50

topic of debate, and it is still unclear how SARS-COV-2 evolved to infect humans.

51

The spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses forms a trimer, which plays a critical

52

role in host cell attachment and entry by recognizing its cellular receptor and

53

mediating membrane fusion. Consequently, the spike protein, particularly its

54

receptor-binding domain (RBD), is the principal player in determining the host range

55

of coronaviruses11. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human ACE2 (hACE2) as an essential

56

cellular receptor for infection5,12. Complex structural determinations have revealed the

57

interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 at an atomic level13-16. Cryo-EM

58

studies revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, similar to that of SARS-CoV, needs

59

to have at least one RBD in an “up” conformation to bind hACE217-23. Therefore, a

60

spike trimer with all three RBDs “down” is in a receptor-binding inactive state, and

61

the conformational change of at least one RBD from “down” to “up” switches the

62

spike trimer to a receptor-binding active state18. The spike and RBD of RaTG13 and

63

SARS-CoV-2 share 97.5% and 89.2% amino acid sequence identity, respectively.

64

Similar to RaTG13, PCoV_GX (GenBank: QIA48614.1) shares 92.3% and 86.7%

65

amino acid sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD. In contrast,

66

PCoV_GD (GenBank: QLR06867.1) and SARS-CoV-2 have greater amino acid

67

sequence identity in the RBD (96.9%) than in the spike protein (89.6%). Consistently,

68

the RBD of PCoV_GD has demonstrated stronger binding to hACE2 than the RBD of

69

RaTG13, and hACE2 also supported more efficient cell entry of PCoV_GD than

70

RaTG13 pseudoviruses24. Data have not been reported regarding the binding of

71

PCoV_GX spike and its RBD to hACE2 or whether hACE2 supports PCoV_GX

72

pseudovirus cell entry.

73

Here we report the cryo-EM structures of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes at 2.48

74

Å and 2.93 Å resolution, respectively. These two spikes have all three RBDs in the

75

“down” conformation. Our structural comparisons of RaTG13, PCoV_GX and

76

SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, coupled with functional data on hACE2 binding and

77

pseudovirus cell entry, provide important insights into the evolution and

78

cross-transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

(GenBank: QHR63300.2) spike proteins were synthesized with codon optimization

into the pCAG vector and the RaTG13 ectodomain (residues 1-1209) into the

from Hi5 insect cells, both proteins existed as heavy glycosylated homotrimers with

91

no cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits by endogenous proteases (Fig. S1). Cryo-EM

92

images were recorded using a FEI Titan Krios microscope operating at 300 KV with a

93

Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector. For the PCoV_GX and RaTG13 spike

94

trimers, ~700,000 and ~450,000 particles, respectively, were subjected to 2D

95

classification, and a total of 263,842 and 99,241 particles were selected and subjected

96

to 3D refinement with C3 symmetry to generate density maps (Fig. S2). The overall

97

density maps were solved to 2.48 Å for the PCoV_GX spike and 2.93 Å for the

98

RaTG13 spike (gold-standard Fourier shell correlation = 0.143) (Fig. S3). The

99

atomic-resolution density maps enabled us to build nearly all residues of the

100

PCoV_GX spike (residues 14-1138) with 84 N-linked glycans (Fig. S4). The refined

101

RaTG13 spike model contains residues 14-1133 with seven breaks (residues 19-23,

102

67-80, 144-156, 176-186, 243-264, 677-685 and 824-830) and 54 N-linked glycans

103

(Fig. S4). Data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed

104

in Table S1.

105
106

Overall structures of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes

107

The overall structures of homotrimeric RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes resemble the

108

previously reported pre-fusion structures of coronavirus spikes (Fig. 1A). Both spikes

109

have a mushroom-like shape (~150 Å in height and ~120 Å in width), consisting of a

110

cap mainly formed by β-strands and a stalk mainly formed by α-helices (Fig. 1A).

111

Like other coronaviruses, the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spike monomers are composed

112

of the S1 and S2 subunits with a protease cleavage site between them (Fig. 1B,1C).

113

The structural components of the spike include the N-terminal domain (NTD), RBD

114

(also called the C-terminal domain, CTD), subdomain 1 (SD1) and subdomain 2 (SD2)

115

in the S1 subunit; and the upstream helix (UH), fusion peptide (FP), connecting

116

region (CR), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), β-hairpin (BH), subdomain 3

117

(SD3) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) in the S2 subunit (Fig. 1D, Fig. S5).

118

RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes have the typical β-coronavirus structural

119

features25. Their NTDs have a core consisting of three β-sheets plus one helix and a

120

ceiling structure above the core (Fig. S6). Three conserved disulfide bonds that are

121

found in other β-coronavirus NTDs are also present in the NTDs of RaTG13

122

(15C-136C, 131C-166C and 291C-301C) and PCoV_GX (15C-134C, 129C-164C and

123

289C-299C) (Fig. S6). The RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBDs adopt an architecture

124

similar to that of other β-coronavirus RBDs, with a β sheet core and an inserted loop

125

called a receptor-binding motif (RBM) (Fig. 2A). Detailed structural descriptions and

126

comparisons of these two RBDs are presented in the next section. The remaining SD1

127

and SD2 domains in the S1 subunit and the S2 subunits of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX

128

are also structurally conserved and similar to those of SARS-CoV-2.

129
130

Structures and hACE2 binding of the RBDs

131

Most β-coronaviruses utilize the RBD to specifically bind the host receptor.

132

Compared to other structural components in the spike, the RBD harbors the most

133

sequence and structure variations across different β-coronaviruses and thus has

134

important implications for viral evolution and cross-species transmission. The

135

RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBD cores are comprised of a twisted five-stranded

136

antiparallel β sheet (β1, β2, β3, β4 and β7) with connecting loops and helices (Fig.

137

2A). The RBM, a long loop with two short β strands (β5 and β6), is inserted between

138

the β4 and β7 strands (Fig. 2A). Besides three disulfide bonds in the core (336C-361C,

139

379C-432C and 391C-525C in RaTG13; 334C-359C, 377C-430C and 389C-523C in

140

PCoV_GX) that stabilize the β sheet, the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBDs also have an

141

additional disulfide bond (480C-488C in RaTG13 and 478C-486C in PCoV_GX) that

142

connects the loop at the distal end of the RBM (Fig. 2A). The overall structures of the

143

RaTG13/PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs are highly similar (Fig. 2B). The rmsd

144

for aligned Cα atoms is 0.91 Å between the RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and

145

0.59 Å between the PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs.

146

We measured the binding affinities of hACE2 with the RBDs of RaTG13,

147

PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The

148

PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs bound to hACE2 with comparable affinities of

149

2.7 nM and 3.9 nM, respectively. However, the RaTG13 RBD bound to hACE2 with

150

a much weaker affinity of 216 nM (Fig. 3A). Sequence comparisons showed that both

151

the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBMs share 75.3% amino acid sequence identity with

152

the RBM of SARS-CoV-2. Of the 16 residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM involved

153

with ACE2 binding, ten are conserved in RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.

154

3B). The other six SARS-CoV-2 residues that are not conserved in both RatG13 and

155

PCoV_GX are Y449, F486, Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505 (Fig. 3B). Except for F486,

156

which is replaced by a leucine in RaTG13 and PCoV_GX, these residues (Y449,

157

Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505) in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM form a patch that has

158

significant hydrophilic interactions with hACE2 (Fig. 3B, Fig. S7). Of these five

159

positions, SARS-CoV-2 Y449 forms two hydrogen bonds with hACE2 D38 and Q42

160

upon binding. This tyrosine is conserved in the PCoV_GX RBD but is replaced by a

161

phenylalanine in the RaTG13 RBD, which would disrupt the hydrogen-bonding

162

interactions (Fig. 3C, Fig. S7). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 Y505 forms two hydrogen

163

bonds with hACE2 E37 and R393. This residue is conserved in PCoV_GX RBD,

164

perhaps having a similar effect in facilitating hACE2 binding, whereas the histidine

165

found at this site in the RaTG13 RBD would alter interactions with hACE2 (Fig. 3C,

166

Fig. S7). We therefore propose that Y449 and Y505 are two of the principal sites that

167

contribute to the weaker binding of the RaTG13 RBD with hACE2 compared to that

168

of the RBDs of PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2.

169
170

Conformations and hACE2 binding of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes

171

As described above, at least one of the RBDs in the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer must

172

adopt an "up" conformation in order to bind hACE2. By cryo-EM, we only captured

173

conformational states of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes with all three RBDs in the

174

“down” position. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer with all three RBDs in the

175

“down” conformation were previously determined (PDB IDs: 6VXX and 6ZGE)19,21.

176

In 6VXX, one of the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs exhibits contacts with 11 residues and the

177

N165/N234-linked glycans from the counter-clockwise monomer and 5 residues from

178

the clockwise monomer (Fig. 4A and 4B, Table S2). In 6ZGE, the three “down”

179

RBDs are more compactly packed, with one RBD having interactions with 35

180

residues and the N165/N234-linked glycans of the two neighboring monomers (Fig.

181

4A and 4B, Table S2). In the RaTG13 spike, one RBD contacts 27 residues and the

182

N165/N234/N370-linked glycans from the counter-clockwise monomer, and 13

183

residues from the clockwise monomer with a distance cutoff of 4.0 Å (Fig. 4A and 4B,

184

Table S2). A nearly identical packing of RBDs was also observed in a recently

185

reported RaTG13 spike structure (PDB ID:6ZGF)21. In the PCoV_GX spike, the

186

number of RBD-contacting residues is 27 from the counter-clockwise monomer and

187

16 from the clockwise monomer. The N163/N232/N368-linked glycans from the

188

counter-clockwise monomer are also involved in contact with the RBD (Fig. 4B,

189

Table S2). Therefore, regarding RBD packing, the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes are

190

more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 spike structure 6ZGE than 6VXX.

191

Unlike in our study, the cryo-EM studies which determined the structures of

192

6ZGE and 6VXX did capture the SARS-CoV-2 spikes adopting a more loose state

193

with one “up” RBD. Our observations of all three RBDs only in the "down" position

194

in the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes suggests they are more prone to adopt the

195

receptor-binding inactive state. Considering that the number of protein-protein

196

interactions around the “down” RBD is nearly the same among the RaTG13,

197

PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 (6ZGE) spikes, glycans may play an important role in

198

how efficiently the RBD can sample different conformations. Of note, we observed

199

contacts between the RBD and three neighboring N-linked glycans, spatially

200

positioned at three vertices of a triangle, in the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes (Fig.

201

4B). Although the SARS-CoV-2 spike also has three asparagine residues (N165,

202

N234 and N370) at these same positons, N370 is not a glycosylation site in the

203

SARS-CoV-2 spike and thus glycans contacting the RBD are not observed at this

204

positon (Fig. 4B).

205

To further our findings, we also measured the binding affinities of hACE2 with

206

the spikes of RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that

207

despite exhibiting only a receptor-binding inactive conformation in the cryo-EM

208

images, the PCoV_GX spike bound hACE2 with an affinity of 130 nM, comparable

209

to the 105 nM affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Fig. 5A). The binding of RaTG13

210

spike to hACE2 was weaker, with an affinity of 600 nM. We tested the entry of

211

RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses into HEK293 cells expressing

212

hACE2. Consistently, the PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses had

213

comparable entry efficiency, whereas the RaTG13 pseudovirus exhibited little to no

214

entry (Fig. 5B).

215

To capture the hACE2-bound state of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes, we

216

mixed spike and ACE2 at a 1:4 molar ratio and performed negative-staining EM. The

217

2D classification did not show particles with bound hACE2 for the RaTG13 spike, but

218

~9% of the PCoV_GX particles were bound to hACE2. After treating the PCoV_GX

219

spike with trypsin for 2 hours, the ratio of hACE2-bound particles increased to 20%

220

(Fig. 5C). These results further support that the conformational switch of the spike is

221

a dynamic equilibrium process and that binding of hACE2 would capture the spike

222

with “up” RBDs and shift the process towards more spikes ready for receptor binding

223

and membrane fusion.

224
225

Discussion

226

Coronavirus spike glycoproteins recognize their host cellular receptor and

227

mediate membrane fusion for entry, thereby functioning as the most critical

228

coronavirus protein in determining viral evolution and cross-species transmission. In

229

this study, cryo-EM structures of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes were determined at

230

atomic resolution. Our comparisons of the structures of the RaTG13, PCoV_GX and

231

SARS-COV-2 spikes, the strength of their hACE2-binding, and their efficiency in

232

facilitating pseudovirus cell entry provide important insights into the evolution and

233

cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

234

Our structural determinations of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes showed that

235

the RBDs of these two coronaviruses are highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-2.

236

However, our SPR experiments showed that only PCoV_GX RBD exhibited a

237

hACE2-binding affinity comparable to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, whereas RaTG13 RBD

238

demonstrated far weaker binding. Sequence alignments showed that variation at six

239

residues (SARS-CoV-2 Y449, F486, Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505) were responsible

240

for the these differences in hACE2-binding among the RaTG13, PCoV_GX and

241

SARS-CoV2 RBDs. The residues Y449, Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505 are especially

242

important, clustering together to form a patch on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that has

243

significant interactions with hACE2. We further pinpointed amino acid changes at

244

two positions (Y449 and Y505) only seen in the RaTG13, and not the PCoV_GX,

245

RBD that may account for the weaker binding we observed between hACE2 and the

246

RaTG13 RBD. Our findings and conclusions are supported by recent reports of

247

adapted and remodeled SARS-CoV-2 strains utilized in mouse model studies. Gu et al.

248

reported an adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain with increased infectivity in mice that has a

249

N501Y mutation in the RBD26. Dinnon et al. remodeled the SARS-COV-2 RBD at

two sites (Q498Y and P499T) to facilitate efficient binding to mouse ACE2,

251

producing a recombinant virus that can effectively utilize mouse ACE2 for entry27.

252

These positions are within the patch we observed and suggest their importance in the

253

binding capabilities of the RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to human

254

ACE2. We further propose that the patch containing Y449, Q493, Q498, N501 and

255

Y505 plays a critical role in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, promoting

256

especially tight binding to hACE2 and impacting the varying affinities observed

257

between the RBD and ACE2 orthologs in wild and domestic animals24,28 .

258

The spikes of diverse coronaviruses infecting humans, mice, swine and other

259

hosts have been structurally determined25. Current data show that the spikes of only

260

the highly pathogenic human coronavirus SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

261

have a unique structural feature, with the three RBDs in the trimer adopting “down”

262

or “up” conformations17,19-21,29. Structure determination of the spike-receptor complex

263

has provided further confirmation that the “up” conformation is required for receptor

264

binding, indicating that the sampling of “down” and “up” conformations by at least

265

one RBD is a prerequisite for receptor binding18,22,23 in addition to specific

266

interactions between the RBD and cellular receptor. In our cryo-EM study, the

267

RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes exhibited only a receptor-binding inactive state, with

268

all three RBDs adopting the “down” conformation. Another group had the same

269

conclusion in a recent structural determination of the RaTG13 spike21. However, in

270

studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the protein seemed to have two conformations,

271

even in the receptor-binding inactive state, with one having more compact packing of

272

the three “down” RBDs than the other19,21. We found that the spikes of RaTG13 and

273

PCoV_GX are more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 spike with tight RBD packing. The

274

molecular basis of the more efficient conformational sampling of the SARS-CoV-2

275

RBD is still not well understood. We observed three N-linked glycans (SARS-CoV-2

276

positions: N165, N234 and N370) contact the RBD in the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX

277

spikes, whereas N370 is not a glycosylation site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The

278

absence of glycans linked to N370 may contribute to the more flexible RBDs of the

279

SARS-CoV-2 spike. This is also supported by a recent study showing that mutation of

280

SARS-CoV-2 N165 resulted in an increase of “up” RBDs, suggesting that glycans

281

serve as a conformational control element of the RBD30. We also cannot exclude other

282

factors, such as the furin site that enables cleavage of the spike protein into the S1 and

283

S2 subunits during biogenesis, may also contribute to the RBD flexibility.

284

The RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes and their RBDs all bound hACE2 in our SPR

285

experiments, although both the RBD and spike of PCoV_GX exhibited higher binding

286

affinities than those of RaTG13. These results suggest that RaTG13 and PCoV_GX

287

spikes can also spontaneously sample “up” RBD, which is essential for hACE2

288

binding. The reason for not observing these conformations in our cryo-EM study may

289

be due to the ratio of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spike particles adopting this state being

290

too low. Interestingly, the PCoV_GX spike bound to hACE2 with an affinity

291

comparable to that of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and also had similar efficiency in cell

292

entry. In contrast, the RaTG13 spike was much weaker in binding hACE2 and

293

mediating cell entry. We also confirmed the binding of PCoV_GX spike to hACE2 by

294

negative-staining EM.

295

Based on all these results, we propose that the tight RBD-hACE2 binding we

among RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-COV-2. This and the RBD “down” to “up”

separately mixed with hACE2 on ice for a few minutes at a molar ratio of 1:4, and

361

then deposited onto glow-discharged grids with a continuous carbon layer (Beijing

363

after 1 minute of incubation on the grid, then washed twice, incubated with 5 μl of 2%

364

uranyl acetate (UA) solution for another minute, and finally blotted with filter paper.

365

These grids were examined under an FEI Tecnai Spirit electron microscope equipped

366

with an FEI Eagle 4k CCD camera. Images were manually collected at 52,000

367

magnification with a defocus range between 1.5-1.8 um, corresponding to a pixel size

executed by TsingTitan.py program. Sequential data processing was carried out on

390

RELION. Initially, ~700,000 particles for PCoV_GX and ~450,000 particles for

391

RaTG13 were subjected to 2D classification. After two or three additional 2D

392

classification, the best selected 474,499 particles for PCoV_GX and 107,274 particles

393

for RaTG13 were applied for initial model and 3D classification.

394

For PCoV_GX, the best class (397,362 particles) from 3D classification yielded a

395

resolution of 3.14 Å (with C3 symmetry). To improve map density, especially NTD

396

and glycosides, particles were expanded with C3 symmetry, and then subjected to

397

local search classification. The particles of best class from local search classification

398

were further applied to CTF refinement with C3 symmetry and Bayesian polishing,

399

which improved the resolution to 2.71 Å and 2.48 Å, respectively. Meanwhile, the

400

selected particles were subjected to focused classification with an adapted mask on

401

NTD, and then further applied to 3D-refinement, CTF refinement and Bayesian

402

polishing to reach a resolution of 3.64 Å. Additional 3D classification and Bayesian

403

polishing resulted in the NTD map at a resolution of 3.68 Å with better quality. Three

404

copies of NTD maps were fitted onto the whole structure map using Chimera, then

405

combined together using PHENIX combine_focused_maps.

406

For RaTG13, the best class (99,241 particles) from 3D classification were

407

subjected to 3D auto-refine with C3 symmetry to generate a density map with a

408

resolution of 2.93 Å.

409

The reported resolutions were estimated with a gold-standard Fourier shell

using ResMap36. Data processing statistics are summarized in Table S1.
