SUMMARY

2

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a currently uncontrolled

3

pandemic and the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is important to study

4

the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it

5

back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize

6

animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving

7

ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic

8

and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus

9

RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle,

10

horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human

11

transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We

12

show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-

13

fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-

14

Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its

15

residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses.

16

Our data suggest that RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc could be used to treat and prevent infection of SARS-

17

CoV-2 and any new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

19

Two subgroups of coronaviruses, including alphacoronaviruses (e.g. swine acute diarrhea syndrome

20

coronavirus, SADS-CoV) and betacoronaviruses (e.g. SARS coronavirus 1, SARS-CoV-1), infect

21

mammals and have broad host ranges spanning bats, rodents, domestic animals, and humans1-7. Bats

22

are considered to be the natural reservoir hosts for a number of pathogenic human coronaviruses,

23

including SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HCoV-NL63,

24

and HCoV-229E 6,8. Domestic animals have been shown to play key roles as intermediate hosts, such

25

as camels for MERS-CoV and camelids for HCoV-229E, to transmit coronaviruses from bats to

26

humans 6. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent

27

of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)8-10, shares 79.5% genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-

28

1 and 96.2% genome sequence identity to a bat coronavirus, Bat-CoV RaTG13, indicating that bats

29

are also likely the reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2 ref.8-10. However, it is unknown whether domestic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.032342; this version posted April 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

30

animals also served as intermediate hosts that facilitated SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its natural

31

reservoir hosts to humans.

32

As of April 7th 2020, the uncontrolled COVID-19 pandemic has already caused over 1,210,000

33

confirmed infections and over 67,000 documented deaths across 211 countries, according to World

34

Health Organization’s online updates. There are currently no vaccines or targeted therapeutics

35

available for this disease11. It is therefore urgent to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because

36

some domestic animals may harbor and spread the virus. More importantly, studies on the host range

37

of SARS-CoV-2 may also help identify new model animals to facilitate basic and translational studies

38

on COVID-19.

39

Receptor binding is a critical determinant for the host range of coronaviruses6,12. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes

40

ACE2, the SARS-CoV-1 receptor13, as an essential cellular receptor to infect cells8,14,15. Therefore, in

41

this study, we characterized seventeen ACE2 orthologs for their function to support entry of SARS-

42

CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, a bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV RaTG13)ref.8, and a coronavirus

43

recently isolated from Malayan pangolins (called Pangolin-CoV hereafter)16. Furthermore, to explore

44

broadly anti-coronavirus approaches to treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated

45

recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) variants of the viral spike proteins, and soluble ACE2

46

variants for their potency as entry inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.

47

RESULTS

48

A wide range of ACE2 orthologs support binding to RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin-

49

CoV, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and SARS-CoV-1

50

The RBD of SARS-CoV-2, like that of SARS-CoV-1, mainly relies on residues in its receptor binding

51

motif (RBM) to bind ACE2 (Figs. 1a and b)17-19. Through analyzing ACE2 residues that are within 5

52

Å from SARS-CoV-2 RBD atoms, we found that these residues are highly conserved across the

53

seventeen analyzed ACE2 orthologs, including human ACE2 and ACE2 orthologs of sixteen domestic

54

and wild animals (Figs. 1a and c, Extended Data Fig. 1, and Extended Data Table. 1). We then

55

made expression plasmids for the seventeen ACE2 orthologs and expressed mouse IgG2 Fc fusion

56

proteins of the RBDs of four coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 WHU01, Bat-CoV RaTG13,

57

Pangolin-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 BJ01 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). These RBD proteins were then

58

used to perform surface staining of 293T cells transfected with each of the seventeen ACE2 orthologs

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.032342; this version posted April 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

59

or a vector plasmid control (Figs. 2a and b). The flow cytometry data clearly show that, although

60

each of the four tested RBDs has a distinctive binding profile, they all can bind to a wide range of

61

ACE2 orthologs. Note that human ACE2 and ACE2 orthologs of all the domestic animals, except for

62

that of donkeys, guinea pigs, and chickens, support efficient binding to all the four tested RBDs. The

63

lack of any RBD binding to donkey ACE2 is likely due to a protein sequence defect, because

64

expression of the donkey ACE2 is detectable in 293T cells but a 22-residue fragment likely important

65

for ACE2 folding is missing in the Genbank sequence (Fig. 2c, and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2b).

66

These data suggest that ACE2 orthologs of domestic animals might be generally functional for

67

supporting cell entry of the four tested viruses.

68

A wide range of ACE2 orthologs, in particular that of rabbits, support entry of the four

69

coronaviruses

70

To evaluate spike protein-mediated entry of these coronaviruses, we first tested multiple conditions

71

for establishing a robust SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus reporter assay (Figs. 3a and b, and Extended Data

72

Fig. 3a). We found that, although the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 slightly enhanced

73

the pseudovirus-produced reporter signals under certain conditions, the most robust signals were

74

produced by the reporter retroviruses pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant that had the

75

‘PRRAR’ furin site mutated to a single arginine residue. Then reporter retroviruses pseudotyped with

76

spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, its furin site deletion mutant (ΔFurin), Bat-CoV RaTG13, and SARS-

77

CoV-1, were respectively used to infect 293T cells expressing each of the seventeen ACE2 orthologs.

78

A VSV-G-pseudotyped reporter retrovirus whose entry is independent of ACE2 was used as a control

79

virus. Consistent with the binding data, the infection data clearly show that SARS-CoV-2, SARS-

80

CoV-1, and Bat-CoV RaTG13 have distinctive infection profiles and ACE2 orthologs of most

81

domestic animals can support entry of all three viruses (Fig. 3c, and Extended Data Fig. 3b). These

82

data suggest that domestic animals, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and

83

rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human transmission. Moreover, the finding

84

that rabbit ACE2 efficiently supports entry of all the three tested viruses suggests that rabbits may

85

serve as a useful model animal of COVID-19, as well as that of SARS and diseases caused by other

86

SARS-related coronaviruses.

Recombinant RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc proteins potently block entry of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-

89

Recombinant RBD and soluble ACE2 proteins have been shown to potently block SARS-CoV-1

90

entry20,21. To investigate whether similar approaches could also be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we first

91

produced IgG Fc fusion proteins of RBD (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-Fc) variants (Fig. 4a).

92

Specifically, the RBD variants include wildtype RBDs of SARS-CoV-1, Pangolin-CoV, and SARS-

93

CoV-2, and four RBD mutants of SARS-CoV-2 (Extended Data Figs. 2a and 4a). The ACE2-Fc

94

variants include human ACE2 truncated at its residue 615 (615-wt) and 740 (740-wt), respectively,

95

and mutants of the 615- and 740-version ACE2-Fc proteins (Extended Data Fig. 4b). We then

96

evaluated these proteins for their potency of blocking SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Among

97

all the RBD-Fc variants, the Y505W mutant of SARS-CoV-2 RBD showed modestly improved

98

potency over the wildtype, and wildtype RBD of Pangolin-CoV showed the best neutralization activity

99

among all the tested RBDs (Fig. 4b). Among the tested ACE2-Fc variants, interestingly, all the 740-

100

version variants showed significantly better potency than the 615-version variants (two-tailed two-

101

sample t-test, p<0.001; Fig. 4c). In addition, D30E mutants of both 615- and 740-version proteins

102

showed improved potency over the corresponding wildtypes (Fig. 4c). We further tested three of the

103

RBD-Fc variants and four of the ACE2-Fc variants for their neutralization activities against SARS-

104

CoV-1 and observed similar results, except that D30E mutation did not show any improvement on the

105

neutralization potency against this virus (Figs. 4d and e). Consistently, cell-surface ACE2 carrying

106

this D30E mutation binds SARS-CoV-2 RBD better than the wildtype ACE2 does, and this enhanced

107

binding was not observed with SARS-CoV-1 RBD (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Thus, the mechanism

108

of the D30E-mediated improvement is likely that the mutation enhances the salt-bridge interaction

109

between the residue 30 of the ACE2 and residue 417 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 4f), because this

110

interaction is only present in the ACE2 complex with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 but not that of SARS-

111

CoV-1 ref.17-19.

112

DISCUSSION

113

In this study, we found that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic animals and pangolins

114

efficiently support binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, a pangolin

115

coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV), and bat coronavirus RaTG13. In addition, the pangolin coronavirus

116

tested here showed the broadest host range. Our data therefore suggest that livestock and companion

117

pets, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits are potential intermediate

118

hosts for these viruses. Therefore, to prevent new outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is

119

necessary to consider epidemic surveillance of livestock animals in marketplaces and companion pets

120

Animal models are essential for pre-clinical evaluation of efficacy and potential toxicity of candidate

123

transmission, pathogenesis, and immunology of this disease. Human ACE2 transgenic mice have been

124

shown to support SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lung, lose weight early after infection and then

125

develop anti-spike IgG immune responses22. However, the expression patterns of a constitutively

126

expressed ACE2 transgene may not fully follow the patterns of endogenous ACE2 gene. There are also

127

major differences between mice and humans in immune responses against pathogens, with immune

128

resistance dominant in humans but tolerance mechanisms dominant in mice23.

129

necessary to find better model animals, which can use endogenous ACE2 to support SARS-CoV-2

130

infection and whose immune systems better mimic human’s. Our finding that rabbit ACE2 efficiently

131

supports binding and entry of the tested diverse coronaviruses suggests that rabbits may serve as a new

132

model animal of COVID-19, as well as that of SARS and diseases caused by other SARS-related

133

coronaviruses.

134

Although in urgent needs, vaccines and targeted therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infections are not

135

available yet11. More importantly, anti-spike IgG, either passively administered or vaccine-induced,

136

was also found to cause severe acute lung injury during acute SARS-CoV infection，likely through

137

an antibody-dependent enhancement mechanism24,25.

138

vaccination strategies and isolation of fully human anti-spike IgG antibodies from convalescent-phase

139

patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), alternative approaches to prevention and

140

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be explored. Here we found that four diverse SARS-

141

like coronaviruses can efficiently utilize ACE2 for entry, and that both RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc proteins,

142

in particular the 740-version of ACE2-Fc and its D30E mutant, potently blocked entry of both SARS-

143

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. These data provide very encouraging evidence that these proteins might be

144

developed as effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents against infection of SARS-CoV-2 and any

145

new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.

reporter gene and pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 spike mutants and VSV-G were
used. Coronavirus spike mutant-mediated viral entry was measured by the luciferase reporter at
48 hours post infection. c, 293T cells expressing the indicated ACE2 orthologs were infected with
luciferase-reporter retroviruses pseudotyped with the indicated spike proteins. ACE2 orthologmediated viral entry was measured by the luciferase reporter at 48 hours post infection. Original
reporter expression data are provided in Extended Data Figure 3b. Relative infection (%) values
for each ACE2 ortholog-mediated viral entry were independently calculated against the highest
expression values of the same pseudotype panel and presented as a heatmap according to the
indicated color code. Data shown are representative of three experiments independently performed
by three different people with similar results, and data points represent mean ± s.d. of three
biological replicates.

METHODS
Plasmids. DNA fragments encoding C-terminally S-tagged ACE2 orthologs were synthesized in
pUC57 backbone plasmid by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). These fragments were then
cloned into pQCXIP plasmid (Clontech) between SbfI and NotI restriction sites. DNA fragments
encoding spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 WHU01 (GenBank: MN988668.1), SARS-CoV-1 BJ01
(GenBank:

AY278488.2),

Pangolin-CoV

Center:

GWHABKW00000000)1, and Bat-CoV RaTG13 (GenBank: MN996532)2, were synthesized by
the Beijing Genomic Institute (BGI, China) and Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) and then cloned
into pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid or pCAGGS plasmid between EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites.
Plasmids encoding recombinant RBD and soluble ACE2 variants were generated by cloning each
of the gene fragments into a pCAGGS-based mouse IgG2a Fc fusion protein expression plasmid
between NotI and BspEI sites. The retroviral reporter plasmids encoding a Gaussia luciferase or
a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene were constructed by cloning the reporter genes
into pQCXIP plasmid (Clontech), respectively.
Cell culture. 293T cell line was purchased from Stem Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
and confirmed mycoplasma-free by the provider. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) at 37°C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator.
Growth medium were supplemented with 2 mM Glutamax-ITM (Gibco), 100 µM non-essential
amino acids (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), and 10% FBS
(Gibco). 293T-based stable cells expressing human ACE2 were maintained under the same culture
condition as 293T, except that 3 µg/mL of puromycin was added to the growth medium. 293F
cells for recombinant protein production was generously provided by Dr. Yu J. Cao (School of
Chemical Biology and Biotechnology, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School) and
maintained in SMM 293-TII serum-free medium (Sino Biological, China) at 37 oC, 8% CO2, in a
shaker incubator at 125 rpm.
IgG Fc fusion protein production and purification. 293F cells at the density of 6 × 105 cells/mL
were seeded into 100 mL SMM 293-TII serum-free medium (Sino Biological, China) one day
before transfection. Cells were then transfected with 100 µg plasmid in complex with 250 µg PEI
MAX 4000 (Ploysciences, Inc, USA). Cell culture supernatants were collected at 48 to 72 hours
post transfection. Recombinant Fc fusion proteins are purified using Protein A Sepharose CL-4B

9.0. Buffers were then exchanged to PBS and proteins were concentrated by 30 kDa cut-off
Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore).
Flow cytometry for detecting interactions of RBD-Fc proteins with cell surface ACE2
orthologs. 293T cells were seeded at 20% density in 48-well plates at 12-15 hours before
transfection. Cells in each well were then transfected with 0.5 µL of lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies) in complex with 200 ng of plasmid encoding one of the seventeen ACE2 orthologs
or a D30E mutant of the human ACE2. Culture medium was changed at 6 hours after transfection.
Cells were then detached with 5 mM EDTA at 36 hours post transfection. Cells were then stained
with 5 µg/mL RBD-Fc proteins at 37 oC for 10 min, washed three times, and then stained with 2
µg/mL Alexa488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Cat. No. A11001) at room temperature for 20 min. After another three washes, cells were analyzed by Attune
NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher) and signals of 10,000 FSC/SSC gated cells were collected
for each sample.
Western Blot to detect S-tagged ACE2 (ACE2-S-tag) or C9-tagged spike (Spike-C9-tag)
expression in 293T cells. 293T cells were seeded at 20% density in 6-well plates at 12-15 hours
before transfection. Cells in each well were then transfected with 2 µg of plasmid in complex with
5 µL of lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were
lysed and 10 µg of total protein were used for western blot. ACE2-S-tag expression was detected
by using 6.2, a mouse anti-S-tag monoclonoal antibody (Invitrogen, Cat. No. MA1-981), and an
HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fc secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 31437). SpikeC9-tag expression was then detected by using 1D4, a mouse anti-C9-tag monoclonal antibody
(Invitrogen, Cat. No. MA1-722), and the HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fc secondary
antibody (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 31437).
Production of reporter retroviruses pseudotyped with coronavirus spike proteins or VSV-G.
293T cells were seeded at 30% density in 150 mm dish at 12-15 hours before transfection. Cells
were then transfected with 67.5 µg of polyethylenimine (PEI) Max 40,000 (Polysciences) in
complex with 11.25 µg of plasmid encoding a coronavirus spike protein or VSV-G, 11.25 µg of
plasmid encoding murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag and Pol proteins, and 11.25 µg of a pQCXIPbased GFP or luciferase reporter plasmid. Eight hours after transfection, cell culture medium was

Cell culture supernatants were collected at 36-48 hours post transfection, spun down at 3000×g for
10 min, and filtered through 0.45 µm filter units to remove cell debris. Coronavirus spikepseudotyped viruses were then concentrated 10 times at 2000×g using 100 kDa cut-off Amicon
Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore).
Pseudovirus infection of 293T cells expressing ACE2 orthologs. 293T cells were seeded at 20%
density in poly-lysine pre-coated 48-well plates 12-15 hours before transfection. Cells in each
well were then transfected with 0.5 µL of lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) in complex with
200 ng of a vector control plasmid or a plasmid encoding one of the seventeen ACE2 orthologs.
Cell culture medium was refreshed at 6 hours post transfection. Additional 18 hours later, cells in
each well were infected with 50 µL of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype pseudovirus (10×concentrated), 20
µL of SARS-CoV-2 ΔFurin pseudovirus (10×concentrated), 50 µL of Bat-CoV RaTG13
pseudovirus (10×concentrated), 10 µL of SARS-CoV-1 pseudovirus (10×concentrated), or 10 µL
of VSV-G pseudovirus diluted in 200 µL of culture medium containing 2% FBS (Gibco) . Culture
medium was refreshed at 2 hours post pseudovirus infection and the medium was refreshed every
12 hours. For the luciferase reporter virus-infected cells, cell culture supernatants were collected
and subjected to a Gaussia luciferase assay at 48 hours post infection. The GFP reporter virusinfected cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) and subjected to fluorescent
microscopy (IX73 microscope, Olympus) at 48 hours post infection.
Gaussia luciferase luminescence flash assay. To measure Gaussia luciferase expression, 20 µL
of cell culture supernatant of each sample and 100 µL of assay buffer containing 4 µM
coelenterazine native (Biosynth Chemistry & Biology) were added to one well of a 96-well black
opaque assay plate (Corning), and measured with the Tristar5 multifunctional microplate reader
(Berthold Technologies) for 0.1 second/well.
