Abstract
Type I interferons (IFN α/β) play a central role in innate immunity to respiratory viruses, including
coronaviruses. Genetic defects in type I interferon signaling were reported in a significant proportion
of

critically ill CoOVID-19 patients. Extensive studies on interferon-induced intracellular signal

transduction pathways led to the elucidation of the Jak-Stat pathway. Furthermore, advances in gene
expression profiling by microarrays have revealed that type I interferon rapidly induced multiple
transcription factor mRNA levels. In this study, transcription factor profiling in the transcriptome was
used to gain novel insights into the role of inducible transcription factors in response to type I
interferon signaling in immune cells and in lung epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Modeling the interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA data in terms of distinct sub-networks
based on biological functions such as antiviral response, immune modulation, and cell growth
revealed enrichment of specific transcription factors in mouse and human immune cells. The
evolutionarily conserved core type I interferon gene expression consists of the inducible
transcriptional factor mRNA of the antiviral response sub-network and enriched in granulocytes.
Analysis of the type I interferon-inducible transcription factor sub-networks as distinct proteinprotein interaction pathways revealed insights into the role of critical hubs in signaling. Interrogation
of multiple microarray datasets revealed that SARS-CoV-2 induced high levels of IFN-beta and
interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA in human lung epithelial cells. Transcription factor
mRNA of the three major sub-networks regulating antiviral, immune modulation, and cell growth
were differentially regulated in human lung epithelial cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection and in
the tissue samples of COVID-19 patients. A subset of type I interferon-inducible transcription factors
and inflammatory mediators were specifically enriched in the lungs and neutrophils of Covid-19
patients. The emerging complex picture of type I IFN transcriptional regulation consists of a rapid
transcriptional switch mediated by the Jak-Stat cascade and a graded output of the inducible
transcription factor activation that enables temporal regulation of gene expression.

Introduction

Interferons (IFN) are pleiotropic cytokines and exert a wide range of biological activities that include
antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunoregulatory effects (1-3). There are 2 major classes of type I
interferons consisting of IFN-alpha (IFN-α) represented by 14 isoforms and one IFN-beta (IFN-β).
Type I IFN is produced by many cell types, including leukocytes, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts. The
amount of IFN-α vs IFN-β produced varies depending on cell type and also on the virus/stimulus (14). The biological effects of interferons are mainly mediated by the rapid and dramatic changes in
gene expression of several hundred genes (5). The role of the Janus kinase and signal transducers and
activators of transcription (Jak-Stat) pathway and transcriptional regulation by interferon-stimulated
gene complex (ISGF-3) consisting of Stat1, Stat2 and, Irf-9 in Type I IFN signaling has been well
established (1-6). Recent advances in high throughput gene expression profiling in primary immune
cells have shown that IFN α/β induces several transcription factor mRNA that sustains secondary and
tertiary rounds of transcription (7,8). Several studies had shown that the activation of the canonical
Jak-Stat pathway is not sufficient to explain the broad range of biological activities of type I IFN
signaling.

IFN α/β inhibits the interleukin-7-mediated growth and survival of B lymphoid

progenitors by a Stat1-independent pathway (9). This growth inhibitory effect involves cell cycle
arrest followed by apoptosis and mediated by Stat1-independent induction of Daxx, a Fas binding
protein implicated in apoptosis (10). The most prominent phenotype of the Stat1-deficient mice is
their increased susceptibility to microbial and viral infection due to the decreased ability to respond to
the antiviral effects of the interferons (11,12). Nevertheless, Stat1-deficient mice mount an IFNmediated resistance to virus infection. Stat1-null mice are more resistant to challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus (MCMV) or Sindbis virus than mice lacking both the type I and type II IFN

receptors (13). There is evidence for differential regulation of type I interferon signaling and
interferon regulatory factors in neuronal cells and astrocytes of wild-type and Stat1-deficient mice in
the mouse brain (14,15). IFN-α/β regulates dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells that are
resident immune cells of the lung and are critical for innate immunity to respiratory viruses (16,17).
The availability of gene expression datasets of primary immune cells treated with Interferon α/β for a
short period of time facilitated profiling type I interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA in the
transcriptome (7.8). Coronaviruses are RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family, including Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 (18). The current
pandemic of coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 is caused by a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2
that emerged first in Wuhan, China (19,20). The world health organization (WHO) has declared the
current pandemic as a global public health emergency because of the rapid spread around the world
with high mortality and morbidity. The importance of a functional interferon system for protection
against SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated by the report that 10% of nearly a thousand Covid-19
patients who developed fatal pneumonia had autoantibodies to interferons and an additional 3-5% of
critically ill patients had mutations in genes that control interferons (21,22). In addition to the genetic
deficiency, genetic variants in the components of type I Interferon signaling such as type I IFN
receptor (IFNAR2), protein tyrosine kinase (TYK2) and the antiviral target gene Oligoadenylate
synthetase (OAS1) were detected in critically ill COVID19 patients (23).

Transcription factor

profiling is a powerful technique to gain insights into mammalian signal transduction pathways.
(24,25). Transcription factor profiling of genes involved in a biologic function such as innate and
adaptive immunity led to the identification of functional connectivity of signaling hubs, critical
nodes, and modules (25,26). In this study transcription factor profiling in the transcriptome of
immune cells in response to type I Interferon treatment and lung epithelial cells in response to SARSCoV-2 infection was investigated.

Materials and Methods

Gene expression datasets Gene expression profiling in response to Type I interferon treatment in
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mouse immune cells were published
previously (7,8). Gene expression datasets representing human lung cell lines infected with
coronaviruses and tissue samples of healthy and COVID-19 patients were also reported (27,28).
Supplementary data was downloaded from the Journal publisher websites and from Geo datasets that
were archived at Pubmed (NCBI). The identification of the differentially expressed genes in the
transcription profile was analyzed using the GEO2R tool and differential expression analysis using
DESeq2 using default parameters. Gene expression resources from Immgen RNA seq SKYLINE
COVID-19 resources were used (http://rstats.immgen.org/Skyline_COVID-19/skyline.html). Cluster
analysis was performed using gene expression software tools (29). Outliers of expression were not
included in the analysis. The evaluation of the gene ontology (GO) enrichment and signaling pathway
analysis was conducted using DAVID, KEGG, and Metascape software (30-32). Protein interactions
were interrogated and visualized in the STRING, WIKI-PI, and BIOGRID databases (33-35) Proteinprotein

Results and Discussion

Functional Annotation of the Inducible transcription factors of Type I Interferon signaling

Gene expression profiling studies in human peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMC) and mouse
immune cells revealed that a large number of transcription factor mRNA were significantly induced
in the transcriptome by type I interferons (7,8). A master list of 35 human and 32 mouse interferoninduced transcription factors was subjected to the functional annotation in Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and

Genomes (KEGG), and Metascape to investigate underlying biological processes and signaling
pathways (30-32). These transcription factors were broadly organized into three major functional
categories-antiviral response, immune modulation, and cell growth (Table1). Mapping the list of
interferon-induced transcription factors into gene ontogeny (GO) terms in Metascape provided
insights into the common functional categories and signal transduction pathways in the human and
mouse transcriptomes (Figure 1A and 1B).

These GO terms included human papillomavirus

infection, Hepatitis B, HTLV-1, response to the virus, interferon-gamma mediated signaling pathway
in the antiviral response category. Immune modulation or inflammation category GO terms included
regulation of cytokine production, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and AP1 pathway. In
contrast, cell growth terms included transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer, positive regulation of
cell death, and DNA damage response (Figure 1A and 1B). Protein-protein interaction abundance
analysis using molecular complex detection (MCODE) algorithm in Metascape revealed three
modules consisting of cell proliferation/Ionizing radiation, interferon-γ and interferon-α/β signaling
represented by red, blue and green, respectively (Figure 1C). The human type I interferon-induced
transcription factor data was obtained from gene expression profiling of a heterogeneous mixture of
cells from the PBMC while the mouse list was derived from a purified population of B-lymphocytes,
dendritic cells, granulocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and T-lymphocytes. Cluster analysis
in gene expression profiling is often used to discriminate genes that are co-regulated under the given
experimental conditions (29). The grouping of transcription factors into functional sub-categories
facilitated the identification of enrichment in distinct cell types. For example, mouse antiviral
transcription factors were highly expressed in granulocytes among immune cells (Figure 2A).
Granulocytes including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are characterized by the presence of
large cytoplasmic granules and essential for the control of infection. Enhanced expression of
transcription factors involved in inflammation such as Ahr, Bcl3. and Egr2 in NK cells and cell

growth such as Myc, Max, and Jun in B-cells was observed (Figure 2B and Figure 2C). Furthermore,
IFN-α and IFN-β mediated changes in distinct functional sub-categories such as antiviral response,
immune modulation and cell growth of human PBMC can be compared in detail (Figure 3).
3.2

Time-course analysis of Type I Interferon signaling

Most of the gene expression profiling studies in response to type I IFN have some technical
limitations (5). These studies were performed in transformed cells or cells cultured in the presence of
high serum or in a limited number of cell types such as fibroblasts or epithelial cells. In addition, cells
were subjected to prolonged interferon treatment of several hours to capture the maximum range of
gene expression levels. Furthermore, antiviral response genes were overrepresented while
transcription factor and growth-regulated genes were under-represented on many custom-designed
arrays of interferon-regulated gene expression. These studies may have missed earlier dynamic
changes in transcriptional factor mRNA levels and cell growth-related gene expression. Interrogation
of gene expression datasets of early time points after type I Interferon treatment revealed that several
transcription factor mRNA were expressed after 1-4 hour treatment of human PBMC and mouse B
cells. (Figure 4A and 4B). Transcription factors involved in antiviral response including Stat1, Stat2,
Irf1, Irf2, and Irf7 mRNA levels were rapidly induced in both PBMC and B cells (Figure 4). An
intact type I IFN response is necessary to inhibit viral replication in cells, control the tissue restriction
of virus, and increase the production of type I IFN acting as a feedback loop (4,36). A large number
of type I interferon regulated genes like 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), Mx, PKR, and Rnase L
implicated in antiviral defense were induced rapidly after infection. Mutations of Stat1 have been
characterized in human populations. Patients with heterozygous Stat1 mutations show susceptibility
to mycobacteria but not the viral disease. Interferon-induced Stat1 homodimer or gamma-activated
factor (GAF) formation was diminished, while the response to the ISGF-3 complex was normal in
cells derived from these patients (37). The clinical and cellular phenotypes of these patients suggest

that the response to mycobacteria was mediated by Stat1 homo-dimer and the antiviral immunity is
dependent on ISGF-3 formation. Interestingly, transcription factors and growth-related genes such as
Myc, Jun, and Schlafen (Sfn) family members were rapidly induced by type I Interferon in B cells
(Figure 4B). Schlafens regulate immune cell proliferation, differentiation, and restricting virus
replication (38). However, Schlafens has no DNA binding activity or direct role in transcriptional
regulation.
3.3

Protein-protein interaction network and functional connectivity of signaling hubs in type

I Interferon signaling
Transcriptional factors bind to regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers located upstream
of the gene transcription start site and act as platforms for the assembly of co-regulators and with
general transcriptional factors regulate eukaryotic gene expression (39). Co-operative protein-protein
interactions play an important role in the functional diversity of signal transduction pathways and
biological functions of multiple cell types (40). Stat1 plays a major role in the transcriptional
regulation by type I and type II interferons (1-3). Stat1 is regulated by post-translational
modifications such as tyrosine and serine phosphorylation and interacts with a large number of
general and specific transcription factors. Stat1 requires distinct components of the co-activator
complex, including the CREB-binding protein family of transcriptional activators (CBP/p300), and
p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF) for distinct platform assembly and histone acetyltransferase
(HAT) activity to activate interferon-stimulated gene transcription (41). Two contact regions between
Stat1 N-terminal and C-terminal regions and CBP/p300 were identified in interferon signaling (42).
RNA polymerase II and associated general transcription factors such as upstream stimulatory factors
(USF) and TATA box binding protein (TBP) play an important role in transcriptional initiation (43).
In contrast to Stat1, the role of inducible transcription factors in type I interferon signaling is not well
understood. It is possible to construct potential protein interaction networks of inducible transcription

factors of distinct functional categories in type I Interferon signaling using the data from proteininteraction databases (33-35,44). As an example, antiviral transcription factor interactions in the
STRING database was shown as a graph with proteins or nodes as ovals and protein interactions as
edges (Figure 5A). Network analysis in TRUUST database revealed extensive interactions between
Stats, IRF, and Sp family of transcription factors (45, data not shown). A major advantage of this
approach is that it allows tools developed for social network analysis such as centrality measures to
be applied to understand the organization of protein interaction networks and critical nodes. These
graph theory algorithms reveal the importance of any particular node to the entire network. Some of
the well-known centrality methods include degree centrality that measures the node connectivity or
the total number of inbound and outbound links. In contrast, between centrality identifies the nodes
that are bridges on the shortest path between other nodes. Furthermore, closeness centrality measures
the closeness of any node to other nodes in the network (46). Applying all these measures facilitated
the ranking of each node in the antiviral sub-network (Table 2). These calculations have shown that
Stat1, Stat2, and Irf1 were the highest-ranked nodes in the antiviral sub-network. In contrast, Irf5 and
Sp110 were the lowest-ranked nodes in the sub-network. Furthermore, transcription factors involved
in a related biologic function often share common protein interaction partners and target genes as
revealed by pairwise analysis of transcription factor hubs involved in innate and adaptive immunity
(25). Implementing the pairwise analysis of common protein interaction partners of Stat1 and other
hubs in antiviral sub-network in Biogrid database revealed that Rela and Stat3 as additional members
of the extended network (data not shown). Although Stat1 was included as a hub in the antiviral subnetwork, it is possible to include Stat1 in immune modulation or cell growth sub-network (Figure
5B). Such a hub can be designated as an authority among hubs. In social network analysis hubs and
authority designations were developed in the context of hyperlink-induced topic search (47). Type I
Interferon is often released simultaneously with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1.

IL-6 by immune cells in response to respiratory virus infection resulting in the cross-talk between
Stat1 and other transcription factors such Stat3, Rela, and Jun and fine-tuning of pathogen response
(48). The protein interaction module of Stat1, Stat3, Rela, and Jun was shown to be a characteristic
feature of innate and adaptive immunity (25)
3.4

Regulation of Core Type I Interferon signaling in immune cells

Phylogenetic analysis of type I Interferon regulated gene expression across multiple species provided
novel insights into the origin and evolution of innate immunity (49). Many components of innate
immunity and interferon signaling like pathogen sensors, transducers, transcription factors such as
interferon regulatory factors (IRF), and target genes were already present and functional before the
origin of the type I interferon signaling system in fishes (50). Microarray analysis of peripheral blood
monocytic cells (PBMC) treated with type I interferon across multiple vertebrate species revealed a
set of 62 highly conserved interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) designated as core ISG involved in
innate immunity (51). The functional sub-categories of these genes include antiviral defense, antigen
presentation, the immunoproteasome, ubiquitin-modification, cell signaling, and apoptosis. This list
includes RNA-sensing pathogen recognition receptors such as Ifih (Mda5), Dhx58 (Lgp2), Rig-I
(Ddx58), and the adaptor molecule Myd88. The highest level of Core ISG expression was observed
in granulocytes compared with other immune cells and includes genes involved in antiviral (Oas, Mx,
Eif2ak2), cell growth and apoptosis (Tnfsf10, Parp9, Parp14, Casp8), and MHC class I antigen
presentation (Figure 6 and data not shown). The group of inducible transcription factor mRNA in
core type I Interferon signaling was dominated by mediators of antiviral response such as Stat1,
Stat2, Irf1, Irf7, Irf9, Pml, and Sp110. Many of the core antiviral response transcription factors were
enriched in granulocytes and interact with each other to form a tight protein interaction network
(Figure 7A and 7B). Consistent with the results, promoter scanning of core ISG by P-Scan program
revealed a highly significant representation of binding sites for Stat1, Stat2 and IRF family members

(data not shown). These studies revealed that the evolutionarily conserved core ISG primary function
was the antiviral response and other biological functions such as immune modulation and cell growth
were elaborated later in the evolution. Novel inducible core transcription factors detected in this
functional screen include two zinc finger proteins Zcc3hav1, Zcchc2 involved in the regulation of
antiviral response and cell growth, respectively (52,53).
3.5

Role of tyrosine kinase Tyk2 and alternative signaling pathways for inducible

transcription factors in Type I Interferon signaling
Type I interferon signaling involves the binding of IFN α/β to its receptor (IFNAR) and activation of
receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 by auto and trans-phosphorylation
(1,3,54). These kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of the receptor on specific tyrosine
residues (Y337, Y512) that serve as docking sites for the recruitment and subsequent activation of
Stat1 and Stat2 (55). Tyk2-null cells are impaired in the activation of Stat1 and Stat2, and ISREmediated gene expression (56,57). Furthermore, the induction of several transcription factor mRNA
by IFN-α was attenuated in Tyk2-null B-cells suggesting that activation of Tyk2 is required for Statdependent and –independent pathways of signaling (Figure 8A). In addition to Jak kinases, IFNAR
also activates alternative pathways involving multiple kinases in parallel such as extracellular signalregulated kinases (Erk1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), phosphatidylinositol3 kinase (PI-3K), Akt serine kinase, and protein kinase C-delta (3,67,68). Jak1 and Tyk2 interact with
a large number of proteins as documented in protein-interaction databases and common protein
interaction partners of Jak1 and Tyk2 are potential candidates for alternative pathways of type I
interferon signaling (25).
IFN-α/β has been shown to activate multiple Stat members such as Stat3, Stat4, Stat5, and Stat6 in
different cell types as demonstrated by tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding assays. Activation
of these Stat members in the regulating of antiviral response, cell proliferation, and differentiation has

been observed in different cell types (58-63). IFN-α/β activated Stat3 in RAW264.7 macrophages and
in primary B-lymphocytes (data not shown). Catalytically active Tyk2 was required for IFN-β
mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat3 (64). Stat3 regulates a large number of
target genes including Myc, Jun and Schafen2 that are rapidly induced by IFN-α in B cells (Figure 2).
Positive and negative regulation of type I interferon signaling by Stat3 was reported. Two patients
with a homozygous mutation of the Stat1 gene were identified (65). Both individuals suffered from
mycobacterial disease but died of viral disease. IFN-α treatment of B-lymphocyte cell lines derived
from these patients resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, but no activation of ISGF-3 was
observed. Furthermore, IFN-α induced Stat3 target genes such as Suppressor of cytokine signaling -3
(SOCS-3) in these Stat1-deficient cell lines indicating that IFN-α/β stimulated Stat1-independent
signaling in human cells. Stat3 activation may have a negative role in type I interferon signaling by
antagonizing multiple steps in ISGF3 transcriptional activity (66). The physiological significance of
activation of additional members of the Stat family in the induction of transcription factor mRNA by
IFN α/β remains to be elucidated. A schematic model of type I interferon signaling involving
canonical Jak1 and Tyk2 leading to the rapid activation of ISGF3 and additional Stat family members
by tyrosine phosphorylation was shown (Figure 8B). The members of the Stat family of transcription
factors share structure, activation mechanism and have distinct binding affinities for cis-elements in
the gene promoter leading to the regulation of a different set of genes. Different combinations of Stats
may be activated in distinct cell types resulting in a variety of biological effects. The cytoplasmic
domain of IFNAR contains several tyrosine phosphorylation sites that are not involved in Stat
activation (69). The role of these additional IFNAR phosphorylation sites and activation of multiple
kinases in type I interferon signaling and inducible transcription factor mRNA expression remains to
be elucidated (Figure 9B).

Profiling inducible transcription factors of Type I Interferon signaling in lung epithelial

cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the tissues of COVID-19 patients
Respiratory virus infection of lung epithelial cells results in type I interferon production, which then
acts in an autocrine or paracrine manner to stimulate interferon-stimulated gene expression (16,17).
Genomic analysis of critically ill COVID-19 patients revealed deficiency or alterations in type I
interferon signaling (21-23). Imbalanced cytokine and interferon responses in COVID-19 patients
were described (27,70,71). Autoantibodies to type I interferon and bacterial products were also
detected in the tissue samples of COVID-19 patients (22,70). Furthermore, the differential expression
of ISG was correlated with lung damage and survival in COVID -19 patients (72). Respiratory virus
infection leads to the immunopathology of the lung mediated by the direct effect of the virus as well
as imbalanced host immune response (19,73,74). Gene expression data of human lung epithelial cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as healthy and COVID 19 tissue samples were published recently,
making it possible to study type I interferon regulation of inducible transcription factor gene
expression (27,28). Interrogation of microarray datasets revealed that interferon beta (IFN-β) and
STAT1 mRNA levels were significantly increased 24 hours after infection with SARS-CoV-1 or
SARS-CoV-2 in human Calu-3 lung epithelial cells (Figure 9). Consistent with these results, type I
interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA levels involved in biological functions such as
antiviral response, inflammation, and cell growth were significantly enhanced in Calu-3 cells infected
with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 10). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection of human
A549 lung type II cells did not induce IFN-β mRNA (Figure 11A). It has been shown that SARSCoV-2 entry into lung epithelial cells required the expression of virus entry receptor Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (75). Infection of A549 cells expressing ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2
rescued in the inducible expression of IFN-β and STAT1 mRNA within 24 hours (Figure 11A and
Figure 11B). Furthermore, expression of type I interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA

levels involved in biological functions such as antiviral response, immune modulation, and cell
growth were significantly enhanced in A549 cells expressing ACE2 receptor (Figure 12). A high
level of interferon-stimulated gene expression (ISG-high) in patients was correlated with high viral
titers and high levels of cytokines and limited lung damage. In contrast, a low level of interferonstimulated gene expression (ISG-low) in COVID-19 patients was correlated with lower viral loads,
extensive lung damage with the presence of activated CD8+ T cells, and macrophages (72). ISG-high
expressing patients died significantly earlier after hospitalization than ISG-low expressing patients
suggesting that type I interferon signaling intensity may be used as a prognostic feature of survival in
COVID-19 patients (72). Stat1 mRNA levels were increased in COVID 19 lung compared with
healthy lung tissue samples (Figure 13A). Furthermore, inducible transcription factors involved in
antiviral response were up-regulated and the transcription factors involved in inflammation and cell
growth were down-regulated in COVID 19 lung compared with healthy lung samples (Figure 13B).
The peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMC) composed of several distinct cell types and the
distribution of changes in gene expression varied significantly in different cell types, in response to
type I interferon (Figures 2 and 3). Expression of the inducible transcription factors of the antiviral,
cell growth, and inflammation sub-networks were specifically enhanced in neutrophils of COVID-19
patients, compared with healthy subjects (Figure 14A-C). High-level expression of a subset of type I
interferon-stimulated genes in tissue samples of COVID-19 patients was observed including a gene
signature of STAT1, STAT2, TNFSF10, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12. This gene signature was
similar to the up-regulated gene expression profile observed in patients with the autoimmune disease
known as Sjogren’s syndrome, characterized by systemic inflammation (76,77).

This gene

expression signature was highly expressed in both the lungs and PBMC of COVID19 patients (Figure
13C and Figure 14B). Elevated expression of inflammatory markers such as EGR1, TNFSF10,
TNFSF14, S100A8, and S100A9 was reported in COVID-19 patients (26,70,78). Members of the

TNF superfamily such as TNFSF10 (TRAIL) and TNFSF14 (LIGHT) were implicated in apoptosis
and inflammation (79). The S100 family members include S100A8. S100A9 and S100A12 are
intracellular calcium-binding proteins that are released into extracellular space and function as
damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPS) involved in tissue repair (80). These
studies demonstrate that IFN-a/β mediated induction of three distinct transcription factor subnetworks in human and mouse immune cells. Furthermore, differential regulation of these
transcription factor sub-networks was observed in human lung epithelial cell lines in response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in the tissue samples of healthy and COVID-19 patients.

Conclusion

Genetic variants or deficiency in components of type I interferon signaling was reported in a
significant proportion of intensive care COVID-19 patients (21-23). In contrast, enhanced
inflammatory response mediated by interferons and cytokines was also reported ln COVID-19
patients leading to an unbalanced cytokine response (27,70-72). Transcriptional factor profiling
revealed that there are two distinct steps in the transcriptional regulation by type I interferons- a fastacting tyrosine phosphorylation switch leading to the activation of the ISGF-3 complex and a gradual
increase of inducible transcription factors that regulate the secondary and tertiary transcription
programs. These two pathways overlap and co-regulate distinct sets of genes to confer temporal
regulation of the type I interferon response. Distinct sub-networks of transcription factors including
antiviral response, immune modulation, and cell growth mediate the biological effects in type I
interferon signaling. Differential regulation of sub-networks was observed in human lung epithelial
cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection and in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a gene signature of type I
interferon signaling transcription factors and inflammatory mediators was observed in the lungs and
peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients. The topology of the interferon regulated transcription factor
sub-networks and their target gene expression may be critically assessed using software tools

developed for social network analysis. Type I interferons have pleiotropic effects and are promising
therapeutic agents in the treatment of different classes of diseases such as viral infection, autoimmune
disease, and cancer. A detailed understanding of the IFN α/β signaling mechanisms is important for
the effectiveness of the therapies. Transcription factor profiling in type I interferon signaling may
have therapeutic implications for treating COVID-19 patients by targeting selective inflammatory
pathways such as MAP kinase pathway and Early growth response 1 (Egr-1) involved in the
regulation of chemokines and cell growth (26). In addition, transcription factor profiling of target
genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity revealed that critical nodes such as BRCA1 and
GILZ involved in regulating multiple cytokine signaling pathways can be simultaneously targeted
with small molecules such as dexamethasone to attenuate inflammation in lung airway epithelial cells
(25). Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with high interferon-stimulated gene expression (ISGhigh) in
the lungs die significantly earlier than patients with low ISG expression (ISGlow) after hospitalization
(72). In this report, high-levels of expression of a subset of type I interferon-inducible transcription
factors and genes involved in cell apoptosis and inflammation were observed in the lungs and
neutrophils in COVID-19 patients. The use of Jak1 or Tyk2 selective inhibitors to block type I
interferon signaling in the periphery and lungs or locally to lower ISG expression may have
therapeutic applications in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients (81,82).
