Abstract

33

Serological tests for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

34

(SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in blood are expected to identify individuals who have acquired

35

immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and indication of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

36

Many serological tests have been developed to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

37

However, these tests have considerable variations in their specificity and sensitivity, and

38

whether they can predict levels of neutralizing activity is yet to be determined. This study

39

aimed to investigate the kinetics and neutralizing activity of various antigen-specific

40

antibody isotypes against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

41

patients confirmed via polymerase chain reaction test. We developed IgG, IgM and IgA

42

measurement assays for each antigen, including receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S)

43

protein, S1 domain, full length S protein, S trimer and nucleocapsid (N) domain, based on

44

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assays of the S protein for all isotypes showed

45

high specificity, while the assays for all isotypes against N protein showed lower specificity.

46

The sensitivity of all antigen-specific antibody isotypes depended on the timing of the serum

47

collection and all of them, except for IgM against N protein, reached more than 90% at 15-

48

21 days post-symptom onset. The best correlation with virus neutralizing activity was found

49

for IgG against RBD (RBD-IgG), and levels of RBD-IgG in sera from four severe COVID-

50

19 patients increased concordantly with neutralizing activity. Our results provide valuable

51

information regarding the selection of serological test for seroprevalence and vaccine

52

evaluation studies.

Introduction

55

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory

56

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has instigated a widespread concern

57

globally (1). As of 1st November 2020, more than 46 million confirmed cases and 1 million

58

deaths have been recorded worldwide. Currently, the gold standard for the diagnosis of

59

COVID-19 is real time RT-PCR assay, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract

60

specimens. In the meantime, serological tests to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the

61

blood have also been investigated (2, 3). Although the immune response and antibody

62

kinetics against SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood, serological tests are expected to be

63

useful for various purposes (4, 5). For instance, convalescent serum/plasma therapy has been

64

initiated for severe COVID-19 patients in some countries (6, 7). Serological tests that

65

quantify neutralizing antibodies should effectively identify donors with high antibody titers.

66

Serological tests for neutralizing antibodies may also be used to determine the efficacy of

67

vaccines currently being developed (8-10). In addition, serological tests provide insight into

68

an individual's immune status as well important epidemiological information on spread of

69

the infection in a specific region (2).

70

To measure an antibody against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to measure an antigen-

71

specific antibody suitable for its application. A typical coronavirus (CoV) contains four major

72

structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) (11, 12).

73

Previous studies have reported that highly immunogenic antigens of SARS-CoV and Middle

74

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are S and N proteins

75

Therefore, most of the serological assays developed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

(13-16).

76

also target these proteins. The S protein consists of two functional subunits (S1 and S2) which

77

form a homotrimer. S1 contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is required for binding

78

to host cells. Therefore, detection of S1 (RBD)-specific antibody is considered as an index

79

for predicting neutralizing activity that protects host cells from virus infection (17, 18). On

80

the other hand, N protein functions to package the capsid-formed genome into virions and

81

acts as a viral RNA silencing suppressor required for viral replication (12). The N protein of

82

CoV is found to be overexpressed in large quantities during infection and is highly

83

immunogenic. Therefore, antibodies against the N protein are promising indicators for

84

detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially once SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are widely

85

deployed, all of which currently uses whole or partial S protein as the antigen.

86

Till date, based on S and N proteins, many serological diagnostic methods have been

87

developed to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. However, detailed analysis of antibody

88

isotypes against each antigen, including the S trimer, has not been conducted. Therefore, this

89

study aimed to investigate the kinetics and neutralizing activity of various antigen-specific

90

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed

91

COVID-19 patients. To assess the various antigen-specific antibodies, we developed the IgG,

92

IgM and IgA measurement assays for each antigen, including RBD, S1, S full length (S full),

93

S trimer and N based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Using this method,

94

we systematically analysed the antibodies in the serum of COVID-19 patients. We also

95

examined the correlation between each antibody and the neutralizing activity in order to

96

clarify which antibody best predicted neutralizing activity. This study advances the

97

understanding of immune response and antibody kinetics against SARS-CoV-2 and informs

Samples

104

This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical

105

Research of the Center for Research Promotion and Support in Fujita Health University

106

(authorisation number HM19-493 and HM17-341).

107

We utilized a series of residual serum samples from 41 COVID-19 patients who

108

were admitted to Fujita Health University Hospital from February 28 to May 21, 2020. The

109

demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1 and

110

Supplementary Table 1. All patients were confirmed as COVID-19 cases by real time PCR

111

assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens at the time of or prior to admission. The date of

112

onset was determined as the day when the patients started experiencing COVID-19

113

symptoms. Severity classifications were made according to the Guidelines of the Treatment

114

and Management of Patients with COVID-19 published by the Infectious Diseases Society

115

of America. Severe COVID-19 patients were defined as those with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air,

116

or those who require supplemental oxygen. The other patients were defined as non-severe

117

COVID-19.

118

One hundred serum samples obtained from 100 healthy human volunteers (mean

119

age, 47; males, 58 and females, 42), collected before the COVID-19 pandemic (July 2012),

120

were used as negative controls to evaluate the specificity and cut-off values for each assay.

121

All serum samples (aliquoted and stored at −80°C) were thawed and evaluated at the same

122

time for the analyses.

ELISA development and assay

125

SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1, S full, S trimer and N protein expressed in HEK293 cells

126

were selected as the target antigens. 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) were

127

coated per well with 250 ng of individual recombinant proteins, covered and incubated

128

overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed with phosphate buffer saline containing 0.1%

129

Tween20 (PBST), blocked with PBST containing 1% casein protein stored overnight at 4°C.

130

After blocking, plates were vacuum dried.

131

Serum samples were heated at 56°C for 30 min before use in order to inactivate any

132

potential residual virus in the sera. Serum samples were diluted by 1:201 for IgG and IgA

133

assays or 1:2010 for IgM assay in sample buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin.

134

Afterwards, 50 µL of the diluted serum samples were added per well and incubated at room

135

temperature (RT) for 60 min. The plates were washed three times with 300 µL PBST and 50

136

µL of peroxidase-labelled anti-human IgG, IgM or IgA antibody was added per well and

137

incubated at RT for 60 min. After incubation, the plates were washed five times with 300 µL

138

PBST and 100 µL of substrate solution (TMB/H2O2) was added per well and incubated at RT

139

for 10 min. Subsequently, the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 µL of 1M HCl. The

140

absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a 620 nm reference filter in a microplate reader

141

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The antibody titers were expressed as U/mL.

TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 JPN/TY/WK-521 strain were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, then placed

149

on VeroE6/TMRRSS2 cells (JCRB1819, JCRB Cell Bank) and cultured at 37°C with 5%

150

CO2 (19). On day 5, plates were fixed with 20% formalin (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical,

151

Japan) and stained with crystal violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for the evaluation of

152

cytopathic effect (CPE). The index of the highest sera dilution factor with CPE inhibition

153

was defined as microneutralization test titer (MNT).

Statistical analysis

156

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows

157

(GraphPad Software, USA). Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic

158

(ROC) were calculated based on the RT-PCR results. Correlations analysis between antibody

159

titre and neutralization test was performed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient.

160

Statistical difference between non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients was determined

Results

165

Antigen-specific antibody isotype responses in COVID-19 patients

166

We evaluated the ELISA designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific IgG, IgM

167

and IgA against RBD, S1, S full, S trimer and N protein. To quantify the antibody responses

168

to each antigen, we tested 169 serums from 41 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and 100

169

negative control serums from healthy donor collected before SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We

170

categorized sera from SARS-CoV-infected cases according the timing of their collection

171

relative to symptom onset. All antigen-specific antibodies and their isotypes started to

172

increase as early as 0–7 days after the onset of symptoms compared to the negative control

173

samples, which showed no marked response to any of the antigens (Fig. 1). The IgG and IgM

174

levels against all antigens continued to increase over time, while IgA levels peaked by 15–

175

21 days and declined thereafter.

176
177

Diagnostic performance of the developed ELISAs

178

To evaluate the diagnostic performance and determine the cut-off values of the

179

developed ELISAs, ROC analysis was performed using the same samples. The ROC analysis

180

showed that the diagnostic performance differed according to the antigens and their isotypes

181

(Fig. 2). The best results were obtained with S1-IgG (area under curve [AUC], 0.943).

182

Conversely, N-IgM showed the lowest diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.797). The analysis

183

also showed that AUC of all antigen-specific antibodies and their isotypes increased over

184

time after the onset of symptoms (Fig. 2).

185

To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the developed ELISAs, the optimal cut10

186

off values for each antigen-specific antibody isotype were determined by the Youden’s index

187

using the ROC analysis of all samples (Table 2). The specificity of the S protein (RBD, S1,

188

S full and S Trimer) assays for all isotypes showed comparable results, with high specificity

189

ranging from 94.0%–99.0%. On the other hand, the assays against N protein for all isotypes

190

showed lower specificities of 79.0%, 88.0% and 82.0% for N-IgG, N-IgM and N-IgA,

191

respectively. The sensitivity was dependent on the timing of the serum collection. During 0–

192

7 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of antigen-specific IgG, IgM and IgA were

193

considerably different and ranged between 23.7%–57.9%, 13.2%–44.7% and 31.6%–50.0%,

194

respectively. Thereafter, the sensitivity of antigen-specific IgG, IgM and IgA increased to

195

more than 90% at 15–21 days after symptom onset, except for N-IgM (85.7%). The

196

sensitivity of all antigen-specific antibody isotypes increased to maximal levels at 22–47 days

197

after symptom onset and ranged between 93.1%–96.6%, except for N-IgM (79.3%).

198
199

Correlation between antigen-specific antibody isotypes and neutralizing activity

200

Next, we examined the relationship between antigen-specific antibody isotype levels

201

and virus neutralizing activity in sera collected from the COVID-19 patients. We performed

202

neutralization assays in a subset of samples including 34 sera from 19 COVID-19 patients.

203

Fig. 3A shows the correlation between each of the antigen-specific antibody isotypes and the

204

neutralizing activity (MNT). All antigen-specific isotypes, except for N-IgM (Spearman r =

205

0.150, p-value = 0.397) and N-IgA (Spearman r = 0.172, p-value = 0.332), showed significant

206

positive correlation between antibody levels and neutralizing activity (Fig. 3A). The best

207

correlation was found with RBD-IgG (Spearman r = 0.751, p-value < 0.0001). Fig. 3B

208

presents the Spearman correlation coefficient (r) of each antigen-specific antibody isotypes.

209

Overall, IgG showed good correlation with neutralizing activity in all the antigens.

210

Conversely, IgA showed a relatively lower correlation with neutralizing activity and N-IgA

211

in particular showed no significant correlation.

212
213

Relationship between RBD-IgG production and disease severity

214

We categorized the COVID-19 patients into two severity groups (severe and non-

215

severe) based on established clinical classifications. The average levels of RBD-IgG in the

216

serum samples, which was the best indicator of neutralizing activity according to Fig. 3, are

217

shown in Fig. 4. Serum RBD-IgG levels in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly

218

higher than non-severe cases as early as 8–14 days after symptom onset, while severe

219

COVID-19 patients produced high levels of RBD-IgG over time.

220
221

Kinetics of serum RBD-IgG levels and neutralizing activity in severe COVID-19

222

patients

223

We evaluated the relationship between RBD-IgG responses and virus neutralizing

224

activity in serum samples obtained from four severe COVID-19 patients at several time

225

points after symptom onset. They all recovered from COVID-19 and duration of the COVID-

226

19-associated symptoms was 21, 23, 22 and 37 for patients 5, 14, 31 and 34, respectively. As

227

shown in Fig. 5, serum RBD-IgG in all four patients increased over time, in concordance

228

with virus neutralizing activity.

Discussion

231

In this study, we comprehensively analyzed antigen-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2

232

antibody isotypes, including IgG, IgM and IgA in COVID-19 patients and identified

233

differential antibody responses and their relationship with neutralizing activity among the

234

isotypes. The insights into the reactivity of each antibody isotype against various antigens

235

generated here should further improve our understanding of the humoral immune responses

236

against SARS-CoV-2.

237

We investigated the kinetics of RBD, S1, S full, S trimer and N protein specific IgG,

238

IgM and IgA responses in 169 serum samples obtained from 41 COVID-19 patients. Our

239

study showed that antigen-specific antibody isotypes in the sera from several patients

240

increased within 0–7 days after the onset of symptoms (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The average of

241

all antigen-specific IgA levels reached their peaks in 15–21 days after the onset of symptoms,

242

while all antigen-specific IgG and IgM levels significantly increased in 8–14 days after the

243

onset and continued to increase thereafter. These increases in IgG and IgM are consistent

244

with some recent reports (20-24). Although there are few available reports on the responses

245

of IgA in COVID-19 patients, one report showed that RBD-specific IgA reached the peak

246

during 16–20 days after the onset of symptoms, which is consistent with our findings (22).

247

These results indicate that, although there are some differences among the isotypes, all

248

antigen-specific antibody isotypes can be detected in the serum of most patients about 2

249

weeks after the onset of symptoms.

250

However, our further analysis revealed that there are considerable differences

251

among the antibodies in terms of the specificity and sensitivity in predicting disease. When

252

the specificity of each antigen-specific antibody isotypes was investigated using a cut-off

253

value determined by the ROC analysis, specificity of the S protein assay for all isotypes

254

showed high specificities ranging between 94.0%–99.0%, while the N protein assay for all

255

isotypes showed lower specificities of 79.0%, 88.0% and 82.0% for N-IgG, N-IgM and N-

256

IgA, respectively. The lower specificity of N protein may be due to potential cross-reactivity

257

with antibodies to commonly circulating CoVs in the negative control samples. Although we

258

have not addressed the potential cross-reactivity of each antigen with serum from humans

259

infected with other CoVs, several studies have shown that N protein-based serological assays

260

were more often associated with cross-reactivity than S protein-based assays (25). Chia et al.

261

reported that S1 or RBD showed better specificity than N-based serological assay and that

262

there was significant cross-reactivity when N protein was used as the antigen for their assay

263

(26). Furthermore, Algaissi et al. reported that the specificity of N-based IgG and IgM assays

264

showed lower sensitivity than S1-based assays (23). Our findings support the use of S protein

265

as the antigen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies.

266

We also determined which antigen-specific antibody isotype assays best represented

267

the virus neutralizing activity (Fig. 3A and B). Although most of the antibody isotypes

268

showed good correlation with neutralizing activity, RBD-IgG assay showed the best

269

correlation. These results are in line with the findings of other reports, which showed

270

correlation of RBD-IgG levels with neutralizing activity (27, 28). Neutralization assays are

271

difficult to perform as routine tests as they require viral cultures and must be performed in

272

laboratories with higher biosafety levels. Measurement of RBD-IgG levels in the serum can

273

be a reliable and convenient tool for assessing the immunological response of COVID-19

274

patients. We also suggest that measuring RBD-IgG levels in the serum may be a useful tool

275

to identify donors for convalescent serum/plasma therapy and quantify the immunogenicity

276

of vaccines which are currently being developed (10, 29, 30).

277

Since RBD-IgG levels in the serum correlated with virus neutralizing activity, we

278

investigated the relationship between severity of COVID-19 patients and serum RBD-IgG

279

levels. As shown in Fig. 4, RBD-IgG levels in the serum samples collected from severe

280

COVID-19 patients within 8–14 days after symptom onset were significantly higher than

281

those of non-severe patients; however, the severe COVID-19 patients showed much higher

282

levels of RBD-IgG thereafter. Consistent with previous reports, our results indicate that

283

measurement of RBD-IgG levels correlate with disease severity of COVID-19 (22, 31).

284

Furthermore, the serum RBD-IgG levels in severe COVID-19 patients who recovered

285

increased along with neutralizing activity. These results suggest that measurement of RBD-

286

IgG levels in convalescent patients can be used to identify appropriate donors with high

287

neutralizing activity for convalescent serum/plasma therapy (7, 10).

288

There are several limitations in this study. Importantly, there were only four severe

289

COVID-19 patients from whom residual serum samples were available to investigate the

290

association between serum RBD-IgG levels and neutralizing activity. Since these four severe

291

COVID-19 patients all recovered from COVID-19, we could not investigate differences in

292

antibody responses and neutralizing activity between patients who recovered from COVID-

293

19 and those who did not.

294

In summary, our results indicate that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in

295

COVID-19 patients varies among the antigen-specific antibody isotypes. Diagnostic

296

performance of ELISAs for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies also varies among

297

antigen-specific antibody isotypes. Among them, serum RBD-IgG levels best correlate with

298

virus neutralizing activity and disease severity, thus may be the optimal assay to track

299

COVID-19 seroconversion responses and use as the basis for COVID-19 serological tests.

IgG antibody titre against RBD (RBD-IgG) were classified into two severity groups: severe

496

and non-severe. Red is severe (6 patients) and blue is non-severe (35 patients). Statistical

497

analysis was done by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test (** P < 0.01, *** P <0.001).
