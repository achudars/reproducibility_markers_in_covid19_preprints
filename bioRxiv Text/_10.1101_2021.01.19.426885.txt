Abstract
The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to exert a significant

26

burden on health care systems worldwide. With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an

27

effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

28

CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine

29

platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-

30

CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived

31

from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and

32

the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a

33

single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19

34

pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (IN) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced

35

COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals. While IM and IN vaccination both induced

36

neutralizing antibody titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA

37

sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive

38

immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data

39

demonstrates that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers

40

rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-

44

stranded RNA virus first isolated from a patient with severe respiratory illness in Wuhan, China (1).

45

SARS-CoV-2 infection manifests as a clinical syndrome termed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),

46

which can lead to respiratory failure (2). In addition to respiratory distress, other clinical manifestations

47

associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection include cardiac pathology, gastrointestinal disease, coagulopathy,

48

and hyperinflammatory syndrome (3-5). Patients with an increased risk of severe clinical manifestation

49

include the elderly, immunocompromised, and individuals with co-morbidities (obesity, diabetes,

50

hypertension etc.)(6). Virtually every country has been affected with almost one hundred million

51

infections to date and an estimated case fatality rate of ~2% (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

52

The widespread morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 emphasize the urgent

53

need for the development and deployment of countermeasures, including vaccines.

54

The COVID-19 pandemic has made the development of a vaccine a global priority (7-9). An ideal

55

vaccine candidate is safe, effective, fast-acting, rapidly deployable, and requires only a single

56

immunization. Most of the current vaccine candidates encode the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein

57

as the primary antigen. S is essential for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity since it binds the angiotensin-converting

58

enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and promotes viral-cell membrane fusion (10). It is also the main target for

59

virus neutralization (11). The route of vaccination can greatly influence the local immune environment at

60

the vaccination and infection site. Recently, the comparison of intramuscular (IM) and intranasal (IN)

61

vaccination of mice with a chimpanzee adenoviral vector-based vaccine revealed an increase in

62

stimulation of local mucosal immunity and generation of antigen-specific IgA and lung resident T cells

63

after IN vaccination. The local mucosal immunity was improved by the generation of antigen-specific IgA

64

and lung resident T cell generation after IN vaccination (12). Prior to progression to human clinical trials,

65

several COVID-19 vaccine candidates were IM administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs) to evaluate

66

their efficacy (13-16).

67

The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccine platform has previously been utilized in

68

vaccines against multiple viral pathogens, such as Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg, Nipah, and Lassa viruses

69

(17-19). VSV-based vaccines elicit a robust and rapid immune response to the encoded antigen(s) after a

70

single immunization (20). The time to immunity has been demonstrated to be within 7-10 days for a

71

number of pathogens in preclinical and clinical studies, greatly reducing the time needed between

72

vaccination and protection (21-24). Multiple routes of VSV-based vaccination, such as IM and IN, have

3

73

been shown to be efficacious (21, 22, 25). Furthermore, the general population is predominantly

74

seronegative for VSV, circumventing pre-exisiting immunity neutralizing the vaccine virus (20). These

75

unique attributes - robust immune stimulation and time to immunity - make this an attractive vaccine

76

platform for SARS-CoV-2. However, the immunogenicity and efficacy of an IM- or IN-administered

77

COVID-19 VSV-based vaccine has not been tested in the NHP model.

78

In the present study, we developed a VSV-based vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S in

79

combination with the EBOV glycoprotein (GP). We utilized the NHP challenge model and compared the

80

vaccine efficacy with a shorter time to challenge in tandem with comparing the optimal route of

81

immunization. We demonstrate that IM-vaccinated NHPs developed no to mild lesions of COVID-19 with

82

variable immunopathology, whereas IN vaccination resulted immune-enhanced disease with interstitial

83

pneumonia in NHPs. IM vaccination resulted in robust and rapid humoral and cellular immune responses

84

while with IN vaccination did not. Transcriptional analysis of the lungs supports our immunological

85

findings by revealing greater expression of innate and adaptive immune genes in the IM vaccination

86

group.

Results

89

Vaccine construction and characterization

90

The VSV-backbone encoding the EBOV Kikwit GP, rVSV-ZEBOV, was used as a parental vector to

91

construct this COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, we generated a VSV construct co-expressing the EBOV GP

92

and SARS-CoV-2 S (VSV-SARS2-EBOV) by the adding the full-length codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 S

93

upstream of the EBOV GP into the existing VSV vector (Fig. S1A). The construct was recovered from

94

plasmid following previously established protocols (26). Expression of both antigens, SARS-CoV-2 S and

95

EBOV GP, was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the VSV particles in cell supernatant (Fig. S1B).

96

Next, we performed viral growth kinetics. VSV-SARS2-EBOV replicated with similar kinetics and had

97

comparable endpoint titers to the parental VSV-EBOV in Vero E6 cells (Fig. S1C), which does not impact

98

potential vaccine production.

99
100
101

Efficacy in nonhuman primates (NHPs)
We demonstrated previously that the parental VSV-EBOV is a fast-acting, IM-administered

102

vaccine (21); that was confirmed in human phase 3 clinical trials (24). Therefore, we set out to analyze

103

the fast-acting potential of a single dose of this VSV-based COVID-19 vaccine in rhesus macaques. Unlike

104

EBOV disease (EVD), COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. However, a previously published study

105

demonstrated that mucosal immunization with VSV-EBOV protected the NHPs from EVD (25). To

106

determine the efficacy of mucosal vaccination against COVID-19 in NHPs, we compared the efficacy of

107

IM and IN vaccination in the rhesus macaque model (27). Groups of 6 NHPs were either IN- or IM-

108

vaccinated with VSV-SARS2-EBOV while control animals received a single dose of VSV-EBOV IN (n=2) or

109

IM (n=2)(Fig. S1D). All NHPs were observed for potential adverse effects, particularly after IN vaccination

110

as this is not the standard route of administration for this vaccine platform, but no clinical changes were

111

noted. After 10 days, all NHPs were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 as previously described (27). On days

112

post challenge (dpc) 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7, a clinical exam including thoracic radiographs and nasal swab

113

collection was performed; in addition, the dpc 3 exam included a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). On dpc

114

7, all NHPs were euthanized and samples were collected for analysis. None of the vaccinated animals

115

displayed clinical signs of disease after challenge.

116

We determined differences in total SARS-CoV-2 RNA and subgenomic (sg) RNA in the nasal

117

swabs of the animals throughout the study. Interestingly, IN vaccination resulted in significantly lower

118

levels of nasal viral RNA on dpc 1 compared to IM indicating better local control of virus replication (Fig.

119

1A). However, on dpc 3 only the total SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA levels were significantly different (Fig.

120

1A). In contrast, both total and sg RNA levels in the BAL were significantly lower for the IM vaccination

121

group compared to IN-vaccinated and control groups (Fig. 1B). This finding is supported by our

122

observation that the IN-vaccinated NHPs had more lung infiltrates compared to the IM and control

123

groups at the time of euthanasia (Fig. 1C). Additionally, only IN-vaccinated NHPs exhibited lung lesions

124

(Fig. S2). This was accompanied by a significant reduction of total RNA and sgRNA in IM-vaccinated, but

125

not IN-vaccinated NHPs compared to controls (Fig. 1D). The comparison of RNA levels in individual lung

126

lobes and other examined tissue samples did not reveal any significant differences (Fig. S3).

127
128
129

Histopathology in NHPs
Histopathologic analysis of the collected lung samples revealed pulmonary pathology consistent

130

with the previously described rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the control group

131

regardless of IM or IN administration of the control vaccine (Fig. 2A,D)(27). In the IM vaccination group

132

pulmonary lesions consisted of low to moderate numbers of eosinophils multifocally infiltrating

133

bronchiolar mucosa, excess mucus accumulation in the lumen of bronchi and bronchioles, and profound

134

perivascular lymphocytic cuffing (interpreted as immune pathology) disseminated throughout all lung

135

lobes (Fig. 2B,E). In combination, these lesions are suggestive of a localized hypersensitivity response.

136

Hypersensitivity lesion location mirrored that of what has previously been described in this NHP model

137

of COVID-19 (27), with a high proportion of lesions located at the periphery of the lung and increased

138

lesion severity in lower lung lobes. Limited evidence of type I pneumocyte damage was present in rare

139

foci and was characterized by lining of alveoli by type II pneumocytes and a scant amount of

140

proteinaceous fluid within alveolar spaces (Fig. 2B,E). Histopathologic lesions in the IN vaccination group

141

mirrored the enhanced gross lesion severity and histologically consisted of an immune-enhanced

142

disease with evidence of classic moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary pathology and moderate

143

hypersensitivity response (Fig. 2C,F). The hypersensitivity response was similar to that observed in the

144

IM-vaccinated group, but more severe with the addition of eosinophil spillover into bronchiolar lumen

145

and moderate numbers of alveolar spaces. SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein immunoreactivity was observed in

146

type I pneumocytes and macrophages of both the control and IN groups, but not in the IM vaccination

147

group (Fig. 2G-I).

148
149
150

Immune responses in NHPs
We next analyzed the peripheral humoral response. IgG responses to the full-length SARS-CoV-2

151

S, the S receptor binding domain (RBD), and the EBOV GP were determined following vaccination and

152

challenge (Fig. 3). We demonstrated that the IM-vaccinated NHPs attained significantly higher SARS-

153

CoV-2 S-specific IgG starting 10 days after vaccination and following challenge compared to IN-

154

vaccinated NHPs and controls (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the IgG response to the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD was higher

155

at day 10 post vaccination (0 dpc) in the IM group compared to the IN and controls (Fig. 3B). Analysis of

156

the IgG subclasses in serum on dpc 0 and 7 showed that both vaccination routes resulted in

157

predominantly IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies with no significant difference between the groups (Fig.

158

3C). Only IgG1 increased after challenge in both vaccine groups significantly compared to controls (Fig.

159

3C). Interestingly, on dpc 7 both IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies were largely absent in sera from IN-

160

vaccinated NHPs (Fig. 3C). IgG responses specific to EBOV GP support the finding that IM vaccination

161

appears more immunogenic compared to IN even though the data are only significantly different on day

162

0 and day 3 (Fig. S4A). Measurable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers were detected as early as 10 days

163

following vaccination for the IM group, and 11 days for the IN group (Fig. 3D). On day 3, significantly

164

higher titers were observed comparing IM-vaccinated NHPs to controls only (Fig. 3D). At the time of

165

euthanasia, the neutralizing titers in IM- and IN-vaccinated NHPs were comparable but significantly

166

higher than those observed in control animals (Fig. 3D)

167

Next, we investigated the humoral responses in the BAL obtained on dpc 3. We detected SARS-

168

CoV-2 S-specific IgG in 3 of the 6 NHPs in the IM vaccinated group but only in 1 of 6 NHPs in the IN group

169

(Fig. 3E). Only the IM-vaccinated NHP with the highest titer of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgG had anti-SARS-

170

CoV-2 S RBD IgG (Fig. 3E). SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgA was not detected in any of the BAL samples (Fig. 3E).

171

In contrast to serum, no IgG1 was detected; however, IgG2 and IgG3 were readily detected in several

172

IM-vaccinated NHPs (Fig. 3F). Unexpectedly, IM vaccination resulted in higher humoral responses in the

173

lung to all antigens including EBOV GP (Fig. S4B).

174

We analyzed the peripheral cellular response even though T cell responses have shown to play

175

only a limited role mediating protection using the VSV-EBOV vaccine (28, 29). Peripheral blood

176

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with a peptide-pool spanning the entire length of the SARS-

177

CoV-2 S and the antigen-specific T cells were identified using intracellular cytokine staining (Fig.4A,B).

178

While there was minimal cytokine production by CD4+ T cells, a significant increase in the CD69

179

activation marker was seen in IM-vaccinated NHPs on 0 and 7 dpc relative to controls (Fig. 4A). Similarly,

180

a significantly higher portion of the CD8+ T cells from the IM group produced granzyme B on dpc 0 and 7

181

compared to controls and IN groups (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, numbers of IL-2+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were

182

significantly lower in the IM group on dpc 0, and comparable to IN and control groups by dpc 7 (Fig.

183

4A,B). Additionally, a greater number of granzyme B+ NK cells was measured on dpc 0 and 7 in IM-

184

vaccinated animals compared to IN-vaccinated and control animals (Fig. 4C).

185

Finally, we monitored levels of systemic and BAL cytokines and chemokines. We found a

186

significant increase in MCP-1 on dpc 1 and 3 in IN-vaccinated animals compared to IM-vaccinated

187

animals. A similar trend was observed for IL-18 on dpc 3 and 5 (Fig. S5A). Levels of MIP-1b were

188

significantly lower at all dpcs in IM-vaccinated animals compared to the control and IN-vaccinated

189

animals (Fig. S5A). Analysis of cytokine and chemokine levels in the BAL revealed that MCP-1 levels were

190

significantly decreased in IN-vaccinated NHPs (Fig. S5B). All other investigated cytokines did not show

191

significant differences.

192
193
194

Transcriptional analysis of BAL samples
To better understand the molecular underpinnings of differential vaccine responses, we profiled

195

the host transcriptional response in the BAL (dpc 3) samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) of BAL

196

samples indicated a distinct separation of uninfected/naïve (historical data) and the three challenged

197

groups, with no clear distinction between the challenged groups (Fig. S6A). Therefore, the samples from

198

control, IM- or IN-vaccinated animals were compared to the uninfected samples. Over 1,000

7

199

differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in the challenged groups compared to the

200

uninfected animals, with most DEGs being upregulated (Fig. S6B). The majority of DEGs were shared

201

amongst the three challenged groups (Fig. 5A). Functional enrichment showed that upregulated and

202

downregulated DEGs shared by all three challenged groups play a role in regulating cell structure (e.g.,

203

“actin cytoskeleton organization”) and innate immunity (e.g., “positive regulation of cytokine

204

production”, “myeloid leukocyte activation”) (Fig. 5B). However, only upregulated DEGs enriched to

205

gene ontology (GO) terms associated with adaptive immunity (e.g., “lymphocyte activation”, “T cell

206

differentiation”)(Fig. 5B).

207

Further analysis of shared DEGs showed that genes involved in pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g.,

208

RELB, MFHAS1, IL12RB1, TNFSF4, TRAF2, C5AR1, and TOLLIP) were more highly expressed in the control

209

group compared to IM and IN groups (Fig. S6C, D). A second cluster of inflammation-related genes were

210

induced to a greater extent in the IN group (IFT88, IL12B, CLEC9, and IL27RA), which is in line with the

211

greater inflammatory response observed in these animals. On the other hand, DEGs implicated in T and

212

B cell-mediated immunity (e.g., LCP1, PRKCB) were induced to a greater extent in IM-vaccinated NHPs

213

(Fig. 5C). Genes enriching to GO term “myeloid cell activation/neutrophil downregulation” were

214

suppressed to a greater extent in the IM cohort, consistent with the lower inflammation profile

215

observed in this group (Fig. S6E).

216

We next analyzed vaccine-specific transcriptional responses in the BAL samples of the IN and IM

217

groups to elucidate unique molecular responses (Fig. 5D-G). DEGs unique to the IN group enriched to GO

218

terms related to organelle dynamics, such as “organelle localization” as well as antiviral immunity

219

(“human papillomavirus infection”) (Fig. 5D). Genes important for vesicular mobilization (RAB8A and

220

RABD3D) as well as antiviral HERC5 were more highly expressed in IN-vaccinated NHPs whereas those

221

associated with signaling (e.g., AKT2, PDE4D) were more down-regulated (Fig. 5E) compared to IM-

222

vaccinated NHPs. DEGs uniquely upregulated in the IM group have roles in protein synthesis and folding

223

(e.g., TRMT10B, TRNAU1AP, HSPB1), cell proliferation (e.g., KITLF, TM4SF19) and T cell activation (e.g.,

224

CRACR2A, SH2D2A) (Fig. 5G).

225

Due to limited sample availability, we were unable to perform phenotyping of immune cells in

226

the BAL. Therefore, we performed in silico flow cytometry to infer changes in cell frequencies based on

227

the transcriptional landscape (Fig. S6F). This analysis predicted significant increases in the levels of

228

monocytes, NK cells and stimulated CD4 Th2 cells while frequencies of naïve & plasma B cell, CD4+ &

229

CD8+ T cells, stimulated dendritic cells and neutrophils were predicted to decline for all three challenged

230

groups. On the other hand, plasma cells and monocytes were predicted to be induced to a lower

231

magnitude in controls compared to IM and IN groups (Fig. S6F).

232
233

Transcriptional analysis of lung samples

234

As described for BAL samples, we observed a clear distinction between lung samples of

235

uninfected/naïve compared to vaccinated and challenged NHPs with no clear separation between the

236

three challenged groups, therefore, we employed the same strategy as described above for BAL (Fig.

237

S7A). A robust transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was evident in all three vaccinated

238

groups compared to naïve animals (Fig. S7B) with the majority of DEGs shared among the three groups

239

(Fig. 6A). Downregulated DEGs shared by all three vaccinated groups enriched to GO terms primarily

240

involved in innate immunity (e.g., “regulation of innate immune response”, “antigen processing and

241

presentation”), cellular stress (e.g., “coagulation”, “response to decreased oxygen levels”, “wound

242

healing”) and cell cycle (e.g., “regulation of cell cycle process”) (Fig. 6B). Genes playing roles in protein

243

folding and turnover (CALR and CTSF), immune activation (e.g., LYN and ADA) coagulation (e.g., PLAT,

244

SIRT2, FERMT3), fluid homeostasis (e.g., ADM, SERPINA5) and cell morphogenesis (e.g., NOTCH4, TEK)

245

were more suppressed in the IN group (Fig. 6C and S7C). Shared upregulated DEGs enriched to GO terms

246

reflecting innate immune processes (e.g., “regulated exocytosis”, “myeloid leukocyte activation”,

247

“neutrophil degranulation”), as well as cell migration (e.g., “chemotaxis”) and extracellular structural

248

dynamics (e.g., “extracellular structural organization”, “cell projection morphogenesis”) (Fig. 6B).

249

Overall, a large portion of these genes were induced to a greater extent in the IN group, notably those

250

that play a role in neutrophil activation (e.g., GRN, AZU1, CR1), cell metabolism (e.g., ALDOC, PGM1,

251

IMPDH1), chemotaxis (e.g., CCL20, CCL8, CCL13, ICAM3), and extracellular matrix remodeling (e.g.,

252

MMP25, MMP16) (Fig. 6D, S7D). Additionally, genes important for angiogenesis and apoptosis were

253

more upregulated in the IN group (e.g., VEGFD, PRKD1, SHC1, DAB2IP) (Fig. S7E).

254

We next analyzed vaccine route-specific DEGs to identify differences in the molecular responses

255

to vaccination and challenge (Fig. 6E-H). Enrichment of the 161 DEGs unique to the IN group revealed

256

enrichment to GO terms suggesting tissue injury (e.g., “lung development”), metabolism (e.g., “protein

257

modification by small protein removal”), and signaling (e.g., “calcium-mediated signaling”) (Fig. 6F).

258

Notably, downregulated DEGs in this group include components of the mitochondrial cellular respiration

259

complex (e.g., MT-CYB, MT-CO2) and cellular homeostasis (e.g., SKIV2L, PDE6C, SKIV2L, SHROOM4) (Fig.

261

In contrast, the 226 DEGs unique to the IM group enriched to GO terms related to cellular

262

defense (e.g., type I interferon signaling pathway”, “TLR9 signaling”, “autophagy”), morphogenesis (e.g.,

263

“epithelial cell morphogenesis”) and membrane dynamics (e.g., “protein localization to membrane”,)

264

(Fig. 6G). The higher expression of DEGs related to the type I interferon response (e.g., CDC37, USP18,

265

IFI6) and ribosome assembly (e.g., MRRF, OGFOD1, FARSA) in the IM and control groups suggests

266

greater mobilization of host defense processes (Fig. 6H). Additionally, genes associated with cilia

267

formation (e.g., INPP5E, TMEM231, PPFIBP2) and regulation of inflammation (e.g., GLOD5, ITIH5, TIFAB)

268

were highly expressed in the IM group in line with reduced damage (Fig. 6H). In silico flow cytometry

269

analysis indicated that these transcriptional changes were consistent with increases in the levels of

270

neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells, dendritic cells and naïve lymphocytes in all the infected animals while

271

frequencies of activated monocytes were predicted to decrease relative to tissue from naïve animals

272

(Fig. S7F).

Discussion
Many vaccine platforms have been utilized to develop a COVID-19 vaccine quickly (13-16), with

276

several already approved for human use within a year of SARS-CoV-2 emergence. However, many of

277

these vaccines require 2 doses to elicit protection and are delivered IM rather than the site of infection.

278

Therefore, we developed a single dose, fast-acting VSV-based vaccine against COVID-19, which is based

279

on the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug administration (FDA) and the European

280

Medicines Agency (EMA) for human use. Additionally, we compared the protective efficacy of IM and IN

281

delivery in the rhesus macaque model (27).

282

A single dose IM-, but not IN-delivered vaccine protected NHPs from COVID-19 pneumonia

283

within 10 days post vaccination. This short time to immunity is a tremendous advantage and highlights

284

its potential to be used rapidly during a public health crisis, particularly in emergency situations when

285

many people were exposed at once. Interestingly, IM vaccination resulted in superior immune response

286

compared to IN as evidenced by the significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-S-specific antibody titers and lower

287

viral loads in this group. None of the animals in this study showed overt clinical signs of disease

288

regardless of their vaccination status. However, histological examination of the lung tissue revealed

289

immunopathology that was most significant in IN-vaccinated animals. The observed immunopathology

290

was not consistent with a classic hypersensitivity response or immune-enhanced disease as the lesions

291

were limited to the periphery of lung lobes and almost exclusively observed in lower lung lobes as

292

previously reported for SARS-CoV-2 infection (27). Importantly, IM-vaccinated animals did not develop

293

signs of interstitial pneumonia, nor could we detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the lungs. Indeed, at the time

294

of euthanasia, lung lesions were apparent in animals from the IN and controls groups, but not in the IM

295

group. This is surprising given mucosal vaccination for other respiratory pathogens has been

296

demonstrated to be superior or comparable to IM (30, 31). It possible that the immunopathology

297

observed in the vaccinated animals is due to the short duration between vaccination and challenge (10

298

days) and that it might also occur with other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms, as this change was clinically

299

silent in our model.

300

In line with the observations above, the transcriptional analysis of lung samples showed a

301

divergence of antiviral states between the IN, IM and control groups. IN vaccination induced

302

transcriptional changes enriched to cell metabolism, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and neutrophil activation

303

processes. Some notable DEGs include genes associated with neutrophil activation and the formation of

304

azurophil granules (e.g. GRN, CR1, and AZU1). While neutrophils play a role in protecting the host,

305

sustained neutrophil activation has been shown to directly correlate to more severe COVID-19 cases

306

(32). In contrast, IM vaccination induced transcriptional changes playing a role in cilia formation,

307

inflammation regulation, and type I IFN. A majority of these genes are responsible for the regulation and

308

control of early innate inflammation such as USP18 which disrupts the JAK-STAT pathway downstream

309

of the IFN receptor (33), and TIFAB which inhibits the activation of the NFkB pathway (34). Collectively

310

these findings support the significant decrease in virus replication between the IN and IM vaccination

311

groups. Transcriptional analysis of acute BAL samples also demonstrated a divergence of antiviral states

312

evidenced by T cell differentiation genes upregulated after IM vaccination compared to innate antiviral

313

posttranslational modifications after IN vaccination. While variable immunopathology was observed in

314

all VSV-SARS2-EBOV-vaccinated NHPs regardless of the route, transcriptional analysis of the BAL

315

demonstrated an upregulation of antiviral genes such as HERC5 in the IN group only, in line with

316

enhanced viral loads in this group. HERC5 is responsible for the production of HECT-type E3 protein

317

ligase, a facilitator of the ISG conjugation system of interferon stimulated gene 15 (35) possibly

318

contributing to the enhanced immunopathology observed in the IN group.

319

Since the importance of a cellular immune response has been recently highlighted in COVID-19

320

patients (36), we assessed development of both innate as well as the adaptive cellular responses

321

following each vaccination strategy. Our analysis showed a higher frequency of granzyme B+ NK cells

322

after IM vaccination. While there was minimal antigen-specific cytokine production from the CD4+ T

323

cells, a significant increase in the early activation marker, CD69, was observed on 0 and 7 dpc. In

11

324

addition, an increase in the IL-2 production was only observed 7 dpc, indicative of the priming of

325

cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (37). Transcriptional analysis revealed that IM vaccination induced upregulation of

326

CRACR2A and SH2D2a. SH2D2a encodes a T cell-specific adaptor protein, which facilitates the formation

327

and maintenance of the immunological synapse between the antigen presenting cell and the T cell

328

receptor allowing for a more robust antigen-specific stimulation (38). CRACR2A also has a role in the

329

maintenance of the immunological synapse and promotes downstream signaling, which results in an

330

increased Th1 response and Th17 effector functions which is supported by the significant decrease of IL-

331

2 on 0 dpc (39).

332

Serum cytokine analyses demonstrated a significant increase in IL-18 and innate chemokines,

333

MCP-1 and MIP-1b, circulating in animals that presented with severe pathology. The increased

334

expression of IL-18 could indicate a priming of the infiltrating immune cells in the lungs to a more

335

proinflammatory state that would result in the observed tissue destruction. However, we did not

336

observe an increase of IL-18 in BAL samples from 3 dpc. The most striking observation was the

337

significant downregulation of MIP-1b on all dpc measured in IM-vaccinated animals. MIP-1b and MCP-1

338

have previously been demonstrated to be indicators of severe COVID-19 pathogenesis by transcriptomic

339

profiling of human patients (40). A decrease in MIP-1b and MCP-1 could contribute to the lack of

340

immune cell infiltration in the lungs of the IM group. Predicted in silico flow cytometry data from BAL on

341

3 dpc showed a decrease of naïve and plasma B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, stimulated dendritic cells

342

and neutrophils supporting this hypothesis. Furthermore, in silico flow cytometry from the lungs on 7

343

dpc were indicative of a decrease in activated monocytes for all SARS-CoV-2-infected NHPs. Further

344

immune cell characterization from BAL and within the lungs is needed to expand upon our results and

345

confirm this hypothesis.

346

In summary, in this study we generated a potent single-dose, fast-acting vaccine for COVID-19.

347

This vaccine grows to high titers like the parent rVSV-ZEBOV vector and to higher titers compared to a

348

VSV vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S alone (41)(unpublished data). Several important questions

349

remain to be addressed in future studies. An extension of the time between vaccination and challenge

350

might overcome the observed difference in protection between the vaccination routes and might

351

eliminate the signs of immunopathology. This aspect will be investigated in future studies in conjunction

352

with assessing the durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity and a possible dose reduction of the

353

vaccine as has been described for the rVSV-ZEBOV, the parental vaccine (42). The rVSV-ZEBOV has been

354

shown to elicit a durable humoral response, which lasts for at least 2 years in humans (43). We will also

355

investigate the addition of another SARS-CoV-2 antigen into the vaccine to promote a stronger T cell

356

response as these responses are typically longer lasting. Furthermore, we will analyze if pre-existing

357

immunity to EBOV could impact the immunogenicity of this bivalent vaccine. For now, the VSV-SARS2-

358

EBOV vaccine presents a vaccine with a high potential as a boosting option after the already approved

359

mRNA-based vaccine because the VSV-SARS2-EBOV elicits primarily a humoral response in contrast to

360

the predominantly T cell-driven immune response after mRNA vaccination (16).

Cells and Viruses

395

Huh7 and VeroE6 cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium

396

(DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Wisent Inc., St. Bruno,

397

Canada), 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 50 U/mL penicillin (Thermo Fisher

398

Scientific), and 50 μg/mL streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). BHK-T7 (baby hamster kidney) cells

399

expressing T7 polymerase were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium (MEM)

400

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5% FBS, 2

401

mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. SARS-CoV-2 isolate nCoV-WA1-2020

402

(MN985325.1) (44) was used for the animal challenge studies and neutralization test.

Generation of VSV-based vaccine candidates
The SARS-CoV-2 S ORF was PCR-amplified from an expression plasmid encoding the codon-

406

optimized (human) gene based on GenBank accession number MN908947 which was kindly provided by

407

Vincent Munster (NIAID). Full-length SARS-CoV-2 S was cloned into the pATX-VSV-EBOV plasmid

408

upstream of the EBOV-Kikwit GP resulting in VSV-SARS2-EBOV (Fig. S1A) following a previously

409

successful strategy (45). The replication-competent recombinant VSV was recovered in BHK-T7 cells as

410

described previously (26). VSV-SARS2-EBOV was propagated on Huh7 cells. The complete sequence of

411

the virus was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The titer of the virus stock was quantified using standard

412

plaque assay on VeroE6 cells.

413

415

Growth kinetics
VeroE6 cells were grown to confluency in a 12-well plate and infected in triplicate with VSVwt,

416

VSV-EBOV, or VSV-SARS2-EBOV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. After 1 h incubation at 37°C, cells

418

samples were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post infection and stored at −80 °C. The titer

419

of the supernatant samples was determined performing TCID50 assay on VeroE6 cells as previously

420

described (26).

421
422
423

Western blot analysis
Supernatant samples containing VSV were mixed 1:1 with sodium dodecyl sulfate-

424

polyacrylamide (SDS) gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 20% β-mercaptoethanol and heated

425

to 99 °C for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and transfer to Trans-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad

426

Laboratories) of all samples was performed as described elsewhere (22). Protein detection was

427

performed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 S RBD (1:1000; Sino Biological) or anti-EBOV GP (ZGP 12/1.1, 1 μg/ml;

428

kindly provided by Ayato Takada, Hokkaido University, Japan) or anti-VSV M (23H12, 1:1000; Kerafast

429

Inc.). After horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody staining using either anti-mouse

430

IgG (1:10,000) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch), the blots were imaged using the

431

SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an iBright™ CL1500

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
Blood, BAL fluid, and nasal swabs were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN)

436

according to manufacturer specifications. Tissues, a maximum of 30 mg each, were processed and

437

extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer specifications. One step RT-

438

qPCR for both genomic and subgenomic viral RNA was performed using specific primer-probe sets and

439

the QuantiFast Probe RT-PCR +ROX Vial Kit (QIAGEN), in the Rotor-Gene Q (QIAGEN) as described

440

previously (13). Five μL of each RNA extraction were run alongside dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 standards

441

with a known concentration of RNA copies.

442
443

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

444

Serum and BAL samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected animals were inactivated by γ-irradiation and

445

used in BSL2 according to IBC-approved SOPs. NUNC Maxisorp Immuno plates were coated with 50 μl of

446

1 μg/mL of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1+S2), SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Sino Biological) or EBOV GP

447

antigen at 4 °C overnight and then washed three times with phosphate buffer saline containing 0.05%

448

Tween 20 (PBST). The plates were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS for 3 hours at room temperature,

449

followed by three additional washes with PBST. The plates were incubated with 50 μl of serial dilutions

450

of the samples in PBS containing 1% skim milk for 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 washes with

451

PBST, the bound antibodies were labeled using 50 μl of 1:2,500 horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled

452

anti-monkey IgG (H+L) (SeraCare Life Sciences) diluted in 1% skim milk in PBST. For the IgG subclass

453

ELISAs the plates were incubated with samples at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with PBST, 50 μl of

454

1 μg/mL Anti-rhesus IgG1 [ena], IgG2 [dio], IgG3 [tria], or IgG4 [tessera] (NHPRR) diluted in 1% skim milk

455

in PBST was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes with PBST, the bound

456

antibodies were labeled using 50 μl of 1:10,000 HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (SeraCare Life

457

Sciences) diluted in 1% skim milk in PBST. For all ELISAs, after incubation for 1 h at room temperature

458

and 3 washes with PBST, 50 μl of KPL ABTS peroxidase substrate solution mix (SeraCare Life Sciences)

459

was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The optical

460

density (OD) at 405 nm was measured using a GloMax® explorer (Promega). The OD values were

461

normalized to the baseline samples obtained on day -10 and the cutoff value was set as the mean OD

462

plus standard deviation of the blank.

463
464
465

Virus neutralization assay
The day before this assay, VeroE6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Serum samples were

466

heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56°C, and 2-fold serial dilutions were prepared in DMEM with 2% FBS.

467

Next, 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 were added and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and 5%

468

CO2. Finally, media was removed from cells and the mixture was added to VeroE6 cells and incubated at

469

37°C and 5% CO2 for 6 days. Then the CPE was documented, and the virus neutralization titer was

470

expressed as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution of the serum which inhibited virus replication

471

(no CPE).

472

474

Flow cytometry
Rhesus macaque PBMCs were isolated from ethylene diamine tetraceticacid (EDTA) whole blood

475

by overlay on a Histopaqueâ-1077 density cushion and separated according to manufacturers’

476

instructions. Isolated PBMCs were resuspended in FBS with 10% DMSO and frozen at -80°C until

477

analysis. For analysis of T cell intracellular cytokine production, cells were stimulated for 6 hours with

478

1µg/ml SARS-CoV-S peptide pool, media, cell stimulation cocktail (containing PMA-Ionomycin,

479

Biolegend), or Lassa virus (LASV) GP peptide pool together with 5µg/ml Brefeldin A (Biolegend).

482

with IFNγ-BV605, IL-4-APC, IL-2-PerCPCy5.5 diluted in perm-wash buffer (Biolegend). For analysis of NK

483

cell intracellular cytokine production, cells were stimulated as described above. Following surface

484

staining with Live/Dead-APCCy7, CD3-FITC, CD4-PerCPCy5.5, CD8-PeTexas Red, CD16-Alexa700, and

485

CD56-BV421, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained intracellularly with granzyme B-APC.

486

Sample acquisition was performed on a Cytoflex-S (Beckman Coulter) and data analyzed in FlowJo V10

487

(TreeStar). Antigen specific T cells were identified by gating on Live/Dead negative, doublet negative

488

(SSC-H vs SSC-A), CD3+, CD56-, CD4+ or CD8+ cells and cytokine positive. Three NK cell sub-populations

489

were identified by gating on Live/Dead negative, doublet negative (SSC-H vs SSC-A), CD3-, CD56-, and

490

CD8+ or CD16+ or CD8+CD16+ double positive. Cytokine responses for each sub-population were

491

identified by gating on the population then granzyme B+ cells. Cytokine positive responses are presented

492

after subtraction of the background responses detected in the LASV GP peptide stimulated samples.

493
494
495

Cytokine analysis
Macaque serum and BAL samples were inactivated by γ-irradiation and removed from the high

496

containment laboratory according to IBC-approved SOPs. Samples were then diluted 1:2 in serum matrix

497

for analysis with Milliplex Non-Human Primate Magnetic Bead Panel as per manufacturer’s instructions

498

(Millipore Corporation). Concentrations for each cytokine were determined for all samples using the Bio-

499

Plex 200 system (BioRad Laboratories Inc.).

500
501
502

Histology and immunohistochemistry
Necropsies and tissue sampling were performed according to IBC-approved SOPs. Lungs were

503

perfused with 10% formalin and processed for histologic review. Harvested tissues were fixed for eight

504

days in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, processed using a VIP-6 Tissue Tek (Sakura

505

Finetek, USA) tissue processor, and embedded in Ultraffin paraffin polymer (Cancer Diagnostics,

506

Durham, NC). Samples were sectioned at 5 μm, dried overnight at 42 °C, and resulting slides were

507

stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Specific anti-CoV immunoreactivity was detected using an in-house

508

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (U864YFA140-4/CB2093) rabbit antibody (Genscript) at a 1:1000

509

dilution. The IHC assay was carried out on a Discovery ULTRA automated staining instrument (Roche

510

Tissue Diagnostics) with a Discovery ChromoMap DAB (Ventana Medical Systems) kit. All tissue slides

511

were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Sections taken at 3 levels from each lung

512

lobe, totally 18 sections, were evaluated for each animal; a representative lesion from each group was

513

Library construction and sequencing
Quality and quantity of RNA from BAL and lower left lung (LLL) were determined using an

517

Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cDNA libraries were constructed using the NEB Next Ultra II Direction RNA

518

Library Prep Kit (Thermo Fischer). RNA was treated with RNase H and DNase I following depletion of

519

ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Adapters were ligated to cDNA products and the subsequent ~300 base pair (bp)

520

amplicons were PCR-amplified and selected by size exclusion. cDNA libraries were assessed for quality

521

and quantity prior to 150 bp single-end sequencing using the Illumina NovaSeq platform.

522
523
524

Bioinformatic analysis
Preliminary data analysis was performed with RNA-Seq workflow module of systemPipeR,

525

developed by Backman et. al (46). RNA-Seq reads were demultiplexed, quality-filtered and trimmed

526

using Trim Galore (average Phred score cut-off of 30, minimum length of 50 bp). FastQC was used to

527

generate quality reports. Hisat2 was used to align reads to the reference genome Macaca mulatta

528

(Macaca_mulatta.Mmul_8.0.1.dna.toplevel.fa) and the Macaca_mulatta.Mmul_8.0.1.97.gtf was used

529

for annotation. For viral read quantification, RNA-Seq reads were separately aligned to the severe acute

530

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Wuhan isolate genome (NC_045512.2) and the

531

GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3_genomic.gff annotation file was used. Raw expression values (gene-

532

level read counts) were generated using the summarizeOverlaps function and normalized (read per

533

kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, rpkm) using the edgeR package. Statistical analysis with

534

edgeR was used to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) meeting the following criteria: genes

535

with median rpkm of ≥5, a false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value ≤ 0.05 and a log2fold change ≥ 1

536

compared to uninfected tissues. The number of total viral reads was determined as the total number of

537

normalized read counts mapping to all viral genes.

538

Functional enrichment of DEGs was performed using Metascape to identify relevant Gene

539

Ontology (GO) biological process terms and KEGG pathways. In silico flow cytometry was performed

540

using ImmQuant with the IRIS database. Heatmaps, bubbleplots, Venn diagrams and violin plots were

541

generated using R packages ggplot2 and VennDiagrams. GO network plots were generated in Cytoscape

542

(Version 3.5.1). Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism software (version 8).

545

All statistical analysis was performed in Prism 8 (GraphPad). The in vitro growth kinetics of

546

recombinant VSVs (Fig. S1C) was examined using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons to

547

evaluate statistical significance at all timepoints. Bioinformatics data were analyzed using one-way

548

ANOVA with multiple comparisons, comparisons were made to either uninfected animals or control-

549

vaccinated animals. Two-tailed Mann-Whitney’s rank or Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare

550

differences between groups for all other data. A Bonferroni correction was used to control for type I

551

error rate where required. Statistically significant differences are indicated as follows: p<0.0001 (****),

552

p<0.001 (***), p<0.01 (**) and p<0.05 (*).

blood vessels are cuffed by moderate numbers of lymphocytes with scattered eosinophils (200x, H&E).
(F) Foci of interstitial pneumonia show pronounced type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, thickening of
alveolar septa by an infiltration of leukocytes and leukocyte spillover into adjacent alveolar spaces with
moderate numbers of alveolar eosinophils noted and multifocal fibrin mats filling alveolar spaces (200x,
H&E). (G) Low numbers of type I pneumocytes in regions lacking pathology are immunoreactive for
SARS-CoV-2 antibody (200x, immunohistochemistry (IHC)). (H) SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoreactivity
was not observed in evaluated sections of the IM vaccinated group (200x, IHC). (I) Low numbers of type I

Heatmaps representing DEGs shared by all infected groups and enriching to Gene Ontology (GO) terms
“myeloid cell activation” and “neutrophil degranulation” for (C) upregulated DEGs and (D)
downregulated DEGs, and (E) “autophagy” and “positive regulation of cytokine production” for
upregulated DEGs. Each column represents the median rpkm of the given group. Range of colors is
based on scale and centered rpkm values of the represented DEGs. Red represents upregulated DEGs;
blue represents downregulated DEGs. (F) In silico flow cytometry using ImmQuant IRIS database
comparing challenged groups to uninfected controls. Red represents upregulation; blue represents
downregulation. Each column represents the average relative predicted frequency of the given cell type.
P-values are calculated relative to the uninfected animals. Statistical significance is indicated. For all
heatmaps, range of colors is based on scale and centered rpkm values of the represented DEGs.
