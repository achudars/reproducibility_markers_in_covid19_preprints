Abstract
Homologous proteins are often compared by pairwise sequence alignment, and
structure superposition if the atomic coordinates are available. Unification of sequence
and structure data is an important task in structural biology. Here, we present Sequence
Similarity 3D (SS3D), a new method for integrating sequence and structure information
for comparison of homologous proteins. SS3D quantifies the spatial similarity of residues
within a given radius of homologous through-space contacts. The spatial alignments are
scored using native BLOSUM and PAM substitution matrices. This work details the
SS3D approach and demonstrates its utility through case studies comparing members of
several protein families: GPCR, p53, kelch, SUMO, and SARS coronavirus spike protein.
We show that SS3D can more clearly highlight biologically important regions of
similarity and dissimilarity compared to pairwise sequence alignments or structure
superposition alone. SS3D is written in C++, and is available with a manual and tutorial
at https://github.com/0x462e41/SS3D/.

Introduction
Conservation is a term used to describe a protein or nucleic acid sequence that
changes slower over time compared to the background mutation rate. For proteins, amino
acids that have critical roles in folding, structure, stability, and target recognition tend to
be preserved or substituted for ones with similar properties in order to maintain their
biological functions (Cooper and Brown, 2008). Conserved regions are often identified
through pairwise sequence alignments, structural superposition, and variations thereof
(Doğan and Karaçalı, 2013). Sequence alignments involve the linear comparison of two
or more amino acid sequences, and are typically created using computer algorithms that
attempt to maximize a scoring function based on a substitution matrix in which aligned
identical positions are scored most favorably, followed by alignment of amino acids with
similar biochemical properties. The alignment of dissimilar amino acids, or introduction
of gaps negatively impacts the alignment score. In cases where evolutionary relatedness
is difficult to ascertain from a sequence alignment, structural superposition can be useful.
The degree of structural similarity between two proteins is commonly quantified using
the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the atomic coordinates, where lower values
indicate a higher degree of 3D similarity.
Sequence alignments and structural superposition have their own benefits and
downsides. While a sequence alignment allows for quantification of conservation at every
position, in the absence of accompanying structures, there is no knowledge of the 3D
organization of the linear sequence. As a result, conserved regions, such as active sites
and interaction surfaces, which are commonly formed by the association of residues
distant in primary sequence, can be difficult to identify, characterize, and compare. On
the other hand, superpositions of protein structure allow for visual comparison of such
regions and quantification of geometrical similarity, often using global or local RMSD
(Maiti et al., 2004). The approach also has limitations. For instance, functionally different
proteins can share similar folds, leading to a close superposition, which may lead one to
incorrect assumptions regarding function, substrate specificity, or other properties.
To overcome some of the limitations intrinsic to pairwise sequence alignments
and structural superposition, we have developed a unique method, dubbed SS3D, for
comparing homologous proteins using both sequence and structure information. In the
following sections, we describe the SS3D method, and use several case studies to
demonstrate its ability to better distinguish biologically important regions of similarity
and dissimilarity compared to pairwise sequence alignment or structure superposition
alone.
Methods
Requirements and program execution
To compare two homologous proteins using SS3D, all that is required is a
structure file in pdb format of each molecule. The atomic coordinates may be obtained
from the protein data bank, model databases, or modeling approach of choice. It is not
necessary to superimpose the structures, as SS3D analysis utilizes residue numbers,
which must be the same for homologous positions in the two proteins. A simple tutorial
for accomplishing this using Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) is included with the tool.
First, the software builds a Cα-Cα contact map of each protein. By default, a 10 Å Cα-Cα
cutoff distance is used, but the parameter is adjustable by the user. For each homologous

Cα-Cα contact between the two proteins, a list of residues that lie within a user specified
3D search radius of either Cα atom involved in the contact (spatial neighbor list) is
obtained separately for each protein (Fig. 1a,b). The spatial alignment is then scored
using the standard BLOSUM62 or PAM250 substitution matrices (Fig. 1b); smaller
values indicate a lower similarity, and larger values correspond to a higher similarity
around the contact. The program contains additional user adjustable options for refining
residue selection, output of the individual alignments, and normalization of the scores on
a 0-1 scale. All examples shown here were executed with default code parameters.
Data representation
The primary SS3D results are output in two convenient formats. The standard
output is a text file containing the residue numbers of the Cα atoms forming a contact,
followed by their spatial similarity score, one per line (e.x. 473 593 -2) (Fig. 1b). This
output can be visualized using a contact matrix colored by score (Fig. 1c). SS3D can also
map spatial similarity scores to the B-factor column of the input pdb files, which can be
colored by value in protein structure visualization software (Fig. 1c). In this work, we
used a red-gray-blue spectrum to represent low, medium, and high spatial similarity
scores, respectively. This representation is effective for illustrating the correlation
between similarity and protein structure-activity relationships, as demonstrated herein.

the homologous position in protein2 falls slightly outside of the search radius. c) Matrix

Results and discussion
To demonstrate SS3D, members of five different protein families were assessed:
GPCR, p53, kelch, SUMO, and SARS coronavirus spike protein. For each case, two
family members were compared by pairwise sequence alignment scored with
BLOSUM62 (linear similarity), structure superposition (RMSD), and spatial similarity
scored with BLOSUM62 (SS3D). In doing so, we demonstrate that SS3D can more
clearly highlight physiologically important regions of similarity and dissimilarity than
either method alone. We expect that SS3D will be useful in numerous applications,
including, but not limited to, improved detection of conserved and nonconserved regions,
delineation of evolutionary pathways, assessment of interaction specificity, and protein
design. The following cases illustrate SS3D utility for these purposes.
Case 1: GPCR
The GPCR superfamily is the largest class of mammalian receptors (Baltoumas et
al., 2013). GPCR family members share the greatest homology in the conserved
transmembrane (TM) segments, and highest diversity around the extracellular amino
terminus (Kobilka, 2007). There are over 800 GPCRs in humans that mediate a diverse
array of physiological processes such as taste, vision, and smell by responding to
extracellular stimuli, including peptides, ions, small molecules, and photons. Figure 2a-c
shows the pairwise, structural, and SS3D comparisons of two class A GPCRs, β2
adrenergic receptor (β2AR), and type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1). Among the
comparisons, SS3D reveals the different target specificities of the two receptors most
apparently (Fig. 2c). The primary endogenous agonists of β2AR are epinephrine and
norepinephrine (Reiner et al., 2010), while that of CB1 is anandamide (Fig.2d) (Felder
and Glass, 1998). β2AR and CB1 agonists bind to a pocket formed by TM segments in
the extracellular leaflet, and the residues that make physical contacts with these ligands
(Chan et al., 2016; Shao et al., 2016) present below average SS3D scores (Fig. 2c,e-f). In
contrast, the TM segments in the intracellular leaflet have higher SS3D values,
specifically around the (D/E)RY and NPXXY segments (Fig. 2c), which have critical
roles in global movements of the helices required for G protein binding and activation,
which is common among class A GPCRs (Katritch et al., 2013).

Case 2: p53
The p53 family of tumor suppressors contains three members, p53, p63, and p73,
which have both similar and distinct functions. The DNA binding domains (DBDs) of
these proteins are the most conserved regions, sharing ~60% sequence similarity and
analogous structures (Costa et al., 2016). Physical contact with DNA occurs at the loops
protruding on the top portion of the β-sandwich fold (Fig. 3). p53 family members bind to
similar response elements, and thus have overlapping transcriptional profiles (Ciribilli et
al., 2013). The high conservation of the DNA binding loops is considerably less evident
in the pairwise alignment and structure superposition (Fig. 3a,b) compared to SS3D (Fig.
3c). Specifically, DNA contact residues N239, Q136, R273, and R248W (Freed-Pastor
and Prives, 2012) show among the highest conservation levels of the entire DBD in the
SS3D comparison with an average similarity score of 0.91 (Fig. 3c). The same residues
have an average score of 0.68 in the pairwise alignment (Fig. 3a).
In addition to accentuating regions of high similarity, SS3D also conveniently
illustrates differences. Despite their high sequence and structure similarity, p53 family
members vary considerably in stability, with p53 being the least stable and most
aggregation prone family member (Cino et al., 2016). p63 is the family member with
highest stability and lowest tendency to aggregate. The S6-S7 and Y220 regions (Fig. 3c)
exhibit altered conformational sampling in p53 and structurally compromised mutants,
leading to formation of surface crevices that destabilize the p53 DBD, promoting its

unfolding and aggregation (Pradhan et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2012). Both pockets are being
explored as targets for p53 stabilizing molecules (Li et al., 2019). The SS3D comparison
of p53 and p63 DBDs shows low similarity in these areas (Fig 3c). Therefore, the SS3D
analysis could potentially guide the design of higher stability variants, which is another
proposed strategy for restoring p53 function (Lima et al., 2020).

comparison of p53, 2xwr (Natan et al., 2011), and p63 DBDs.
Case 3: kelch domain
The kelch repeat motif is a 44-56 amino acid sequence that forms a four-stranded
antiparallel beta sheet (Adams et al., 2000). The repeats, or blades, can associate,
typically in clusters of 4-7, to form β-propellers. Kelch repeat proteins are involved in
diverse cellular functions, and interact with binding partners through residues
surrounding a central cavity (Fig. 4). The kelch domain of KLHL2 selectively recognizes
‘EXDQ’ motifs (Gouw et al., 2018), while that of KLHL19 binds to ‘EXGE’ containing
motifs (Karttunen et al., 2018). Both have high selectivity for their particular consensus
motifs, and are unable to bind to those of one another interchangeably (Schumacher et al.,
2014). The SS3D comparison of KLHL2 and KLHL19 kelch domains (Fig. 4c) shows a
discernable pattern, where blades 1 and 2 have lower similarity scores relative to blades
3-6, which is not evident by pairwise alignment or RMSD (Fig. 4d,e). Intriguingly,
crucial residues for KLHL19 interaction with its major partner, nrf2, are located within
blades 1 and 2 (Karttunen et al., 2018): Y334 (blade 1), R380 (blade 2), and N382 (blade
2). Because KLHL2 and KLHL19 share a common ancestor, it seems plausible that
individual blades evolved at different rates, and greater divergence of a subset of the
repeats (blades 1 and 2) was sufficient to achieve novel interaction specificity.

Case 4: SUMO
Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins originate from a common β-grasp fold
ancestor, and comprise a diverse family with numerous cellular functions (Zuin et al.,
2014). Differently from ubiquitin, which targets proteins for degradation, small ubiquitinlike modifiers (SUMOs) are key regulators of transcription, apoptosis, cell cycle, and
other fundamental processes (Müller et al., 2001). SUMOs can bind both covalently and
noncovalently to target proteins. The former is catalyzed by SUMOspecific proteases (SENPs), while the latter is mediated by SUMO interacting motifs
(SIMs) (Hickey et al., 2012). SENPs and SIMs have been shown to have SUMO isoform
preference, with SUMO1 residues Q53, R54, A72, H75, and G81, being important
determinants of interaction specificity (Chupreta et al., 2005; Ronau et al., 2016).
Compared to the pairwise alignment and structure superposition of SUMO1 and 2 (Fig.
5a,b), SS3D better highlights the differences around these residues, which present low
spatial similarity scores (Fig. 5c). The comparison also illustrates the power of SS3D in
identifying conserved regions. Although the ubiquitin-like protein family has become
highly diversified, the ancestral β-grasp scaffold has been preserved. SS3D precisely
shows high conservation around the protein core, and even reveals differential
conservation of surface- and core-oriented residues (Fig. 5c).

Case 5: SARS coronavirus spike protein
The spike protein is a large glycosylated homotrimer that garnishes the viral
envelope and interacts with host receptors permitting virus fusion with cell membranes
(Belouzard et al., 2012). Spike protein neutralizing antibodies have been detected in
coronavirus patients, implicating it as a prime antigenic component and target for vaccine
development (Kitabatake et al., 2007). Although the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2
spike proteins share 76% sequence identity (Jaimes et al., 2020), several antibodies
against the former spike protein do not cross-neutralize that of the latter, indicating that
they possess unique antigenic characteristics (Yi et al., 2020). Assessment of the
differences between key features in spike protein variants is expected to be useful for
development of vaccines and virus entry inhibitors (Robson, 2020). The N-terminal and
receptor binding domains (NBD and RBD) are potential targets for neutralizing
antibodies (Jiang et al., 2020), while the S1/S2 cleavage site facilitates virus entry and
has been determined essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans (Hoffmann et al.,
2020). Interestingly, these regions are more prominently seen by SS3D comparison than
pairwise or structural similarity alone (Fig. 6a-d). Within the RBD, the ACE2 receptor
binding motif (RBM) is a crucial target for neutralizing antibodies (Freund et al., 2015).
SS3D reveals low similarity in the central portion of the RBM (Fig. 6e), which could
explain poor cross-neutralizing activity of most SARS-CoV-1 antibodies against SARSCoV-2 (Lan et al., 2020). Neither the pairwise similarity nor RMSD comparisons are able
to discriminate RBM uniqueness (Fig. 6f).

Conclusions
The present work introduces a new method for comparing homologous proteins
by integrating sequence and structure information. By employing a standard scoring
metric, SS3D provides a quantitative measure of spatial similarity between proteins. Case
studies of different protein families illustrate that SS3D more effectively shows
biologically important regions of similarity and dissimilarity compared to pairwise
sequence alignments or structure superposition alone. We anticipate that the tool will be
useful for numerous bioinformatics purposes including, and beyond those illustrated here.
