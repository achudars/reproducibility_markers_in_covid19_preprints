ABSTRACT

25

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global public health and

26

economy crisis. The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the

27

human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be

28

the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, comparing to the SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs identified in

29

bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S)

30

glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor

31

recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and

32

pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or

33

amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from

34

14 mammal species and found that ACE2 from multiple species can support the

35

infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage

36

site deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse

37

exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activity, respectively. Among the remaining

38

species, ACE2 from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of

39

SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These

40

findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs,

41

zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models.

Importance

48

SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as primary receptor for host cell entry. Viral entry

49

mediated by the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein largely determines host range and

50

is the major constraint to interspecies transmission. We examined the receptor activity

51

of 14 ACE2 orthologues and found that wild type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the

52

furin cleavage site in S protein could utilize ACE2 from a broad range of animal species

53

to enter host cells. These results have important implications in the natural hosts,

54

interspecies transmission, animal models and molecular basis of receptor binding for

55

SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

61
62

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Dec. 2019 in the city

63

of Wuhan, China (1), and has since spread worldwide, causing 2.3 million infected and

64

around 160,000 fatalities as of April 18th, 2020 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

65

These numbers are still growing rapidly. The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused an

66

unprecedented public health and economy crisis.

67

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

68

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; initially named as 2019-nCoV) (2, 3). The origin of

69

SARS-CoV-2 and its emergence in the human population remain mysterious. Many of

70

the early cases were linked to the Huanan seafood and wild animal market in Wuhan

71

city, raising the possibility of zoonotic origin (4). Sequencing analyses showed that the

72

genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5%, 89.1%, 93.3%, and 96.2% nucleotide sequence

73

identity with that of human SARS-CoV, bat coronavirus (CoV) ZC45, bat CoV

74

RmYN02, and bat CoV RaTG13, respectively, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 probably

75

has bat origins (2, 3, 5). This finding is not surprising as bats are notorious for serving

76

as the natural reservoir for two other deadly human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and

77

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which previously caused

78

global outbreak, respectively (6, 7).

79

Although SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats, bat CoVs are unlikely to

80

jump directly to humans due to the general ecological separation. Other mammal

81

species may have been served as intermediate or amplifying hosts where the progenitor

82

virus acquires critical mutations for efficient zoonotic transmission to human. This has

83

been seen in the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV where palm civet and

84

dromedary camel act as the respective intermediate host (7). The Huanan seafood and

85

wild animal market in Wuhan city would otherwise be a unique place to trace any

86

potential animal source; however, soon after the disease outbreak, the market was

87

closed and all the wild animals were cleared, making this task very challenging or even

88

impossible. As an alternative, wide screening of wild animals becomes imperative.

89

Several recent studies identified multiple SARS-COV-2-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) from

90

smuggled Malayan pangolins in China. These pangolin CoVs (PCoV) form two

91

phylogenetic lineages, PCoV-GX and PCoV-GD (8-11). In particular, lineage

92

PCoV-GD was found to carry a nearly identical receptor-binding motif (RBM) in the

93

spike (S) protein to that of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.1). However, the genome of these

94

pangolin SL-CoVs share only 85.5%-92.4% nucleotide identities with that of

95

SARS-CoV-2. This is in contrast to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV where CoVs isolated

96

form the intermediate host palm civet and dromedary camel share 99.6% and 99.9% %

97

genome sequence identities with their human counterpart, respectively (12, 13).

98

Therefore, pangolins tested in these studies are not the direct intermediate host for

99

SARS-CoV-2. Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 came from other pangolins or other wild

100

animal species remains to be determined.

101

S protein driven cellular entry, triggered by receptor recognition, is the major

102

determinant of host range, cell, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses (14).

103

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a type I membrane glycoprotein, which can be cleaved

104

to S1 and S2 subunit during biogenesis at the polybasic furin cleavage site (RRAR)

105

(Fig.1) (15-18). Previous studies have shown that furin cleavage is not essential for

106

coronavirus-cell membrane fusion, but enhances cell-to-cell fusion (19-23), expands

107

coronavirus cell tropism (24), increases the fitness of sequence variant within the

108

quasispecies population of bovine CoV (25). Recent studies indicated that the cleavage

109

at the S1/S2 boundary by furin in virus-producing cells is a critical prime step that

110

facilitates conformation change triggered by receptor binding during virus entry and

111

subsequent fusion-activating cleavage at the S2′site, which is located immediate

112

upstream of fusion peptide in S2 subunit (18, 24, 26). Also, furin cleavage in HA was

113

found to convert avirulent avian influenza virus isolate to a highly pathogenic isolate

114

(27). Interestingly, this cleavage site is not present in the S protein of SARS-CoV, bat

115

SL-CoVs or pangolin SL-CoVs identified so far (5, 15). Besides furin-mediated

116

cleavage in virus-producing cells, SARS-CoV-2 S protein is also cleaved for fusion

117

activation by cell surface protease TMPRSS2 and lysosomal proteases, e.g. cathepsin L,

118

during virus entering target cells (15, 18).

119

During cell entry, S1 binds to the cellular receptor, subsequently triggering a

120

cascade of events leading to S2-mediated membrane fusion between host cells and

121

coronavirus particles (28). S1 protein contains an independently folded domain called

122

the receptor binding domain (RBD), which harbors an RBM that is primarily involved

123

in contact with receptor (Fig. 1). Human ACE2 (hACE2) has been identified as the

124

cellular receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 (3, 15, 17, 29) and SARS-CoV (30). In addition

125

to hACE2, ACE2 from horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus alcyone) was found to support cell

126

entry of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated VSV-based pseudotyped virus (15). By using

127

infectious virus it has also been shown that ACE2 from Chinese horseshoe bat

128

(Rhinolophus sinicus), civet and swine, but not mouse, could serve as functional

129

receptors (3). However, in this infection system, the entry step was coupled with other

130

steps during virus life cycle, i.e. viral genome replication, translation, virion assembly

131

and budding, and thus the receptor activity of these animal ACE2 orthologs were not

132

directly investigated.

133

In an effort to search for potential animal hosts, we examined the receptor activity

134

of ACE2 from 14 mammal species, including human, rhesus monkey, Chinese

135

horseshoe bat (Rs bat), Mexican free-tailed bat (Tb bat), rat, mouse, palm civet, raccoon

136

dog, ferret badger, hog badger, canine, feline, rabbit, and pangolin for SARS-CoV-2 and

137

a mutant virus lacking the furin cleavage site in the S protein. Our results show that

138

multiple animal ACE2 could serve as receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2

139

mutant. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest

140

receptor activity, respectively, with the other 10 ACE2s exhibiting intermediate activity.

141

The implications of our findings were discussed in terms of the natural reservoir,

142

zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, animal health, and animal model.

143

Results

144

Human ACE2 serves as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2

145

To examine the receptor activity of human ACE2 (hACE2) for SARS-CoV-2, we

146

first established a HIV-based pseudotyped virus entry system. This system has been

147

widely used in studies of coronavirus entry. To improve the expression level of S protein

148

and the yield of pseudotyped virus, a codon-optimized S gene based on the sequence of

149

isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (2) was synthesized and used for production of pseudotyped virus

150

as previously described for other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including SARS-CoV,

151

MERS-CoV, NL63, 229E, and OC43 (31, 32). The pseudotyped virus was then used to

152

infect 293T cells transfected with either empty vector, or a plasmid expressing APN

153

(receptor for HCoV-229E), DDP4 (receptor for MERS-CoV), ACE1 or hACE2. Two

154

days post-infection, the luciferase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 2A, only

155

hACE2 was able to efficiently support virus entry. The entry of SARS-CoV-2, but not

156

influenza virus A (IVA) or HCoV-43, was blocked by antibody against hACE2 in a

157

dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). We also performed a syncytia formation assay to

158

assess the membrane fusion triggered by hACE2-S binding. As shown in Fig. 1C,

159

syncytia formation was only seen for cells expressing hACE2, but not hACE1, mixed

160

with cells expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV. These results

161

confirm that hACE2 is the bone fide entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2.

162

Multiple animal ACE2 orthologs serve as receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and

163

SARS-CoV-2 mutant with S protein lacking the furin cleavage site

164

To test if other animal ACE2 orthologs can also be used as receptor for

165

SARS-CoV-2, we cloned or synthesized ACE2 from rhesus monkey, Chinese horseshoe

166

bat (Rs bat), Mexican free-tailed bat (Tb bat), rat, mouse, palm civet, raccoon dog, ferret

167

badger, hog badger, canine, feline, rabbit, and pangolin. These animals were chosen as

168

being either the proposed natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2 (bat, pangolin) (3, 10),

169

intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV (civet, raccoon) (12), common animal model (rat,

170

mouse, monkey), or household pets (canine, feline, rabbit). These ACE2 molecules were

171

transiently expressed in 293T cells (Fig.3A), which were then infected with

172

pseudotyped virus of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2pp). The luciferase activity was

173

measured and normalized to hACE2 (Fig. 3B). The results showed that (1) ACE2 of

174

human and rhesus monkey were the most efficient receptors; (2) ACE2 of rat and mouse

175

barely supported virus entry (<10% of hACE2); (3) the receptor activities of the other

176

10 animal ACE2s were between human/monkey and rat/mouse. Among these, ACE2 of

177

canine, feline, rabbit and pangolin could support virus entry at levels >50% of hACE2.

178

To examine receptor binding ability, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP)

179

analysis by using both S1 and receptor binding domain (RBD) as probe. Among the 14

180

different ACE2s tested, ACE2 from human, monkey, feline, rabbit and pangolin

181

exhibited significant and consistent association with S1 and RBD (Fig.3C). Importantly,

182

these ACE2s correspond to the group of ACE2s that supported the most efficient virus

183

entry (Fig.3B). The Lack of significant entry reduction in 293T cells of furin mutant

184

virus was likely due to the redundancy of cellular proteases, e.g. endosomal cathepsin,

185

that promote membrane fusion in endosome. It has been proposed that MERS-CoV

186

mutant having uncleaved S proteins enter cells via late endosome/lysosome (24). Two

187

recent studies confirmed that furin cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was required for

188

efficient entry into human lung cells (18, 33).

189

A striking difference between SARS-CoV-2 and animal SL-CoVs is the presence

190

of a polybasic furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary of the S protein (Fig.1). Here,

191

we generated a SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutant with the furin cleavage site deleted to

192

mimic the bat SL-CoV CZ45. This S mutant has been previously demonstrated to

193

express a full-length non-cleaved S protein during biogenesis in cells (17). Pseudotyped

194

virus with this mutant S protein was produced and used to infect ACE2-transfected

195

293T cells. Similar or slightly higher efficiency were observed for the mutant S

196

protein-mediated pseudoviral infection in cells transfected with all the animal ACE2s,

197

except for mouse, rat and civet where the mutant S protein mediated a slight lower

198

efficiency of infection. Interesting, pangolin ACE2 was now as efficient as hACE2 for

199

supporting mutant virus entry (Fig.3B).

200

We also tested the receptor usage of these 14 ACE2 by SARS-CoV (Fig.3D). The

201

results indicated that ACE2 of Rs bat and rat were the poorest receptors (<20% of

202

hACE2), while the other ACE2s could support SARS-CoV entry at levels >50% of

203

hACE2. Interestingly, ACE2 of rabbit and pangolin were even more efficient than

204

hACE2 for supporting SARS-CoV entry. Together, these results demonstrated that

205

SARS-CoV-2 and its mutant virus lacking furin cleavage site, as well as SARS-CoV,

206

could use multiple animal ACE2s as receptor.

207

Molecular basis of different ACE2 receptor activities

208

To help understand the molecular basis of different ACE2 receptor activities, we

209

first examined the overall sequence variation between these ACE2s. For this purpose,

210

we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of ACE2s (Fig.4).

211

Interestingly, the phylogenetic clustering of ACE2s is correlated with their abilities to

212

support SARS-CoV-2 entry. For example, ACE2s in subclade IIA (human, rhesus

213

monkey and rabbit) and IIB (rat and mouse) were the most efficient and poorest receptor,

214

respectively, while ACE2s in clade I (from the remaining animals) were intermediate

215

between subclades IIA and IIB. This correlation suggests that sequence variations that

216

define for speciation are responsible for observed differences in receptor activity.

217

Next, based on the published crystal structures of hACE2-RBD complex we

218

compared amino acid sequences of ACE2 receptors, focusing on 23 critical residues in

219

close contact with RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (16, 34, 35) (Fig. 5). Two obvious patterns
10

220

were observed. First, hACE2 and rhesus monkey ACE2 are identical at all critical

221

residues for RBD interaction. This explains why rhesus monkey ACE2 supported virus

222

entry as efficient as hACE2 (Fig.3B). Second, since rat and mouse merely support virus

223

entry, the three substitutions (D30N, Y83F and K353H) that are only seen in rat and

224

mouse ACE2s may be the key.

225

To further explain the different receptor activities, we used homology-based

226

structure modeling to analyze the effect of residue substitutions at the atomic level.

227

Structure models of 14 ACE2s were generated based on the crystal structure of

228

SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex (16). The effects of critical residue substitutions

229

were analyzed and are summarized in Table 1. Overall, the predicted effects of residue

230

substitutions in ACE2s were consistent with corresponding receptor activities. ACE2 of

231

rodents and bats are presented as examples of this analysis (Fig.6).

232

First, we examined the rodent-unique substitutions D30N, Y83F and K353H as

233

they may play a key role in rat and mouse ACE2 inactivity. In humans the residues at

234

all three of these positions directly contact the RBD via hydrogen bonds. D30 contacts

235

K417, Y83 contacts N487, and K353 appears to be at the center of a hydrogen bond

236

network spanning seven RBD residues (Y449, G496, Q498, T500, N501, G502, Y505)

237

and eight ACE2 residues (D38, Y41, Q42, N330, K353, G354, D355, R357). The D30N,

238

Y83F and K353H substitutions are all predicted to disrupt these interactions in rat and

239

mouse ACE2 (Figure 6). This is consistent with previous reports which pinpoint K353

240

as an important hotspot for both SARS-CoV-2 (16) and SARS-CoV (36) binding. It has

241

been experimentally demonstrated that introduction of K353H into hACE2 significantly

242

reduces binding to SARS-CoV S1; in contrast, introduction of H353K into rat ACE2

243

significantly increases binding to SARS-CoV S1 (37). Our homology models indicate

244

that other residue substitutions may also be contributing to the low viral entry activity in

245

mouse and rat ACE2. Substitutions Q24N, Q27S, M82N, Q325P and E329T in rat

246

ACE2, and L79T, M82S and E329A in mouse ACE2, are all predicted to disrupt

247

interactions with RBD residues (Fig. 6 and Table 1).

248

Both Bat ACE2s are also inefficient receptors for viral entry (Fig.3B). Since the

249

profile of residues at the receptor/RBD interface is significantly different from rat and

250

mouse ACE2, we examined other bat-specific residue substitutions that may be

251

contributing to receptor dysfunction. There are 8 and 10 critical residue substitutions in

252

the Rs bat and Tb bat ACE2s, respectively (Fig.5). Among these, we examined the

253

substitutions at positions Y41, H34 and E329 as they are only seen in bat ACE2s. The

254

Y41H substitution in both bat ACE2s appears to be disrupting the same H-bond network

255

that was disrupted by K353H in rat and mouse ACE2. Although Y41 is not as centrally

256

located in the H-bond network as K353, it directly contacts N501 from the RBD, which is

257

the same residue that is stabilized by K353. A second interaction which appears to be

258

disrupted in only bat ACE2s occurs at position H34. In humans, H34 forms a H-bond

259

with Y453 from the RBD, which is broken through a H34T substitution in bat ACE2s.

260

Finally, the bat-unique substitution E329N appears to be disrupting H-bonds connecting

261

two ACE2 residues (E329, Q325) and two RBD residues (N439, Q506). In Tb bat ACE2,

262

all connections in the H-bond network are disrupted by the single E329N substitution,

263

however the H-bond network is predicted to be restored by an additional substitution,

264

Q325E in Rs bat. In addition, other residue substitutions, i.e. T27M and M82N in Rs bat,

265

and D30Q and L79H in Tb bat, are also disruptive (Fig. 6).

266

These results reveal that the poor and low receptor activity of rodent ACEs and bat

267

ACE2 are resulted from a broken interaction network by a key residue substitution, i.e.

268

K353H in rodents and Y41H in bats, and additive disruptive effects by multiple residue

269

substitutions.

Discussion

271

In this study, we examined the receptor activity of 14 ACE2 orthologues. The

272

results suggested that wild type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the furin cleavage site

273

in S protein could use ACE2 from a broad range of animal species to enter host cells.

274

Below we discuss the implication of our findings in terms of natural reservoir, zoonotic

275

transmission, human-to-animal transmission, animal health, and animal model.

276

Implication in natural reservoirs and zoonotic transmission

277

Among the 14 ACE2s tested here, hACE2 and rhesus monkey ACE2 are the most

278

efficient receptors, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has already been well adapted to

279

humans. In addition, ACE2s of other animals, except mouse and rat, could also support

280

SARS-CoV-2 entry (Fig.3B). Although these data were obtained by using HIV1-based

281

pseudotyped virus, for ACE2 of Rs bat, civet, and mouse, the data is consistent with in

282

vitro infection data using infectious virus (3). Receptor usage by coronaviruses has been

283

well known to be a major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis

284

(14, 38, 39). It is therefore reasonable to assume that SARS-CoV-2 would be able to

285

infect all these animals. As a matter of fact, several in vivo infection and seroconversion

286

studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can infect rhesus monkey (40), feline, ferret,

287

and canine (41, 42). Our findings are also in line with the concordance between ACE2

288

receptor usage by SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus and susceptibility of the animals to

289

SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Fig.3D, ACE2 of rhesus monkey, mouse, civet,

290

ferret badger, raccoon and feline could support SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus entry;

291

concordantly, all these animals are susceptible to native SARS-CoV virus infection (12,

292

43-46).

293

Among all those wild animals that are potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2, bat

294

and pangolin have already been proposed to be the natural reservoirs as closely related

295

SL-CoVs have been identified in bats (2, 3, 5) and pangolins (8-11). A recent study has

296

shown that bat SL-CoV RaTG13 could use hACE2 as receptor, consistent with the

297

presence of several favorable hACE2-binding residues (aa 455, 482-486) in the receptor

298

binding motif (RBM) of the S protein (Fig.1) (16). For pangolin SL-CoVs, lineage

299

PCoV-GD has only one non-critical amino acid substitution (Q483H) in the RBM when

300

compared to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.1) (10). Therefore, PCoV-GD most likely can also use

301

hACE2 and other animal ACE2s as functional receptors.

302

We also tested the receptor usage by a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that lacks the furin

303

cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary. Our result showed that the mutant virus behaved

304

similarly to the wt virus. Namely, the entry of mutant virus could also be supported by

305

those animal ACE2s that supported the entry of wt virus. This result is similar to another

306

study that used the S gene mutant but in a MLV-based pseudotyped virus system (17)

307

and the role of furin cleavage during coronavirus infection. Furin cleavage is not

308

essential for coronavirus-cell membrane fusion, but enhances cell-to-cell fusion (19-22,

309

47). This could provide certain level of advantage during infection. For example, in the

310

quasispecies population of bovine CoV, a minor sequence variant with a polybasic
14

311

furin-like cleavage site in the S2 subunit quickly dominated the population even after a

312

single passage in cells (25). However, by using pseudotyped virus system, which is a

313

single cycle infection system, we may not see the advantage. Still, ours result

314

unequivocally showed that SARS-CoV-2 without this cleavage site could use multiple

315

animal ACE2s as receptors to enter cells. As there is a need to continuously search for

316

potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV, results presented here can help significantly

317

narrow down the scope of potential targets.

318

Collectively, our results highlight the potential of these wild animals to serve as

319

natural reservoirs or intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and its progenitor, the risk of

320

zoonotic transmission of animal SL-CoVs to human, and the necessity of virus

321

surveillance in wild animals.

322

Implication in human-to-animal transmission and animal health

323

Among those animal species tested here, canine and feline are of special concern as

324

they are often raised as companion pets. Our data indicate that ACE2 of canine and

325

feline could support SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus entry quite efficiently (>50% of

326

hACE2, Fig.3B), raising the alarming possibility of virus transmission from infected

327

human to these pets or potentially vice versa. As a matter of fact, there was a recent

328

report that a Pomeranian dog in Hong Kong tested weakly positive for SARS-CoV-2

329

while maintaining an asymptomatic state. The genome of the virus isolated from this

330

dog has only three nucleotide changes compared to the virus isolated from two infected

331

persons living in the same household, suggesting that this dog probably acquired the

332

virus from the infected owners (48). Our results are further supported by two additional

333

studies. One study showed that both dog and cat were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
15

334

infection. While the virus replicated poorly in dogs, it replicated efficiently in cats and

335

was able to transmit to unaffected cats that were housed with them (41). The other study

336

revealed that 14.7% of cat sera samples collected in Wuhan city after the outbreak were

337

positive for antibody against SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that many cats were infected

338

during the outbreak, most likely from infected humans in close contact (42). Domestic

339

cats are also susceptible to SARS-CoV infection (43) and human-to-cat transmission

340

was evident during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 in Hong Kong (49). These findings

341

were also in agreement with our results that ACE2 of cat and dog could serve as

342

receptor for SARS-CoV (Fig.3D).

343

As described above, it seems that dogs are not as susceptible as cats to

344

SARS-CoV-2 (41, 48). Interestingly, this is in agreement with results from IP analysis

345

that showed cat ACE2 could bind to S1 or RBD more efficiently than dog ACE2

346

(Fig.3C). Structural models further suggest that, at those critical RBD-binding residues,

347

dog and cat ACE2 share 4 substitutions (Q24L, D30E, D38E, and M82T), while dog

348

ACE2 has an additional substitution, H34Y (Fig.5). Based on structural modeling, both

349

Q24L and M82T are predicted to be disruptive, while both D30E and D38E are

350

tolerable (Table 1). H34Y in dog ACE2 is predicted to disrupt the hydrogen bond with

351

Y453 of RBD (Table 1). These atomic interactions explain why dog ACE2 binds to S1

352

or RBD less efficiently compared to cat ACE2, and both are less efficient than human

353

ACE2.

354

In addition to cat and dog, rabbits are also often raised as household pets. Our

355

results indicate that rabbit ACE2 is an efficient receptor (Fig. 3B and 3C), suggesting

356

that rabbit may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than cat.

357

Currently, there is no evidence that infected pets can transmit the virus back to

358

human; however, this may be possible and should be investigated. Out of an abundance

359

of caution it would be best when one is infected to have both human and pets

360

quarantined, and the pets tested as well.

361

Implication in animal model

362

Animal models are essential for study of pathogenesis, vaccinology and

363

therapeutics of viral pathogens. Rodents are probably the most common and amenable

364

animal models because of low cost, easy handling, defined genetics, and the possibility

365

of scalability (50). However, our results showed that both mouse and rat ACE2 are poor

366

receptors for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.3B and 3C), suggesting that they are probably resistant

367

to infection. Actually, this has been verified by using infectious SARS-CoV-2 to infect

368

mouse ACE2-transfected cells (3) or mice (51). Genetically engineered mice expressing

369

hACE2 were previously developed as an animal model for SARS-CoV (52). This model

370

has been tested recently for SARS-CoV-2, and found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

371

infection and development of interstitial pneumonia (51), a common clinical feature of

372

COVID-19 patients (53). Human ACE2-transgenic mice therefore represent useful

373

animal models. However, because of the high demand, and discontinuance due to the

374

disappearance of SARS-CoV in the human population after 2004, it is expected that this

375

mouse model will be in short supply (54). Alternative methods should be sought to

376

develop a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain. Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains were

377

developed by serial passage of virus in mice (55, 56). However, this method may not

378

work for SARS-CoV-2 as mouse ACE2 still supports some entry for SARS-CoV

379

(Fig.3D), but not SARS-CoV-2. An alternative way to make a mouse-adapted

380

SARS-CoV-2 strain could be achieved by rational design of the S gene. Based on the

381

structural model, we know that receptor dysfunction of mouse ACE2 is due to

382

disruptive D30N, L79T, M82S, Y83F, E329A and K353H substitutions (Fig.5, Fig.6 and

383

Table 1). Therefore, by specifically introducing mutations into the RBM of S gene it

384

may be possible to restore or at least partly restore interactions with these ACE2

385

substitutions. Consequently, the engineered virus may be able to efficiently infect

386

wildtype mice.

387

To date, several animals (i.e. rhesus monkey, ferret, dog, cat, pig, chicken and duck)

388

have been examined as potential animal models for SARS-CoV-2 (40, 41). Although

389

the rhesus monkey, ferret and cat may seem to be the promising candidates, none of

390

them are perfect in terms of recapitulation of typical clinical features in COVID-19

391

patients. Therefore, multiple animal models may be needed. Our results indicate that

392

rabbit ACE2 is a more efficient receptors than other animal ACE2s for both

393

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig.3). Therefore, it may be worthy assessing rabbit as a

394

useful animal model for further studies.

(Paguma larvata, accession number AY881174.1), and rat (Rattus norvegicus, accession

407

408

(Invitrogen) as previously described (37, 58). ACE2 protein expressed from this vector

409

has a c-myc tag at the N-terminus and a C9 tag at the C-terminus. An Age I site was

Construction of plasmids expressing S, S1 and RBD of SARS-CoV-2

430

The nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S gene was retrieved from NCBI

431

database (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank No. MN908947). According the method

432

described by Gregory J. Babcock et al (59), the codon-optimized S gene was

433

synthesized, and cloned into pCAGGS vector. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutant without

434

the furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary was generated by an overlapping

435

PCR-based method as previously described (60). The S1 subunit (aa 14-685) and RBD

436

(aa 331-524) were cloned into a soluble protein expression vector, pSecTag2/Hygro-Ig

437

vector, which contains human IgG Fc fragment and mouse Ig k-chain leader sequence

438

(61). The protein expressed is soluble and has a human IgG-Fc tag.

439

Western blot assay

440

As previously described, the expression of ACE2-C9, S1-Ig, and RBD-Ig fusion

441

proteins were examined by western-blot (61). Briefly, lysates or culture supernatants of

442

293T cells transfected with plasmid encoding ACE2 orthologs and S1-Ig or RBD-Ig

443

were collected, boiled for 10 min, and then resolved by 4~12% SDS-PAGE. A PVDF

444

membrane containing the proteins transferred from SDS-PAGE was blocked with

445

blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in TBS) for 1h at room temperature and probed

446

with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed three times with washing

447

buffer (0.05% tween-20 in TBS), followed by incubation with secondary antibody for

450

Immunoprecipitation (IP) assay.

451

The association between Ig-fused S1 protein or RBD protein and ACE2 protein

452

with C9 tag was measured by IP according to a previously described method (60).

453

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid encoding ACE2 with

454

Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h post-transfection, the transfected 293T cells were

455

harvested and lysed in PBS buffer containing 0.3 % n-decyl-β-D-maltopyranoside

456

(DDM, Anatrace). Cell lysates were incubated with Protein A/G PLUS Agarose (Santa

457

Cruz, sc-2003) together with 4μg of S1-Ig or RBD-Ig. Protein A/G agarose were

458

washed three times in TBS/1% Ttriton-X100, resolved by SDS–PAGE, and detected by

459

western blot using anti-C9 monoclonal antibody.

460

Production of pseudotyped virus

461

Following the standard protocol of calcium phosphate transfection, Lenti-X cells in

462

10-cm plate were co-transfected by 20μg of HIV-luc and 10μg of CoVs spike gene

463

plasmid. At 48h post-transfection, 15 ml supernatant was collected and passed through a

464

0.45um pore size PES filter. The purified virus was titrated with Lenti-X p24 Rapid

465

Titer Assay (Takara Bio, Cat. No. 632200). The virus was stored at -80 °C for future

466

use.

467

Virus entry assay

468

Each well of 293T cells in a 96-well plate was transfected with 0.1µg of ACE2

469

plasmid DNA following the standard protocol of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At

470

48 hours post-transfection, 150 µl of p24-normalized (10 ng) of pseudotype virus was

and 250 µl of fresh medium was added into each well for further incubation. Two days

478

activity was expressed as relative light unit (RLU) and normalized to human ACE2 for

479

plotting.

480

Syncytial formation assay

For each ACE2, four wells were tested in a single

481

293T cells with approximately 90% confluent on 12-well plate were transfected

482

with 1.6μg of plasmid DNA encoding viral S gene or ACE2. At 24 h post-transfection,

483

293T cells expressing the S protein were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with 293T cells expressing

484

ACE2 and plated on 12-well plate. Multinucleated syncytia were observed 24 h after the

485

cells were mixed.

486

Sequence analysis

487

Multiple alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences of the spike gene of

488

coronaviruses and ACE2 orthologs were performed using Clustal X (62). Phylogenetic

neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in MEGA X. The tree is drawn to scale with

491

branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of domain structures and critical ACE2-binding
residues of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. SP: signal peptide. NTD: Nterminal domain. RBD: receptor-binding domain. RBM: receptor-binding motif. FP:
fusion peptide. TM: transmembrane domain. CT: cytoplasmic tail. The S protein is
cleaved into S1 and S2 subunit during biogenesis at the polybasic furin cleavage site
(RRAR), which is not present in SARS-CoV and other animal SARS-CoV-2-like
CoVs. The S1 subunit is required for binding to ACE2 receptor, while the S2 subunit
containing a FP mediates membrane fusion. In SARS-CoV-2, the S1 contains NTD and
an independently folded domain known as RBD, which harbors a region called receptor
binding motif (RBM), that are primarily in contact with receptor. The most critical
hACE2-binding residues in the RBM of several SARS-CoV-2-related CoVs are
highlighted in yellow and referred from the crystal structure of RBD-hACE2 complex
(Shang et al, Nature). PCoV-GX: pangolin CoV isolate GX-PL4. PCoV-GD: pangolin
CoV isolate MP789. The only difference in the RBM between PCoV-GD and
SARS-CoV-2 is Q498H (underlined). The GenBank No. for these CoVs is:
SARS-CoV-2 (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, MN908947), SARS-CoV (isolate Tor2,
NC_004718.3), bat-ZC45 (MG772933.1), bat-RaTG13 (MN996532.1), PCoV-GX

Fig. 2. Human ACE2 served as receptor for SARS-CoV-2. (A) ACE2 supported
HIV-Luc-based pseudotyped virus entry. 293T cells were transfected with empty vector
pcDNA3.1, APN (receptor for HCoV-229E), DDP4 (receptor for MERS-CoV), ACE1
or ACE2. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 S protein
pseudotyped virus (SARS-CoV-2pp). At 48 h post infection, luciferase activity was
measured. (B) Human ACE2 antibody inhibited virus entry at a dose-dependent manner.

293T cells were transfected with ACE2. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were
pre-incubated with indicated concentration of hACE2 antibody or control antibody
(anti-IDE) for 1 h, and then infected by pseudotyped virus of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza
virus A (IAVpp) or human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (HCoV-OC43pp) in the presence
of indicated concentration of hACE2 antibody or control antibody (anti-IDE) for
another 3 h, then the virus and antibodies were removed. At 48 h post infection,
luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the control antibody for
SARS-CoV-2pp. Error bars reveal the standard deviation of the means from four
biological repeats. (C) Syncytia formation assay. 293T cells transfected with a plasmid
the expressing S protein of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with
those cells transfected with a plasmid expressing ACE1 or ACE2. Twenty-four hours
later, syncytia formation was recorded.

Fig. 4. Phylogenetic clustering of ACE2s correlates with their receptor activities.
Upper panel: phylogram tree of 14 ACE2s. The tree was constructed based on
nucleotide sequences using the Neighbor-joining method implemented in program
MEGA X. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree
was rooted by ACE2 of platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). The taxonomic orders
where these animals are classified are shown on the right-hand side of the tree. Lower
panel: a heat bar summarizing the relative levels of pseudotyped virus entry supported
by different animal ACE2s.
