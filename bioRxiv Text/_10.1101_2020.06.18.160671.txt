Abstract

26
27

Human coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses which cause respiratory

28

diseases ranging in severity from the seasonal common cold to SARS and COVID-19. Of the 7

29

human coronaviruses discovered to date, 3 emergent and severe human coronavirus strains

30

(SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have recently jumped to humans in the last 20

31

years. The COVID-19 pandemic spawned by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has

32

highlighted the importance for development of effective therapeutics to target emerging

33

coronaviruses. Upon entry, the replicase genes of coronaviruses are translated and subsequently

34

proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. Of these proteases, nonstructural protein 5

35

(nsp5, Mpro, or 3CLpro), mediates the majority of these cleavages and remains a key drug target

36

for therapeutic inhibitors. Efforts to develop nsp5 active-site inhibitors for human coronaviruses

37

have thus far been unsuccessful, establishing the need for identification of other critical and

38

conserved non-active-site regions of the protease. In this study, we describe the identification of

39

an essential, conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 interdomain loop (IDL) of mouse

40

hepatitis virus (MHV), a common coronavirus replication model. Using site-directed

41

mutagenesis and replication studies, we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-

42

shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-

43

sensitivity. Structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses,

44

including all 7 human coronaviruses, suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this

45

horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new, non-active-site regulatory

46

region of the nsp5 (3CLpro) protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors.

Importance

49
50

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans and triggered a

51

pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across

52

more than 180 countries and territories (June 2020). SARS-CoV-2 represents the third emergent

53

coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans

54

remains certain. Critically, there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of

55

COVID-19. The coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded

56

enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design. However, past attempts to target the

57

active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-

58

active-site targets for therapeutic development. This study describes the discovery of a novel

59

conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)

60

which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development.

Introduction

63
64

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses which encode among the

65

largest RNA virus genomes on the planet and infect a wide range of organisms including

66

humans. To date, 7 human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified, which include 4 HCoVs

67

associated with seasonal common colds (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-

68

HKU1) and 3 novel emerging coronaviruses associated with lower respiratory diseases and

69

significant mortality (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) (1). In December 2019, the

70

first case of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. Caused by

71

a new emerging human coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2, this coronavirus likely emerged

72

from bats and triggered a current worldwide pandemic resulting in over 8 million infections and

73

over 400,000 deaths at the time of this writing (June 2020) (2). To date, there remains no

74

commercially available vaccine for human coronaviruses and exhaustive efforts globally are

75

underway to rapidly produce vaccines and effective therapeutic options to prevent and treat

76

human coronavirus infections.

77
78

Coronaviruses encode positive-strand RNA (+ssRNA) genomes that range in size from 27 kb to

79

32 kb and represent among the largest RNA genomes (1, 3). During coronavirus infections,

80

attachment and fusion of the virus are triggered by the viral Spike attachment protein (4–6).

81

Upon entry and uncoating, the replicase open-reading frames of the virus, which encode up to 16

82

nonstructural proteins (nsps) are translated to form two variant polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab)

83

(Fig. 1A) (7–11) . These polyproteins must undergo proteolytic cleavage by virus-encoded

84

proteases, papain-like protease(s) (PLPs) and the nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), to yield the

85

mature replication machinery of the virus (1, 12–14).

86
87

Coronavirus protease nsp5 (Mpro, 3CLpro) is a cysteine protease which is conserved in both

88

overall structure and function among all coronaviruses identified to date (13, 15–17). Since its

89

initial discovery, nsp5 has continued to be a primary target for design of coronavirus inhibitors

90

and therapeutics. Nsp5 consists of three domains with domains 1 and 2 forming a chymotrypsin-

91

like fold housing the His-Cys catalytic dyad and active site and a more divergent third domain

92

promoting stabilization of the chymotrypsin-like fold and mediating nsp5 dimerization, an

93

important event to complete 3CLpro maturation processing (Fig. 1C) (18–21). Connecting

94

domains 2 and 3 is a 16 amino acid interdomain loop (IDL) which is a conserved feature in every

95

nsp5 structure resolved to date (Fig. 1B and 1D). Several recent studies using X-ray structures

96

have suggested that residues located in the IDL form parts of the S2 – S4 substrate binding

97

pockets for several human nsp5 proteases (22–25). Furthermore, biochemical modeling and

98

docking of active site inhibitors to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the recent SARS-CoV-2

99

3CLpro proteases have suggested that engagement between residues found within the nsp5 IDL

100

are critical for increasing affinity and inhibitory activity of active site inhibitors (24–26). Despite

101

these biochemical studies and predictive models, there has yet to be any studies which have

102

evaluated the function of the nsp5 IDL in a replicating virus. We hypothesize that the

103

coronavirus nsp5 IDL represents an important structural and regulatory region of the protease.

104
105

In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate how specific changes within the

106

nsp5 IDL of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), an established replication model for coronavirus

107

study, impact overall virus replication (27). These studies provide the first detailed analysis of

108

this conserved and important region of the nsp5 protease and may provide a new target for the

109

development of coronavirus nsp5 inhibitors.

described (28, 29). Virus experiments were performed in murine delayed brain tumor 9 (DBT-9)

118

cells, which are naturally permissive to MHV-A59 infection, and baby hamster kidney cells

119

which express the MHV receptor (BHK-R) under selection with 0.8 mg/ml of G418. Complete

120

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM, VWR) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

121

serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, and an antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Corning) containing penicillin,

122

streptomycin, and amphotericin B, was used for growth of both DBT-9 and BHK-R cells. All

123

biochemical experiments were carried out using rabbit polyclonal anti-nsp8 antisera previously

124

described (29).

125
126

Site-directed mutagenesis and recovery of MHV nsp5 IDL mutant viruses. The MHV

127

infectious clone (MHVic) reverse genetics system used for the attempted recovery of the nsp5

128

IDL mutant viruses has been previously described by Yount et al (30). In brief, the nsp5 IDL

129

mutations were engineered into the MHVic C fragment using a PCR-based approach with sense

130

and antisense primers containing overlapping nucleotide changes corresponding to the desired

131

amino acid changes in the nsp5 IDL. The MHVic C fragment sequences were all sequence

132

confirmed prior to MHVic assembly, which involved the ligation of digested and gel purified

133

cDNA fragments, in vitro transcription of the ligated cDNA (along with a N-gene containing

134

cDNA) using an mMachine T7 transcription kit (Ambion), and subsequent electroporation into

135

BHK-R cells. All virus recovery attempts were made at least 3 times and recovered viruses were

136

expanded in DBT-9 cells and sequence confirmed before analysis.

137

Viral replication assays and efficiency of plating (EOP) analysis. To evaluate viral replication

139

kinetics, DBT-9 cells were grown to near confluency (~90 - 100%) in 6-well plates prior to

140

infection with a virus multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU/cell at either 37°C or 40°C.

141

Throughout the replication time course, aliquots of virus were obtained and prewarmed media

142

added back to ensure a constant volume. Virus titers were determined in duplicate by plaque

143

assay on DBT-9 cells as previously described (29). Efficiency of plating (EOP) values were

144

determined as the ratio of calculated titers by plaque assay at two different temperatures (40°C

145

and 37°C) for the same aliquot of virus.

146
147

Western blot analysis of nsp5 protease activity. DBT-9 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.5

148

with virus and cell lysates harvested in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% Sodium

149

deoxycholate, and 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) at 8 h p.i. Lysates were separated on a 4 – 15%

150

polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and blotted using an MHV nsp8-specific

151

rabbit primary antibody, anti-nsp8 (VU123) (29). Western blots were resolved using an HRP-

152

conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad).

153
154

Reversion analysis. A plaque assay was performed at 40°C in DBT-9 cells. After visible

155

plaques had formed, 10 plaques were picked and were individually expanded in T25 flasks of

156

confluent DBT-9 cells. At approximately 70 – 90% syncytial involvement, the viral RNA was

157

isolated and used for sequencing of the nsp5 coding region.

158
159

Sequence and structural analyses. The nsp5 IDL sequences of MHV-A59 and all 7 HCoVs

160

were aligned using CLUSTALW and analyzed for sequence conservation using WebLogo (31).

Structural analysis of coronavirus nsp5 proteases was performed using PyMol (The PyMOL

162

168

Statistical analyses. Differences in viral replication were evaluated by fitting the replication

169

curves to logistic growth models. The replication curve data were log transformed and a three-

170

parameter model was fit to each temperature condition by least squares (40, 41). Parameter

171

estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each mutant strain. The parameters

172

evaluated were maximum slope (replication rate), inflection point (time to maximal replication),

173

and maximum titer. Strain parameter estimates with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals

174

were significantly different (p<0.05). EOP data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with viral

175

strain as the main effect. Post-hoc analysis was conducted using Tukey’s HSD to determine

176

differences between strains. The data were log transformed to meet the assumptions of ANOVA

177

but represented as non-transformed values for ease of interpretation. All statistical analysis were

178

performed using JMP (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Site-directed mutagenesis of the MHV nsp5 IDL reveals several residues and IDL

184

modifications which fail to tolerate alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The MHV nsp5

185

interdomain loop (IDL) is comprised of 16 amino acids from P184 to T199. To assess the roles

186

and contributions of the different residues and regions of the IDL to the nsp5 protease activity,

187

we used a combination of alanine-scanning mutagenesis and C-terminal additions and deletions

188

to initially mutate the MHV nsp5 IDL (Table 1). Of the 16 amino acids comprising the loop, a

189

total of 8 virus mutants were successfully recovered (P184A, R186A, A188I, V190I, V191I,

190

P194A, Q196A, and Y198A), 5 amino acid residues failed to permit virus recovery despite

191

multiple attempts at rescue (Y185A, D187A, Q189A, Q192A, and T199A), and 3 amino acid

192

residues were not evaluated (L193, V195, and D197). Among the unrecovered mutants,

193

additional attempts to rescue using more conservative amino acid substitutions at residues D187

194

(D187E) and Q192 (Q192N) were also unsuccessful. A total of four different C-terminal

195

modifications were also attempted, which included 2 different C-terminal additions (a

196

duplication of residues 197 - 199 and a duplication of residue 199) and 2 different C-terminal

197

deletions (a deletion of residues 197 – 199 and a deletion of residue 199). All four of these C-

198

terminal modifications to the nsp5 IDL failed to permit virus recovery.

199
200

Analyses of plaque formation, replication, and protease activity reveal a novel

201

temperature-sensitive mutant in the MHV nsp5 IDL. To evaluate the replication kinetics of

202

each of the recovered MHV nsp5 IDL mutants, we infected confluent DBT-9 cells with an MOI

203

of 0.01 of each of the IDL mutants and titered aliquots over a 24 h period (Fig. 2A). All 8

204

recovered MHV IDL mutants exhibited indistinguishable replication kinetics compared to WT

205

MHV. Previously, we described a total of 3 separate temperature-sensitive mutations (tsV148A,

206

tsS133A, and tsF219L) in the MHV nsp5 protease whose phenotypes could be suppressed

207

through long-distance second-site suppressor mutations (28, 29, 42). To evaluate whether any of

208

the recovered MHV nsp5 IDL mutants may exhibit a temperature-sensitive phenotype, we

9

209

performed an efficiency of plating (EOP) analysis by comparing the titers of each IDL virus by

210

plaque assay determined at a physiologic (37°C) and elevated temperature (40°C) (Fig. 3A).

211

Average EOP values were determined by the average ratios of titers at 40°C compared to 37°C,

212

with those EOP values less than 10-1 indicating a greater than 10-fold reduction in titers at the

213

elevated temperature as being temperature-sensitive (ts). WT MHV exhibited an average EOP of

214

7.6 x 10-1. In contrast, previously described ts nsp5 mutant virus S133A, exhibited an average

215

EOP of 1.49 x 10-4, consistent with the EOP previously reported (29). Two separate MHV nsp5

216

IDL mutants exhibited average EOP values less than 10-1 and were significantly lower than WT

217

MHV (p<0.05): P184A and R186A. Mutant P184A exhibited an average EOP of 1.39 x 10-2. In

218

contrast, IDL mutant R186A resulted in a much lower average EOP of 7.6 x 10-4, which was not

219

significantly different from the known ts mutant S133A. No other IDL mutants exhibited average

220

EOPs significantly different from WT MHV. These data suggested that mutagenesis of two

221

separate IDL residues (P184A and R186A) have resulted in novel temperature-sensitive

222

phenotypes. To determine whether the observed differences in phenotype for IDL mutants

223

P184A and R186A are due specifically to defects in nsp5 protease activity or some other long-

224

distance effect, we performed a Western blot to evaluate the ability for the P184A and R186A

225

nsp5 proteases to process the maturation cleavage of a downstream replicase (pp1ab) protein,

226

nsp8, during virus replication (Fig. 3B). Lysates from WT-, P184A-, and R186A-infected DBT-9

227

cells were compared for nsp5-mediated nsp8 processing at 37°C compared to 40°C. WT-MHV

228

and P184A exhibited approximately equivalent levels (ratios of 1.08 and 0.99, respectively) of

229

nsp8 protein detected at both temperatures. Consistent with its temperature-sensitive EOP, virus

230

mutant R186A exhibited reduced nsp8 protein detected at 40°C compared to 37°C (ratio of 0.78)

231

and when normalized to WT, exhibited an approximate 27% reduction in mature nsp8 protein

232

produced at the elevated temperature. These data demonstrate that MHV nsp5 IDL mutation

233

R186A is associated with reduced nsp5 activity at 40°C, whereas no appreciable difference in

234

processing at 40°C was detected for mutant P184A.

235
236

To assess the impact of elevated temperature on replication of the recovered MHV IDL mutant

237

viruses, we repeated the MOI 0.01 replication assay in DBT-9 cells at 40°C (Fig. 2B). In contrast

238

to replication at 37°C, the replication kinetics among the MHV IDL strains were far more

239

variable, with most strains exhibiting a delay in logarithmic growth compared to WT MHV.

240

Mutant P184A, which had shown a temperature-sensitive EOP of 1.39 x 10-2, failed to exhibit

241

replication kinetics that were significantly different for wild-type or the other MHV IDL strains.

242

In contrast, mutant strain R186A showed significantly delayed replication kinetics to reach the

243

maximal logarithmic growth rate (p<0.05) compared to WT MHV consistent with its

244

temperature-sensitive EOP of 7.6 x 10-4. Collectively, these data indicate that mutant R186A

245

exhibits both significantly reduced capacity to form plaques and delayed replication kinetics at

246

the elevated temperature of 40°C compared to WT MHV.

247
248

Reversion analysis of ts MHV nsp5 IDL mutant R186A reveals three compensatory second-

249

site suppressor mutations. To identify potential interacting residues and novel regulatory

250

networks within the MHV nsp5 protease associated with residue R186, we performed reversion

251

analysis at 40°C by expanding and sequencing formed plaques at the inhibitory temperature (Fig.

252

4A). A total of 10 plaques were selected at expanded in T25 flasks for virus collection and

253

sequencing. Of these, 6 of these plaques resulted in the original R186A mutant virus while 3 of

254

these plaques yielded R186A in addition to one of each of three different second-site putative

11

255

suppressor mutations in nsp5: P184S, L141V, and L141I (Fig. 4B). Additional sequencing was

256

performed on these 3 recovered viruses throughout the ORF1ab coding region and no other

257

mutations were identified. The P184S mutation arose within the MHV nsp5 IDL, while residue

258

L141 is located on the same loop housing the C145 catalytic residue of the active site.

259
260

To evaluate whether the emergence of these second-site suppressor mutations aids in viral

261

growth at 40°C, an EOP analysis was performed using these viruses at 37°C and 40°C (Fig. 4C).

262

Consistent with earlier analysis, the R186A IDL mutant exhibited a temperature-sensitive and

263

significantly reduced EOP (1.56 x 10-3) compared to WT MHV (0.60) (p<0.001). However, all 3

264

second-site suppressor mutant viruses (R186A/P184S, R186A/L141V, and R186A/L141I)

265

resulted in indistinguishable EOP values (0.62, 0.78, and 0.33, respectively) from WT. These

266

data collectively demonstrate that the addition of the second-site suppressor mutations was able

267

to compensate for the initial defects in plaque formation associated with the primary R186A IDL

268

mutation.

269
270

The nsp5 IDL contains a structurally-conserved novel horseshoe region in the N-terminal

271

region of the loop of human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. To

272

understand the structure and function of the IDL, we compared available crystal structures of

273

human coronaviruses with MHV. To date, 6 of the 7 human coronavirus nsp5 proteases have

274

been crystallized and resolved. We aligned these crystal structures along with MHV nsp5 and a

275

modelled structure of HCoV-OC43 (Fig. 5A). Consistent with earlier studies, there was a high

276

degree of conservation among domains 1 and 2 for all 8 of the proteases evaluated (most notably

277

in and around the protein’s active site) (42). In contrast, domain 3 exhibited far more structural

278

variability. The nsp5 IDL structure showed a high degree of structural similarity throughout

279

including around a horseshoe shaped region in the N-terminus of the loop forming the inner and

280

bottom part of the binding pocket for residues P2 – P5 of the substrate (Fig. 5A and B).

281

Modeling using the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2, residues D187 and T188 formed a distinct

282

pocket in and around the P2 residue of Leu, residues T188 and Q189 establish the back wall of

283

the P3 binding pocket, and residues Q189, T190, and Q192 are responsible for forming the back

284

(Q189 and T190) and base (Q192) of the P4 and P5 binding pockets.

285
286

Among the MHV IDL mutants which failed to rescue were D187A, Q189A, and Q192A. Amino

287

acid residues D187 and Q192 are structurally conserved in all sequenced nsp5 proteases to date

288

(Fig. 1B). Both D187 and Q192 are located in a conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the N-

289

terminus of the IDL. The D187 side chain projects from the top of the horseshoe-shaped region

290

towards domain 1 and the protease active site and forms the inner wall pocket for the P2 binding

291

site. In an alignment of the D187 residues of MHV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-

292

2, the positioning and orientation of the side chain are highly conserved with predicted polar

293

contacts with two additional highly conserved residues R40 (which is immediately adjacent to

294

the catalytic H41) and Y54 (Fig. 5C). The Q192 side chain is conserved in its positioning

295

towards the center of the horseshoe-shaped region where it shares predicted polar contacts with

296

several other IDL residues including A188 and R186 (in MHV), R186 and R188 (in SARS-CoV-

297

2), K191 (in MERS-CoV), and T190 (in SARS-CoV) (Fig. 5D).The coordination of Q192 with

298

the backbone amino and carboxyl groups of R186 is conserved across all 4 viruses suggesting a

299

potential role for the newly-identified temperature-sensitive residue. Collectively, these data

Discussion

305
306

The coronavirus nsp5 protease remains a leading target for the development of inhibitor drug

307

development. Over the last two decades, there have now been 3 emergent coronavirus outbreaks

308

(including the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic) which collectively highlight both the importance

309

for rapid development of effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19, but also the need

310

to be prepared for potential future coronavirus outbreaks. In the present study, we evaluated the

311

structure and function of the nsp5 protease IDL, a poorly studied and structurally conserved

312

region of the protease. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that some residues and

313

regions of the protease were capable of accepting mutations without apparent defects in viral

314

replication, however a number of residues mostly located within a horseshoe-shaped region in

315

the N-terminus of the protease either failed to permit virus recovery or resulted in a viral

316

temperature-sensitivity. Of the 16 amino acid residues comprising the loop, we were able to

317

successfully recover viral mutants at 8 different locations (Table 1).

318
319

Despite the overall structural conservation of the entirety of the loop, the majority of these

320

mutations resulted in no apparent defects in viral replication compared to WT. A few of these

321

residues (A188, V190, and V191) with no apparent viral defects are known to form the basis of

322

part of the P3 - P5 substrate binding pockets of the protease (24, 26). Yet, compared to the rest of

14

323

the IDL, these residue positions showed among the least sequence conservation (Figure 1B),

324

which may explain the plasticity with which these residues could tolerate mutagenesis as well as

325

cleavage site variability among coronaviruses (16). Similarly, more C-terminal residues P194,

326

Q196, and Y198 are also found in more variable sequence locations within the IDL. Collectively,

327

these 8 residue positions may simply represent flexible linker residues than serving additional

328

structural supportive or enzymatic roles within the protease.

329
330

Residues P184 and R186, while rescued when mutated to alanine amino acids, exhibited reduced

331

capacity to form plaques at 40°C. P184 is found at a bend leading into the horseshoe shaped

332

region of the IDL and may be responsible for helping stabilize the N-terminal anchor of the loop

333

within domain 2. Replication analysis and Western blots of the P184A mutant virus failed to

334

show significant differences from WT MHV, however the selection of a P184S mutation in

335

reversion analysis of R186A may suggest that these two residues represent stabilizing and

336

interacting nodes within the protease (Figure 4B). We previously described 3 different

337

temperature-sensitive mutations in MHV-A59 (S133A, V148A, and F219L) which all shared

338

overlapping compensatory second-site suppressor mutations (28, 29, 42). All 3 viruses selected

339

for an H134Y mutation, while the temperature-sensitive V148A mutation selected for an S133N

340

mutation. Furthermore, second-site mutations were identified for F219L which were located

341

greater than 20 Å away from the initial mutation. P184A is located on an adjacent loop in

342

domain 2 to both S133 and H134 (less than 6 Å) in distance (not shown). MHV viral mutant

343

R186A was found to exhibit delayed replication kinetics (Figure 2), reduced capacity to form

344

plaques (Figure 3), and reduced nsp5-mediated proteolytic processing at the elevated

345

temperature of 40°C, consistent with a temperature-sensitive phenotype (Figure 3). Perhaps

346

surprising, the R186 residue position was the most variable and least conserved structurally

347

among all 7 HCoVs evaluated (Figure 1B). Structural analysis of the MHV, SARS-CoV, SARS-

348

CoV-2, and MERS-CoV revealed that the side chain of the 100% conserved Q192 appears to

349

form conserved polar interactions with the backbone amino and carboxyl termini of the residue

350

186 position (Figure 5D). These data may suggest that Q192 is stabilized within the horseshoe

351

shaped region of the IDL through anchoring to the residue 186 position immediately across from

352

it. In addition, the selection of a compensatory change in the P184 position during reversion

353

analysis would support a role of both the 184 and 186 residue positions in mediating loop

354

stabilization. In addition to a P184S second-site suppressor mutation, two additional mutations

355

(L141V and L141I) were also each associated with compensating for the R186A temperature-

356

sensitivity (Figure 4B). Residue L141 is part of a well-characterized 3-residue loop (S139 –

357

L141) that forms part of the S1 subsite of the protease and transitions into a short 310-helix

358

triggering an inactive conformation that has been shown in SARS-CoV serving as a putative

359

enzymatic switch from inactive to active conformations. Introducing a L141T mutation into an

360

inactive SARS-CoV triple mutant (G11A/R298A/Q299A) resulting restoration of nsp5 protease

361

activity (20, 43). These earlier studies suggest that L141, helps regulate substrate accessibility to

362

the active site. I141, one of the residues selected for by R186A in MHV, is the wild-type residue

363

in two different a-CoVs: HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. The selection for a mutation at this

364

residue position to restore full activity of R186A at 40°C may indicate that the protease

365

experienced instability in or around the active site and substrate binding pocket of the protease.

366
367

There were 5 IDL residues which failed to permit MHV mutant virus rescue (Y185A, D187A/E,

368

Q189A, Q192A/N, and T199A) (Table 1). Residue T199, while far more variable, is located at

16

369

the C-terminal end of the IDL and efforts to modify this region by either additions or deletions

370

were not tolerated. These data may suggest an important role of T199 in stabilizing the base and

371

positioning of the IDL. Comparatively, four of these residue positions (185, 187, 189, and 192)

372

show a high level of amino acid conservation with two of these residues (D187 and Q192) being

373

100% conserved across all known coronavirus nsp5 protease sequences to date (Figure 1B). All

374

four of these residues are found within a conserved horseshoe-shaped region within the N-

375

terminus of the nsp5 IDL. We propose that this horseshoe-shaped region is a critical region of

376

the protease for both structure and function based on the following observations: (1) A total of 6

377

different residues either failed to tolerate mutagenesis (Y185, D187, Q189, and Q192) or resulted

378

in altered phenotypes under elevated temperatures (P184 and R186); (2) Biochemical analysis

379

and predictive structural modeling indicates that multiple residues including D187 – Q192 are

380

involved in forming the P2 – P5 substrate binding pockets; (3) Predicted polar interactions

381

shown here between D187 and conserved domain 1 residues R40 and Y54 appear to stabilize the

382

positioning of the loop which is conserved in all nsp5 protease structures to date; and (4)

383

Reversion analysis of temperature-sensitive IDL mutant R186A selected for two separate

384

mutations at residue L141, which is known to regulate substrate accessibility to the active site

385

and enzymatic activation. Previous biochemical analyses have suggested that next-generation

386

coronavirus nsp5 inhibitors need to coordinate with the P2 – P5 substrate binding site to increase

387

affinity and efficacy. The IDL data presented here support this idea and highlights a novel,

388

conserved region found in all 7 HCoVs to date, including the recent emerging and pandemic

389

SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 1: MHV nsp5 (3CLpro)-mediated polyprotein processing and conservation of

549

structure and sequence of the nsp5 IDL. (A) Upon entry of the +ssRNA genome of MHV into

550

cells, the first open-reading frame (ORF1) encoding the replicase machinery is translated into

551

two variant polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) which undergo maturation cleavages by 3 viral

552

encoded proteases (papain-like proteases 1 (PLP1, black) and 2 (PLP2, blue) and nsp5 (3CLPro,

553

red)). The cleavage sites are marked by arrows with colors corresponding to the protease

554

mediating each cleavage. (B) Sequence alignment (top) and sequence logo (bottom) of the MHV

555

and 7 HCoV nsp5 IDL sequences. Residues D187 and Q192 are 100% conserved (in bold) in all

556

known coronavirus nsp5 sequences identified to date. The sequence logo was generated using

557

WebLogo with amino acid conservation represented in the height of each letter and the overall

558

height of the amino acids represented in the position (31). (C) Crystal structure of an MHV nsp5

559

monomer and dimer (PDB - 6JIJ) with domains 1 (D1, red), 2 (D2, blue), 3 (D3, gray) and the

560

D2-D3 IDL (green) color coded. (D) Expanded view of the MHV nsp5 IDL with the individual

561

amino acids comprising the loop labeled along with the H41-C145 catalytic dyad residues.

564

Confluent monolayers of DBT-9 cells were infected with an MOI = 0.01. Aliquots of viral

565

supernatant were obtained over 24 h post-infection (h p.i.) and viral titers were determined by

566

plaque assay in DBT-9 cells at 37°C. Data points in each graph represent the average titer ± SEM

567

for 2 experimental replicates (A) or 5 experimental replicates (B). The limit of detection is

568

shown by a black dashed line and titers at or below the limit of detection were reported as equal

570

maximal replication rate with statistically significant times compared to WT indicated (***,

Figure 3: Efficiency of plating (EOP) and Western blot analysis of MHV nsp5 IDL mutant

574

viruses. (A) Plaque assays were performed in confluent monolayers of DBT-9 to determine the

575

capacity of each virus to form plaques at 37°C and 40°C. The efficiency of plating (EOP) was

576

determined as the ratio of titers at 40°C to 37°C for an identical stock. The data shown reflect the

577

average EOP ± SEM (N = 3). Significant differences from WT are indicated by asterisks (***,

578

p<0.05, one-way ANOVA). (B) A Western blot was performed using mock or virus-infected

579

lysates (WT, P184A, and R186A) which were harvested 8 h p.i. from DBT-9 cells infected at an

580

MOI = 0.5. The protein lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane,

581

and blotted for mature nsp8 (which undergoes maturation cleavage mediated by nsp5 protease)

582

using anti-nsp8 antisera (VU123). Molecular weight markers are shown to the left of the bands.

583

The average nsp8 band intensities (N = 2) were quantified using ImageJ and the ratios of nsp8

584

detected at 40°C to 37°C were reported for each virus as well as when normalized to the ratio for

585

WT MHV. The two panels of the Western blot shown are from the same gel at the same

586

exposure with irrelevant bands cropped out.

Figure 4: Reversion analysis of MHV nsp5 IDL mutant virus R186A. (A) Confluent

589

monolayers of DBT-9 cells were infected with serially diluted mutant R186A for plaque

590

formation at 40°C. A total of 10 plaques were picked and virus expanded at 40°C in T25 (25

591

cm2) flasks until approximately 30 – 50% involvement in syncytia. Viral RNA was isolated and
