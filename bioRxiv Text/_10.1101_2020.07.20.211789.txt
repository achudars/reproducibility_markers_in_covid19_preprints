Abstract:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that seriously endangers human health. There is an urgent
need to build physiological relevant human models for deep understanding the complex organ-level
disease processes and facilitating effective therapeutics for COVID-19. Here, we first report the use
of microengineered alveolus chip to create a human disease model of lung injury and immune
responses induced by native SARS-CoV-2 at organ-level. This biomimetic system is able to
reconstitute the key features of human alveolar-capillary barrier by co-culture of alveolar epithelial
and microvascular endothelial cells under microfluidic flow. The epithelial cells on chip showed
higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection than endothelial cells identified by viral spike protein
expression. Transcriptional analysis showed distinct responses of two cell types to SARS-CoV-2
infection, including activated type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway in epithelium and activated
JAK-STAT signaling pathway in endothelium. Notably, in the presence of circulating immune cells, a
series of alveolar pathological changes were observed, including the detachment of endothelial cells,
recruitment of immune cells, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β
and TNF-α). These new findings revealed a crucial role of immune cells in mediating lung injury
and exacerbated inflammation. Treatment with antiviral compound remdesivir could suppress viral
copy and alleviate the disruption of alveolar barrier integrity induced by viral infection. This
bioengineered human organ chip system can closely mirror human-relevant lung pathogenesis and
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, not possible by other in vitro models, which provides a
promising and alternative platform for COVID-19 research and preclinical trials.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic broke out in late 2019 and quickly became a global
epidemic [1-4]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus
of COVID-19, has infected over ten million individuals up to July 2020 according to the report from

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.211789; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

World Health Organization (WHO), and the number of patients and deaths are increasing globally.
COVID-19 patients exhibit a broad spectrum of disease progression and multiple clinical features
including fever, dry cough, and ground-glass opacities [5, 6]. Human lung is the primary target for
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by the process ranging from mild syndrome to severe
lung injury and multi-organ failure. Many severe cases of COVID-19 develop progressive
respiratory failure, leading to death due to diffuse alveolar damage, inflammation and pneumonia
[6-9]. Based on pathological features of COVID-19 by biopsy samples, inflammatory infiltration of
mononuclear cells or lymphocytes could be observed in lung interstitial tissues or alveolar cavities [9,
10]. Particularly, previous studies from severe patients have suggested that an excessive
inflammatory cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 often result in aberrant immunopathology
and lethal outcome. However, in-depth mechanism of pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still not clear.
Presently, SARS-CoV-2 infection is studied mostly relying on monolayer cultures of cell lines and
primary tissue cells [11, 12], human organoids [13, 14], and animal models [15, 16]. However, all of
these models have their limitations. For example, monolayer cell cultures are oversimplified and
cannot exhibit the complex structure and functions of human organ-specific microenvironments in
vivo. Human organoids (e.g., lung organoids) can provide multiple cell types and more complex
tissue-specific functions, but they cannot model organ-level features of lung, such as tissue-tissue
interfaces, blood flow, cross-talk between epithelium and endothelium, and immune cell-host
responses, which are essential for the pathological progression of viral infection in pulmonary tissue
in vivo. In addition, animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established for validating
therapeutics of drugs or vaccines [15, 16]. However, given the species difference, their targeted
organs or systemic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significant different from human
individuals. Moreover, the expensive cost, time-consuming process and animal ethics should be
seriously considered. As such, it is highly desirable to develop alternative preclinical models that can
better reflect human-relevant organ pathophysiology and responses to accelerate SARS-CoV-2
research and candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.
Significant advances in bioengineered organs-on-chips technology have made it possible to
reconstruct 3D human organotypic models in vitro by recapitulating the key functions of living
organisms in microfluidic device, such as intestine, heart, liver, lung and kidney [17]. They are able
to model human-relevant organ physiology, holding great potentials for disease studies and drug

testing [18-21]. Here, we first report the establishment of a microengineered human pulmonary
model of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a chip that allows to recapitulate the human relevant lung
pathophysiology and immune responses associated with COVID-19 in vitro. The biomimetic lung
alveolar chip consisted of two channels (alveolar lumen and vascular channels) sandwiched with
extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated porous membrane that enables to the co-culture of human
alveolus epithelial cells, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, and immune cells under
perfused media flow. This device can reproduce the critical features of human alveolar-capillary
barrier by synergistically combining human epithelium-endothelium interactions, 3D ECM and
mechanical fluid cues. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, we systematically analyzed the responses of
distinct cell types to virus by immunostaining and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. With
addition of circulating immune cells in the vascular channel, we examined the pathological changes
of epithelium-endothelium interface and inflammatory responses at virus post-infection, as well as
the potential anti-viral therapeutics. This human-organ-chip offers a robust microsystem to study
human-relevant organ responses to infectious virus, which are difficult to reproduce in other in vitro
models. It provides a new strategy for COVID-19 research and future preclinical trials.

Results
1. Characterization of microengineered human alveolus chip
Lung is the primary target organ in the progress of COVID-19. Human alveoli contained
alveolar-capillary barrier is an important component unit of lung. Alveolar-capillary barrier is
composed of alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells interacting across a 3D ECM, which
plays vital roles in gas exchange and prevention of external hazardous substances invasion or virus
infection (Fig. 1A). Clinical and histopathological evidences suggested alveolar function is seriously
damaged by SARS-CoV-2. In order to create the human lung infection model by SARS-CoV-2 in
vitro, we initially design and construct a biomimetic human alveolus chip in a multilayer
microfluidic device under dynamic culture conditions. The microfluidic device consists of two
channels separated by a thin and porous PDMS membrane coated with ECM (Fig. 1B). The PDMS
membrane allows to form bio-interface and is beneficial to the interactions of upper and bottom cell
layers. The culture chamber permits the perfusion of media flow, which can facilitate nutrients

exchange and waste exclusion.
In this work, human alveolar epithelial type II cell (AT II) line (HPAEpiC) and lung
microvasculature cell line (HULEC-5a) were seeded on the upper and lower side of porous
membrane, separately. These two types of cells were cultured for 3 days until confluent into
monolayers under continuous media flow (50 μl/h) in upper and bottom channels, thus forming an
alveolus epithelium-endothelium tissue interface. The integrity of formed tissue barrier was assessed
by the expression of adherent junction proteins in both human epithelium and endothelium.
Immunostaining analysis showed that epithelial cells could form adherent junctions identified by
E-cadherin, and endothelial cells formed conjunctions identified by VE-cadherin, respectively
(supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, the integrity of barrier under different culture conditions was
assessed by the diffusion rate of FITC-dextran between the two parallel channels (supplementary Fig.
S2). The barrier permeability was lower under fluid flow than that in static cultures, indicating the
important role of flow in maintaining the function and integrity of alveolar-capillary barrier.

2. SARS-CoV-2 infection in human alveolus chip
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a host receptor for cellular entry, and
transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2) for Spike protein priming [12, 22-24]. Prior to create
the SARS-CoV-2 infection model based on human alveolus chip, we sought to identify the
susceptibility of alveolar epithelial cells to this virus. Initially, we examined the expression of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 proteins in HPAEpiC and HULEC-5a cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). The western blot
data showed the positive expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in both cell types [12, 25], and the
higher ACE2 expression in HPAEpiC than HULEC-5a cells. HPAEpiC cells were then infected with
SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 10 in monolayer cultures. At 3 days post-infection, more than 20 % Spike
protein-positive cells were observed (Fig. 2B). To further examine the ultrastructure of
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis of mock- or
SARS-CoV-2-infected HPAEpiC cells were performed (Fig. 2C, D). The TEM micrographs showed
that mock cells exhibited primary AT II cell-like morphological characteristics, including a small
cellular size with square or round shape (Fig. 2C1), microvilli on free surface (Fig. 2C2) and lamellar
bodies within cell body (Fig. 2C3) [26, 27]. In infected cells, lots of viral particles were detected and
distributed in clusters within cell bodies as shown in Fig. 2D, indicating the susceptibility of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.211789; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

HPAEpiC cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To model alveolar infection by SARS-CoV-2, virus was inoculated into the upper alveolus channel
of chip at a MOI of 10, and cell were cultured for 3 days. The predominated expression of spike
protein was observed in epithelial cells, demonstrating the viral infection and massive replication in
alveolar epithelium (Fig. 3A and B), but not in endothelial cells. In addition, there are not obvious
changes in the organization of adherent junction proteins in HPAEpiC cells (E-cadherin) and
HULEC-5a cells (VE-cadherin), as well as the confluent rate of epithelial cells and endothelial cells
(Fig. 3C and D). These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate primarily in the
alveolar epithelial cells, but not in endothelial cells.

3. Transcriptional analysis of host cells responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection
To gain a global understanding of transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed
RNA-seq analysis of HPAEpiC and HULEC-5a cells following virus infection in the alveolus chip.
The ratio of virus-aligned reads over total reads in each sample was calculated to estimate the viral
replication levels in these two cell types. The results showed that the ratio of viral reads was much
higher in infected-HPAEpiC cells than HULEC-5a cells (Fig. 4A and B), which are consistent with
the immunostaining analysis (Fig. 3B). It revealed that human alveolar epithelial cells were more
permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection than microvascular endothelial cells, similar to the
histopathological findings from autopsy reports [28]. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed
SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited broad transcriptional changes in both HPAEpiC and HULEC-5a cells
(Fig. 4C). For identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the cutoffs for the fold change
and P value were set to 2.0 and 0.05, respectively. By combining the two data sets, we found the two
cell types only shared 52 overlapping up-regulated DEGs (6.2% of total up-regulated DEGs) and
only 43 overlapping down-regulated DEGs (5.5% of total down-regulated DEGs) (Fig. 4D). These
results suggested that epithelial and endothelial cells displayed distinct transcriptome responses after
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In general, viral infection can trigger antiviral or immune responses in host cells. We then
performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DEPs related with immune responses, and
tried to identify which host defense responses can be induced after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The GO
enrichment results showed, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced broader immune responses and antiviral

responses in HPAEpiC cells, including defense response to virus, type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling
pathway and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (Fig. 4E). While, in HULEC-5a cells, terms
related with positive regulation of JAK-STAT cascade and adaptive immune response were enriched
(Fig. 4F). Moreover, among up-regulated genes related with immune responses in HULEC-5a cells,
we identified some chemokines, including CCL15-CCL14, CCL15 and CCL23 (supplementary Fig.
S3).

alveolar epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells, including the susceptibility to virus,
immune responses and activated signaling pathway. This indicated the diverse roles of alveolar
epithelial and endothelial cells involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

4. Immune responses in human alveolus chip following SARS-CoV-2 infection
The accumulation and extensive infiltration of immune cells observed in the lungs may contribute
significantly to the pathogenesis in patients infected with respiratory viruses [29]. We next explored
the roles of human circulating immune cells in the alveolar pathological process after SARS-CoV-2
infection. In this study, PBMCs were isolated from healthy human blood and infused into the lower
vascular channel of chip. SARS-CoV-2 was then inoculated into the upper channel at a MOI of 10
and incubated for 2 days. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in alveolar epithelial cells by
Spike protein in the presence of PBMCs (Fig. 5A). Strikingly, in the presence of PBMCs, the
distributions of both E-cadherin and VE-cadherin expressions in human epithelial and endothelial
cells were intensely disrupted after virus infection (Fig. 5A). The obvious disruption of alveolar
barrier function might be due to the involvement of PBMCs during the progress of viral infection.
Furthermore, the cell confluency of human endothelium and epithelium after SARS-CoV-2 infection
were examined on chip with the addition of PBMCs in vascular channel. Notably, the addition of
PBMCs caused a significant decrease of endothelial cell confluency from 90.31±26.91% to 45.92±
8.52% (Fig.5B and C), however, no detectable changes of cell confluency were observed in epithelial
cells. The data reflected the detachment and dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells in the presence
of PBMCs in vascular channel. These results above revealed the crucial role of circulating immune
cells in mediating the damage of alveolar barrier function after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
As above, transcriptional analysis had identified several up-regulated chemokines in endothelial

cells after viral infection, which may be correlated with the recruitment of immune cells and
inflammatory response. Subsequently, we examined the behaviors of circulating immunocytes in the
vascular channel of chip after viral infection. Strikingly, the recruitment and adhesion of PBMCs,
especially CD14+ monocytes were obviously observed on the surface of endothelium layer in the
infected chip (Fig. 5D and E), which was similar to the inflammatory cell infiltration as observed
clinically [9, 30].
To further explore the possible inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 in this alveolus
chip, we examined the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in culture media from the
vascular channel. At 2 days post-infection, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased in
the absence of PBMCs (Fig. 5G and H). Moreover, all four cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α)
were markedly increased following SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of PBMCs (Fig. 5F-I).
Especially, viral infection caused a 10-fold increase in the level of IL-1β and IL-6 (Fig. 5F and G).
We also examined the inflammatory cytokines secretion in culture media from the epithelial layer,
which showed similar results to that from the vascular channel (supplementary Fig. S4). These
results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the recruitment of PBMCs, and aggravated
inflammatory response, which are consistent with clinical findings. It appears this human organ chip
could reflect human relevant pathological changes and host immune response to SARS-CoV-2,
which are difficult to replicate in existing in vitro models.

5. Assessment of potential anti-viral therapeutics of remdesivir
To explore the potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, we treated the virus infected human
alveolus chip with remdesivir. Remdesivir is recognized as a promising antiviral compound against
many RNA viruses (e.g., SARS, MERS-CoV), including SARS-CoV-2 [31-33]. Recent clinical trials
showed remdesivir can shorten the disease course and reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients,
and it has been approved by FDA in US [34]. In this study, an indicated dose of remdesivir (1μM)
was added into the monolayer culture of HPAEpiC cells at 1h post-infection of SARS-CoV-2. After
administration for 3 days, the culture supernatants were collected for virus titers determination by
qRT-PCR. A marked decrease of virus titers was detected in the infected-HPAEpiC cells following
remdesivir treatment (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, we tested the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in the
infected chip model with the addition of PBMCs in the vascular channel. As shown in Figure 6B and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.211789; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

C, remdesivir treatment could restore the damage of epithelial layers and endothelial layer to some
extent (Fig. 6B and C). These results indicated the potential role of remdesivir in suppressing
SARS-CoV-2 replication and alleviating the virus-induced injury of alveolar-capillary barrier. It also
suggested early administration of remdesivir might be helpful for disease control and alleviating lung
injury for COVID-19 patients.

Discussion:
In this study, we created a microengineered human disease model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro
that allowed to recapitulate the pathophysiology and immune responses of alveoli at organ-level. The
biomimetic human chip model closely recapitulated alveolar-capillary barrier injury and
inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as viral replication in human
alveolar epithelium, vascular dysfunction, recruitment of immune cells, and increased inflammatory
cytokine release in a physiological-relevant manner (Fig. 7), which are not be readily modeled in
existing in vitro model systems. Particularly, we found that human circulating immune cells play a
key role in exacerbating inflammatory responses and the injury of alveolar-capillary-barrier induced
by SARS-CoV-2. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, in
which virus-induced inflammatory responses and lung injury were possibly mediated by the complex
and intrinsic cross-talk among epithelium-endothelium interface and immune cells.
As known, the AT II cells have been demonstrated as the primary infected target of SARS-CoV-2
by histopathological studies [35]. In this study, we found human alveolar epithelial cells were more
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than endothelial cells as identified on the chip. Moreover,
transcriptome analysis demonstrated a distinctive response of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells
to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which epithelium exhibited much higher viral load than that of
endothelium as observed on the co-cultured alveolus chip. This may partially explain why
SARS-CoV-2 cannot be easily detected in the blood samples of COVID-19 patients [28]. In addition,
compared with pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells displayed broader
and stronger innate immune responses and antiviral responses following viral infection, such as
IFN-I signaling pathway. A recent study reported IFN-I responsive gene sets are up-regulated in lung
tissues from severe COVID-19 deaths, which might be associated with exacerbated lung

inflammation [36]. It appears our results are in agreement with the clinical results, indicating the
feasibility of the lung infection model to reflect clinically relevant immune response in COVID-19.
Meanwhile, the activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway was observed in pulmonary
microvascular endothelial cells after viral infection. It is well known that cytokines (e.g. IL-6) are
enable to activate JAK-STAT pathway and further regulate different cellular and immune processes
[37, 38]. Ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor could effectively relieve symptoms of patients with severe
COVID-19 [39, 40]. Our findings suggested the potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment
by targeting JAK-STAT signaling pathway in microvascular endothelium.
Clinically, severe COVID-19 patients often display inflammatory cytokine storm that is associated
with excessive immune responses, which may aggravate respiratory failure and cause multi-organ
damage. Circulating cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α are significantly elevated in
patients with severe COVID-19 [41, 42]. Therefore, we detected these cytokines in the alveolus chip
model following viral infection, and the results showed SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers secretions of
these cytokines, and addition of circulating immune cells significantly further increases their level,
accompany by recruitment of immune cells, and more severe damages of epithelium and
endothelium. These data are relevant with pathological manifestations observed in severe patients
with COVID-19 [43, 44]. Our findings revealed the key roles of immune cells in mediating alveolar
injury, microvascular endothelial dysfunction and the excessive inflammatory response at
organ-level.
One potential limitation of this work is the lack of human primary alveolar tissues that contains
multicellular types of pneumocytes, such as alveolar epithelial type I and type II cells as existing in
vivo. In addition, this model has yet to be tried for assessing more other drug candidates for
COVID-19 therapeutics. Despite some limitations, the great value of the human alveolus chip is that
it is capable to model human lung pathophysiology and study host-immune responses to respiratory
viral infection at organ level. In combination with the existing cell-based models, this bioengineered
lung infection model on chip may provide a complement to animal models for evaluating candidate
drugs and repurposing approved drugs to face the crisis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Collectively, this work provides a proof-of-concept to establish a microengineered human disease
model in vitro that enables to closely recapitulate lung pathophysiology and immune responses to
native SARS-CoV-2 infection for the first time. Comprehensive analysis of this infection model

revealed new insights into the pathogenesis associated with COVID-19, in which virus-induced
inflammation is a major contributor lung injury with the involvement of circulating immune cells.
This human organ chip system provided a synthetic strategy to rebuild human organs and analyze
pathological responses at organ level by flexibly varying system parameters, which is opening up
new avenues for COVID-19 research and drug development.

Methods
Device fabrication
The human alveolus chip device consisted of the upper and lower layers fabricated by casting
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pre-polymer on molds prepared using conventional soft lithography
procedures. 10:1 (wt/wt) PDMS base to curing agent (184 Silicone Elastomer, Dow Corning Corp)
was polymerized to produce molded device with channels by thermal curing at 80 °C for 45 min.
The top channel (1.5 mm wide × 0.25 mm high) and bottom channel (1.5 mm wide × 0.25 mm high)
were used to form the alveolus lumen and the microvascular layer, respectively. The length of
overlapping channels was 15 mm. The two channels were separated by a thin (~10 μm) through-hole
PDMS membrane (5 μm pores) to construct tissue-tissue interfaces. The porous PDMS membranes
were fabricated based on the glass templates and spin-coating method modified from the previous
protocol. The membrane was sandwiched between the aligned upper and bottom channels of the
device by oxygen plasma bonding for 30 s. Finally, the chip devices were sterilized in an autoclave
and the porous member of the device was coated with rat tail collagen type I (200 μg/mL, Corning)
on both sides at 37 °C for 48 h before cell seeding.

Cell culture
African green monkey kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells (ATCC, no. 1586) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS,
Gibco). Immortalized human alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) were generated from Type II
pneumocytes of human lung tissue (purchased form Sciencell Shanghai Corporation) and were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. Human lung
microvasculature cell line HULEC-5a was purchased from Procell Corporation and were maintained

in HULEC-5a growth medium (Procell, CM-0565). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
isolated from fresh human blood using Ficoll (Stem cell technologies) density centrifugation.
Isolated PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 50 IU/mL IL-2
and used for adhesion assays on chip. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2.
To create the human alveolus chip, HULEC-5a cells (~ 1×105 cells) were initially seeded on the
bottom side of the collagen-coated porous PDMS membrane and allowed to attach on the membrane
surface under static conditions for two hours. Subsequently, cells were washed with fresh medium to
exclude/remove unattached ones. Then, HPAEpiC cells (~ 5×105 cells) were seeded into the upper
channel under static cultures. After cell attachment, constant media flows (50 μL/h) were applied in
both the upper and bottom layers using peristaltic pump. The cells were grown to confluence for 3
days and the chips were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Virus
A clinical isolate SARS-COV-2 strain 107 was obtained from Guangdong Provincial Center for
Disease Control and Prevention, China, and propagated in Vero E6 cells. The virus titers were
(infectious titers of virus) were determined by a TCID50 assay on Vero cells. All work involving live

SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention-approved
BSL-3 laboratory of the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science.

SARS-CoV-2 Infections
HPAEpiC cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 ×105 cells per well) in RPMI 1640 medium
containing 10% FBS. After seeding for 24h, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 10.
After one hour, cells were washed three times with PBS and kept in fresh medium for 3 days. At day
3 post-infection, cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
before analysis. The culture supernatant was collected for RNA extraction.
For SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human alveolus chip, the apical channel of chip device was
infused with 30 μL of RPMI 1640 medium containing the indicated multiplicity of virus (MOI=10).
After one hour of infection, cells were washed three times with PBS and kept in fresh medium. At

day 3 post-infection, the apical and basal media were collected for analysis of released cytokines. The
HPAEpiC and HULEC-5a cells cultured on chip were fixed for immunofluorescence analysis or
lysed for RNA-seq data analysis, respectively.

Permeability assay
The alveolar-capillary barrier permeability was assessed by detecting the FITC-dextran diffusion rate
from the lower vessel layer to the upper alveolar channel. After a 3-day co-culture, the medium with
FITC-dextran (40 kDa, 1 mg/mL) was then infused into the bottom channel of device. The media
were collected from the upper channel at different time points (0 h, 1 h and 2 h) and the fluorescence
intensity was measured using microplate system (ABI Vii 7).

Western blot analysis
Protein samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto 0.2 μm nitrocellulose
membranes (GE Amersham). After being blocked with 5% BSA in TBST buffer containing 0.05%
Tween-20, the membranes were probed with the anti-ACE2 antibody (1:1000 dilution),
anti-TMPRSS2 antibody (1:1000 dilution) or anti-GAPDH antibody (1:2000 dilution) at 4
overnight. The membranes were then probed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour at room temperature. Protein bands were
detected by Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE life).

Immunostaining
HPAEpiC cells cultured on well plate were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA at 4
overnight. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST buffer) for 5 min
and blocked with PBST buffer containing 5% normal goat serum for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Antibodies were diluted with PBST buffer. Cells were stained with corresponding primary antibodies
at 4°C overnight and with secondary antibodies (supplementary Table S1) at room temperature for 1
hour. After staining with secondary antibodies, cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
For immunofluorescent imaging of alveolus chip, cells were washed with PBS through the upper
and bottom channels and fixed with 4% PFA. The fixed tissues were subjected to
immunofluorescence staining by the same procedure as described above. All images were acquired

using a confocal fluorescent microscope system (Carl zeiss LSM880). Image processing was done
using ImageJ (NIH).

Analysis of inflammatory cytokines
To analyze the released cytokines, the media in the vessel channel were collected from each chip.
The concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α were measured using the corresponding human
ELISA kits (Biolegend, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)
Virus titers were determined by viral RNA detection using qRT-PCR. The culture supernatant for
each condition was harvested for RNA extraction using the HP Viral RNA Kit (Roche, Cat no.
11858882001) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. QRT-PCR was performed using One
Step RT-PCR RNA direct real-time PCR master mix (TOYOBO, QRT-101A) in a PCR System
(Applied Biosystem, ViiA™ 7). The primers of SARS-CoV-2 E gene were as follows: N-F: 5’-GGG
GAA CTT CTC CTG CTA GAA T-3’; N-R: 5’-CAG ACA TTT TGC TCT CAA GCT G-3’;
N-probe: 5’-TTG CTG CTG CTT GAC AGA TT-3’. PCR amplification was performed under the
following conditions: 50 for 10 min, and 95 1min, followed by 45 cycles consisting of 95  for
15 s, 60  for 45 s.

Transmission electron microscopy
HPAEpiC cells were collected and fixed in 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 2.5%
glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at 4 overnight. After washed with PBS for three
times and fixed in 1% OsO4 buffer for 2 h, the samples were dehydrated with graded ethanol
solutions, and embedded in Epon 812 resin (SPI). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were stained with 2%
uranyl acetate for 30 minutes and then lead citrate for 10 mins. Images were acquired with a
JEM-1400 PLUS electron microscope.

Remdesivir treatment
Stock solution of remdesivir (GS-5734) was prepared in DMSO. For HPAEpiC cell cultures on plate,
after SARS-CoV-2 infection for 1 h, cells were treated with or without 1 μM remdesivir for 3 days

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.211789; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

and the supernatants were collected at distinct time points (24 h, 48 h and 72 h) for viral load
analysis by qRT-PCR. For alveolus chip, cells were treated with or without 1 μM remdesivir for 2
days after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of PBMCs. After 48 h, the cells were fixed for
immunofluorescence analysis.

RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing
HPAEpiC cells and HULEC-5a cells were collected separately from the chips, and total RNAs were
extracted from samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the methods by Chomczynski et al. [45].
DNA digestion was carried out after RNA extraction by DNaseI. RNA quality was determined by
examining A260/A280 with NanodropTM OneCspectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc).
RNA Integrity was confirmed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Qualified RNAs were finally
quantified by Qubit3.0 with QubitTM RNA Broad Range Assay kit (Life Technologies). 500 ng total
RNAs were used for stranded RNA sequencing library preparation using KC-DigitalTM Stranded
mRNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (Catalog NO. DR08502, Wuhan SeqHealth Co., Ltd. China)
following the manufacturer’s instruction. The kit eliminates duplication bias in PCR and sequencing
steps, using unique molecular identifier (UMI) of 8 random bases to label the pre-amplified cDNA
molecules. The library products corresponding to 200-500 bps were enriched, quantified and finally
sequenced on Hiseq X 10 sequencer (Illumina).

RNA-seq data analysis
Raw sequencing data was first filtered by Trimmomatic (version 0.36), low-quality reads were
discarded and the reads contaminated with adaptor sequences were trimmed. Clean Reads were
further treated with in-house scripts to eliminate duplication bias introduced in library preparation
and sequencing. In brief, clean reads were first clustered according to the UMI sequences, in which
reads with the same UMI sequence were grouped into the same cluster, resulting in 65,536 clusters.
Reads in the same cluster were compared to each other by pairwise alignment, and then reads with
sequence identity over 95% were extracted to a new sub-cluster. After all sub-clusters were generated,
multiple sequence alignment was performed to get one consensus sequence for each sub-cluster.
After these steps, any errors and biases introduced by PCR amplification or sequencing were
eliminated.

(ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-87/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/) using STAR software (version 2.5.3a)
with default parameters. Reads mapped to the exon regions of each gene were counted by
featureCounts (Subread-1.5.1; Bioconductor) and then RPKMs were calculated. Genes differentially
expressed between groups were identified using the edgeR package (version 3.12.1). A FDR
corrected p-valuecutoff of 0.05 and Fold-change cutoff of 2 were used to judge the statistical
significance of gene expression differences. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of
genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes were both
implemented by KOBAS software (version: 2.1.1) with a corrected P-value cutoff of 0.05 to judge
statistically significant enrichment.

Statistical analyses
Data were collected in Excel (Microsoft). Differences between two groups were analyzed using a
Student’s t-test. Multiple group comparisons were performed using a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by post-hoc tests. The bar graphs with error bars represent mean ± standard
deviation (SD). Significance is indicated by asterisks: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.

Figure 7. Proposed working model for SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and inflammatory
ry
responses based on human alveolus chip. Following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, virus particles invade
de
the alveolar epithelium and endothelium, and replicate violently in human epithelial cells. The viral
ral
infection can activate the host antiviral defense or immune response, including the activation of
innate immune responses (e.g. IFN-I signaling pathway) in epithelial cells and JAK-STAT signaling
ing
pathway in endothelial cells. The released cytokines or chemokines from infected cells can recruit
uit
circulating immune cells (such as CD14+ monocytes) to infected sites and initiate inflammatory
ry
responses. This process further exacerbates the disruption of alveolus-capillary barrier integrity, and
nd
leads to the lung injury.
