ABSTRACT

26

An unaddressed key question in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

27

pandemic is the duration of immunity for which specific T cell responses against the

28

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an indispensable

29

element. Being situated in Wuhan where the pandemic initiated enables us to conduct

30

the longest analyses of memory T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19

31

convalescent individuals (CIs). Magnitude and breadth of SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4

32

and CD8 T cell responses were heterogeneous between patients but robust responses

33

could be detected up to 9 months post disease onset in most CIs. Loss of memory

34

CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were observed in only 16.13% and 25.81% of CIs,

35

respectively. Thus, the overall magnitude and breadth of memory CD4 and CD8 T cell

36

responses were quite stable and not inversely correlated with the time from disease

37

onset. Interestingly, the only significant decrease in the response was found for

38

memory CD4 T cells in the first 6-month post COVID-19 disease onset. Longitudinal

39

analyses revealed that the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 and CD8 T cell

40

responses were quite heterogenous between patients. Loss of memory CD4 T cell

41

responses was observed more frequently in asymptomatic cases than after

42

symptomatic COVID-19. Interestingly, the few CIs in which SARS-CoV-2-specific

43

IgG responses disappeared showed more durable memory CD4 T cell responses than

44

CIs who remained IgG-positive for month. Collectively, we provide the first

45

comprehensive characterization of the long-term memory T cell response in CIs,

46

suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity is long-lasting in the majority

47

of individuals.

Introduction

49

Antigen-specific T and B cell responses play fundamental roles in the clearance of

50

most viral infections. Additionally, the establishment of T and B cell memory after

51

recovery is essential for protecting the host against disease upon re-exposure. Faced

52

by the unprecedented medical and socioeconomic crisis caused by severe acute

53

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus

54

disease 2019 (COVID-19), the scientific community has ignited tremendous efforts to

55

map correlates of protection and determinants of immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

56

While antibody-based immunity is relatively well-studied, increasing evidences

57

suggest that T cells may play a fundamental role in the resolution of COVID-19

58

The current dogma is that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses,

59

responding at variably high frequencies recognizing multiple epitopes across the viral

60

proteome, can be detected in most individuals both during acute COVID-19 and

61

convalescence afterwards

62

responses during the early phase is assumed to correlate with the magnitude of

63

antibody responses, and more severe and protracted disease usually drives a more

64

vigorous and, in terms of epitope coverage, broader T cell response

65

has also been observed that cellular and humoral immune responses can become

66

uncoupled in some SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, who showed strong specific T

67

cell immunity but lack detectable antibody responses 9. It is assumed that this results

68

from antibody responses waning more quickly than T cell responses

69

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are rather short-lived, while T cell memory

memory were mainly generated from individuals recovering from COVID-19 during a

72

relatively short follow-up period the longest observation duration being less than 60

73

days post disease onset (dpdo) 5. To our knowledge, it is not yet known whether

74

natural infections with SARS-CoV-2 generate long-lasting memory T cell responses

75

and how memory T cell responses changes in a long-term post recovery.

76

Wuhan was the very first city hit by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, all patients who

77

experienced the longest phase of convalescence following COVID-19 reside here or

78

closeby. Wuhan also performed a thorough SARS-CoV-2 RNA test for every resident

79

in May, 2020 to preclude the possibility of local spread of the virus ever since. This

80

enabled us to characterize the long-term memory T cell responses in a cohort of

81

COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CIs) with an unprecedented observation time up

82

to 274 dpdo. Our results suggest that robust SARS-CoV-2 memory T cell responses

83

can be detected in the majority of CIs long-term post recovery.

Subjects

86

Thirty-one convalescent individuals who resolved their SARS-CoV-2 infection and 11

87

SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals (UIs) were recruited at the Department of

88

Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of

89

Science and Technology and the Department of Gastroenterology from April to

90

September 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the Guidelines for

91

Diagnosis and Treatment of Corona Virus Disease 2019 issued by the National Health

92

Commission of China (7th edition). Informed written consent was obtained from each

93

patient and the study protocol was approved by the local medical ethics committee of

94

Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and

108

phosphoprotein (N) or the membrane glycoprotein (M) of SARS-CoV-2 were used for

109

110

were resuspended in complete medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% [v/v] fetal calf

116

Biosciences, USA) cells served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Fresh

117

medium containing IL-2 was added on day 4 and 7. On day 10, cells were

118

restimulated for 5 hours with the same peptide pool in the presence of brefeldin A

119

(BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Cells were then tested for IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α

120

expression by intracellular cytokine staining. Specific cytokine responses were

121

calculated by subtracting the background activation (the percentage of cytokine

122

positive cells in the negative control) before further analysis. T cell responses were

123

defined as detectable if the frequency in the specifically stimulated culture exceeded

124

the unstimulated control at least twofold (stimulation index > 2). Samples with

Results

147

Characteristics of the study cohort

148

To characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in

149

individuals who had recovered from COVID-19, blood samples derived from 31 CIs

150

together with 11 UIs were assessed. The demographic profiles of all individuals are

151

shown in Table 1. The median period between disease onset and blood sampling was

152

169 days (range: 83 to 274 days). Among all COVID-19 cases, 56.67% (17/31) were

153

hospitalized and 46.67% (14/31) received oxygen inhalation treatment. Leukopenia

154

and lymphopenia were observed in 52.94% (9/17) and 76.47% (13/17) of tested cases,

155

respectively. Increased C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels were apparent in 70.59%

156

(12/17) and 85.71% (12/14) of tested patients, respectively. Abnormal radiological

157

findings suggesting pneumonia were evident in 74.19% (23/31) CIs by chest

158

computed tomography scans (CT). Sixteen CIs (51.61%) had positive RT-PCR results

159

for viral RNA. All patients were confirmed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG

160

seropositive. At the time of last blood sampling, 45.16% (14/31) were IgG single

161

positive and 29.03% (9/31) were IgM and IgG double positive. Besides, 8 CIs who

162

had become IgG seronegative were purposely recruited to study the interdependence

163

of humoral and cellular immunity. The defining criteria for COVID-19 convalescence

164

were as follows: being afebrile for more than 3 days, resolution of respiratory

165

symptoms, substantial improvement of chest CT images, and two consecutive

166

negative RT-qPCR tests for viral RNA in respiratory tract swab samples obtained at

167

least 24 h apart. At the time of blood sampling, all CIs were negative for viral RNA

Characterization of the long-term memory T cell response specific to SARS-CoV-2

171

PBMCs of UIs and CIs were re-stimulated with 3 panels of overlapping peptides

172

spanning the SARS-CoV-2 proteins S, N, and M, respectively, to determine memory T

173

cell responses ex vivo. We used an intracellular cytokine staining flow cytometry

174

assay (Fig. S1), and the magnitude of the overall cytokine responses [interferon

175

(IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α] for CD4 and CD8 T

176

cells of all participants are shown in Fig. 1a. Besides, the magnitude and breadth (to

177

how many peptide pools T cells responded) of the IFN-γ, IL-2 or TNF-α-positive T

178

cells are also shown individually in Fig. 1b and 1c. Consistent with previous reports

179

4,6

180

CD4 and CD8 T cells: 27.27%, 3/11), but with a much lower magnitude than those in

181

CIs (Fig. 1a-1c). In general, memory T cell responses considerably varied in breadth

182

and magnitude between individual CIs. The magnitudes of TNF-α responses against S,

183

IFN-γ or TNF-α responses against N, and IFN-γ responses against M of CD4 and

184

CD8 T cells were significantly positively correlated (Fig. 1d and S2). Memory CD4 T

185

cell responses against a single, two or three peptide pools of the different proteins

186

were detected in 6.45% (2/31), 19.35% (6/31), and 58.06% (18/31) of CIs,

187

respectively (Fig. 1e). Memory CD8 T cell responses against a single, two or three

188

peptide pools of the different proteins were detected in 29.03% (9/31), 16.13% (5/31),

189

and 29.03% (9/31) of CIs, respectively (Fig. 1f). Interestingly, 16.13% (5/31 for CD4)

, a proportion of T cells weakly responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in UIs (both

190

and 25.81% (8/31 for CD8) of CIs did not exhibit memory T cell responses against

191

the three viral proteins (Fig. 1e and 1f). There were only 9.68% (3/31) of CIs who

192

showed no any detectable memory T cell responses against the three proteins for both

193

CD4 and CD8 T cells. Taken together, while the vast majority of CIs had clearly

194

measurable T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, the data also shows substantial

195

individuality in SARS-CoV-2 memory T cell responses.

196
197

Next, we analyzed the correlation between the magnitude and breadth of the overall

198

SARS-CoV-2 memory T cell responses and the time after disease onset. The CIs were

199

studied up to 9 month after disease onset and we combined the data from all patients

200

for the analysis. In addition, we separately analyzed two different time periods after

201

COVID-19, the first 6 month and the following 3 months for changes in memory T

202

cell responses. For CD4 T cells, the magnitude and breadth of SARS-CoV-2 memory

203

responses against S, N or M showed no significant correlation with days post disease

204

onset (dpdo) (Fig. 2a), suggesting that the CD4 T cell response was relatively stable

205

over time. Interestingly, however, during the first 180 dpdo a significant inverse

206

correlation between the magnitude of the memory CD4 T cell response against S and

207

dpdo was observed (r2=0.480, P=0.003, Fig. 2b). In contrast, during the late

208

convalescent phase between 6 and 9 month after COVID-19 the magnitude of

209

memory CD4 T cell responses against S (r2=0.327, P=0.041) and N (r2=0.328,

210

P=0.041) was positively correlated with dpdo (Fig. 2c). For CD8 T cells, the

211

magnitude and breadth of SARS-CoV-2 memory responses against S, N or M did also

212

not show a significant correlation with dpdo (Fig. 2e). In contrast to CD4 T cells, CD8

213

T cells did not show a biphasic response during the two different time phases after

214

COVID-19 (Fig. 2d-2f). No significant changes in the magnitude or breath of the CD8

215

T cell response to any of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins was observed in the early or late

216

phase, with the only exception that a positive correlation between the breadth of

217

memory CD8 T cell responses and dpdo after 180 days was observed (r2=0.311,

218

P=0.048, Fig. 2f).

219

These results indicated that the overall SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 and CD8 T cell

220

responses were long-lasting. However, for memory CD4 T cells a decline in the

221

magnitude of the response was observed during the early recovery phase which was

222

reversed in the following months, highlighting the need for long-term follow up

223

studies such as this.

224
225

To further characterize the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 memory T cell responses, the

226

magnitude of T cell responses were longitudinally examined in more detail in 4

227

individual CIs. Strong and broad CD4 (in all 4 individuals) and CD8 (3 out of 4

228

individuals) T cell responses against S, N, and M were detected at the first sampling

229

time point (83-127 dpdo, Fig. 3a-3d). In 2 out of 4 individuals, a decrease in the

230

magnitude of both SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses was

231

observed on 147 dpdo and 214 dpdo, respectively (Fig. 3a and 3b), which was most

232

pronounced for the response against the S peptide pool. In contrast, one individual

233

showed sustained SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses over time

234

(Fig. 3c), whereas another individual also showed sustained SARS-CoV-2 memory

235

CD4 T cell responses but a strong increase in S-, N-, and M-specific memory CD8 T

236

cell responses, which were undetectable at the early time point in this individual, (Fig.

237

3d).

238
239

Taken together, these results suggested that long-term memory T cell responses to

240

SARS-CoV-2 are quite patient-specific and heterogeneous, and may even fluctuate

241

over time in individuals.

242
243

Correlation between the long-term memory T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 and

244

disease severity

245

Next, we examined the differences in the magnitude and breadth of memory CD4 and

246

CD8 T cell responses in CIs according to their different degrees of COVID-19

247

severity. CIs were stratified according to the severity of disease into asymptomatic

248

(ACs: 19.35%, 6/31), moderate (MCs: 61.29%, 19/31), and severe COVID-19 cases

249

(SCs: 19.35%, 6/31). No significant difference in the age between the symptomatic

250

and asymptomatic cases was observed. In general, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2

251

memory T cell responses against S, N or M, either for the overall or individual

252

cytokine production, were lower in ACs than in MCs and SCs, but the differences

253

were not statistically significant (Fig. 4a, 4b and S3). Also no significant correlations

254

were observed between the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 memory T cell responses and

255

clinical parameters indicating disease severity, including white blood cell and

259

However, memory CD4 T cell responses against S, N, and M became undetectable in

260

50% (3/6) of ACs, but only in 5.26% (1/19) of MCs (P=0.031, Fig. 4a). Memory CD8

261

T cell responses against S, N, and M became undetectable in 50% (3/6) of ACs, but

262

only in 21.05% (4/19) of MCs and 16.67% (1/6) of SCs, respectively (Fig. 4b). No

263

AC showed memory CD8 T cell responses against multiple peptide pools, while 52.63%

264

(10/19) of MCs and 66.67 (4/6) of SCs showed memory CD8 T cell responses to at

265

least 2 different peptide pools (Fig. 4b).

Elderly people are predisposed to develop severe COVID-19 and mortality increases

270

between the magnitude and breadth of memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and

271

age in CIs. We observed that the breadth, but not the magnitude of memory CD4 T

272

cell responses was inversely correlated with the age of CIs (r2=0.162, P=0.016, Fig.

273

5a). No significant correlation between the magnitude and breadth of memory CD8 T

274

cell responses and the age of CIs were observed (Fig. 5b).

During the acute phase of COVID-19, T cell responses positively correlated with the

279

magnitude of antibody responses

280

whether this association is maintained during the long-term convalescence. To this

281

end, we compared memory T cell responses and antibody responses in CIs from 83 to

282

274 dpdo. As shown in Fig. S5, the magnitude of memory CD4 and CD8 T cell

283

responses against S and N showed no significant correlation with the titers of

284

corresponding IgG against S and N. Form our large convalescent out-patient cohort

285

very few patients lose their SARS-COV-2-specific IgG responses over time. We were

286

interested if those patients still kept their memory T cells. We therefore selected 8

287

IgG-seronegative CIs and compared them to 23 seropositive CIs. At the time point of

288

last sampling the age of the IgG-seronegative CIs was significantly lower, and the

289

dpdo was significantly higher, than those of the 23 IgG-seropositive CIs (Fig. S6a). To

290

overcome this bias, we compared the magnitude and breadth of memory T cell

291

responses of IgG-seronegative CIs with 7 selected IgG-seropositive CIs with

292

comparable age and dpdo (Fig. S6b). Interestingly, memory CD4 T cell responses

293

against N and M were significantly higher in IgG-seronegative CIs than those in

294

IgG-seropositive CIs (Fig. 6a). A tendency of increased memory CD4 T cell response

295

against S in IgG-seronegative CIs was also observed, although the difference

296

remained close to the borderline of statistical significance (P=0.052, Fig. 6a). All

297

IgG-seronegative CIs showed memory CD4 T cell responses to at least 2 peptide

298

pools, while 28.57% IgG-seropositive CIs showed no memory CD4 T cell responses

299

to S, N or M (Fig. 6b). In contrast to CD4 T cells, no significant differences in the

300

magnitude and breadth of memory CD8 T cell responses between the

301

IgG-seronegative and -seropositive CIs were observed (Fig. 6c and 6d), indicating

302

that CD8 T cells seem to be less correlated with humoral immune responses as

303

compared to CD4 T cells.

305

Discussion

306

One of the most important and challenging questions facing medicine today concerns

307

the extent to which immunity develops and persists following COVID-19. Previous

308

studies suggest that the persistence of protective immunity against different

309

coronaviruses varies significantly, since those against seasonal coronavirus are

310

short-lived

311

coronavirus (MERS) are described to last longer

312

demonstrated that macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 are resistant to reinfection

313

with the same virus isolate following recovery from their initial infection, suggesting

314

the cellular and/or humoral immunity facilitated by the primary infection might have

315

protected the same nonhuman primates against secondary encounters

316

in both studies, reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 were carried out within a relative short

317

time window (4 and 5 weeks after the primary infection). In contrast to the

318

observation in the macaque model, there are some reports demonstrating the principle

319

possibility of reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 in humans

320

that the lifespan of the humoral response following SARS-CoV-2 infection is

321

relatively short, especially in mild and asymptomatic cases

16

while those against SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome

322

although SARS-CoV-2 infection may blunt long-lived antibody responses, immune

323

memory might still be achieved through virus-specific memory T cell responses 2,

324

which have been detected in most recently recovered individuals, including

325

asymptomatic cases and those with undetectable antibody responses 9. Here we

326

provide, to our knowledge, the first characterization of long-term memory T cell

327

responses in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent individuals up to 9 months

328

following primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that the magnitude and breadth

329

of long-term memory T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are heterogeneous. While the

330

majority of CIs demonstrate strong and broad memory T cell responses up to 9

331

months post disease onset, some individuals have lost their T cell responses against

332

the studied antigens within half a year. The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4

333

T cell response is inversely correlated with the time that had elapsed from disease

334

onset within 180 days, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 T cell response may

335

wane over time at the early months following primary SARS-CoV-2 infection.

336

Intriguingly, half of the asymptomatic cases have lost their memory CD4 and CD8 T

337

cell responses, suggesting the memory T cell responses might be less durable in

338

asymptomatic cases than in symptomatic cases. The breadth of memory CD4 T cell

339

responses were inversely correlated with the age of the patients, suggesting the

340

memory T cell responses might also be less durable in elderly individuals. Moreover,

341

the kinetics of memory T cell responses are heterogeneous in the herein examined CIs,

342

while some show a sharp decline of memory T cell responses over time, others show

343

rather sustained or even increasing memory T cell responses. Our data document a

344

durability of cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2, however, for a fraction of

345

elderly individuals with asymptomatic infections a considerable waning of cellular

346

immunity may occur. Our results also suggest that the intensity of SARS-CoV-2

347

memory T cell responses detected in peripheral blood may fluctuate over time in CIs,

348

which is unlikely to be caused by reexposion to SARS-CoV-2, since the the

349

possibility of local spread of the virus in Wuhan and nearby area has been precluded

350

by the thorough SARS-CoV-2 RNA test conducted in May for every resident. Future

351

studies are needed to closely monitor the SARS-CoV-2 memory T cell responses to

352

address how the intensities of these responses are regulated in CIs.

353
354

Different from the observation during and shortly after the acute phase of

355

SARS-CoV-2 infection

356

SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral responses are not positively correlated

357

with each other. In contrast, IgG-seronegative CIs demonstrate even stronger

358

SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4 T cell responses than IgG-seropositive CIs. A

359

recent study started to investigate the possible mechanisms of short-lived antibody

360

responses observed in COVID-19 patients and has reported that germinal centers in

361

secondary lymphoid organs were largely absent during the acute phase of COVID-19

366

evidence that the above-mentioned effect may extent to a far longer period in the

367

convalescent phase of COVID-19. Although it remains unclear which arms of the

368

adaptive immune response are responsible for protection against SARS-CoV-2

Figure 5. The breadth of long-term SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 T cell responses is

509

negatively correlated with the age of COVID-19 convalescent individuals. The

510

correlation between the magnitude and breadth of memory CD4 (a) and CD8 (b) T

511

cell responses specific to S, N and M and age are shown. Pearson product-moment

512

correlation coefficient test was used to test the significance and P value and r2 value

513

(correlation coefficient) are indicated in each panel. S: surface glycoprotein; N:

514

nucleocapsid phosphoprotein; M: membrane glycoprotein.

Figure 6. The long-term SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 T cell responses is robust in

518

IgG-seronegative COVID-19 convalescent individuals. The magnitude (a) and

519

breadth (b) of memory CD4 T cell responses are compared between IgG-seronegative

520

(IgG-, n=8) and IgG-seropositive (IgG+, n=7) CIs. The magnitude (c) and breadth (d)

521

of memory CD8 T cell responses are compared between IgG-seronegative (IgG-, n=8)

522

and IgG-seropositive (IgG+, n=7) CIs. Statistically significant differences are

523

indicated by asterisks (* < 0.05, Non-parametric Mann-Whitney test). S: surface

524

glycoprotein; N: nucleocapsid phosphoprotein; M: membrane glycoprotein.
