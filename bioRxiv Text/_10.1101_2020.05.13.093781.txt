Abstract
Since its emergence in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been
posing a serious threat to public health worldwide as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). Now distributed in a pandemic pattern, this disease still lacks an effective drug treatment with low
toxicity, leading pharmaceutical companies and research labs to work against time to find a candidate molecule
to efficiently treat the affected patients. Due to the well-known broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the
lactoferrin protein, we sought to verify whether its bovine form (bLf) would also be effective in vitro against
SARS-CoV-2. Using an antiviral assay based on quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR), we found that bLf reduced progeny virus yield by up to ~84,6% in African green monkey kidney
epithelial cells (Vero E6) and ~68,6% in adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) at 1
mg/mL, a concentration previously shown to have low cytotoxicity. Therefore, our preliminary data suggest
that bLf has the potential to constitute a biochemical approach to fight the new coronavirus pandemic.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with
a positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid
(RNA) genome, structurally recognized by electron

microscopy for their distinctive crown-shaped
spike projections (Li, 2016). Although some CoVs
(e.g., HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43) were already
known to cause respiratory infections in humans,
this group of viruses was not considered to be

highly pathogenic until the outbreaks of severe
acute repiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012
(Cui et al., 2019). The so-called SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV were each responsible for hundreds of
human deaths (Su et al., 2016).
In late 2019, a new CoV emerged in China and
quickly spread across the world causing a
respiratory illness named coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) (Jiang et al., 2020). This virus, called
SARS-CoV-2 due to its close phylogenetic
relationship with the CoV from the 2002 outbreak,
has reached a pandemic distribution pattern and has
already caused thousands of human deaths
worldwide (Wu et al., 2020).
Despite being less lethal than the CoVs associated
to SARS and MERS, the CoV responsible for
COVID-19 is more contagious than those viruses
(Meo et al., 2020). The high rate of hospitalizations
resulting from this new disease has caused the
collapse of health systems in several countries,
raising the need for an effective drug with low
toxicity to treat human infections (Velavan &
Meyer, 2020). In this sense, lactoferrin (Lf) – an
iron-binding protein naturally found in milk and
other bodily secretions with broad-spectrum
antimicrobial activity (Jenssen & Hancock, 2009)
– may represent an alternative.
Lf exhibits inhibitory activities against a wide
range of viruses in vitro, including those
responsible for respiratory tract infections such as
common cold and influenza (Wakabayashi et al.,
2014). In its bovine form (bLf), the protein was also
shown to be effective in vitro against a pseudotyped
version of the etiological agent of SARS,
interfering with virus infection at the attachment
stage (Lang et al., 2011).
In view of the above, this brief work aimed to
assess the activity of bLf against SARS-CoV-2 in
vitro, using African green monkey kidney
epithelial (Vero E6) and adenocarcinomic human
alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cell lines.
Material and Methods
Vero E6 and A549 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
plus penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. SARS-CoV-2 was

isolated after two passages of a nasopharyngeal
swab sample from a positive case in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, in Vero E6 cells. All virus-related
procedures were performed in multi-user facilities
with biosafety level 3 (BSL-3), according to World
Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. BLf was
obtained from Art’Gerecht.
For the antiviral assays, cells were plated at a
density of 5 x 104 cells/well in 48-well plates. After
culturing overnight, cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated
with bLf in FBS-containing DMEM at the
indicated concentrations for 1 h. Then, the previous
solution was removed and cells were incubated
with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 0.01 in the presence of bLf in pure
DMEM for an additional 1 h. Afterwards, the virus
inoculum was removed and cells were incubated
with bLf-containing medium for 72 h.
Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays were performed
after extraction of viral RNA from the culture
supernatant using the QIAGEN QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit, according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Amplification was carried out by
using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit on the
ABI PRISM 7500 System with primers and probes
specific for SARS-CoV-2 as published elsewhere
(Corman et al., 2020). A standard curve with a prequantified reference sample was used for RNA
quantification, expressed as a function of volume
(copies/mL).
Statistical analyses were performed using ordinary
one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test for
multiple comparisons on GraphPad Prism 6
Software. P-values less than 0.05 were considered
as indicative of statistically significant differences.
Results
As an initial assessment of the inhibitory activity of
bLf on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a both suceptible
and permissive cell line, Vero E6 cells were
infected in the absence or presence of the protein at
concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mg/mL and
virus load in the culture supernatant was
determined by qRT-PCR. As observed, bLf
promoted a dose-dependent inhibition of SARSCoV-2 yield, which was reduced by up to ~84,6%
at 1 mg/mL based on viral RNA level (Figure 1).

be effective in randomized controlled trials (Zumla
et al., 2016). Facing the rampant spread of COVID19 around the world, this study demonstrated that
bLf is able to significantly interfere with SARSCoV-2 replication in vitro at 1 mg/mL. Previous
studies using Vero E6 (Murphy et al., 2000) or
A549 (Tung et al., 2013) cells have reported low
cytotoxic effects for bLf at this concentration.

Figure 1: Effect of bLf on SARS-CoV-2 yield in Vero E6
cells. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations
of bLf before, during and after virus adsorption. At 72 h postinfection, viral RNA was extracted from the culture
supernatant and quantified by qRT-PCR. Data represent
means plus standard deviations from 3 independent
experiments and asterisk denotes a statistically significant
difference in relation to control.

Next, to check if such antiviral action of bLf is also
exerted on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cell line
more related to the main target organs of the virus
in humans (i.e., the lungs), the previous in vitro
approach based on qRT-PCR was conducted with
A549 cells. Once again, bLf promoted a significant
inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 yield, reducing
viral RNA level in the culture supernatant by up to
~68,6% at 1 mg/mL (Figure 2).

In line with a recent work on SARS-CoV-2
(Harcourt et al., 2020), our qRT-PCR data revealed
that the virus replicates at higher titers in Vero E6
cells than in A549 cells, which differed by 4 log10.
This variation may be due to a limited expression
of viral subgenomic RNAs during CoV replication
in the latter cells (Gillim-Ross et al., 2004).
Based on a previous work addressing the
mechanism involved in the activity of bLf against
a SARS pseudovirus (Lang et al., 2011), it is likely
that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs at
the entry level by blocking heparan sulfate
proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are commonly
exploited by viruses for cell attachment (Cagno et
al., 2019). Indeed, this seems to be a general
mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of bLf
on several unrelated viruses, including respiratory
viruses (Superti et al., 2019) and even endemic
(Carvalho et al., 2014) or epidemic (Carvalho et al.,
2017) arboviruses.
Regarding in vivo responses to CoVs, it is worth
noting that genes coding for Lf are highly upregulated in patients with SARS and the protein
may further inhibit virus infection in vivo by
enhancing natural killer (NK) cell activity and
stimulating neutrophil aggregation and adhesion
(Reghunathan et al., 2005).

Figure 2: Effect of bLf on SARS-CoV-2 yield in A549
cells. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations
of bLf before, during and after virus adsorption. At 72 h postinfection, viral RNA was extracted from the culture
supernatant and quantified by qRT-PCR. Data represent
means plus standard deviations from 3 independent
experiments and asterisk denotes a statistically significant
difference in relation to control.

Recently, a prospective observational study with
COVID-19 patients has shown that oral treatment
with liposomal bLf allows a complete and fast
recovery from the disease within the first 4-5 days,
although it has not been proved that the protein acts
directly on virus infection (Serrano et al., 2020).
Despite being preliminary, our data provides a
proof of concept to support further trials with bLf
in the pandemic scenario of COVID-19.
