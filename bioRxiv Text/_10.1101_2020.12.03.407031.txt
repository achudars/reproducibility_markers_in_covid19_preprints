Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) with innate and adaptive immune response triggered in such patients
by viral antigens. Both convalescent plasma and engineered high affinity human monoclonal
antibodies have shown therapeutic potential to treat COVID-19. Whether additional antiviral
soluble factors exist in peripheral blood remain understudied. Herein, we detected circulating
exosomes that express the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) in plasma of both healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated
that exosomal ACE2 competes with cellular ACE2 for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
ACE2-expressing (ACE2+) exosomes blocked the binding of the viral spike (S) protein RBD to
ACE2+ cells in a dose dependent manner, which was 400- to 700-fold more potent than that of
vesicle-free recombinant human ACE2 extracellular domain protein (rhACE2). As a consequence,
exosomal ACE2 prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus tethering and infection of human host
cells at a 50-150 fold higher efficacy than rhACE2. A similar antiviral activity of exosomal ACE2
was further demonstrated to block wild-type live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of note, depletion of
ACE2+ exosomes from COVID-19 patient plasma impaired the ability to block SARS-CoV-2
RBD binding to host cells. Our data demonstrate that ACE2+ exosomes can serve as a decoy
therapeutic and a possible innate antiviral mechanism to block SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main Text
COVID-19 1,2 has become a global pandemic resulting in more than 55 million cases and
over 1.3 million deaths to date 3. SARS-CoV-2 shares high structural similarity with SARS-CoV,
which caused an outbreak in 2003 4, and encodes four main proteins- glycoproteins spike (S),
envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein besides several accessory proteins 1,57

. Through the external receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S transmembrane protein, both

coronaviruses bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a primary receptor for host cell
attachment and subsequent entry 1,5-7. Approaches to block or impede the viral interaction with
the entry receptor ACE2 on the host cell, including S-specific neutralization antibodies (Abs) 8-20
and rhACE2 21-23, inhibit infectivity and prevent COVID-19.
Exosomes are cell-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in a variety of
physiological and pathobiological functions

24-28

, and present many proteins on the surface

reminiscent of their cellular counterpart, such as immune regulators of myeloid and lymphoid cells
to affect antiviral immune response 28-30. We detected circulating ACE2+ exosomes in plasma from
both healthy donors and patients who recovered from COVID-19. Importantly, ACE2+ exosomes
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the viral spike protein binding with its cellular receptor
in host cells. Our observations demonstrate that ACE2+ exosomes are a previously unknown innate
antiviral mechanism to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as provide a rationale for the use
of ACE2+ exosomes to combat COVID-19.
Identification and characterization of ACE2+ exosomes
We previously established an automated and high throughput method, micro flow vesiclometry
(MFV), to detect and profile the surface proteins of blood exosomes at single particle resolution 31.
To establish a working protocol for measuring ACE2 expression in exosomes from human plasma,
we first determined that ACE2 was detectable in ACE2+ cell-derived exosomes. Two sets of
human cell lines HEK-293 (HEK) and HeLa, originally negative for ACE2 (ACE2- control), were
engineered to stably express ACE2 as verified by flow cytometry and immunoblotting (Fig. 1A &
B). Both ACE2+ cell-and ACE2- cell-derived exosomes were purified from cell culture
supernatants using ultracentrifugation after removal of cell debris and apoptotic bodies
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Exosomes exhibited an average size of approximately 180 nm with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.407031; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

equivalent vesicle counts of 6x107 per g of exosome proteins as measured by nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA) (Fig. 1C). Immunoblotting demonstrated that these exosomes expressed
CD63, CD81, and TSG101 but not GRP94 (Fig. 1B).
We further developed two cutting-edge platforms: high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) and high-throughput MFV to analyze native exosomes in liquid conditions at singleexosome resolution. Immuno-cryo-EM revealed that both ACE2- and ACE2+ exosomes have a
similar spheric vesicle shape and express CD81 (Fig. 1D). More importantly, ACE2 expression
was detected in a majority of the imaged vesicles (~52% of 178, between 3-40 gold nanoparticles
per vesicle) isolated from ACE2+ cells (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig S1C & D). MFV also
exclusively detected ACE2 in the exosomes derived from both HEK and HeLa cells expressing
ACE2, but not from their parental ACE2- controls, whereas both ACE2+ and ACE2- cells produced
almost equivalent numbers of total EVs (0.5~1x108 counts per g exosome proteins), consistent
with the NTA analyses (Fig. 1C & E, Supplementary Fig S1E-F). Within both ACE2+ HEK and
HeLa cell-derived exosomes, the ACE2+ exosomes account for up to 1-5x106 particles per g of
exosome proteins (2-6% of total EVs) (Fig. 1E, Supplementary Fig S1F). Exosomal ACE2 might
be under-detected by MFV due to its relatively higher detection threshold than that of cryo-EM
images (~50% positivity of ACE2) which provide a resolution of single gold nanoparticles stained
for ACE2 (Supplementary Fig S1D). The MFV analyses of double stained EVs isolated from
HEK-ACE2 and HeLa-ACE2 cells further identified ACE2 largely enriched in CD81+ exosomes
(28.6 and 62.5%) or CD63+ exosomes (33.2 and 47.8%) (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Fig S1F).
Taking advantage of the MFV-based direct analysis of circulating exosomes in crude plasma
samples, we detected a small subset, ranging from 0.3 to 1.3%, of ACE2+ exosomes in total plasma
particles or EVs, which were also enriched in CD63+ exosome subsets from both pre-COVID-19
(NWL-001 and -004) and COVID-19 (CSB-023 and -029) patients (Fig. 1G, Supplementary Fig
S1G). The ultracentrifugation pellets of enriched exosomes from plasma specimens had detectable
TSG101 and very low ACE2 levels (Supplementary Fig. S1H) further confirming that ACE2+
exosomes exist in plasma from both healthy donors and COVID-19 patients.
ACE2+ exosomes block SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding and viral infections

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.407031; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

To analyze the effects of ACE2+ exosomes on viral infection, we implemented a flow cytometrybased SARS-CoV-2 S protein (RBD)-binding assay (Supplementary Fig. S2A). As expected,
ACE2+ HEK cells displayed a specific and high binding (>90%) with a red fluorophore AF-647conjugated RBD protein at 16 nM, in contrast to a minimal background level of mock control as
well as absent RBD-binding with ACE2- control cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The RBD probe
bound to ACE2+ cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by pre-incubation with
rhACE2 as reported previously

21

(Fig. 2A & B). Notably, ACE2+ exosomes inhibited SARS-

CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2+ HEK cells as evidence by the percentage of AF-647+ cells and the
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) which were both dramatically reduced (Fig. 2A & B). In
contrast, ACE2- exosomes had negligible effects (Fig. 2A & B), indicating that the exosomes
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognition with their cellular receptors through ACE2. The
approximate IC50 for soluble rhACE2 to inhibit RBD binding to host cells is 127 nM (~7.6x1012
molecules in 0.1 mL of reaction) (Fig. 2C). In order to compare the efficacy between rhACE2 and
exosomal ACE2 (exoACE2), we converted the exosome concentrations in exosome particles per
measured exosome proteins (~1x108/µg) multiplied with estimated number of ACE2 molecules
per exosome into molar concentrations of exoACE2. Based on our immune-cryo-EM data, ~50%
exosomes presenting 3-40 ACE2 molecules (Supplementary Fig. S1C-D), we speculate an
average of 20 ACE2 molecules per exosome due to limited exosomal space 32. Based upon a series
of exosome dilution-based RBD neutralization assays, the IC50 values of exoACE2 in the
exosomes derived from ACE2+ HEK and Hela cells are 0.18 and 0.33 nM, respectively, which
contain 1.0-2.0x1010 ACE2 molecules in 0.5-1.0x109 particles (Fig. 2D-E). Therefore, exoACE2
possesses 400-700 times better neutralization efficiency than soluble rhACE2 to block SARSCoV-2 viral RBD binding to human host cells.
Next, we evaluated the neutralization effects of ACE2+ exosomes on the infectivity by SARSCoV-2 S+ pseudovirus and wild-type virus. When the SIV3-derived SARS-CoV-2 S+ pseudovirus
with either a dual Luc2-IRES-Cherry reporter or an eGFP fluorescence protein reporter was
utilized, the viral infectivity to ACE2+ host cells was analyzed by flow cytometry of Cherry or
eGFP expressing cells as well as luminescence signal of cellular luciferase activity
(Supplementary Fig. S3A-C). About 3% of ACE2+ cells were detected with Cherry protein
expression when 300~500 infection-units (IFU) of SARS-CoV-2 S+ pseudoviruses were used,
whereas no ACE2- cells were infected with the same viral dose (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig.

S3D). ACE2+ exosomes blocked SARS-CoV-2 S+ pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent
manner and achieved more than 90% inhibition at a dose of 20 µg (Fig. 3B). A similar result was
observed when the SARS-CoV-2 S+ pseudovirus carrying a luciferase reporter was used (Fig. 3CE). The IC50 values of exoACE2 in the exosomes derived from ACE2+ HEK and HeLa cells are
12.3 pM and 39.7 pM, respectively (Fig. 3C & D), which are equivalent to 0.4-1.0x108 particles
(0.37-1.18 µg exosomes) with maximal 0.8-2x109 ACE2 molecules in 0.1 mL reactions. In
comparison to an IC50 of rhACE2 at 1.88 nM (1x1011 molecules in 0.1mL), exosomal ACE2
presents an estimated 50 to 150-fold neutralization efficacy to block SARS-COV-2 infection of
human host cells. In contrast, ACE2- control exosomes only had marginal neutralization effects,
which were not dose-dependent (Fig. 3F & G). Preincubation of SARS-CoV-2 S+ pseudovirus
with ACE2+ exosomes did not yield infection of ACE2-negative cells (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
Collectively, our results provide a rationale for the use of ACE2+ exosomes as an innovative
methodology to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, upon the wild-type SARS-CoV-2
infection (400 plaque-forming units), HeLa ACE2+ exosomes at the doses of 334 and 668 pM
exoACE2 (10 and 20 µg exosomes) protected the vero-6 cells from viral infection-mediated death
resulting in an improved host cell viability whereas ACE2- exosomes failed to protect the cells
from viral infection (Fig 3H).
ACE2+ exosomes associated with plasma neutralization effects
We continued to investigate whether ACE2+ exosome abundancy is associated with viral
neutralization effect of human plasma. MFV-based single exosome analysis detected a wide range
of ACE2+ exosome abundancy (vesicle counts) in plasma from both pre-COVID-19 (NWL) and
convalescent COVID-19 (CSB) patients (Figs. 1G & 4A), implying that the levels of circulating
ACE2+ exosomes are variable. As expected, the RBD-IgG levels in COVID-19 patient plasma
were significantly associated with their neutralization effects on RBD binding to human cells, but
pre-COVID-19 plasma (NWL) had absent or negligible levels of RBD-IgG (Fig. 4B,
Supplementary Fig. S3E).
Together with our discovery that ACE2+ exosome inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, we speculated
that, in addition to specific neutralization Abs, ACE2+ exosomes might function as an innate antiSARS-COV-2 mechanism. To investigate this idea, we first enriched plasma exosomes by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.407031; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

ultracentrifugation (Fig. 4C & D). Importantly, ACE2+ exosomes pelleted from the plasma of both
healthy donors and COVID-19 patients partially inhibited RBD-binding to ACE2-expressing HEK
cells (Fig. 4E). To validate whether the ACE2+ exosomes in the plasma pellet were responsible
for inhibition of RBD binding, we used RBD-conjugated magnetic beads to deplete the majority
of ACE2+ exosomes in the samples (Fig. 4C & D). Depletion of ACE2+ exosomes significantly
impaired the ability of plasma samples to inhibt RBD-binding to ACE2+ HEK cells (Fig. 4E),
indicating that the ACE2+ exosomes in the plasma from both healthy donors and COVID-19
patients were responsible for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.
We also noticed that the pellets from one COVID-19 plasma (CSB-012) had residual but detectable
levels of RBD-specific IgG, which were also depleted by RBD-beads (Fig. 4C & F). This implies
that IgG may contribute to the neutralization capacity of the plasma pellets from COVID-19
patients, but not the healthy donors, to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Based on the altered
ACE2+ exosome levels (vesicle counts measured by MFV) in all four samples and the RBD-IgG
alteration in CSB-012 and CSB-024, we developed a mathematical model to estimate the relative
contributions of ACE2+ exosomes and RBD-IgG in convalescent plasma to block SARS-CoV-2
binding (Supplementary Fig. S3F). We then integrated the contribution of both ACE2+ exosomes
and RBD-IgG levels for an improved prediction of RBD neutralization activity of COVID-19
patient plasma (N=30) (Fig. 4G, Supplementary Fig. S4).
Collectively, our data reveal a previously unknown antiviral mechanism of circulating ACE2+
exosomes that may suppress infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses utilizing ACE2 as an
entry receptor.
Discussion
Our studies demonstrate that ACE2+ exosomes can compete with host cell surface ACE2 to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and possibly by other coronaviruses that utilize ACE2 as their initial
tethering receptor. Similarly, a recent study has shown that rhACE2 inhibits SARS-CoV-2
infection 21. Based on an assumption that one exosome is capable of containing a limited number
of total protein molecules

32

and our cryo-EM data showing possibly up to 20 ACE2 molecules

per exosome, exosomal ACE2 might possess up to 100-fold better efficiency to block SARS-CoV2 infection than soluble rhACE2.

Exosomes have been utilized as drug delivery systems with therapeutic potential against various
disorders including infectious diseases 33,34. We anticipate that the therapeutic efficacy of ACE2+
exosomes can be further potentiated through co-delivering additional anti-SARS-CoV-2
medicines 35,36. In addition, circulating exosomes in plasma represent an important component of
blood in terms of its defensive, homeostatic and signal transduction properties

28-31

. Importantly,

here we detected a substantial amount of ACE2+ exosomes in human plasma, and ACE2+
exosomes function as a potent decoy to protect host cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our
discovery reveals that circulating ACE2+ exosomes may serve as a previously unknown innate
antiviral mechanism to protect the host from coronavirus infection. Future studies are needed to
investigate whether circulating ACE2 exosomes account for reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load and
COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Methods
Human subject study and biosafety approvals.
All research activities with human blood specimens of pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19
convalescent patients were implemented under NIH guidelines for human subject studies and the
protocols approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board (STU00205299
and #STU00212371) as well as the Institutional Biosafety Committee.
Cell culture
The parent ACE2- human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells (HEK) or human cervical cancer HeLa
cells (HeLa) are transduced with lentiviral pDual-ACE2 expression vector for stable ACE2
expression and production of ACE2+ exosomes. Dr. Thomas Gallagher of Stritch Medical School,
Loyola University kindly provided HeLa and HeLa-ACE2 cells via the Hope group. ACE2- parent
cell serve as negative controls in production of ACE2- exosomes in the culture. Cells were tested
for mycoplasma contamination before culturing. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. FBS used to prepare complete media was exosomedepleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C.
Flow cytometry
Cells were blocked with mouse serum IgG (Sigma, 15381) for 10 min at room temperature and
then incubated with specific antibodies; AF-647 mouse anti-human ACE2 (R&D systems,
FAB9332R), AF-488 mouse anti-human ACE2 (R&D systems, FAB9333G), AF-647 isotype
control mouse IgG2b (R&D systems, IC003R) or AF-488 isotype control mouse IgG2bAF488
(R&D systems, IC003G) for 45 min on ice, followed by washing twice with 2% exosome-free
FBS/PBS. Finally, the cells were diluted in 2% exo-free FBS/PBS and analyzed on a BD-LSR II
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Isolation and Purification of cell line-derived exosomes
Exosomes were isolated from the cell culture supernatant of each of the four cell lines as described
previously37. Cells were cultured as monolayers for 48-72 h under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at
37 °C. When cells reached confluency of approximately 80-90%, culture supernatant was collected,
and exosomes were isolated using differential centrifugation. First, the supernatant was centrifuged
at 2,000 × g for 10 min then at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove dead cells and cell debris. Second,
the supernatant was ultracentrifuged for 70 min at 100,000 × g to pellet the exosomes. Exosomes
were then washed by resuspension in 30 mL of sterile PBS (Hyclone, Utah, USA), and pelleted by
ultracentrifugation for 70 h at 100,000 × g. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 100 μl PBS and
stored at −80 °C.
Western blotting

Cells and exosomes were lysed by RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100 dilution)
for 30 min on ice, then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and 14,000 rpm. 10-20 µg of cell-derived
proteins and 2-8 µg of exosome-derived proteins were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min and loaded
to SDS-PAGE, then transferred to PVDF membranes. The antibodies, ACE2 (R&D systems,
AF933), CD81 (GeneTex, CTX101766), CD63 (Proteintech, 25682-1-AP), GRP94 (Proteintech,
1H10B7), TSG101 (Proteintech, 14497-1-AP) and β-actin (Sigma, A5441) were used as primary
antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were from
Promega (Rabbit W401B and Mouse W402B), and the substrate ECL was detected by Pierce
ECL2 solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1896433A).
Nanoparticle tracking analysis
Analysis was performed at the Analytical bioNanoTechnology Core Facility of the Simpson
Querrey Institute at Northwestern University. All samples were diluted in PBS to a final volume
of 1 ml and ideal measurement concentrations were found by pre-testing the ideal particle per
frame value. Settings were according to the manufacturer’s software manual (NanoSight NS3000).
Micro Flow Vesiclometry (MFV) Analysis of Exosomes
Antibody solutions were centrifuged at 14000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove aggregates before use.
Exosomes (1-2 μg protein equivalent amount of exosomes in 20 μL of PBS) were blocked using
1μg of mouse serum IgG for 10 min at RT then incubated with: AF-488 mouse anti-human ACE2
(R&D systems, FAB9333G), APC mouse antihuman CD81 (BD Biosciences, 561958), AF-647
mouse antihuman CD63 (BD, Biosciences, 561983), AF-488 isotype control mouse IgG2b (R&D
systems, IC003G), APC isotype control mouse IgG1κ (BD Biosciences, 555751) or AF-647 isotype
control mouse IgG1κ (BD, Biosciences, 557714) for 45 min at 4°C. The solution was then diluted
to 200μL with PBS and the samples were run on Apogee A50 Micro Flow Cytometer (MFC)
(Apogee Flow Systems, Hertfordshire, UK) (http://www.apogeeflow.com/products.php). The
reference ApogeeMix beads (Apogee Flow Systems, 1493), were used to assess the performance
of Apogee MFC, and to compare the size distribution of the exosomes. PBS was run as a
background control.
Immuno-cryo-EM imaging
Antibody solutions and other staining buffers were centrifuged to remove non-specific particles or
aggregates in the buffer of intereat, at 14000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C before use. Exosomes (10µg in
100uL) were blocked using 5μg of mouse serum IgG for 10 min at RT then incubated with mouse
anti-human ACE2 (R&D systems, FAB9333G), mouse antihuman CD81 (BD Biosciences,
551108), isotype control mouse IgG2b (R&D systems, IC003G) or isotype control mouse IgG1κ
(BD Biosciences, 551954) for 45 min at 4 °C.. To rinse samples, 1mL PBS was added to the tubes,
and exosomes were centrifuged 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. PBS was aspirated, samples were
reconstituted in 100 uL PBS, and incubated with EM goat anti-mouse IgG (H&L) 10 nm gold

conjugated (BBI solutions, EM.GMHL10) (7:100) for 30 min at RT. Exosomes were then rinsed
by adding 1300 uL PBS then centrifugation 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Finally, PBS was
aspirated, and exosomes were reconstituted in 50 uL PBS.
For cryoEM visualization, samples were prepared from freshly stained exosomes at the
concentration provided. For cryo-freezing, 3.5µl of exosome solutions were applied to fresh glowdischarged (10 s, 15 mA; Pelco EasiGlow) lacey carbon TEM grids (Electron Microscopy Services)
and vitrified using a FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). The sample was applied to the
grid and kept at 85% humidity and 10 oC. After a 10 s incubation period the grid was blotted with
Whatman 595 filter paper for 4 seconds using a blot force of 5 and plunge frozen into liquid ethane.
Samples were imaged using a JEOL 3200FS electron microscope equipped with an omega energy
filter operated at 200 kV with a K3 direct electron detector (Ametek) using the minimal dose
system. The total dose for each movie was ~20 e-/A2 and was fractionated into 14 frames at a
nominal magnification between 8,000 to 15,000 (pixel size on the detector between 4.1 Å to 2.2
Å, respectively). After motion correction of the movies 38, exosomes were identified manually
using ImageJ 39. Two grids were prepared and imaged with 10-20 fields for each condition.
Development of the SARS-Cov-2 RBD “bait”:
RBD of 223 amino acid (Arg319-Phe541) fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein that binds
to the ACE2 receptor (Raybiotech, 230-30162-100) was biotinylated using NHS-PEG4-Biotin
(Thermo Fisher, 21330). The protein was de-salted using Zeba Quick Spin columns (Thermo
Fisher, 89849) and incubated with Streptavidin-AlexaFluor-647 (SA-AF-647) (Thermo
Fisher, S21374) to make the RBD-biotin-AF647 bait.
Cell-based RBD binding neutralization by ACE2+ exosomes and human plasma
The RBD-biotin-AF647 bait (3.3 and 16 nM) was incubated with exosomes (ACE2+ and ACE2-),
recombinant human ACE2 extracellular region (rhACE2, RayBiotech, 230-30165), or human
plasma (10 µl or 80 µl) for 45 minutes on ice (creating “neutralized RBD”), then incubated with
ACE2+ HEK-293 cells (200,000 cells in 100 µL) for 45 minutes on ice. Human recombinant ACE2
protein was used as a positive control (70-140 ng). RBD bait that was incubated with PBS, or with
ACE2- exosomes, non-fluorescent RBD bait (mock control) and ACE2- cells were used as controls.
Cells were then spun and washed twice with PBS. DAPI was added as to exclude dead cells
analyzed on flow cytometer and viable singlets were gated for percentage and mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) measurements of the RBD-AF647+ population.
Neutralization effects of ACE2+ exosomes on SARS-CoV-2 spike+ pseudovirus infection to
human host cells.
The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S+) pseudovirus carrying the Luc2-Cherry reporters were made for live
virus neutralization assay after the pcDNA3-spike expression vector was transfected along with
pCMV-Luc2-IRES-Cherry and pSIV3+ lentiviral vectors into a lentivirus producing cell HEK-

293. The S+ pseudovirus was then incubated with ACE2+ exosomes, or ACE2- exosomes, or a
positive control rhACE2, or negative control (PBS), for 1 hr at 37oC prior to the infection with
ACE2+ human host cells HeLa in 96-well plates (5,000 cells/well). A bald virus without spike
expression and ACE- cells served as negative controls. Flow cytometry of Cherry or eGFP and
luciferase activity analysis (Promega, E1500) were used to assess viral infectivity.
Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 live virus infection to vero-6 cells at the BSL3 facility
The wild-type SARS-CoV-2 live virus study was conducted at the BSL-3 facility at the NIAIDsupported University of Chicago Howard T. Ricketts Regional Biochontainment Laboratory. One
day prior to viral infections, 10,000 vero-6 cells were seeded per well in triplicates onto 96-well
plates. 16 hours after seeding, the attached cells were infected with mock controls (no virus) and
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (500 pfu) viruses which were pre-mixed with a serial of doses of
exosomes (starting from 20 µg with 6 times of 1:2 dilutions) or an untreated control. 96 hours later,
the host cell viability (opposite to viral infectivity-caused cell death) was measured by crystal
violet staining which stained attached viable cells on the plate following fixation. Cells killed off
by the virus were floating and excluded. For the untreated control, the cells were infected but left
without any treatment with a value of maximal cell death caused by the virus. The second control
was the mock infected control where cells grew in the absences of virus or experimental sample
representing the maximum normal cell growth over the time period. The absorbance value of the
untreated control was subtracted from all other absorbance values thereby making untreated 0 then
all absorbance values were divided by the mock infected value thereby making that value 100.
RBD-IgG quantitative ELISA assay
The ELISA protocol was validated as previously described 40,41 and used herein with the
modification of using plasma instead of serum. Plasma samples were diluted by half with PBS
during RosetteSep human B cell processing (StemCell Technologies #15064), aliquoted, and
stored at -80C until analysis. Plasma was run in quadruplicate and reported as the average. Results
were normalized to the CR3022 antibody with known affinity to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 42. Sample
anti-RBD IgG concentration reported as µg/ml was calculated from the 4PL regression of the
CR3022 calibration curve. A sample value >0.39 µg/ml CR3022 was considered seropositive.
Exosome enrichment by ultracentrifuge
Covid-19 (CSB) and pre-COVID-19 (NWL) patient derived plasma samples were obtained from
Northwestern Memorial Hospital and stored at -80 °C. CSB and NWL plasmas were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter) at 100000 x g for 2, 4, 8 and 18 h at 4 °C to isolate and enrich
exosomes in the pellets. After centrifuge, supernatants and plasma pellets were collected separately.
Plasma pellets were resuspended in appropriate volumes of PBS. The levels of ACE2+ exosomes
in plasma samples were evaluated by MFV on Apogee and western blotting using exosome marker
TSG101 and ACE2. ACE2+ cell line derived exosomes were used as a positive control.

Depletion of ACE2+ exosomes by RBD-beads
CSB and NWL patient plasma samples (1.0-2.0 ml) were ultra-centrifuged for 8 h at 100000 x g
at 4 °C, and the pellets were resuspended in 250-500 µL PBS as exosome-enriched samples for
subsequent bead-mediated depletion. RBD-coupled magnetic beads or anti ACE2-coupled
dynabeads beads were prepared according to manufacturer’s protocols. Biotin conjugated RBD
protein (ACROBiosystems, SPD-C82E9) were coupled with magnetic beads (CELLection Biotin
Binder Kit, Thermo Fisher Sceintific, 11533D), and 5 µg of anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D systems,
AF933) or isotope control IgG (R&D systems) were conjugated to dynabeads (Dynabeads CoImmunoprecipitation Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14321D). Exosome pellet samples were
incubated with the beads for overnight at 4°C and then the beads were removed by spinning or
magnetic forces. The ACE2+ exosome depletion efficiency was confirmed by MFV on Apogee
and/or western blotting methods.
The altered neutralization effects of NWL and CSB plasma-enriched exosomes (resuspended
pellets) prior to and after bead depletion were measured via flow cytometry as modified RBD
binding to human host cells as described above. And rhACE2 protein (RayBiotech, 230-30165)
was used as a positive control (70-140 ng).
Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism 6.0 Software was used to perform statistical analyses and calculate the IC50. One
way or two ways ANOVA (followed by Tukey or Sidak’s posttest) were used where appropriate.
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). For patient plasma association analyses,
the neutralization data were collected from the laboratory, electronically recorded and verified by
laboratory staff. To reduce bias from batch effects, four different RBD-IgG replicates were
performed. One-way ANOVA test was performed showing the replicates did not show significant
batch errors (F=0.01, p-value>0.9), thus mean values were used for analysis. Log-linear model
(Poisson regression) was fitted to estimate the associations between counts of RBD binding to cells
and independent predictors of interest. This suggested negative associations and the adjusted R2
suggests that integrated ACE2+RBD value explains the relation better than RBD alone (Adj. R 2
=0.623 p<0.0001). Coeffecient from this analysis was used to create graphs in Fig 4g. All statistical
analyses were performed by R 4.0.2.
