Abstract
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic, has

35

led to substantial mortality, together with mass global disruption. There is an urgent need

36

for novel antiviral drugs for therapeutic or prophylactic application. Cathepsin L is a key

37

host cysteine protease utilized by coronaviruses for cell entry and is recognized as a

38

promising drug target. The marine natural product, gallinamide A and several synthetic

39

analogues, were identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin L activity with IC50 values in

40

the picomolar range. Lead molecules possessed selectivity over cathepsin B and other

41

related human cathepsin proteases and did not exhibit inhibitory activity against viral

42

proteases Mpro and PLpro. We demonstrate that gallinamide A and two lead analogues

potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, with EC50 values in the nanomolar range,

thus further highlighting the potential of cathepsin L as a COVID-19 antiviral drug target.

Introduction

47

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is

48

a beta-coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, a respiratory disease that emerged from the

49

Hubei province in China in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic on the 11th

50

of March 2020 (1). Alarmingly, in less than 12 months, COVID-19 has been reported in

51

nearly every country, with over 77 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 1.7

52

million deaths globally (at the time of writing). The COVID-19 pandemic has had a

53

devastating effect on both global health and the functioning of society, and prophylactic and

54

therapeutic intervention strategies are urgently needed. To date, there has been an intense

55

global effort directed towards the development of an effective COVID-19 vaccine, with

56

several candidates, (2) including two mRNA vaccines and a chimpanzee adenovirus-

57

vectored vaccine recently completing phase III human clinical trials (3-5). In addition to an

58

effective prophylactic vaccine, the control of COVID-19, and potentially future SARS

59

coronavirus zoonoses, also requires efficacious antiviral therapeutics. While antiviral drug

60

discovery for SARS-CoV-2 has been the subject of significant effort, the majority of

61

molecules currently in clinical trials are repurposed from other indications for which they

62

were originally approved. Remdesivir is currently the only antiviral drug to be approved by

63

the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19. Whilst this

64

molecule has been reported to show some efficacy during early infection, the drug has

65

performed poorly in a number of trials where it was deemed ineffective, (6, 7) including a

66

recent report from the World Health Organization that suggested remdesivir provided little

67

to no effect in the outcome of COVID-19 infections in hospitalized patients (8). Examples

68

of other repurposing approaches that have been explored, include the use of the

69

hydroxychloroquine, (9-11) the HIV therapy Lopinavir-ritonavir, (12, 13) as well as type I

70

interferon regimens; (14, 15) however, these too have shown no improvement over standard

71

care in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. At the present time, one of the most effective

72

means of improving COVID-19 patient outcomes has been through the use of the

73

glucocorticoid dexamethasone which serves to reduce inflammation-mediated lung injury

74

(16). Taken together, despite significant effort from the global research community, there is

75

still an urgent need to discover effective antivirals for COVID-19 infection that operate

76

through novel mechanisms of action and that are distinctive to the molecules currently in

77

use. While there are obvious benefits to post-exposure drug therapies, the development of a

78

pre-exposure prophylaxis approach, such as what has been employed for HIV, (17) would

79

also be transformative for protecting vulnerable communities.

80

SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% genome identity to the SARS-CoV that emerged in Guangdong

81

province, China in 2002. It is now accepted that the two coronaviruses share similar

82

molecular mechanisms of host cell recognition, entry and replication (18-20). Recognition

83

and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target cells relies on binding between the receptor-binding

84

domain (RBD) of an envelope homotrimeric spike glycoprotein (S) and the host cellular

85

receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Figure 1A). Recently, a second

86

receptor protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, known

87

as CD147, has been identified as mediating spike protein interaction and viral uptake via

88

endocytosis (21). Each monomeric unit of the S protein contains an S1 and S2 subunit that

89

mediate attachment and membrane fusion with host cells, respectively. Host cell entry

90

requires priming of the S protein by cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2ʹ site that enables fusion

91

of viral and cellular membranes. This cleavage has been shown to be carried out primarily

92

by the membrane-bound serine protease TMPRSS2, (19) but can also be performed by the

93

cysteine protease, cathepsin L (CatL) (22, 23). Following entry of the virus into the cell via

94

an endosomal pathway, CatL is responsible for S1 cleavage at acidic pH, conditions where

95

TMPRSS2 is not catalytically functional. Overexpression of CatL in human cell lines

96

enhances SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated viral entry, while circulating CatL is elevated

97

during COVID-19 disease and correlates with progression and severity (24). Finally, it is

98

known that expression of CatL, but not cathepsin B (CatB), is up-regulated by interleukin-

99

6 (IL-6) (25). This is of importance, as there is early evidence that IL-6 is a surrogate

100

inflammatory marker for severe COVID-19 disease with poor prognosis (26). This would

101

imply that CatL is upregulated under these conditions and would therefore be a potentially

102

important target for controlling excessive pathology.

103

This dual role of CatL in the establishment and progression of COVID-19 pathology has

104

therefore reinforced the enzyme as a key drug target for SARS-CoV-2 (27). The importance

105

of both TMPRSS2 and CatL for facilitating viral entry and replication is highlighted by the

106

effectiveness of TMPRSS2 inhibitors, camostat mesylate (19) and nafamostat mesylate (28)

107

and the pan-cysteine protease inhibitors E64d (19) and K777 (23) to reduce virus infection

108

levels of SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV) in a range of human cell lines. Following

109

uncoating and release of the viral RNA from the endosome, translation of the two large viral

110

reading frames gives rise to the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that are subsequently

111

processed by two viral proteases: the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease

112

(PLpro) (18). This gives rise to a number of non-structural proteins (nsps) that subsequently

113

orchestrate viral replication and release from infected cells, to infect new cells. As such,

114

both Mpro and PLpro are also promising antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 (29-32).

115

Gallinamide A 1 (also known as symplostatin 4) is a modified depsipeptide natural product

116

that was independently discovered from marine cyanobacteria of the Schizothrix genus in

117

Panama (33) and Symploca in Florida (34). The natural product has several unusual

118

structural features including a pyrrolinone derived from L-alanine and an ,-unsaturated

119

imide moiety (Figure 1B). Notably, gallinamide A has been demonstrated to be a potent

120

covalent inhibitor of several parasite-derived cysteine proteases (35-37), as well as human

121

CatL (38), with several synthetic analogues of the natural product also shown to have potent

122

in vivo antimalarial activity in a murine model (39). Given the importance of CatL for

123

cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, we sought to investigate whether the CatL inhibitory activity

124

of gallinamide A could be leveraged for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity. Towards this end,

125

in May 2020 we assembled an international consortium to investigate gallinamide A,

126

together with 32 synthetic natural product analogues, as novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2

127

entry. We report herein that several analogues exhibit potent inhibitory activity against CatL

128

with IC50 values in the low nanomolar to picomolar range. Several of these gallinamide A-

129

inspired molecules also possess selectivity over CatB and other related cathepsin proteases

130

and do not inhibit the two viral proteases Mpro and PLpro. Finally, we demonstrate that

131

gallinamide A and two of the most active CatL-inhibiting natural product analogues potently

132

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, with EC50 values in the nanomolar range, thus

133

further highlighting the potential of CatL as a COVID-19 antiviral target.

Results
Gallinamide A inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro via the inhibition of CatL

137

Gallinamide A (1) was initially screened in a SARS-CoV-2 viral infection assay in Vero 76

138

clone E6 cells (VeroE6) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID)

139

to gauge whether the natural product exhibited antiviral activity. Pleasingly, gallinamide A

140

was shown to decrease viral load with an IC90 of 88 nM. Following this, we further validated

141

the activity of the natural product by performing the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assay

142

in our own laboratories using VeroE6 cells and adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal

143

epithelial cells overexpressing ACE2 (A549/ACE2). Briefly gallinamide A (1) was pre-

144

incubated with 4000 VeroE6 cells in a 384-well plate for 30 minutes and then challenged

145

with 0.5 MOI SARS-CoV-2. In the absence of treatment, these conditions lead to viral

146

cytopathic effects (CPE) and cell loss that is correlated to the level of available infectious

147

virus in the initial inoculum after 72 hours. Addition of inhibitors that block viral entry

148

reduces CPE/cell loss in a dose-dependent manner. To obtain a quantitative measure of CPE,

149

the nuclei of live cells were stained, imaged and enumerated using high-content image

150

analysis software. Using this method, we could readily generate dose-dependent sigmoidal

151

inhibition curves and calculated an EC50 of 28 ± 12 nM for gallinamide A from four

152

independent experiments (Figure S1). In parallel, 500 SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were

153

used to infect confluent monolayers of A549/ACE2 cells grown in 96-well plates that had

154

been incubated for 1 hr with serially diluted gallinamide A, followed by assessment of the

155

formation of CPE 96 hrs later under an inverted microscope. This showed that gallinamide

156

A at a concentration as low as 625 nM was capable of completely preventing virus-induced

157

CPE.

158

Recent studies have shown that peptidic inhibitors of CatL and other related cysteine

159

proteases also possess inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (40, 41). In order to

160

assess the comparative activity of gallinamide A against human CatL and the viral proteases

161

Mpro and PLpro, we incubated these proteases with 10 µM of the natural product, and

162

quantified the remaining activity using fluorogenic substrates. CatL activity was completely

163

inhibited by gallinamide A at this concentration, while no inhibition of Mpro or PLpro was

164

observed (Figure 1C).

165

We next sought to determine the abundance of CatL in the VeroE6 and A549 cell lines. A

166

comprehensive bottom-up proteomic analysis was utilized to assess the likelihood that this

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.424111; this version posted December 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

167

protease serves as the physiological target of gallinamide A in cell-based assays (Figure

168

S2, Data File S1). In VeroE6 cells, CatL was among the top 300 most abundant proteins

169

and in comparison, its closely related homologue cathepsin B (CatB), was 10-fold lower in

170

abundance. In contrast, A549 cells had 10-fold higher levels of CatB compared to CatL. In

171

addition to determining the abundance of CatL by proteomics, we confirmed that CatL was

172

catalytically active in VeroE6 cells by incubating lysates with the fluorogenic substrate Z-

173

Phe-Arg-AMC. This activity was completely inhibited by 20 µM of Gallinamide A. CatB

174

can also cleave Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, however when a CatB-specific inhibitor, CA-074(42) was

175

added to the lysate, no inhibitory activity was observed (Figure S3A). These data reveal

176

that there is very little active CatB in VeroE6 lysates relative to CatL. For A549 cell extracts,

177

protease activity using Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was also inhibited by gallinamide A, however most

178

of the activity was also sensitive to CA-074 indicating that CatB is the dominant cysteine

179

cathepsin in these cells (Figure S3B). This activity data is supported by our proteomics

180

analysis of A549 cells where CatB was found to be more abundant than CatL (Figure S2).

181

Taken together, these data suggest that the antiviral activity of gallinamide A is not due to

182

inhibition of viral (MPro and PLpro) protease targets but likely due to inhibition of host-

183

derived CatL. The level of CatL differs substantially in these cell lines which supports

184

published data that some cell lines are more sensitive to cysteine protease inhibition than

185

others (23).

186

Assessment of CatL inhibitory activity of synthetic gallinamide A analogues

187

Three series of synthetic gallinamide A analogues have been developed by our laboratories

188

to date. Series 1 consist of depsipeptide compounds 2-10, with various aliphatic residues

189

incorporated at the pseudo-N-terminus, the α,β-unsaturated moiety and on the pyrrolinone

190

ring (Figure 2) (37). Series 2 is comprised of indolylpyrrolinone analogues 11-23 that have

191

varied functionality at the pseudo-N-terminus and the three amino acid residues within the

192

linear chain (39). Finally, series 3 analogues (24-33) possess a number of biaryl-moieties

193

appended to the pyrrolinone unit, and dimethylvaline or methylpiperidine functionalities at

194

the pseudo-N-terminus. Each of these analogues was subjected to a preliminary inhibitory

195

screen against human CatL, Mpro and PLpro (Figure 3). For the CatL assays, compounds

196

were incubated at 416 nM; the majority of the analogues showed potent inhibition at this

197

concentration, with 21 of the compounds reducing enzymatic activity by more than 90%

198

(Figure 3A). Based on the lack of potency of the parent natural product 1 against Mpro and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.424111; this version posted December 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

199

PLpro, compounds were screened at a higher concentration (10 µM) against these enzymes.

200

As with gallinamide A, none of these analogues showed appreciable inhibition of SARS-

201

CoV-2 Mpro or PLpro under these conditions (Figure 3B). A follow-up screen against CatL

202

at 13 nM identified gallinamide A (1), analogue 3 from series 1, and 17, 19, 20 and 23 from

203

series 2 as being the most potent inhibitors. These were selected for more detailed inhibitory

204

assays against human CatL as described below.

205

The inhibitory potency of gallinamide A (1) and analogues 17, 19, 20 and 23 was next

206

evaluated using dose-response assays against CatL for the determination of IC50 values

207

(Figure 4). An insufficient amount of analogue 3 was available for these experiments, and

208

therefore no further studies were performed with this compound. Gallinamide A (1)

209

exhibited an IC50 of 17.6 pM against CatL (Figure 4A), while the four analogues possessed

210

IC50 values ranging from 6 to 17 pM (Figure 4B-E). Each of the compounds were counter-

211

screened against related human cysteine cathepsins, including CatB, cathepsin V (CatV),

212

cathepsin K (CatK) and cathepsin S (CatS) (Figure 4A-E). While each of the compounds

213

showed inhibitory activity against all cathepsins tested, the IC50 values were generally

214

between 1 and 4 orders of magnitude less potent than for CatL, thus indicating selectivity

215

for CatL over the other cathepsins. In addition to determining the IC50 values, we also

216

determined kinact/Ki values for gallinamide A and the lead analogues for CatL (Figure 4F,

217

Figure S4). Based on the kinact/Ki constants, we determined that analogue 23 was 1.4-fold

218

more potent than the parent natural product 1, while 17, 19 and 20 were between 2.1- and

219

3.2-fold less potent than 1.

220

Given that CatB was detected in our proteomics studies using VeroE6 and A549 lysates

221

(Figure S2), and it has also been recently reported that a broad-spectrum activity-based

222

probe for cysteine proteases was active against both proteases in cell lysates, (23) we also

223

calculated the kinact/Ki values for gallinamide A and the selected lead analogues against

224

CatB. This revealed selectivity values ranging from 8-fold for compound 17 to 112-fold for

225

gallinamide A (Figure 4F, Figure S5) for CatL over CatB. In addition, we evaluated the

226

molecules against mouse CatL (mCatL) to give an initial indication of the future

227

applicability in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the exception of 19, the

228

compounds possessed increased potency against mCatL relative to human CatL (Figure 4F,

229

Figure S6).

231

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Entry into Cells

232

Having established the potent inhibition of CatL and SARS-CoV-2 entry by gallinamide A,

233

and having also demonstrated that synthetic analogues 17, 19, 20 and 23 were also potent

234

inhibitors of the protease, we next assessed these lead analogues against SARS-CoV-2 entry

235

and infectivity in VeroE6 cells. Before embarking on the antiviral assays, each of the

236

analogues were first assessed for cytotoxicity on VeroE6 cells. Pleasingly, none of the

237

compounds exhibited cytotoxicity after 24 hours at up to a concentration of 100 µM in this

238

cell line (Figure S7). Antiviral assays were next performed in VeroE6 cells on the lead

239

analogues using the same high content fluorescence microscopy method described for

240

gallinamide A above. Analogues 19 and 23 both exhibited potent antiviral activity with EC50

241

values of 168 nM and 920 nM, respectively (Table 1, Figure S8). Based on these data, we

242

further assessed the activity of the compounds against SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE in

243

A549/ACE2 cells. In these experiments complete inhibition of CPE was observed at

244

concentrations of 310 nM for 19 and 23 (Figure S9), making them more potent than

245

gallinamide A in these cells. Interestingly, in both cell lines, 17 and 20 exhibited poor

246

antiviral activity with EC50 values greater than 5 µM, despite showing potent inhibition of

247

CatL in vitro (IC50 of 9 and 6 pM, respectively) and complete inactivation of CatL in VeroE6

248

and A549 lysates at 10 µM (Figure S3). The reduced activity of 17 and 20 compared to 1,

249

19 and 23 in the antiviral assay may be owing to poor cell permeability of these compounds.

250

While both CatL and TMPRSS2 can mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells by

251

facilitating S protein priming, (22) evidence suggests that the predominant mechanism of

252

entry is dependent on the relative levels of the two proteins in a given cell line (19, 28, 41).

253

To assess the effect of the lead compounds 1 and 19 in a TMPRSS2 overexpressing cell

254

line, we used MRC-5/ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells which we also verified to possess CatL, albeit

255

in lower abundance than in VeroE6 and A549 cells (Figure S2). Gratifyingly, both 1 and

256

19 were able to completely neutralize SARS-CoV-2 entry into this cell line at a

257

concentration of 32 nM (Figure S10), thus suggesting that CatL is still important for viral

258

entry in these TMPRSS2 overexpressing cells. Interestingly, while the TMPRSS2 inhibitor

259

Nafamostat mesylate was able to block infection in MRC-5/ACE2/TMPRSS2 (albeit with

260

neutralization at 4 µM concentrations), it did not exhibit notable antiviral activity on VeroE6

261

cells (Figure S10). These data suggest that both TMPRSS2 and CatL protease pathways are

262

operational and important for infectivity in MRC-5/ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells, but that CatL is

the predominate pathway in VeroE6 cells, consistent with the levels of each protein in these

264

cells (Figure S2).

Discussion
Pathogenic coronaviruses are now well recognized for their potential to induce substantial

269

human morbidity and mortality. To bring the current global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2

270

under control will ultimately require mass implementation of a safe and effective vaccine.

271

Whilst recent vaccine results show promise, challenges remain with respect to protecting

272

unvaccinated individuals or vulnerable populations. In previous epidemics, where vaccines

273

were limited, either by efficacy or reach within the community, antivirals served as the

274

cornerstone for fighting disease. This has been recently observed for two major viral

275

pathogens, HCV, which is now readily curable with a short course of antivirals, and HIV.

276

Whilst HIV cannot be cured by therapeutic approaches, it can be readily managed through

277

pre-exposure prohylaxis (PreP) or treatment post-exposure with antivirals. While it is

278

acknowledged that respiratory diseases like SARS-CoV-2 present many unique challenges

279

with respect to antiviral strategies, it is feasible that equivalent success in PreP development

280

could in turn lead to the protection of vulnerable communities, such as healthcare workers

281

or the elderly within care facilities. In addition, PreP-based approaches may reduce the viral

282

reproductive rate in communities with high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Even if PreP antiviral

283

strategies were limited to lowering viral load, this would improve not only prognosis but

284

also limit the onward spread to the next host.

285
286

Early in pandemics, clinically ready drugs provide the fastest means for effective treatment.

287

However, to date, many repurposed drugs have not provided any evidence of clinical benefit

288

for SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of dexamethasone, a steroid rather than an antiviral

289

agent, for late-stage disease. With the virus entrenched within the global population, and

290

new more infectious strains emerging (43), we now require compounds that target the virus

291

with greater potency and breadth. Previous studies have indicated that CatL inhibitors have

292

the potential to serve as antivirals for a range of coronaviruses, including HCoV-229E (44),

293

MERS-CoV (45) and SARS-CoV-1 (46). SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell entry is

294

enhanced by overexpression of CatL in human cell lines, and recent evidence suggests

295

elevated levels of circulating CatL is also correlated with COVID-19 disease progression

296

and severity (24). Importantly, targeting a host protease, as opposed to a viral protease

297

specific to one virus or viral strain, may provide the best opportunity for broad spectrum

298

antiviral activity that is less susceptible to rapidly progressing viral mutations. CatL is

299

therefore a promising drug target for SARS-CoV-2, and also for other current or future

300

coronavirus strains, as well as other virus families including the Filoviridae, such as the

301

Ebola virus (45).

302
303

Historically, nature has been the single most successful source for the discovery of new

304

pharmaceutical lead compounds, especially in the areas of anti-infective and anticancer

305

agents (47). In this work, we demonstrate that gallinamide A, a peptide-based natural

306

product isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, and two synthetic analogues of the natural

307

product, possess potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in monkey (VeroE6) and

308

human (A549) cells. Specifically, the parent natural product exhibited the most potent

309

inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells, with an EC50 of 28 nM, whereas analogues 19

310

and 23 were the most potent in A549/ACE2 cells (complete inhibition of CPE at 310 nM).

311

We show that these molecules were able to inhibit CatL in both cell lines, and could

312

selectively target recombinant CatL over other related cysteine cathepsins in vitro, with no

313

host cell cytotoxicity up to 100 µM. Based on this potent CatL inhibitory activity of

314

gallinamide A, and the structural analogues, it is tempting to speculate that the evolution of

315

this cyanobacterially-derived molecule has been guided and optimized by activity at a

316

cysteine protease target related to CatL.

317
318

CatL is a lysosomal enzyme that plays a key role in intracellular protein degradation in our

319

cells. Expression of this enzyme is dysregulated in several human diseases, including cancer

320

(48), arthritis (49) and diabetic nephropathy (50), with therapeutics in development for these

321

ailments (51). Mice deficient for this gene exhibit hair loss (52), bone and heart defects (53,

322

54), and enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection (55). Therefore, targeting of this host

323

enzyme for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections may pose a risk for side-effects. However,

324

treatment for coronavirus infection would likely be short-term, aiming to reduce viral entry

325

and early replication until host innate and adaptive responses can be developed. There are

326

already a number of FDA-approved drugs that possess inhibitory activity against CatL (27).

327

Furthermore, recent studies have shown that K777, a potent irreversible inhibitor of CatL

328

consisting of a dipeptide-vinyl sulfone, was found to be well tolerated in rodents, dogs and

329

nonhuman primates (56), and an IND has been opened with the FDA for its use as a

330

therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 infection (23). Importantly, synthetic gallinamide A

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.424111; this version posted December 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

331

analogues have already been safely examined in vivo for other infectious indications (39).

332

Our studies showed that gallinamide A and the most promising synthetic analogues maintain

333

potency against mouse CatL and therefore future work in our laboratories will investigate

334

in vivo efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infection models.

335
336

While CatL shows clear promise as a suitable drug target, the entry pathways for SARS-

337

CoV-2 are complex and can be endosomal or at the cell membrane, with the latter driven by

338

the serine protease TMPRSS2 (19). Tropism of the virus is equally complex. Oropharyngeal

339

tissue is well known for its ability to facilitate transmission and contributes to the early

340

stages of disease, whilst once established, infection can proceed across many organ types

341

outside of the respiratory tract, including kidneys, liver, heart, brain, and blood (57). CatL

342

and TMPRSS2 are both highly expressed in lung tissue (58), however treatment of infection

343

across multiple different cell types and organ systems may require preferential inhibition at

344

the membrane (TMPRSS2) or in the endosome (CatL). Future studies will therefore also

345

seek to incorporate inhibitors of the major fusogenic entry pathways for the virus. This

346

combination approach may have an added benefit, in that it may allow lower doses of the

347

individual drugs to be utilized due to synergism in the mechanisms of action.

348
349

In summary, we demonstrate here that the marine natural product, gallinamide A and several

350

synthetic analogues, are potent inhibitors of CatL, a key host cysteine protease involved in

351

the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Lead molecules possessed selectivity over CatB and

352

other related human cathepsin proteases and did not exhibit inhibitory activity against viral

353

proteases Mpro and PLpro. Gallinamide A and two lead analogues potently inhibited SARS-

354

CoV-2 infection in vitro, which now serve as leads for the future development of therapeutic

355

or prophylactic drug candidates. Importantly, this work also highlights the potential of CatL

356

as a bone fide target for the development of novel antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 or other

357

pathogenic coronaviruses.

364

of 200 µM Mu-HSSKLQ-AMC (Sigma-Aldrich, SCP0224) in the same buffer was then

365

added and protease activity was quantified at 25 °C. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 PLpro was

366

purchased from Acro Biosystems, PAE-C5184. 49 nM of this enzyme was incubated with

367

10 µM of each compound at 25 °C for 15 minutes in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM

370

Cathepsin L was purchased from R&D Systems (952-CY), and 50 pM of the enzyme was

371

incubated with 416 nM and 13 nM of each compound and separately with 10 µM of

372

gallinamide A at 25 °C for 15 minutes in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, 5 mM DTT, 0.01%

373

BSA, 1 mM EDTA. An equal volume of 5 µM of Z-FR-AMC (Sigma-Aldrich, C9521) was

374

then added. All assays were performed in triplicate wells and DMSO was used as a vehicle

375

control. The final volume of each reaction was 30 µL, and fluorescence was measured at

376

360/460 nm (ex/em) using a Biotek® Synergy M2 fluorescence plate reader. Activity was

377

normalized to wells lacking inhibitor but containing 0.01% DMSO in assay buffer.

378

Dose-response studies: Recombinant human cathepsin B (953-CY), cathepsin S

379

(1183-CY), cathepsin V (1080-CY) and were purchased from R&D Systems. Human

380

cathepsin K (BML-SE553) was purchased from Enzo. 1.11 nM of cathepsin L, cathepsin B,

381

cathepsin V, cathepsin K and 4.44 nM of cathepsin S were preincubated for 30 minutes at

382

25 oC with 3333 to 0.006 nM of each compound in 40 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, 5 mM

383

DTT, 0.001% BSA, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl. Remaining protease activity was then

384

detected using a final concentration of 40 µM of Z-FR-AMC (Sigma-Aldrich, C9521).

385

Fluorescent activity was recorded as outlined above. For kinact/Ki studies, mouse cathepsin

386

L (1515-CY) was purchased from R&D Systems. Human CatL, human CatB and mouse

387

CatL (1 nM) were assayed at 25 °C in 30 µL reaction volumes containing 40 mM sodium

388

acetate pH 5.5, 5 mM DTT, 0.001% BSA, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 40 µM of Z-FR-

389

AMC (Sigma-Aldrich, C9521) in the presence of 555.56 to 0.01 nM of each compound in

390

quadruplicate wells. To calculate the IC50, inhibitor and substrate were added

391

simultaneously to the enzyme and the rate of AMC release was determined from 0 to 30

392

min and compared to a DMSO control. To calculate Ki and kinact, the rate of product

393

formation was calculated at 6 min intervals for 1 h and normalized to activity in the control

394

wells containing DMSO. kobs values for each inhibitor concentration were calculated from

395

inactivation curves, and inhibition constants kinact and kinact/Ki were calculated by

396

nonlinear regression of kobs and inhibitor concentration using GraphPad Prism 9 software.

402

Cytotoxicity assays: Cytotoxicity of lead compounds was determined by an Alamar

403

Blue HS (Invitrogen) cell viability assay as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, VeroE6

404

(ATCC® CRL-1586™) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)

405

with 4.5 g/L D-Glucose, L-Glutamine and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 10% foetal

406

calf serum (Sigma) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml, Gibco). 5x104 cells were seeded

407

into wells of a 96-well flat bottom culture plate (Corning) and once adhered, compounds

408

were added at varying concentrations and incubated for 24 hours (37 oC, 5% CO2). Alamar

409

Blue HS cell viability reagent (Invitrogen) was added and the cells further incubated for 2-

410

4 hours. Relative fluorescent units (RFU) were determined per well at ex/em 560/590 nm

411

(Tecan Infinite M1000 pro plate reader). Increasing RFU is proportional to cell viability.

412

Cell lines for SARS-CoV-2 infection assays: VeroE6 cells (ATCC® CRL-

413

1586™) were maintained in Minimal Essential Media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%

414

FBS and subcultured according to the supplier’s instructions. MRC-5 cells stably expressing

415

human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were generated by transducing MRC-5 cells (ATCC CCL-

416

171) with lentiviral particles. Briefly, the ORFs for hACE2 (Addgene#1786) and

417

hTMPRSS2a (Addgene#53887) were cloned into lentiviral expression vectors

418

pRRLsinPPT.CMV.GFP.WPRE (60) and pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen (Clontech) respectively.

419

Lentiviral particles expressing the above proteins were produced by co-transfecting

420

expression plasmids individually with a second generation lentiviral packaging construct

431

decoy approach. The MRC5 and A549 cells were analysed using the Homo

432

sapiens proteome database and the VeroE6 cells using the Chlorocebus sabaeus proteome

433

database, both of which were from Uniprot.

434

VeroE6 and A549 cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mM MES pH 6.0; 100 M

435

AEBSF, 1 µM pepstatin A, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT buffer and protein concentration in

436

the cleared supernatant was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid assay with BSA as a

437

protein standard. 225 ng of total protein was incubated with 20 µM of 1, 17, 19, 20, 23, CA-

438

074 (MilliporeSigma #205530) and E-64 (Alfa Aesar #J62933) for 30 minutes in 50 mM

439

sodium acetate pH 5.5; 5 mM DTT; 1 mM EDTA; 1 µM pepstatin; 100 µM AEBSF, and

440

then mixed with equal volume of 50 µM of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC in the same buffer. Activity

441

was normalized to wells that lacked inhibitor but contained 0.2% DMSO in assay buffer.

442

SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibition assay: A high content fluorescence microscopy

443

approach was used to assess the ability of gallinamide A and the synthetic analogues to

444

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in permissive cells. The compounds were initially diluted in

445

cell culture medium (MEM-2% FCS) to make 2x working stock solutions and then serially

446

diluted further in the above media to achieve a 2-fold dilution series. 20 L of each dilution

447

was then added to cells seeded a day prior at 3x103 cells in a volume of 40 L of MEM-2%

448

FCS per well in a 384-well plate (Corning #CLS3985). The plates containing the cells and

449

compounds were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C, 5% CO2 following which 20 L of

450

virus solution at 8x103 TCID50/mL (63) was added to the wells. Plates were incubated at

451

37 °C, 5% CO2 for a further 72 hours following which the cells were stained with NucBlue

452

dye (Invitrogen, #R37605) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The entire 384-well

453

plate was imaged using the InCell 2500 (Cytiva) high throughput microscope, with a 10×

454

0.45 NA CFI Plan Apo Lambda air objective. Acquired nuclei were then counted in high

455

content using InCarta high-content image analysis software (Cytiva) to give a quantitative

456

measure of CPE. Virus inhibition/neutralization was calculated as %N= (D-(1-Q))x100/D,

457

where; “Q” is the value of nuclei in test well divided by the average number of nuclei in

458

untreated uninfected controls, and “D”=1-Q for the wells infected with virus but untreated

459

with inhibitors. Thus, the average nuclear counts for the infected and uninfected cell

460

controls get defined as 0% and 100% neutralization respectively. To account for cell death

461

due to drug toxicity, cells treated with a given compound alone and without virus were

462

included in each assay. The % neutralization for each compound concentration in infected

463

wells was normalised to % neutralization in wells with equivalent amount of compound but

464

without the virus to yield the final neutralization values for each condition.

465

At the University of Texas Medical Branch, A549/ACE2 cells were grown in M-10

466

media and treated with 500 SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (USA_WA1/2020 isolate) prior to

467

addition of 20 to 0.156 µM of compound. After cultivation at 37 °C for 4 days, individual

468

wells were observed by an inverted microscope for determining the status of virus-induced

469

formation of cytopathic effect (CPE). The efficacy of individual compounds was calculated

470

and expressed as the lowest concentration capable of completely preventing virus-induced

471

CPE in 100% of the wells. All compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO as 10 mM stock

472

solutions and diluted in culture media and experiments using infectious virus were

473

conducted under BSL-3 conditions.
