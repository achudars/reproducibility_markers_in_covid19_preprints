Abstract

32

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised an urgent

33

need to develop effective therapeutics against the severe acute respiratory syndrome

34

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N)

35

protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and

36

multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered

37

that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)

38

both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we

39

found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of

40

SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover,

41

we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene

42

the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the

43

condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the

44

LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding

45

modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of

46

antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may

47

provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against

48

SARS-CoV-2.

50

To date, tens of millions of people have been infected with severe acute respiratory

51

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the outbreak of the respiratory disease

52

named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a newly emerged member of the

53

coronavirus family, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus, which

54

has probably the largest genome (approximately 30 kb) among all RNA viruses. The

55

nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly responsible for recognizing and

56

wrapping viral RNA into helically symmetric structures, and thus insulates the viral

57

genome from external environment1. It was also reported that N protein can boost the

58

efficiency of transcription and replication of viral RNA, implying its vital and

59

multifunctional roles in the life cycle of coronavirus2,3. Considering the abundant

60

expression and high immunogenicity of N protein during viral infection, accumulating

61

studies have been performed to investigate the potential of N protein to serve as an

62

antiviral drug target4-7.

63
64

In recent years, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been shown to offer a highly

65

efficient mechanism to spatially and temporally modulate the cellular processes, such

66

as

67

remodeling13,14. Currently, more and more researches have shown that LLPS also

68

participates in multiple aspects of viral infection, including viral replication,

69

transcriptional regulation, and the formation of stress granules to modulate host

70

immune response15-22. In general, viral transcription and replication tend to take place

71

in a specific intracellular compartment called viral factory or viral inclusion22-24, and

72

particularly the replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) in coronaviruses25-27.

73

Recent studies on negative-strand RNA viruses such as rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis

74

virus (VSV) and measles virus (MeV), have indicated that LLPS is a common

75

mechanism for N protein and phosphoprotein (P protein) to form viral inclusion-like

76

structures17-19. Despite these known evidences of LLPS in negative-strand RNA viruses,

77

it is unclear whether the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses undergoes

78

LLPS and how the N protein driven phase separation participates in viral multiplication.

80

In this study, we determined the unique characteristics of the phase separation driven

81

by the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 (termed SARS-CoV-2-N) both in vitro and in vivo.

82

The influence of individual protein domains, mutations and nucleic acids on the phase

83

condensation of SARS-CoV-2-N was also depicted. Importantly, the interplay between

84

the N protein-viral RNA complex of SARS-CoV-2 (termed SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA) and

85

nsp12, the key component of the coronavirus RTCs, was demonstrated to be mediated

86

by LLPS. Furthermore, we found that two small molecules targeting the SARS-CoV-2-

87

N are able to intervene the phase separation properties of the N protein-viral RNA-

88

nsp12 (termed SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA-nsp12) complex, which may improve the

89

accessibility of other antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their viral targets (e.g.,

90

nsp12/RdRp). Our findings thus open a new opportunity for developing efficacious

91

therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.

94

SARS-CoV-2-N undergoes phase separation in vitro and in vivo

95

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (termed SARS-CoV-2-N), in common

96

with that of other coronaviruses, contains an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD)

97

and a dimerization domain at its C terminus (CTD) (Fig. 1a and see Extended Data Fig.

98

1). The remaining domains of SARS-CoV-2-N are highly disordered, and contain three

99

intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), with one also displaying prion-like activity,

100

according to the predictions using IUPred228,29 and PLAAC30 programs (Fig. 1a). As

101

accumulating evidence has shown that the proteins with intrinsically disordered and

102

prion-like properties are generally prone to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation

103

(LLPS)31-34, it is natural to ask whether SARS-CoV-2-N also displays the LLPS

104

characteristics. To answer this question, we first expressed and purified the recombinant

105

SARS-CoV-2-N protein with an mEGFP-tag (a monomeric variant of EGFP, A206K)

106

or a His-tag using a prokaryotic expression system (see Extended Data Fig. 2a, b).

107

Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that SARS-CoV-2-N readily self-associated

108

to form numerous micron-sized spherical condensates (Fig. 1b, c). Further time-lapse

109

observations revealed that the SARS-CoV-2-N condensates fused and coalesced into

110

larger ones upon their intersections (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Video 1), indicating the

111

liquid-like properties of SARS-CoV-2-N condensates. We also used fluorescence

112

recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to further study the dynamics of internal

113

molecules within the N protein condensates. Recovery of fluorescence within the

114

bleached regions (Fig. 1e) showed that SARS-CoV-2-N can partially freely diffuse

115

within the condensed phase, consistent with their liquid-like behavior. In addition,

116

phase condensation of SARS-CoV-2-N was sensitive to increasing ionic strength (Fig.

117

1f): at low protein or high salt concentrations, SARS-CoV-2-N remained dissolved in

118

solution and no droplets were observed, whereas at high protein or low salt

119

concentrations, it condensed into droplets, suggesting that electrostatic interactions are

120

important for its condensation. Collectively, the above results demonstrated that SARS-

121

CoV-2-N is capable of undergoing LLPS in vitro.

122
123

Next, we examined whether SARS-CoV-2-N can also undergo LLPS in vivo, by

124

ectopically expressing an mCherry tagged version of SARS-CoV-2-N in cells. We

125

observed that SARS-CoV-2-N formed numerous puncta-like structures upon

126

expression in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1g). We further evaluated the dynamicity of SARS-

127

CoV-2-N within these puncta using FRAP, and the spatiotemporal analysis of bleaching

128

events showed that SARS-CoV-2-N redistributed rapidly from the unbleached area to

129

the bleached one (Fig. 1g, h). In addition, time-lapse observations revealed that the

130

SARS-CoV-2-N puncta fused into larger condensates right after their interactions (Fig.

131

1i, Supplementary Video 2). All together, these results showed that SARS-CoV-2-N is

132

also able to undergo LLPS in vivo.

Viral RNA modulates phase condensation of SARS-CoV-2-N

159

It was previously reported that the N protein of coronavirus prefers to bind to the

160

intergenic regions and exhibits high binding affinity with the UCUAA pentanucleotide

161

repeats5,35,36. Given this fact, it would be interesting to know whether viral RNA can

162

affect the phase separation behavior of SARS-CoV-2-N. To investigate this problem,

163

we synthesized a 30-nt single-strand RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (genomic region 28,248-

164

28,277), which contained a UCUAA pentanucleotide and was labeled with Cy5. We

165

found that the addition of this viral RNA to the purified SARS-CoV-2-N solution at a

166

physiological salt concentration (150 mM NaCl) resulted in robust co-phase separation

167

of these two components, which was more predominant than that of a single one alone

168

(Fig. 2a). Compared to the condensates of SARS-CoV-2-N alone (Fig. 1d), the droplets

169

of N protein-RNA (termed SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA) complex were more spherical (Fig.

170

2b, Supplementary Video 3). In addition, the condensates of SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA

171

complex exhibited slightly higher molecular exchange rates than those of N protein

172

alone (Fig. 1e, 2c). To further study the phase separation properties of this two-

173

component (i.e., N protein and nucleic acid) system under different conditions, we

174

examined its condensation behaviors at different constituents. As in other two-

175

component phase separation systems31,37, the complex of SARS-CoV-2-N and viral

176

RNA also exhibited an optimal molecular ratio of condensation (Fig. 2d, e). Moreover,

177

although the synthesized viral RNA, the host-derived RNA (β-actin RNA), the dsRNA

178

and the ssDNA (both derived from viral RNA sequence) all induced phase separation,

179

viral RNA displayed the most prominent effect (Fig. 2f, g) in regulating the LLPS of

180

SARS-CoV-2-N. Thus, viral RNA plays a dominant role in promoting the phase

181

separation of SARS-CoV-2-N in vitro, and modulating the liquid-like properties of the

resulting condensates.

The intact structure of SARS-CoV-2-N is crucial to phase separation

202

To determine the contributions of individual domains of SARS-CoV-2-N to its phase

203

separation, we first designed and expressed five truncations using a prokaryotic

204

expression system (Fig. 3a and see Extended Data Fig. 2a) and then examined their

205

phase separation properties at various ratios of N protein to viral RNA (Fig. 3b). For a

206

protein/RNA ratio of 1 or 2 (i.e., 1.5 μM protein/1.5 μM RNA or 3 μM protein/1.5 μM

207

RNA, respectively), only full-length (FL) SARS-CoV-2-N exhibited the ability to phase

208

separate (Fig. 3b). When the protein/RNA ratio reached 4 or even 8 (i.e., 6 μM

209

protein/1.5 μM RNA or 12 μM protein/1.5 μM RNA, respectively), although the

210

truncations also formed phase-separated condensates, their LLPS ability was much

211

weaker than that of the full-length SARS-CoV-2-N protein (Fig. 3b, c). All these results

212

indicated that all domains contribute to phase separation of SARS-CoV-2-N.

258

serine-arginine (SR) rich region in the IDR2 domain of SARS-CoV-2-N was the hot

259

spot, and harbored 7 of the top 10 most frequent mutations. The SR residues are

260

generally considered potential phosphorylation sites, and the alternation of their

261

phosphorylation states can impact both RNA binding and intracellular transportation of

262

the N protein of coronavirus42-45. Among all the known missense mutations in SARS-

263

CoV-2-N, R203K was of the highest frequency and always associated with other

264

mutations (Fig. 3d), indicating that probably it was one of the earliest mutations. Next,

265

we expressed and purified a number of mutated SARS-CoV-2-N protein in vitro,

266

including R203K, S194L, S197L, and S188L mutants (4 among the top 5 mutations)

267

(see Extended Data Fig. 2b), and then examined their phase separation capacity.

268

Interestingly, these mutants displayed markedly weaker phase separation than the wild-

269

type N protein (Fig. 3e). Thus, it is conceivable that the SR rich region acts as a

270

regulatory hub to modulate the biological functions of SARS-CoV-2-N through turning

271

its phase separation properties.

CVL218 and PJ34 interact with SARS-CoV-2-N and affect the internal dynamics

275

Considering the phase separation properties of SARS-CoV-2-N in vitro and in vivo, we

276

want to know whether there exist small molecules or drugs that can intervene the viral

277

life cycle through changing the condensation of this protein. According to our previous

278

study, two poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, CVL218 and PJ34, exhibit

279

binding potential to SARS-CoV-2-N, as discovered by a machine learning based drug

280

repositioning strategy6. Our surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays confirmed that

281

these two small molecules both interact with SARS-CoV-2-N, with CVL218 showing

282

a higher binding affinity (KD=4.7 μM, Fig.4a) than PJ34 (KD=696 μM, Fig. 4b). Since

283

the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of SARS-CoV-2-N are

284

highly conserved and play important roles in RNA binding and self-dimerization46, we

285

next investigated whether they are responsible for the interactions with these two small

286

molecules. Unexpectedly, neither NTD nor CTD alone bound to CVL218 or PJ34

287

according to our in vitro SPR results (see Extended Data Fig. 3), implying that the entire

288

structure and conformation of SARS-CoV-2-N, including NTD, CTD and IDRs, are

289

essential for the interactions with CVL218 or PJ34.

290
291

Next, we examined whether CVL218 and PJ34 can influence the phase separation

292

behavior of SARS-CoV-2-N with viral RNA. We observed that the addition of CVL218

293

or PJ34 had little effect on the number or morphology of the puncta of SARS-CoV-2-

294

N-RNA complex, comparing to DMSO treatment (Fig. 4c). Nevertheless, the

295

fluorescence intensity of the condensates with CVL218 or PJ34 treatment recovered

296

faster than that with DMSO treatment after photobleaching (Fig. 4d, e), demonstrating

297

that CVL218 and PJ34 can both enhance the internal mobility of the condensates of

298

SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA complex.

321

Nsp12, a core component of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex in

322

SARS-CoV-2, forms the coronavirus transcription and replication machinery with nsp7

323

and nsp8 together (Fig. 5a). It was previously reported that N protein can cooperate

324

with RdRp to facilitate viral infection25. However, the underlying mechanisms still

325

remain largely obscure. To further explore whether the interplay between N protein and

326

RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by phase separation, we also purified the nsp12

327

protein (see Extended Data Fig. 2c) and examined its potential involvement in LLPS.

328

We observed that nsp12 alone cannot undergo phase separation under physiological salt

329

condition (Fig. 5b), whereas it readily converted to amorphous condensates when

330

mixed with viral RNA (see Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition, FRAP assays indicated

331

that the fluorescence intensity of nsp12-RNA condensates cannot recover after

332

photobleaching (Supplementary Video 4), implying that little molecular exchange

333

occurs within the resulting solid-state condensates. Nevertheless, we found that nsp12

334

can be readily recruited into the SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA condensates without changing

335

their morphological shapes and arrangements (Fig. 5b). Here, the highly concentrated

336

condensates of SARS-CoV-2-N-nsp12 complex may provide a favorable condition for

337

fast viral replication in vivo.

347

Next, we sought to examined whether CVL218 or PJ34 can affect the phase

348

condensation properties of SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA-nsp12 complex. Interestingly, the

349

sizes of SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA-nsp12 condensates in the CVL218 or PJ34 treated group

350

were much larger than those of the corresponding group without nsp12 (Fig. 5d-e and

351

see Extended Data Fig. 5). More importantly, no matter with or without nsp12, the sizes

352

of SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA condensates under CVL218 or PJ34 treatment were

353

significantly larger than those of the DMSO treated group (Fig. 5c-f). Moreover, FRAP

354

assays indicated that the fluorescence recovery rates of SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA-nsp12

355

condensates were faster in the CVL218 or PJ34 treated group than those of the control

356

treatment (Fig. 5g, h). Thus, our results suggested that CVL218 and PJ34 can induce a

357

more dynamic condition to facilitate the intermolecular exchange of internal molecules

358

within the droplets of SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA-nsp12 complex in vitro. The accelerating

359

exchange rates of internal molecules within the droplets may loosen the solid-state

360

condensation of the nsp12-containing RdRp complex and thus benefit the entrance of

361

other antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) into their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp).

Discussion

409

Our results showed that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is capable of undergoing LLPS,

410

and extra addition of viral RNA further facilitates its phase separation, which has also

411

been recently confirmed by several independent research teams47-49. Moreover, with in-

412

depth study, we discovered that nsp12/RdRp can be recruited into the condensates of

413

SARS-CoV-2-N-RNA complex. Furthermore, in terms of the intervention of the SARS-

414

CoV-2-N driven phase separation, we set up an experimental workflow for compound

415

verification and proposed a conceptual framework for developing the small molecule-

416

based therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, based on a rationale of combination therapy

417

to target both N protein and nsp12/RdRp.

418
419

Our work suggests that LLPS is likely to be the driving force of the connection between

420

N protein and the replication and transcription complexes (RTCs), and thus altering the

421

N-driven LLPS can possibly intervene viral multiplication and infection. Normally,

422

many non-structural proteins (nsps) of coronavirus anchor in double-membrane

423

vesicles and convoluted membranes and are packaged into RTCs in infected cells25-27.

424

The dynamics of RTCs is generally relatively low, implying that they display relatively

425

static structures and probably their communications with the surroundings rely on other

426

components26. Yet, N protein is so far the only known structural protein of coronavirus

427

that shuttles into and outside RTCs and plays a vital role in coordination with the RdRp

428

complex25-27. Likewise, in the negative-strand RNA viruses, a granular structure termed

429

inclusion body particularly stays in cytoplasm serving as a site of viral replication and

430

transcription15,17-19,22. Interestingly, two structural proteins, i.e., N and P proteins, have

431

been shown to be sufficient to spontaneously form an inclusion body-like structure

432

mediated by LLPS in rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and measles virus

433

(MeV)17-19. Here, we showed that in SARS-CoV-2, nsp12 can be recruited into the

434

condensates of N protein, which are then turned to exhibit more liquid-like

435

characteristics. Therefore, LLPS is probably an efficient mechanism to organize N

436

protein and nsp12 together in SARS-CoV-2 to achieve fast viral replication. Of course,

437

more evidence is needed to answer whether LLPS is a common mechanism for the
21

438

formation of viral-specific compartments in other viruses.

439

Although extensive studies have been conducted on developing effective therapeutics

440

against coronavirus through primarily targeting the spike protein and viral enzymes

441

(e.g., nsp12/RdRp, 3C-like protease and papain-like protease), there is little success of

442

these strategies. According to our results, we speculate that the LLPS characteristics of

443

N protein may be one of the underlying reasons for the failure of many anti-coronavirus

444

drugs. A related evidence comes from a recent study showing that a number of

445

antineoplastic drugs cannot freely diffuse, but rather become partitioned in specific

446

protein condensates in vitro50. This result supports the hypothesis that altering the

447

biophysical properties of condensates may improve the distribution and efficacy of

448

drugs. In our study, we observed that in vitro nsp12 and viral RNA form amorphous

449

condensates, implying that their complex is relatively immobile, which is also

450

consistent with the previous observations on the dynamics of RTCs25-27. The solid state

451

of nsp12-RNA complex may exclude the nsp12 targeting drugs (e.g., remdesivir51-53)

452

from the surrounding solution, which thus provides a possible explanation on why many

453

nucleotide analog drugs as broad-spectrum viral RdRp inhibitors have poor

454

performance in the treatment of coronavirus54,55.

455
456

As a proof of concept on discovering an intervention of the N protein driven LLPS, we

457

identified two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, with the ability to affect the

458

condensation properties of the SARS-CoV-2-N-nsp12 complex. These two compounds

459

can influence the morphology of the N protein driven condensates, and also augment

460

their sizes in vitro (Fig. 5f). Meanwhile, we also observed an increasing number of

461

puncta of overexpressed mCherry-N in Vero-E6 cells, after CVL218/PJ34 treatment

462

(see Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). In addition, these two small molecules both tune the

463

SARS-CoV-2-N-nsp12 droplets to become more liquid-like, thus increasing the

464

exchange with the surrounding solution and attenuating the molecular interactions

465

within the condensates. Based on these observations, we speculate that CVL218 and

466

PJ34 may act as bulking agents to reduce the local density of the SARS-CoV-2-N-nsp12

467

condensates. The increasing penetrability may possibly contribute to the access of other

468

small-molecule drugs into the condensates. Therefore, we propose that CVL218 or PJ34

469

can be applied to facilitate the entrance of other antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir51-53)

470

into RTCs by remodeling the communications between N protein and RTCs and

471

promoting the permeability of RTCs (Fig. 5i). Our results suggest that the N protein

472

driven LLPS is a promising target for the design of antiviral drugs, and the deep

473

understanding into the functional roles of N protein in regulating the accessibility of

474

RTCs will thus advance the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies.

were constructed by seamless cloning kits (Beyotime, D7010M) and confirmed by

with a 1:1 molar ratio of Alexa Fluor™ 546 carbox (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for 1 h

515

at room temperature with continuous stirring. Then, the free dyes were removed by

516

centrifugation in MICROSPIN G-50 column (GE Healthcare, 27-5330-01). The labeled

517

proteins were stored at −80°C. For in vitro phase separation experiments, 5% labeled

518

protein was mixed with unlabeled before use.

520

Synthesis of RNA and DNA

521

The 5’-Cy5-labeled 10-bp viral RNA oligo (AGCUGAUGAG) and 30-bp RNA oligos

522

(viral RNA: GAUUUCAUCUAAACGAACAAACUAAAAUGU; human β actin

523

RNA: UCACCAACUGGGACGACAUGGAGAAAAUCU) with were synthesized at

524

HIPPOBIO, LLC. The double-strand RNA was annealed at 25 μM in the annealing

525

buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl) using a thermocycler, during which

526

the oligos were heated up to 95 °C for 2 min and gradually cooled to 25°C over an hour.

527
528

Phase separation assays

529

In vitro LLPS experiments were performed at room temperature. All samples were

530

seeded and recorded on 384 low-binding multi-well 0.17 mm microscopy plates (In

531

Vitro Scientiﬁc) and sealed with optically clear adhesive ﬁlm. For phase separation

532

assays with the mEGFP-N protein of SARS-CoV-2, solutions of GFP fusion proteins

533

were diluted to the indicated final concentrations in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mM

534

NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA and 1mM MgCl2 in a total volume of 10 µl to induce

535

phase separation. For the N proteins without tags, the assays were performed in 20 mM

536

Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl. For phase separation assays treated with small

537

molecules, CVL218 or PJ34 (dissolved in 1% DMSO) were added to the well mixed

538

phase separation samples prior to imaging at a final concentration of 20 μM. The group

539

treated with 1% DMSO was used as the control.

540

For in vivo assays, Vero E6 cells were seeded into 4-well chamber 35 mm dishes with

541

a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. For cells to reach 70% confluent, 1 µg pCDNA3.1-

542

mcherry-N plasmid was transfected, with the replacement of normal cell culture

543

medium by that supplemented with CVL218 or PJ34 at a final concentration of 20 µM.

544

For the control wells, cell medium containing 1% DMSO was added. Imaging was

545

performed with a NIKON A1 microscope equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective.

546

NIS-Elements AR Analysis was used to analyze the images.

548

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements in vivo and in

549

vitro

550

FRAP experiments were carried out with a NIKON A1 microscope equipped with a

551

100× oil immersion objective. Droplets were bleached with the corresponding laser

552

pulse (3 repeats, 80% intensity, and dwell time 1 s). Recovery from photobleaching was

553

recorded for the indicated time point.

555

Mutation frequency analysis

556

To perform the mutation frequency analysis of SARS-CoV-2-N protein, we used 61,003

557

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences downloaded from the China National Center for

558

Bioinformation, 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource39 (downloaded on July 6th, 2020).

559

We considered all the missense mutations among the N protein region (from positions

560

28,274 to 29,530 in the genome).

561
562

Surface plasmon resonance assays

563

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays were performed on Biacore S200 with a CM5

564

sensor chip (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) at room temperature. The full-length N

565

protein, NTD and CTD of SARS-CoV-2 were all diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH

567

contained 1×PBS-P with 2% DMSO. The tested drugs (CVL218 or PJ34) in 2-fold

568

serial dilutions were made in the running buffer. The solutions flowed through the chip

569

surface at a flow rate of 20 μL/min at room temperature (25℃). The dissociation

570

constants (KD) of CVL218 and PJ34 binding to full-length N protein, NTD and CTD

571

were calculated from the association and dissociation curves of the sensorgrams using
