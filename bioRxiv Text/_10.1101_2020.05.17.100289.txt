Abstract

13

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for an unprecedented global

14

pandemic of COVID-19. Animal models are urgently needed to study the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and to

15

screen candidate vaccines and treatments. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are considered the gold standard model

16

for many infectious pathogens as they usually best reflect the human condition. Here, we show that African green

17

monkeys support a high level of SARS-CoV-2 replication and develop pronounced respiratory disease that may

18

be more substantial than reported for other NHP species including cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. In

19

addition, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mucosal samples of all animals including feces of several animals as late

20

as 15 days after virus exposure. Importantly, we show that virus replication and respiratory disease can be

21

produced in African green monkeys using a much lower and more natural dose of SARS-CoV-2 than has been

22

employed in other NHP studies.

Introduction

24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease

25

2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly swept the globe. As of May 16, 2020, over

26

4.4 million confirmed cases and 302,000 deaths have been reported worldwide [1]. The COVID-19 crisis has

27

inflicted an immense toll on human health causing profound socioeconomic effects that will linger for years to

28

come.

29

Vaccines and treatments against SARS-CoV-2 could drastically reduce COVID-19 transmission, saving

30

lives and brightening prospects for economic recovery. No licensed countermeasures currently exist, although a

31

number of clinical trials are underway. While clinical testing is a good predictor of preventative and drug efficacy,

32

caution is warranted with this approach due to the potential for disease enhancement. Vaccine candidates

33

against SARS-CoV-1, including inactivated whole-virus, recombinant DNA subunit, virus-like particle, and live

34

virus vector-based vaccines, induced an immunopathology following immunization and experimental infection of

35

mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates (NHPs) suggesting hypersensitivity to virus components [2-5]. Given the

36

strong genetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 [6], an appropriate surrogate for human COVID-19 is

37

needed to safely evaluate prophylactics. A careful assessment in animal models could reveal possible immune

38

complications elicited by vaccines and therapies prior to their release to the public. Moreover, animal models

39

could help shed light on important aspects of the disease in ways that are not easily addressed or feasible in

40

humans, such as how the virus spreads and interacts with the host immune system.

41

An ideal COVID-19 animal model would replicate all facets of human disease. Several animal species

42

including mice, hamsters, ferrets, and NHPs were found to support SARS-CoV-2 replication and displayed

43

varying degrees of non-lethal illness when the virus was delivered into the respiratory tract of these animals [7-

44

13]. While each of these models has utility in the study of COVID-19, NHPs have the closest physiological

45

resemblance to humans allowing a better comparison of host responses to infection. This genetic similarity has

46

also contributed to the increased availability of reagents to perform in-depth analyses of the immune response.

47

Recently, the first studies evaluating the pathogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus and rhesus

48

macaques were performed. Rhesus macaques developed pneumonia and clinical signs whereas disease in

49

cynomolgus macaques was fairly mild indicating the former appears to better reflect more severe cases of

50

COVID-19 [10-12]. These results suggest certain NHP species may serve as better models than others for

51

coronavirus infections. For SARS, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-1, African green monkeys (AGMs) were

52

found to support the highest level of viral replication, followed by cynomolgus macaques and rhesus macaques

53

when all three species were challenged in parallel [14]. Only AGMs had notable replication in the lower

54

respiratory tract following SARS-CoV-1 inoculation; necropsy of these animals indicated focal interstitial

55

mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and edema in the lung consistent with human SARS. As SARS-CoV-1 and

56

SARS-CoV-2 share the same putative host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [15, 16], we

57

reasoned that AGMs might serve as a useful model for COVID-19.

58

Here, we infected AGMs with a low passage isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/INMI1-

59

Isolate/2020/Italy) and evaluated their potential as a model for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2/INMI1-Isolate/2020/Italy

60

was isolated from the first clinical case in Italy [17] and is the first V clade virus (GISAID) to be experimentally

61

inoculated into NHPs. We demonstrate AGMs mimic several aspects of human disease including a high degree

62

of viral replication and severe pulmonary lesions. This model can be used to conduct pathogenesis studies and

63

to screen potential vaccines and therapeutics.

64
65

Results

66

We challenged six adult AGMs with 5.0 x 105 PFU of the Italy isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/INMI1-

67

Isolate/2020/Italy) by combined intratracheal (i.t.) and intranasal (i.n.) routes (dose divided equally). A cohort of

68

three animals was euthanized at 5 dpi, while the remaining three animals were held indefinitely. Blood from all

69

animals was sampled on days 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and continuing with days 7, 9, 12, 15, and 21 for animals held

70

past 5 dpi. No overt clinical signs of disease were observable in any of the animals, other than decreased appetite

71

compared to baseline (0 days post-infection; dpi) in 5/6 animals, and a brief period of elevated body temperature

72

suggestive of fever in two of three animals at 3 dpi (Supplementary Figure 1). A biphasic increase in partial O2

73

pressures were noted in two animals over the course of the study, but no overt changes in partial CO2 pressures

74

in any animals were noted (Figure 1-A,B). Transient shifts in leukocyte populations and mild thrombocytopenia

75

were observed in all animals, most prominently during days 2-7 post-infection (Supplementary Table 1, Figure

76

1-C,D,E,F). Markers for renal and hepatic function mostly remained unchanged (< 2-fold increases in ALT, AST,

77

ALP); however, CRP, a marker of acute systemic inflammation, was elevated two to seven-fold in all animals 2-

78

5 dpi (Table 1, Figure 1-G,H,I,J). Thoracic radiographs were taken on -1, 2, 3, 4, 5 dpi, and were shown to be

79

inconclusive (Supplementary Figure 2). Gross examination at necropsy of three AGMs at 5 dpi revealed varying

80

degrees of pulmonary consolidation with hyperemia in all monkeys (Figure 2). Lesions were multifocal to locally

81

extensive within each lobe. The most severe lesions were located in the dorsal aspects of the lower lung lobes

82

in all animals. A board-certified veterinary pathologist approximated lesion severity for each lung lobe

83

(Supplementary Table 2) Small intestines in all monkeys were segmentally flaccid and distended with gas and

84

yellow liquid contents. Mild lymphoid enlargement was noted in one of the three monkeys. There were no other

85

significant gross lesions.

86

Histologically, all three AGMs at 5 dpi developed varying degrees of multifocal pulmonary lesions. In the

87

most severely affected monkey, histologic features of pneumonia include acute inflammation centered on

88

terminal bronchioles and numerous multinucleated giant cells with irregularly distributed nuclei. Continuous with

89

the terminal bronchiolitis was evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membrane formation, type

90

II pneumocyte hyperplasia, pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage. Occasionally, small fibrous tissue

91

proliferations were noted within the terminal airways reminiscent of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia

92

(BOOP)-like lesions. Interstitial pneumonia was noted in the lesser affected regions of the lung along with

93

congestion and increased numbers of alveolar macrophages. In the less affected monkeys, pulmonary lesions

94

lack acute inflammation within the terminal bronchioles; however, interstitial pneumonia is present and in one

95

monkey, multinucleated giant cells with irregularly distributed nuclei were prominently displayed within

96

bronchioles. Colocalization of SARS antigen with pulmonary lesions were demonstrated with antibodies against

97

SARS N protein. Positive immunohistochemical labeling was noted diffusely within the cytoplasm of alveolar

98

macrophages, respiratory epithelium, type I pneumocytes and type II pneumocytes. One animal had only positive

99

immunolabeling in respiratory epithelium. Genomic SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected by in situ hybridization in

100

pneumocytes and associated with the alveolar macrophages within acute inflammation centered on terminal

101

bronchioles (Figure 3).

102

We quantified viral load from mucosal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collected on

103

procedure days by RT-qPCR and plaque titration (Figure 4). All animals had detectable quantities of vRNA and

104

infectious virus from nasal secretions beginning at 2 dpi, with viral titers ranging from ~2-4 log PFU/mL (Figure

105

4-A,B). Both viral RNA (vRNA) and infectious virus were detected from oral swabs from only three animals

106

(AGM-2, AGM-5, AGM-6) 3 dpi, and persisted in AGM-5 up to 7 dpi (Figure 4-C,D). Infectious virus was only

107

detectable from the rectal swab of a single animal (AGM-3) 3-5 dpi; however, vRNA was also detected from

108

AGM-4 and AGM-5 (Figure 4-E,F). Both vRNA and infectious virus was present in BAL fluid from all animals

109

beginning at 3 dpi (Figure 4-G,H). Neither vRNA nor infectious virus was detected by RT-qPCR of RNA from

110

whole blood or plaque titration of plasma from any animal, indicating a lack of circulating cell-associated or free

111

virus in the peripheral blood (data not shown).

112

Similar to human cases of COVID-19, systemic concentrations of a number of inflammatory cytokines

113

and chemokines were elevated following AGM infection. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory IL-8, IP-10, IL-12, and

114

monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) peaked at 2 DPI corresponding to subsequent recruitment of

115

monocytes and neutrophils in the blood (Figure 1-D,E, Figure 5-C,D,E,F). Increased secretion of IL-6, IFN-beta,

116

and IL-10was also evident at this time point (Figure 5-A,G,H). Notably, IL-6 is thought to predict respiratory failure

117

in human COVID-19 cases and may serve as an effective immunological biomarker [18]. As IL-6 is a main

118

regulator of acute phase fibrinogen synthesis, and elevated fibrinogen and other coagulation abnormalities are

119

thought to correlate with disease severity in hospitalized patients [19, 20] , we also measured levels of this

120

clotting factor. Fibrinogen levels surged in 4 of 6 monkeys indicating potential coagulation abnormalities in these

121

animals (Figure 5-B). This increase in circulating fibrinogen aligns with our gross pathology findings of substantial

122

hemorrhage in the lung of monkeys euthanized at 5 DPI. Collectively, these results indicate the host response

123

to SARS-CoV-2 infection in AGMs parallels that of humans.

124

Four animals seroconverted against SARS-CoV-2, including all three animals held past 5 dpi, with the

125

earliest detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG occurring at 5 dpi in AGM-3, AGM-4, and AGM-6 (Figure 6-A). IgG

126

titers peaked at 15 dpi, with AGM-6 exhibiting low titers at 15 and 21 dpi compared to AGM-4 and AGM-5.

127

Neutralizing titers (50% plaque reduction values) ranged from 1:8-1:32 were evident beginning at day 5 in one

128

animal and all three animals followed to the study endpoint (Figure 6, B,C,D,E).

Discussion

131

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and its astonishingly rapid evolution from localized outbreak to pandemic threat

132

has emphasized the importance of coronaviruses with regards to human health globally, particularly of those

133

clustering with lineage B betacoronaviruses. Accordingly, a necessity exists for the development of animal

134

models for SARS-CoV-2 which recapitulate the COVID-19 disease phenotype observed in humans. With regard

135

to NHPs, efforts to do so have been made using both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques [11-13, 21], with rhesus

136

macaques more closely exhibiting the symptoms of COVID-19 disease in humans. Given that AGMs have shown

137

utility as disease models for a number of respiratory pathogens (i.e., Nipah [22], SARS-CoV-1 [14]), we

138

investigated their suitability as a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

139

AGMs challenged with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 from Italy did not develop overt, debilitating clinical

140

illness; however, changes in leukocyte subpopulations, thrombocytes, and serum markers of acute inflammatory

141

processes indicated a systemic response to infection. Using surgically implanted temperature data loggers we

142

were able to detect elevated body temperatures in two animals 3 dpi, indicative of fever. Moreover, all animals

143

held past 5 dpi seroconverted, with two animals achieving high IgG titers (1:6400). The third animal held to 21

144

dpi never had an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer above 1:200, suggesting a dampened humoral response in this

145

animal, and that immune arms other than humoral immunity may be important during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

146

Additionally, the potential for re-infection in humans with SARS-CoV-2 has been speculated, but the risk factors

147

or actual incidence are unknown. However, antibody titers to endemic human coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E)

148

are reported to gradually wane and re-infection with the homologous virus has been reported [23, 24].

149

An important aspect of the AGM model for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the development of pronounced viral

150

pneumonia. All AGMs in our study exhibited pulmonary consolidation with hemorrhage, varying in severity

151

between animals and lung lobes. We performed thoracic radiographs on all six SARS-CoV-2-infected AGMs;

152

however, the radiographs while consistent with work on SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques recently published by

153

others [11, 12, 21] did not reflect the degree of lesions and hemorrhage of the lungs seen at necropsy. It is our

154

opinion that the radiographs from our study as well as those from the other COVID-19 NHP studies do not

155

convincingly demonstrate SARS-CoV-2-induced disease.

156

radiographs could be nonspecific and due to atelectasis, poor inspiratory effort, and BALS collection procedures.

157

Important to this discussion, the current recommendation in humans is to not even use radiography for the

158

primary diagnosis of COVID-19. Notably, a recent study of 636 ambulatory patients with COVID-19 did not

159

detect any abnormalities in chest X rays of almost 60% of the cases [25]. The use of computed tomography (CT)

160

scanning or even plesmography techniques may be more informative for detailed pulmonary investigations using

161

animal models.

Specifically, opacities and changes observed in

162

There was evidence of gastrointestinal involvement in the SARS-CoV-2-infected AGMs, which has been

163

reported in human cases [23], as the putative SAR-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE-2 is expressed in the epithelium

164

of the ileum and colon [26]. However, while all animals in our study exhibited abnormalities within the small

165

intestine, we did not observe signs of gastrointestinal distress during the study course, with the possible

166

exception of decreased appetite in most animals.

167

Our data show that infection of AGMs with SARS-CoV-2 results in the release of inflammatory mediators

168

with similar immune signatures as human cases. Several groups reported that levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10

169

correlate with disease severity in human patients [27, 28]. In this study, we observed increased serum levels of

170

these interleukins as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines elevated in human cases.

171

Moreover, we detected a rise in fibrinogen in a majority of monkeys, another prominent finding in human COVID-

172

10 cases. Fibrinogen is implicated in thrombosis and vascular injury suggesting this discovery warrants further

173

investigation. Together, these results indicate the AGM model can be used to study the host response to COVID-

174

19. The heterologous response of AGMs along with the ability to collect tissues and longitudinal samples permits

175

a detailed study of pathogenesis and immunity to COVID-19.

Methods

178

Virus

179

The virus (SARS-CoV-2/INMI1-Isolate/2020/Italy) employed was isolated on January 30, 2020 from the sputum

180

of the first clinical case in Italy, a tourist visiting from the Hubei province of China that developed respiratory

181

illness while traveling [17]. The virus was initially passaged twice (P2) on Vero E6 cells; the supernatant and cell

182

lysate were collected and clarified following a freeze/thaw cycle. This isolate is certified Mycoplasma and FMDV

183

free. The complete sequence was submitted to GenBank (MT066156) and is available on the GISAID website

184

(BetaCoV/Italy/INMI1-isl/2020: EPI_ISL_410545) upon registration. For in vivo challenge, the P2 virus was

185

propagated on Vero E6 cells and the supernatant was collected and clarified by centrifugation making the virus

186

used in this study a P3 stock.

188

Animal challenge

189

Animals were anesthetized with ketamine and inoculated with ~5 × 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-

190

2/INMI1-Isolate/2020/Italy) with the dose being equally divided between the intratracheal (i.t.) (5.0 ml) and the

191

intranasal (i.n.) (1.0 ml total at 0.5 ml per nostril) routes for each animal. Animals were longitudinally monitored

192

for clinical signs of illness including temperature (measured by surgically implanted DST micro-T small

193

implantable thermo loggers (Star-Oddi, Gardabaer, Iceland), respiration quality, and clinical pathology. All

194

measurements requiring physical manipulation of the animals were performed under sedation by ketamine. All

195

animal studies were approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Institutional Animal Care and

196

Use Committee and adhere to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

197

198

Radiographic technique

199

All monkeys were imaged with a portable GE AMX-4+ computed radiography system using a DRTECH detector

200

set at a 36 inch focal film distance. Images were captured and evaluated using the Maven Patient Image Software

201

in ventral dorsal (VD) and right lateral (R LAT) positions at 50 kVp and 12.5mA as previously described [22].

202

Chest radiographs were captured and interpreted by a double board-certified clinical veterinarian and veterinary

203

pathologist and reviewed by a MD board-certified radiologist.

204

205

RNA isolation from SARS-CoV-2-infected AGMs

206

On specified procedure days (days 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 15, 21), 100 μl of blood was added to 600 μl of AVL viral

207

lysis buffer (Qiagen) for virus inactivation and RNA extraction. Following removal from the high containment

208

laboratory, RNA was isolated from blood and swabs using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen).

209

210

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 load

211

RNA was isolated from blood and mucosal swabs and assessed using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 N2 assay

212

primers/probe for reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)[29]. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using

213

One-step probe RT-qPCR kits (Qiagen) run on the CFX96 detection system (Bio-Rad), with the following cycle

214

conditions: 50°C for 10 minutes, 95°C for 10 seconds, and 45 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds and 55°C for

215

30 seconds. Threshold cycle (CT) values representing SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed with CFX Manager

Software, and data are presented as GEq. To generate the GEq standard curve, RNA from Vero E6 cells infected

217

with SARS-CoV-2/INMI1-Isolate/2020/Italy was extracted and the number of genomes was calculated using

218

Avogadro’s number and the molecular weight of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

219

Virus titration was performed by plaque assay with Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) from all blood plasma

220

and mucosal swabs, and BAL samples. Briefly, increasing 10-fold dilutions of the samples were adsorbed to

221

Vero E6 cell monolayers in duplicate wells (200 μl). Cells were overlaid with EMEM agar medium plus 1.25%

222

Avicel, incubated for 2 days, and plaques were counted after staining with 1% crystal violet in formalin. The limit

223

of detection for this assay is 25 PFU/ml.

washes to develop the colorimetric reaction. The reaction was stopped with 3M sulfuric acid 5-10 minutes after

245

OPD addition and absorbance values were measured at a wavelength of 492nm on a spectrophotometer

246

(Molecular Devices Emax system, Sunnyvale, CA). Absorbance values were normalized by subtracting normal

247

wells from antigen-coated wells at the corresponding serum dilution. A sumOD value > 0.6 was required to

248

denote a positive sample. End-point titers were defined as the reciprocal of the last adjusted serum dilution with

249

a value ≥ 0.20.

250

251

Serum neutralization assay

252

Neutralization titers were calculated by determining the dilution of serum that reduced 50% of plaques (PRNT50).

253

We incubated a standard 100 PFU amount of SARS-CoV-2 with two-fold serial dilutions of serum samples for

254

one hour. The virus-serum mixture was then used to inoculate Vero E6 cells for 60 minutes. Cells were overlaid

255

with EMEM agar medium plus 1.25% Avicel, incubated for 2 days, and plaques were counted after staining with

256

1% crystal violet in formalin.

258

Bead-based cytokine and coagulation immunoassays

259

Concentrations of immune mediators and fibrinogen were determined by flow cytometry using LegendPlex

260

multiplex technology (BioLegend). Serum levels of cytokines/chemokines and plasma levels of fibrinogen were

261

quantified using a Nonhuman Primate Inflammation 13-plex (1:4 dilution) or Human Fibrinolysis (1:10,000

262

dilution) panel, respectively. Samples were processed in duplicate following the kit instructions and

263

recommendations. Following bead staining and washing, 1500-4000 bead events were collected on a FACS

264

Canto II cytometer (BD Biosciences) using BD FACS Diva software. The raw .fcs files were analyzed with

265

BioLegend’s cloud-based LEGENDplex™ Data Analysis Software.

267

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry

268

Necropsy was performed on all subjects euthanized at day 5. Tissue samples of all major organs were collected

269

for histopathologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) examination and were immersion-fixed in 10% neutral

270

buffered formalin. Specimens were processed and embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm thickness. For

271

IHC, specific anti-SARS immunoreactivity was detected using an anti-SARS nucleocapsid protein rabbit primary

antibody at a 1:800 dilution for 60 minutes (Novusbio NB100-56683). The tissue sections were processed for

273

IHC using the ThermoFisher Scientific Lab Vision Autostainer 360 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Secondary antibody

274

used was biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 1:200 for 30 minutes

275

followed by Vector Streptavidin Alkaline Phosphatase at a dilution of 1:200 for 20 min (Vector Laboratories,

276

Burlingame, CA). Slides were developed with Bio-Red (Biopath) for 7 minutes and counterstained with

277

hematoxylin for one minute.

278

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues was

279

performed using the RNAscope 2.5 high definition (HD) RED kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA)

280

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 20 ZZ probe pairs targeting the genomic SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

281

(S) gene were designed and synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (catalogue 848561). After sectioning,

282

deparaffinization with xylene and graded ethanol washes and peroxidase blocking, the sections were heated in

283

RNAscope target retrieval reagent buffer (Advanced Cell Diagnostics catalogue 322000) for 15 minutes and then

284

air-dried overnight. The sections were then digested with Protease III (catalogue 322340) at 40C in the HybEZ

285

oven (HybEZ, Advanced Cell Diagnostics catalogue 321711) for 15 minutes. Sections were exposed to ISH

286

target probe and incubated at 40C in the HybEZ oven for 2 hours. After rinsing, the signal was amplified using

287

the manufacturer provided pre-amplifier and amplifier conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and incubated with a

288

red substrate-chromogen solution for 10 minutes, counterstained with hematoxylin, air-dried, and cover slipped.

Figure 1: Hematological features of AGMs infected with SARS-CoV-2. Blood was collected from AGMs on
procedure days (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 21). Partial pressures of CO 2 and O2 were obtained using an iSTAT
Alinity hematological analyzer (Abbott). Leukocyte subpopulations and thrombocytes were differentiated and
quantified using a Vetscan HM5 hematological analyzer (Abaxis). Serum analytes (ALT, AST, ALP, CRP) were
quantified using a Piccolo serum biochemistry analyzer (Abaxis). For all graphs, dashed lines and open
symbols (AGM-1, AGM-2, AGM-3) indicate AGMs sacrificed 5 dpi; solid lines (AGM-4, AGM-5, AGM-6)
indicate AGMs held to 21 dpi.

Figure 6: Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and virus neutralization in AGMs. Anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgG binding titers were determined using traditional ELISA methodology where the antigen was whole infected
cell lysate (background subtraction was performed using virus negative cell lysate) and titers are represented as
reciprocal dilutions (A.). Antibody neutralization titers were also determined for sera collected 5 dpi (B), 7 dpi
(C), 15 dpi (D), and 21 dpi (E). Data plotted represents the percent reduction in plaque counts (average of
duplicate wells) compared to the average of three independent virus control plates (average plaque count across
all three plates = 75). Dashed lines on each graph indicate 50% neutralization compared to the virus control plates.
All plaque counts were calculated from duplicate wells at each dilution.
