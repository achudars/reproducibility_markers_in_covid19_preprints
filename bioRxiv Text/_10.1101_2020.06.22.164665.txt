Abstract

35
36

Background: The novel coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV) has been affecting global health since
the end of 2019 and there is no sign that the epidemic is abating . The major issue for controlling

37

the infectious is lacking efficient prevention and therapeutic approaches. Chloroquine (CQ) and

38
39

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been reported to treat the disease, but the underlying mechanism
remains controversial.

40
41

Purpose: The objective of this study is to investigate whether CQ and HCQ could be ACE2 blockers
and used to inhibit 2019-nCoV virus infection.

42

Methods: In our study, we used CCK-8 staining, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining

43
44

to evaluate the toxicity and autophagy of CQ and HCQ, respectively, on ACE2 high-expressing
HEK293T cells (ACE2 h cells). We further analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2

45
46

by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped
virus was also used to observe the viropexis effect of CQ and HCQ in ACE2h cells.

47
48

Results: Results showed that HCQ is slightly more toxic to ACE2h cells than CQ. Both CQ and
HCQ could bind to ACE2 with KD =(7.31±0.62)e-7 M and (4.82±0.87)e-7 M, respectively. They

49
50

exhibit equivalent suppression effect for the entrance of 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus into
ACE2h cells.

51

Conclusions: CQ and HCQ both inhibit the entrance 2019-nCoV into cells by blocking the binding

52
53

of the virus with ACE2. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of CQ
and HCQ treatment effect on virus infection.

Introduction

57

Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are effective antimalarial drugs (White, 1996).

58

The sole difference between their chemical structures is the presence of a hydroxymethyl group on

59
60

HCQ as against a methyl group on CQ. The hydroxymethyl group enables HCQ to be absorbed in
the human gastrointestinal tract faster and distributed in the body to larger extent than CQ (Rainsford

61
62

et al., 2015; Schrezenmeier and Dorner, 2020). Since 2004, reports on the anti-viruses effects of CQ
and HCQ have gradually increased. For example, CQ can inhibit the replication of SARS and HIV

63

viruses in vitro, and it also has significant inhibitory effects on Borna, avian leukemia and Zika

64
65

viruses. (Al-Bari, 2017; Keyaerts et al., 2004; Savarino et al., 2006). Therefore, CQ and HCQ have
been considered broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

66

Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV (also called SARS-CoV-2) in 2020, there have been reports of

67

CQ and HCQ used in clinical treatment. For example, clinical trial reports issued by 10 hospitals in

68

China indicate that CQ may shorten the duration of the disease (Gautret et al., 2020). A small

69
70

nonrandom clinical trial in France showed that HCQ combined with azithromycin has a significant
therapeutic effect (Gautret et al., 2020), and it has been reported that CQ can effectively inhibit the

71
72

deterioration of new coronary pneumonia, improve lung imaging performance, promote viral
reversion and shorten the time of disease onset(Gao et al., 2020). It has been hypothesized that HCQ

73

aerosols can be inhaled early in infection, allowing for the sufficient therapeutic effects on alveolar

74
75

epithelial cells while avoiding the adverse effects of large oral doses(Klimke et al., 2020). However,
it has also been reported that the combination of HCQ and azithromycin in 11 patients with severe

76
77

2019-nCoV infection has not achieved a positive clinical effect (Molina et al., 2020). Another
observational study showed that HCQ had no effect on the intubation or composite endpoint of death

78

(Geleris et al., 2020). There is still a lack of randomized controlled trials of HCQ in the treatment

79

of patients with 2019-nCoV.

80

At present, it is generally believed that the 2019-nCoV enters the host cell by binding to ACE2 on

81

the plasma membrane of the cells, causing infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020;

82

Zheng et al., 2020). Therefore, blocking or antagonizing the ACE2 signaling pathway in susceptible

83
84

cells should be beneficial in the prevention of 2019-nCoV infection (Wu et al., 2020). Abdelli et al.
conducted a molecular docking experiment between CQ and ACE2 and found that CQ binds to

85
86

ACE2 with low binding energy and forms a stable complex system (Abdelli et al., 2020). Studies
have shown that ACE2 is a type I membrane-bound glycoprotein composed of 805 amino acids,

87

mainly distributed in vascular endothelial cells, alveolar and renal tubular epithelial cells, and

88
89

profoundly expressed in tissues such as heart, kidney, retina, and gastrointestinal tissue (Xiao et al.,
2020). Flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation studies have shown that during alveolar epithelial

90
91

cell infection with SARS virus, CQ and HCQ can prevent the binding of viral S protein to ACE2 by
disrupting ACE2 terminal glycosylation (Brufsky, 2020; Vincent et al., 2005). Virus infection

92

experiments in vitro confirmed that CQ could reduce the infection of cells by 2019-nCoV, and play

93
94

a role in both the entry and post-entry stages of viral infection. At the same time, HCQ can
effectively reduce the 2019-nCoV copy number (Wang et al., 2020b).

95

Recently, there have also been reports of adverse reactions of HCQ and CQ. A clinical trial of 90

96

patients with 2019-nCoV infection in the United States showed that 2019-nCoV positive patients

97

receiving HCQ treatment had a higher risk of prolonged QTc, suggesting a risk of cardiotoxicity

98

(Mercuro et al., 2020). At the same time, in a clinical trial of 197 2019-nCoV positive patients in

99
100

China, CQ showed a significant therapeutic effect without severe adverse reactions (Mingxing et
al., 2020). The above evidence suggests that the adverse effects of CQ treatment in 2019-nCoV

101
102

posotive patients may be lower than that of HCQ. The curative effect and mechanism of the anti2019-nCoV of CQ and HCQ are still controversial.

103

In this study, we found that CQ and HCQ can antagonize ACE2 and inhibit the entry of 2019-nCoV

104

spike pseudotyped virus into ACE2 expressed HEK293T cells (ACE2 h cells).

using the same method.

138

Apoptosis assay

139

ACE2h cells were seeded in a six-well plate and treated with different concentrations of CQ and

140
141

HCQ (0, 10, 20 and 40 μM) for 24 h. Cells were collected and washed with PBS and resuspended
in 400 μL of 1 × binding Buffer. Annexin V-FITC (5 μL) was added to the cells and incubated 26 °C

142
143

in the dark for 15 min. PI (10 μL) was added to the cells and incubated in an ice bath for 5 min.
Detection was performed within 30 min. The excitation wavelength of the flow cytometer (Accuri

144

C6 Plus, BD Biosciences, Beijing, China) was 488 nm, and the emission wavelength was 530 nm

145
146

to detect FITC, while PI was detected at 575 nm. Normal cells had low fluorescence intensity.
Apoptotic cells had strong green fluorescence, and necrotic cells had double staining with green and

147

red fluorescence.

148

Western blotting

149
150

Total proteins from different cells were extracted in ice-cold conditions using RIPA lysis buffer
containing 10% protease inhibitor and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The protein concentration

151

was determined using a BCA Protein Quantification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

152
153

The protein in the cell lysates was denatured by boiling the samples for 5 min with a 5 × loading
sample buffer and equal amounts of protein were separated on a 10% gel using SDS‐PAGE. The

154
155

separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and blocked by
constant stirring with 5% nonfat milk in Tris‐buffered saline containing Tween-20. The membranes

156

were then incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: anti-ACE2 (1:500,

157

EPR4435, Abcam), anti-LC3 (1:1000, #2775, Cell Signaling Technology [CST]) and anti-GAPDH

158

(1:2000, a#2118, CST). The membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated

159
160

with secondary antibodies (a dilution of 1:20,000 in TBST) for 1 h at 37°C. The membranes were
washed three times with TBST for 10 min and developed using ECLkit. A Lane 1 DTM

161
162

transilluminator (Beijing Creation Science, Beijing, China) was used to capture the images of the
developed blots, and Image-Pro Plus 5.1 software (Rockville, MD, USA) was used to quantify the

163

protein levels.

164

Immunofluorescence assays

165

ACE2h cells (2×103) were seeded on 24 mm×24 mm coverslips. and incubated overnight at 37 °C

166

with 5 % CO2 .10 μM, 20 μM or 40 μM CQ and HCQ were added to the slides and treated for 24 h.

167

The slides were then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde, followed with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min

168
169

and 5% BSA solution for 1 h at 26°C after washing three times with PBS. The cells were then
continuously incubated with LC3 primary antibody at 37°C for 3 h, and the fluorescent secondary

170
171

antibody at 26°C for 2 h followed with TRITC-Phalloidin stain for 30 min at 26°C . Finally, the
cells were mounted with 50 μL of DAPI-containing anti-fluorescence quenching reagent. All the

172

cells were observed using a laser confocal fluorescence microscope.

173

Docking Studies

174

Molecular docking studies were carried out using SYBYL-X 2.0 version. The small molecules and

175

X-ray crystal structure of the protein (PDB code: 6M0J) were imported. Water molecules were

176

removed and hydrogen was added. Tripos force field and Pullman charge were applied to minimize.

177

CQ and HCQ were depicted by the Sybyl/Sketch module (Tripos Inc.), optimized by Powell’s

178

method with the Tripos force field with convergence criterion at 0.005 kcal/( Å mol), and assigned

179

using Gasteiger–Hückel method.

180

Surface plasmon resonance assay

181

For assessment of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), ACE2 protein with a 6-his tag (30 μg/mL) was

182
183

fixed on a carboxyl sensor chip (Nicoya, Canada) by capture-coupling. Then, CQ or HCQ at 6.25,
12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μM was injected sequentially into the chamber in PBS running buffer. The

184

interaction of ACE2 with the fixed small molecules was detected using Open SPRTM (Nicoya

185
186

Lifesciences, Waterloo, Canada) at 25°C. The binding time and disassociation time were both 2 50
s, the flow rate was 20 μL/s, and the chip was regenerated with hydrochloric acid (pH 2.0). A one-

187
188

to-one diffusion-corrected model was fitted to the wavelength shifts corresponding to the varied
drug concentration. The data were retrieved and analyzed using TraceDrawer.

189

Detection of 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus entry into ACE2h cells

190

For this process, 5 × 104 of ACE2h cells in 50 μL DMEM per well were seeded into white 96‐well

191
192

plates. The cells were cultured in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO 2 for 2 h. Medium (25 μL)
was aspirated carefully from 96 wells, 25 μL medium containing the corresponding dose of the

193

medicine was added and incubated for 2 h. Then 5 μL of 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus was

194
195

added (Sino Biological, PSC001), and incubated in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO 2 for 4 h
followed with adding 100 μL of complemented DMEM per well. After 6-8 h of further infection,

196
197

the culture medium containing the virus was removed and replaced by 200 μL of fresh DMEM, and
incubated continuously at 37℃ for 48 h, the culture medium was aspirated and 20 μL of cell lysate

198

was added from the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, E1500) to each well, Following this, 100

199
200

μL of luminescence solution was added to wells before the luciferase luminescence detection,
chemiluminescence was detected by a microplate reader under 560 nm, with exposure time of 1 s.

201

Statistical analysis

202

Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SD) and were statistically analyzed

203
204

using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Two-tailed tests were used for comparisons between two
groups, and differences were considered statistically significant at p <0.05.

206

Effect of CQ and HCQ on ACE2h cell viability

207

The expression of ACE2 protein in human lung and bronchial-related cells was higher than that in

208

HEK293T cells. The expression of ACE2 protein in ACE2h cells was significantly higher than that

209
210

in other cells, indicating that ACE2h cells were successfully constructed. It has been reported that
AT2 cells express the highest ACE2 receptors in lung and bronchial cells (Zou et al., 2020). We

211
212

confirmed that the highest expression of the ACE2 protein occurred in AT2 cells. In addition, this is
the first report that EOL-1 cells also express the ACE2 protein (Figure 1A).

213

As shown in Figure 1B, CQ and HCQ had no significant effect on the activity of ACE2h cells when

214

the concentration was less than 50 μM, and the survival rate of ACE2h cells could be reduced in a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.164665; this version posted August 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

215

dose-dependent manner when the concentration was above 50 μM. The inhibition of HCQ on the

216
217

activity of ACE2h cells was more significant than that of CQ. It can be concluded that the toxicity
of HCQ was higher than that of CQ on ACE2h cells at different time points at the same

218
219

concentrations (Figure 1C). At a concentration of 20 μM, the statistical difference appeared at 6 h.
Ca2+ is an essential second messenger in several cell pathways, as shown in Figure 1D, and CQ or

220

HCQ rarely affects Ca2+ influx change in ACE2h cells. Figure 1E shows that within 24 h, the

221

concentrations of both drugs had no significant effect on apoptosis.

222

CQ and HCQ induce LC3-mediated autophagy in ACE2 h cells

223

Autophagosome is a spherical structure and as an essential marker for autophagy, and LC3 is known

224

to be stably associated with the autophagosome membranes. LC3 includes two forms LC3-I and

225
226

LC3-II, LC3-I is found in the cytoplasm, whereas LC3-II is membrane-bound and converted from
LC3-I to initiate formation and lengthening of the autophagosome. Therefore, to investigate the

227
228

effects of CQ and HCQ induced autophagy on ACE2h cells, FITC-LC3, TRITC-Phalloidin and
DAPI staining were used. Activating lysosomal (green) and filamentous actin (F-actin, red) was

229

detected after stimulation with 10, 20 and 40 μM of CQ and HCQ in ACE2 cells (Figure 2A).

230

We further pretreated ACE2h cells with CQ and HCQ, and measured the expression of ACE2h cells

231
232

autophagy proteins LC3-I and LC3-II by Western blotting. We found that the expression level of
LC3 and LC3-II increased in CQ and HCQ-treated ACE2h cells (Figure 2B). The protein level of

233

the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was significantly increased compared to the control group (Figure 2B). All

234

of these results suggested that CQ and HCQ could induce LC3-mediated autophagy in ACE2 h cells.

235

Binding characteristics of CQ and HCQ with ACE2

236

The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects its host cells through binding to the ACE2 protein

237

followed by cleavage of the spike protein by human TMPRSS2 , we focused on whether

238

CQ or HCQ could bind with ACE2. A virtual molecular docking test was performed to investigate

239

the binding character of CQ and HCQ with ACE2. The chemical structure of both drugs are showed

240
241

in Figure 3A. Figure 3B shows that both CQ and HCQ can bind to R393 and D350 (both in green)
of ACE2 with their quinoline and imino groups. In addition, due to the replacement of a methyl

242
243

group by a hydroxymethyl group, HCQ can form two additional hydrogen bonds with D350 and
S44 (in red).We further used SPR to confirm the binding between CQ or HCQ and ACE2. The

244

binding constant KD of these two compounds and ACE2 protein were (7.31±0.62)e-7 and

245

(4.82±0.87)e-7 M respectively (Figure 3C).

246

CQ and HCQ suppressed the entrance of 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus into ACEh

247

cells

248

ACEh cells infected only with 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus were considered as controls, and

249
250

the luciferase luminescence value of the control was defined as 1. Under treatment of 0.625 μM,
1.25 μM, 2.5 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM CQ, the 2019-nCoV spike pseudotypes virus entrance

251

ratio were reduced to 86±0.11, 69±0.13, 62±0.19, 56±0.13, 44±0.18 and 23±0.10%, respectively,

252
253

when treated by the same dosage of HCQ, the ratios were 77±0.07, 58±0.12, 53±0.09, 44±0.08,
35±0.05, and 29±0.05% respectively (Figure 4). The ability of the 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped

254

virus to enter ACE2h cells was significantly reduced after treatment with both CQ and HCQ.

2019-nCoV is globally prevalent in 2020(Wang et al., 2020a), and there are currently no specific

257

drugs against the virus(Lei et al., 2020). ACE2 is the target receptor of 2019-nCoV (Yan et al., 2020),

258
259

and CQ and HCQ have shown certain efficacy in clinical use(Fantini et al., 2020; Ferner and
Aronson, 2020; Meo et al., 2020). This study confirmed that both CQ and HCQ can interact with

260

ACE2 and inhibit the entry of pseudoviruses.

261

CQ and HCQ have traditionally been used as anti-malaria drugs (White, 2007; White et al., 2014).

262
263

They can easily induce a resistance to the malaria paraside (Gasquet et al., 1995), and are still
recommnented for use solely against malaria. Further studies are needed to test the senstivity to

264

local malaria strains since it is safe, efficient and cheap (Gutman et al., 2017). Recently, they have

265
266

also been used commonly as immune modification drugs to treat autoimmune disorders (Plantone
and Koudriavtseva, 2018). The underlying mechanism against malaria seems clear, but the

267
268

mechanism of anti-inflammation is still under investigation. An increasing number of people believe
that CQ and HCQ protect of lysosomes and could change pH values in lysosome (Mauthe et al.,

269

2018). The two drugs have been reported to treat certain viral infections, but the antivirus

270
271

mechanism remains unclear (Savarino, 2011). In Zika virus infection, CQ has been reported to be
an endocytosis-blocking agent, and can inhibit the virus in different cell models (Delvecchio et al.,

272

2016). Similarly, 2019-nCoV was driven by endocytosis after binding to ACE2.

273

CQ and HCQ possess structural differences, and the presence of the hydroxymethyl group in HCQ

274
275

allows it to form additional hydrogen bonds with ACE2 according to the molecular docking results.
These different modes may finally reveal different bioactivities and affinitis of CQ and HCQ on

276
277

ACE2. Based on the above results, we further analyzed the binding strength of CQ and HCQ to the
ACE2 protein, and found that both CQ and HCQ display strong binding to the ACE2 protein.

278

Virus entry into cells is a critical step in the process of virus infection (Shang et al., 2020). However,

279

novel coronavirus research is greatly limited by the need to achieve a laboratory safety level of 3 or

280

above for direct research using virus strains(Nie et al., 2020). A pseudovirus is a retrovirus that can

281
282

integrate the membrane glycoproteins of a different kind of virus to form an external viral membrane,
while retainings the genomic characteristics of the retrovirus itself. Construction of the 2019-nCoV

283
284

pseudovirus that can only infect cells once, ensure safety and allows simulation the process of virus
invasion into the cell to detect whether drugs have antiviral activity in vitro (Ou et al., 2020).

285
286
287
288
289

Therefore, we use 2019-nCoV pseudovirus as an infection model to assess the antiviral effects of CQ
and HCQ. We confirmed that both CQ and HCQ have the ability to suppress the entrance of 2019-nCoV
spike pseudotypes virus into ACE2h cells. 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 for cellular entry. Thus, CQ and HCQ
could be good inhibitors to block 2019-nCoV infection of human cells expression ACE2. However, the
difference in the inhibitory effect of these two drugs on 2019-nCoV needs further study.

290

Our study revealed that CQ and HCQ as ACE2 blockers inhibit the entrance of 2019-nCoV

291
292

pseudovirus into the cells, providing new insights into the use of CQ and HCQ for 2019-nCoV
treatment and further control.
