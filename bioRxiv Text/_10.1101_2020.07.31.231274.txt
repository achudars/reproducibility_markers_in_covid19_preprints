ABSTRACT
The superfamily-1 helicase non-structural protein 13 (nsp13) is required for SARS-CoV-2
replication, making it an important antiviral therapeutic target. The mechanism and
regulation of nsp13 has not been explored at the single-molecule level. Specifically, forcedependent unwinding experiments have yet to be performed for any coronavirus helicase.
Here, using optical tweezers, we find that nsp13 unwinding frequency, processivity, and
velocity increase substantially when a destabilizing force is applied to the dsRNA,
suggesting a passive unwinding mechanism. These results, along with bulk assays, depict
nsp13 as an intrinsically weak helicase that can be potently activated by picoNewton
forces. Such force-dependent behavior contrasts the known behavior of other viral
monomeric helicases, drawing stronger parallels to ring-shaped helicases. Our findings
suggest that mechanoregulation, which may be provided by a directly bound RNAdependent RNA polymerase, enables on-demand helicase activity on the relevant
polynucleotide substrate during viral replication.
MAIN TEXT
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-stranded RNA coronavirus responsible for the current
coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1,2. Its genome encodes sixteen non-structural proteins
(nsp), including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12 (RdRP), and the RNA helicase
nsp133. Nsp13 is essential for viral replication4 and was recently shown to form a complex
together with nsp125. Nsp13 from SARS-CoV-2 is a superfamily 1 helicase and is >99% similar
to nsp13 from SARS-CoV-13, differing by a single amino acid (V570I). This high level of
conservation indicates that nsp13 from SARS-CoV-1 and -CoV-2 have a shared unwinding
mechanism. It also indicates that antiviral therapeutics targeting the helicase would be effective

towards SARS-CoV-1 and -CoV-2 nsp13, and potentially on helicases from future coronaviridae.
Despite this therapeutic potential, the detailed mechanism and regulation of replicative helicases
in coronaviridae in general remain poorly studied.
Previous work on SARS-CoV-1 nsp13 has established via bulk assays a 5’-3’ directionality
of unwinding activity6. Nsp13 has been shown to unwind both RNA and DNA substrates with
approximately equal initial rates, despite the virus having an RNA genome7,8. The efficiency of
nsp13 unwindase activity is low compared to other helicases, but may be enhanced by either
cooperativity or by interaction with the viral RdRp8–10. Consistently, recent structural data has
shown that SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 can form a complex with RdRP5. Nonetheless, the potential
mechanisms underlying nsp13 activation have not been explored.
Mechanical forces offer potential means for the regulation of viral helicase activation.
Some viral helicases, such as hexameric T4 bacteriophage gp41 and T7 bacteriophage gp4,
exhibit enhanced unwinding velocities when destabilizing forces are applied to their
polynucleotide substrates11,12. Other viral helicases, such as the monomeric hepatitis C virus
(HCV) nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) show little change in unwinding velocity when forces are
applied to their substrate13. Strong force-dependence of velocity is correlated with a passive
unwinding mechanism (i.e. energy from ATP hydrolysis is used for translocation, but not for
breaking base pairs), whereas weak force-dependence of velocity is correlated with an active
unwinding mechanism (i.e. energy from ATP hydrolysis is used to directly separate base pairs)14–
16
. As such, force-dependence of the unwinding activity of a helicase has fundamental implications
for its regulation during physiological operation. Force-dependence measurements have yet to be
performed for any coronavirus helicase.
In the current work, we investigate the mechanism of SAS-CoV-2 nsp13-driven
polynucleotide unwinding activity using both bulk and single-molecule approaches. Using bulk
assays, we find that nsp13 unwinds both DNA and RNA with weak intrinsic activity. Using optical
tweezers, we find that applying picoNewton forces, as could be provided by a bound RdRp to the
RNA substrate increases the event frequency, unwinding velocity, and processivity of nsp13,
leading to a >50-fold enhancement of catalytic activity. These results indicate that nsp13 utilizes
a passive unwinding mechanism, and identifies mechanoregulation as a sufficient means of
nsp13 activation.
RESULTS
Biochemical characterization of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase consists of an N-terminal zinc binding domain (ZBD),
followed by stalk and beta domains (S and 1B domains, respectively), and finally the catalytic
RecA1 and RecA2 (A1 and A2) helicase domains (Fig. 1a). Previous structural and biochemical
data on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV4,17 have identified the ZBD and S domains as important for
structural stability of the enzyme. The A1 and A2 domains regulate ATP hydrolysis, and, along
with the B1 domain, are proposed to regulate oligonucleotide binding.
Biochemical studies of SARS-CoV-1 nsp13 indicated that a GST-tag, which has the
potential to induce dimerization, compared to a His6-tag, could substantially alter activity (>280fold)8. However, the positively-charged His6-tag may also artificially bias polynucleotide binding.
Therefore, for our analyses we used recombinant affinity tag-free, full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp13

(hereafter, nsp13), which we have reported recently5. Briefly, the protein was subjected to Ni-NTA
affinity, cation exchange (CaptoS HP) and size exclusion (S200 increase) chromatography. The
addition of an ion exchange step reduced DNA contamination and a monodisperse peak off of
the gel filtration column at 15 mL (Fig. 1b), and SDS-PAGE (Coomassie) analysis revealed >95%
purity (Fig. 1c).
To examine the nucleotide binding capabilities of nsp13, we used differential scanning
fluorimetry (DSF) to measure shifts in melting temperature18. We found that nsp13 alone (apo)
had a melting temperature of 40.5 oC, and that the addition of ATPγS or ADP:AlF3 (1 mM) shifted
the melting temperature ~5-12oC (Fig. 1d). These shifts indicate stabilization via ligand binding,
and are consistent with recent structural data showing ADP:AlF3 binding within the nsp13 active
site5 (Fig. 1d). No significant shift was observed in the presence of ADP (1 mM), indicating minimal
protein stabilization (Fig.1d).
To examine nsp13 binding to RNA and DNA, we performed fluorescence anisotropy
measurements. We designed fluorescently-tagged double-stranded DNA and RNA substrates
containing an 18-bp duplex region with a 10-nucleotide 5’ overhang. A 10-nucleotide overhang
allows only one copy of nsp13 to bind at a time9. The fluorescence anisotropy of these substrates
(10 nM) was measured both in the absence and presence of nsp13 (3.4 μM) in nucleotide-free
buffer. We measured an increase in fluorescence anisotropy for both DNA and RNA, indicating
that nsp13 can bind both of these substrates (Fig. 1e). Together, these data indicate that
recombinant tag-free nsp13 binds nucleotide analogs, and can bind both RNA and DNA in the
absence of nucleotide.
Unwinding activity of nsp13 on DNA and RNA substrates
To examine the helicase activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, we utilized a bulk fluorescencebased single-turnover assay19. Briefly, we synthesized the DNA and RNA substrates described
above but with the addition of a quencher on the previously unlabelled strand such that
fluorescence signal is suppressed while in the duplex, but not when the strands are dissociated
(Fig. 2a). In this assay, nsp13 (10 nM) unwound DNA in the presence of MgATP (2 mM), as
revealed by an increase in the fluorescence signal (Fig. 2b). This activity was also observed using
a gel-based assay (Fig. S1). We found that helicase activity could be readily observed at nsp13
concentrations below 100 pM in the presence of DNA (1 μM) (Fig. 2c). We next performed an
initial velocity analysis of nsp13 and observed unwinding rates that increased with DNA
concentration. Fitting these data to the Michaelis-Menten equation revealed a KM of 1.05 ± 0.15
μM for DNA and a kcat of 0.53 ± 0.03 s-1 (fit ± 95% confidence interval; Fig. 2d). This rate of DNA
unwinding is similar to that reported for HCV NS3 helicase in a fluorescence-based helicase
assay20. We determined a Hill coefficient of ~1, indicating a lack of cooperativity in nsp13-driven
unwinding for our substrates.
We next examined nsp13 helicase activity using an RNA duplex with an analogous
sequence. As with DNA, we observed a substrate concentration-dependent increase in
fluorescence signal (Fig. 2e). Compared to DNA, we observe that the unwinding rate for the RNA
substrate is ~2-3-fold lower, and that the initial rate profile for RNA remains linear even at the
highest substrate concentration (6 μM) tested (Fig. 2d, e). Therefore, we can only estimate a KM
> 5 μM for RNA.

To examine the basis of the difference between DNA and RNA unwinding in the helicase
assay, we considered that ionic strength (i.e. KCl concentration) could alter nsp13 duplex binding
affinity due to the electrostatic nature of enzyme-nucleic acid interactions. DNA unwinding was
faster than RNA (between 1.5 to 8-fold) at all salt concentrations tested (Fig. 2f). Nsp13
demonstrated the highest activity when no KCl was added to the assay, and increasing the
salt concentration led to a decrease in duplex unwinding rate, with no measurable activity at
≥250 mM KCl. A similar salt dependence of nsp13 helicase activity was observed in gel-based
assays (Fig. S2). As a control, ADP:AlF3 inhibited both nsp13-dependent RNA and DNA (500 nM)
unwinding with similar IC50 values (Fig. 2g). Overall, our data suggest that nsp13 possesses 5’3’ helicase activity, albeit with a weak KM, and, for our specific substrates, may unwind DNA more
readily than RNA.
Single-molecule measurements of nsp13-driven RNA unwinding
To further investigate the RNA helicase activity of nsp13, we designed an optical trap
assay to directly visualize RNA unwinding at the single-molecule level. Briefly an RNA hairpin
including a 20-nucleotide 5’ loading zone, a 180-bp duplex region, and a tetraloop, was annealed
to two 1.5-kbp dsDNA handles, which in turn were conjugated to polystyrene beads (see Methods;
Fig. 3a). One bead was held steady in a micropipette, while the other was held in an optical trap
and manipulated to apply a specified amount of force. A single tether between the two beads was
ensured by measuring the force-extension curve of each tether (Fig. 3b). Under 20 pN, the hairpin
remained stably folded by itself for the duration of the experiments. Nsp13 was then injected into
the sample chamber, and dsRNA unwinding was monitored by the necessary changes in the
optical trap position required to hold a constant force. Nsp13-catalyzed unwinding of the hairpin
would result in an increase in the distance between the two beads.
We first made measurements at low applied forces (4 pN). At this force, the unwinding
activity of nsp13 was consistent with the low catalytic efficiency measured in the bulk assays (Fig.
2). The long time period between the unwinding events relative to the durations of these events
suggest that each unwinding is likely driven by a single helicase enzyme11. RNA unwinding events
by nsp13 were rare and short, typically terminating after a few tens of bp, indicating poor
processivity (Fig. 3c, d). We next made measurements at 18 pN, the highest applied force
feasible without starting to open the hairpin (Fig. 3b). We observed three major differences at 18
pN (Fig 2e) in comparison to 4 pN: (i) unwinding events occurred more frequently at the same
nsp13 concentration, (ii) unwinding events became longer in distance, and (iii) unwinding
appeared to be much faster. In some instances, nsp13 unwound the entire 180 bp hairpin (Fig.
3f). We also observed slippage events in ~33% of recorded traces at 18 pN; These events were
marked by sudden (>1 kbp-s-1) backward motions along the RNA followed by a rapid resumption
in unwinding (Fig. 3g). Furthermore, the unwinding velocity and processivity decreased with
reduced ATP (Fig. S3), indicating that nsp13 may detach from the RNA while waiting for ATP.
Nsp13 event frequency, processivity, and velocity are enhanced by applied force
To quantify the force-dependence of nsp13 helicase activity, we made single-molecule
measurements of dsRNA unwinding at multiple applied forces between 4 and 18 pN (Fig. 4a).

We first measured the event frequency, or number of independent unwinding events per unit time.
The event frequency increased ~14-fold between 4 and 18 pN (Fig. 4b). Assuming a simple model
where there is no rate-limiting step to initiate unwinding, the event frequency is proportional to the
on-rate of nsp13 binding to RNA, meaning that applied force on the RNA substrate may increase
the nsp13 on-rate ~14-fold. The low event frequency extrapolated to zero force is consistent with
the weak KM measured in bulk assays (Fig. 2d).
We next measured the processivity, or total length of dsRNA unwound during each event.
The processivity increased monotonically from 4 pN, where no event was greater than 50 bp, to
18 pN, where ~35% of the nsp13 molecules unwound the entire 180 bp dsRNA duplex region
(Fig. 4c). At the lower forces measured (4-14 pN), where events were not truncated by the limited
length of the RNA hairpin, distributions of measured processivities could be fitted to a single
exponential, indicating that, for this given RNA hairpin, nsp13 has a constant probability of
detaching as it unwinds (i.e. does not preferentially detach at a sequence-specific position) (Fig.
S4).
We next measured the velocity of nsp13 in response to applied force on the dsRNA
substrate. Remarkably, we found that the velocity increased exponentially with force, increasing
from ~70 bp-s-1 at 4 pN to ~280 bp-s-1 at 18 pN (Fig. 4d). Velocity is a measure of kcat, meaning
that applied force increases the kcat ~4-fold. We can also estimate the nsp13 off-rate as the
velocity divided by the processivity. As both of these values approximately increase in tandem
over the measured force range, we estimate the nsp13 off-rate to be force-independent at ~2 s-1
(Fig. 4c, d). Coupling the 4-fold change in the kcat with the 14-fold change in the KM, we estimate
that increasing the applied force for 4 to 18 pN increases the catalytic efficiency >50-fold. Fitting
the velocity data to an exponential function yielded an extrapolated zero-force velocity of ~50 bp
s-1 (Fig. 4d). Such scaling of the velocity indicates that nps13 likely follows a passive helicase
mechanism14,15. Overall, we find that applying force to the dsRNA substrate enhances nsp13
unwinding frequency, processivity, and velocity.
DISCUSSION
In the current work, we show that SARS-CoV2 nsp13 has weak intrinsic helicase activity
that can be stimulated >50-fold by externally provided forces. These results provide insight into
the mechanism and regulation of nsp13, enabling a deeper molecular understanding of the
processes underlying SARS-Cov2 replication.
While the in vivo velocity of nsp13 has not yet been determined, the E. coli replication
complex travels at ~1,000 bp s-1 14,21. We thus speculate that nsp13 moves much faster than its
basal unwinding velocity during viral infection. Our data suggest that nsp13 RNA helicase activity
can be stimulated >50-fold by forces in the 10-20 pN regime that act on the nucleic acid substrate
(Fig 4e). E. coli RNA polymerase and T7 viral RNA polymerase can each provide ~20 pN of
force22,23. Therefore, we speculate that simultaneous action of the RdRp on the same duplex may
provide the external force on the RNA substrate necessary for activated nsp13 unwinding (Fig.
4e). While the recent structural data does not directly inform on how nsp13 and the RdRp together
work on the same RNA substrate5, existing kinetic data shows that RdRP enhances nsp13
helicases activity8. Moreover, there are numerous instances of polymerases activating helicases
in other viral systems, including Zika24, T712,21,25, and T426–28. While posttranslational modifications

or induced conformational changes may also contribute to nsp13 regulation, we show here that
external force on the dsRNA substrate is sufficient to activate the helicase.
Replicative helicases from the six superfamilies29 fall into two broad classes: ring-shaped
hexameric helicases and non-hexameric helicases30,31. Functionally, two mechanisms have been
proposed for helicases to date: an active mechanism, in which the helicase directly destabilizes
the DNA or RNA substrate, and a passive mechanism, in which the helicase opportunistically
advances upon the spontaneous opening of base pairs14–16. These mechanisms are not mutually
exclusive, and a continuum between them likely exists32. Nsp13 is non-hexameric5, and based on
the shape of the force-velocity curve (Fig. 4d), we propose that it more closely matches the
definition of a passive helicase. Notably, a passive mechanism has, to our knowledge, not been
characterized for a non-hexameric helicase to date. The non-hexameric superfamily 2 helicase
HCV NS3, and the non-hexameric superfamily 1 DNA repair helicase UvrD are proposed to be
active helicases, each having unwinding velocities that do not increase in response to
destabilizing forces13,33. We show here that the unwindase activity of nsp13 more closely matches
that of ring-shaped bacteriophage DNA helicases such as T4 gp41 and T7 gp4, each of which
show a strong force-dependent velocity11,12. The similarities between the velocities and
processivities between nsp13 and T4 gp41 specifically, both basal and in response to external
forces, suggest a common mechanism11,34.
Direct force-activation on nsp13 unwindase activity enables on-demand regulation. This
is likely important to viral RNA genome stability, as promiscuous unwinding would expose it to
degradation. A default low-activity state for the helicase also maintains the integrity of the viral
replication machinery and prevents dissociation35. Nsp13 in SARS-CoV-2 is >99% similar by
sequence identity to its counterpart in SARS-CoV-13, suggesting that force-regulation of
replicative helicase activity is likely conserved across coronaviridae that are evolutionarily
proximal to the causative agent of COVID-19.
The high conservation of nsp13 helicases across coronaviridae suggests that therapeutic
agents could be developed to treat COVID-19 and other diseases. Targeting viral helicases in
general has been challenging36,37. However, recent successes in targeting different ATPases38,39
suggests that selective and potent inhibitors of nsp13 could be developed. The bulk and singlemolecule assay platforms reported here may be leveraged in future drug discovery efforts and in
detailed mechanistic investigation of nsp13 inhibition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning
The nsp13 plasmid was generated as previously described 5. Briefly, the OptimumGene method
(Genscript) was used to optimize the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase sequence for insect
cell expression. The gene was synthesized and cloned into the pet28(a)+ vector, using NdeI and
XhoI restriction sites, by Genscript. We then performed mutagenesis using the Quikchange
mutagenesis kit (Agilent) to insert an HRV-3C (PreScission) protease cleavage site and remove
the thrombin cleavage site.
Protein Expression and Purification
Nsp13 was expressed and purified as reported previously with minimal changes 5. Briefly, the
plasmid expressing the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase (SARS-CoV-2-nsp13 Pet28a or SARS-CoV2-nsp13 Pet28a-PreScission) was transformed into BL21 Rosetta cells and used to make a starter
culture of 100 mL of LB with 100 μL of 50 mg/mL kanamycin. The starter culture was grown
overnight at 37 oC. The next day, 4-6 L of LB were inoculated with 10 mL of SARS-CoV-2-nsp13
Pet28a-PreScission starter culture per L. These cultures were grown at 37 oC for ~2 hrs, or until
an OD600 of 0.6. The temperature was then lowered to 18 oC and once at temperature, each L
culture was induced with 1 mL of 0.2M IPTG per liter of growth. The cultures were left overnight
(~16 hrs) at 18 oC and harvested the next day by spinning down at ~5000 g for 10 minutes and
resuspend pellets in affinity buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 5%
Glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 20 mM Imidazole, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM BME). 9 μL of benzonase was added
to the resuspended pellets and the pellet was subsequently lysed using an Avestin Emulsiflex C5
with pressure exceeding 10,000 psi. The lysate was then centrifuged using a Beckman Coulter
ultracentrifuge and a Type 70 Ti rotor at 15,000 rpm for 45 minutes at 4 oC. The supernatant was
then added to 2 mL of Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with affinity buffer and incubated at 4 oC with
rocking for 1 hr. The supernatant and resin mixture was then passed through a gravity column,
and the resin was subsequently washed with ~900 mL of affinity buffer. Once complete, the
protein was eluted with 15-20 mL of affinity buffer + 250 mM imidazole. 100 uL of prescission
protease (~4 mg/mL) were added to the elution and the protein was left to dialyze overnight in
dialysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP). The elution is
diluted 2Xfold with milliQ-H2O the next morning to give ion exchange A buffer (25 mM Hepes pH
7.0, 50 mM NaCl,2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP) and loaded onto a CaptoS HP column (Cytiva) at
a flow rate of 1 mL/min and then eluted with a gradient from 0% ion exchange B buffer (25 mM
Hepes pH 7.0, 1 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP to 50% ion exchange B buffer over 30
minutes. The protein eluted at around ~5-10% ion exchange B buffer. The protein was then
concentrated to 500 μL using a 50 kDa cutoff Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal filter (Millipore
UFC805008) and injected onto a Superdex 200 increase gel filtration column in sizing buffer (25
mM HEPES pH 7.0, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). The protein was flash
frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 oC.
Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
These experiments were carried out on a C1000 Touch Thermal cycler CFX-96 instrument (GE
Healthcare). recombinant constructs were diluted to a final concentration of 4 μM in DSF buffer

(25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 0.005% triton-X) and
assayed in a 96-well plate (Hard-shell HSP9665 Bio-Rad). Ligands were added to a final
concentration of 1 mM. Sypro Orange fluorescent dye (Sigma S5692, excitation 490 nm, emission
590 nm) was used at 1:500 dilution. The temperature was linearly increased with a step of 0.5 oC
for 55 minutes, from 25 oC to 95 oC and fluorescence readings were taken at each interval. Melting
temperatures were recorded as the minimum value of the first derivative of the fluorescence vs
temperature curves. These experiments were
Preparation of DNA and RNA Duplex Substrates
All oligos used for the preparation of DNA and RNA substrates were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT). The fluorescently-quenched partial duplex DNA substrate was prepared
by mixing Oligo1 (5’-TTTTTTTTTTCTGATGTTAGCAGCTTCG-BHQ2-3’) and Oligo2 (5’-TAMRACGAAGCTGCTAACATCAG-3’) in a 1.2:1 molar ratio and annealed by heating at 95 oC for 5 min
in a temperature controlled aluminum block, followed by cooling the sample at a rate of 1 oC/min
until reaching 25 oC. The fluorescent partial duplex DNA substrate (lacking BHQ2) was prepared
by mixing unlabeled Oligo1 and Oligo2 in a 1.2:1 molar ratio and annealing as above. The
fluorescently-quenched partial duplex RNA substrate was prepared by mixing Oligo3 (5’UUUUUUUUUUCUGAUGUUAGCAGCUUCG-BHQ2-3’)
and
Oligo4
(5’-TAMRACGAAGCUGCUAACAUCAG-3’) in a 1.2:1 molar ratio and annealed by heating at 75 oC for 5 min
in a temperature controlled aluminum block, followed by cooling the sample at a rate of 1 oC/min
until reaching 25 oC. The fluorescent partial duplex RNA substrate (lacking BHQ2) was prepared
by mixing unlabeled Oligo3 and Oligo4 in a 1.2:1 molar ratio and annealing as per the
fluorescently-quenched partial duplex RNA substrate. Capture oligos, complementary to the
duplexed portion of the BHQ2 strands, used in helicase assays for DNA and RNA substrates,
have the sequence 5’-CGAAGCTGCTAACATCAG-3’ and 5’-CGAAGCUGCUAACAUCAG-3’,
respectively.
Fluorescence Anisotropy Binding Assay
For fluorescence anisotropy studies, nsp13 (34 μM, in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (PH=7.5),
5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, and 3% glycerol) and partial duplex DNA/RNA (as
prepared above; 100 nM in 20 mM HEPES (PH=7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP)
were diluted 10x into assay buffer (20 mM HEPES (PH=7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 0.005%
Triton X100) with KCl added to a final concentration of 25 mM (20 μL final reaction volume).
Fluorescence anisotropy was measured after incubating for ten minutes at room temperature
using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader (Biotek; 532/25 nm excitation filter, 590/35 nm emission filter)
in dual photomultiplier tube (PMT) mode. Gain values on the two PMTs (reading parallel and
perpendicular emission) were automatically scaled to give equal counts from a DNA or RNAfluorophore-only control well, and the G factor was automatically adjusted.
Microplate-based Helicase Activity Assays
Initial velocities of nsp13 helicase were measured by mixing recombinant nsp13 (10 nM) with
partial duplex DNA or RNA substrates (0-6 μM) in the presence of ATP (2 mM) and capture oligo
(8 or 12 μM) in 24 μL reaction volumes using solid black 384-well NBS microplates (Corning).
Nsp13 was prepared as a 2x stock solution in helicase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mM

KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM TCEP, 0.5 mM glutathione, 0.01% triton X100 and 0.1
mg/mL BSA) and 12 μL was added to reaction wells. DNA/RNA duplex substrates were prepared
as 4x stock solutions in helicase buffer followed by 2-fold serial dilutions in helicase buffer.
Substrate dilutions (6 μL) were added to reaction wells containing nsp13 and incubated for 10
min. ATP/capture oligos were prepared as a combined 4x stock solution in helicase buffer, and 6
μL were added to reaction wells to initiate the reactions. Control reactions included wells with no
enzyme and no ATP added. Substrate unwinding was measured by continuously recording the
fluorescence (excitation: 544 nm, emission: 590 nm) on a Synergy Neo2 plate reader (Biotek) for
30 min, 15 s intervals. Relative fluorescence units (RFU) were converted to units of molarity with
standard curves generated from DNA Oligo2 and RNA Oligo4. Enzyme parameters KM, kcat and
Hill coefficients (h) were determined by fitting the plot of initial rates (first ~150 s) against substrate
concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation or the Hill equation using Prism v.6.0 (GraphPad
Software, Inc).
Variable enzyme concentration assays were performed by combining a 4x
substrate/capture oligo (6 μL) stock solution in helicase buffer with 2-fold serial dilution of 2x
nsp13 (12 μL) in helicase buffer in reaction wells. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a 4x
ATP solution in helicase buffer. Final concentrations were 0-2 nM nsp13, 0.5 μM DNA/RNA
substrate, 2.5 μM capture oligo and 2 mM ATP. Control reactions containing no ATP were
included.
Variable KCl concentration assays were performed by combining a 4x
nsp13/substrate/capture oligo (6 μL) stock solution in helicase buffer (-KCl) with 2-fold serial

by the addition of a 4x ATP solution in helicase buffer. Final concentrations were 10 nM nsp13,
0.5 μM DNA/RNA substrate, 2.5 μM capture oligo, 2 mM ATP and 0-250 mM KCl. Control
reactions containing no ATP were included in the assay.
Inhibition assays were performed by combining 4x nsp13/substrate/capture oligo (6 μL)
stock solution in Assay Buffer with 2-fold ADP:AlF3 (prepared as a 2x 1:2 molar ratio stock) serial
dilutions (12 μL) in helicase buffer in reaction wells. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a
4x ATP solution in helicase buffer. Final concentrations were 10 nM nsp13, 0.5 μM DNA/RNA
substrate, 2.5 μM capture oligo, 2 mM ATP and 0-500 μM ADP:AlF3. Control reactions containing
no ATP and no ADP:AlF3 were included in the assays. Data were fit using a sigmoidal dose

Gel-based Helicase Activity Assays
Time-course experiments were performed by mixing recombinant nsp13 (20 nM) with ’
partial duplex DNA or RNA substrates (100 nM) in the presence of ATP (2 mM) and capture oligo
(1000 nM) in 80 μL reaction volumes. Reactions were performed in clear 200 μL tubes at 30oC in

1 mM TCEP, 0.005% triton X100 and 0.1 mg/mL BSA), and 20 μL was added to 40 μL helicase
buffer in the reaction tube. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μL of a 4x ATP stock
solution in helicase buffer. 10 μL reaction time-points were taken at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60
min, and quenched by the addition of 10 μL of a 100 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol solution. Time-point
samples (5 μL) were resolved by 10% native-PAGE at room temperature, 200 V for 25 min. The
gels were scanned using a Typhoon Trio Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare) in TAMRA dye
mode to visualize fluorescence.
Variable KCl concentration assays were performed by mixing recombinant nsp13 (200
nM) with partial duplex DNA or RNA substrates (20 nM) in the presence of ATP (2 mM) and
capture oligo (2000 nM) in 10 μL reaction volumes. Nsp13/substrate/capture oligo was prepared
as a 4x stock solution in helicase buffer and 2.5 μL was added to 5 μL of 2x stocks of KCl in
helicase buffer (2-fold serial dilutions). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2.5 μL of a 4x
ATP stock solution in helicase buffer and incubated at 37 oC for 30 min. Reactions were quenched
and gels were performed as described above.
Preparation of Substrate for Optical Tweezers Assay
The substrate consists of two 1.5-kbp-long biotinylated dsDNA handles annealed to an
RNA hairpin containing a 180-bp stem and a tetraloop. A 20-nt single-stranded region at the 5’
flank of the hairpin serves as the nsp13 loading site (with a sequence of 5’CAGAAAGAAAAACCGGAUCC-3’). The hairpin sequence was made by in vitro transcription of
a DNA template used previously40 using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher).
RNA was then puriﬁed using the MEGAclear Kit (Thermo Fisher). The DNA handles were
generated by PCR using modiﬁed primers to generate the overhang for annealing to the hairpincontaining RNA. The forward primer for the 5’ overhang handle contains an inverted base that
terminates Phusion DNA polymerase (with a sequence of 5’CAACCATGAGCACGAATCCTAAACCT/ilnvdT/GCATAACCCCTTGGGGCCTCTAAACG-3’).
The forward primer for the 3’ overhang handle contains inverted bases at its 5’ end that
terminate Taq polymerase (with a sequence of 5’/5InvdG//iInvdC//iInvdA//iInvdA//iInvdA//iInvdT//iInvdC//iInvdT//iInvdC//iInvdC//iInvdG//iInvdG//iIn
vdG//iInvdG//iInvdT//iInvdT//iInvdC//iInvdC//iInvdC//iInvdC//iInvdA//iInvdA//iInvdT//iInvdA//iInvdC/
/iInvdG/TAGTCTAGAGAATTCATTGCGTTCTGTACA/3ddC/-3’). The reverse primers for the 5’
and 3’ overhang handles contain a biotin at their respective 5’ ends for bead attachment.
The annealed complex containing the 5’ overhang handle and the RNA hairpin was
assembled by mixing 1 𝜇M 5’ overhang handles, 400 nM RNA hairpin in a total volume 20 𝜇L of
TL buffer, incubated at 65 oC for 90s and cooled to 4 oC. TL buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 55 mM KOAc, 6 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mM DTT. A 10 𝜇l reaction containing 3.5 𝜇L of
annealed complex and 1.6 𝜇L of 0.5% streptavidin coated polystyrene beads (2 𝜇m diameter,
Spherotech) was incubated on ice for 30 min. Then the mixture was diluted with 1 mL TL buffer .
A separate reaction containing 50 nM 3’ overhang handles and 1.6 𝜇L of beads was incubated
and diluted as above.
To form a tether, a bead conjugated to5’ overhang handle complexes was immobilized
on a pipette via suction and brought into close proximity to a second bead conjugated to 3’
overhang handles held in an optical trap. Upon hybridization of the 3’ overhang handle with the
5’ overhang handle/RNA hairpin complex, a tether was formed.

Optical tweezers measurements
All single-molecule measurements were made using an optical tweezers instrument
(“MiniTweezers”)41. The sample buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgSO4, 1 mM TCEP, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and 0.005% triton X100. At the start of each experiment,
a tether was formed in the sample chamber and its force-extension behavior was obtained by
moving the optically trapped bead at a speed of 70 nm/s away from the second bead held in the
pipette. Once a single tether was confirmed by the shape of the force-extension curve, nsp13 (0.1
nM) and ATP (1 mM unless otherwise stated) were injected into the chamber, and unwinding data
were collected in a force-feedback mode to maintain a constant tension in the tethered molecule.
Data were collected at 200 Hz. All experiments were conducted at 23 ± 1 °C.
Single-molecule data were analyzed in MATLAB (Natick, MA). The raw readout in nm was
converted to base pairs by using the extensible worm-like chain model with parameters 42:
persistence length 1 nm, contour length 0.59 nm per RNA nucleotide, and stretch modulus 1000
pN. Velocity was determined by linear fitting to the time-distance data (start to end of a processive
event). Processivity was determined as the maximum distance traveled prior to detachment.
Event frequency was determined by counting the number of independent unwinding events
divided by the total recording time for a given tether.
