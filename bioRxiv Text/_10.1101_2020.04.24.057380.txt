Abstract
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak starting from China at the end of
2019 and its subsequent spread in many countries have given rise to thousands of
coronavirus samples being collected and sequenced till date. To trace back the initial
temporal change of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus implicated in COVID-19, we study
the limited genomic sequences that were available within the first couple of months of
its spread. These samples were collected under varying circumstances and highlight
wide variations in their genomic compositions. In this paper, we explore whether these
variations characterize the initial temporal change of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We observe that n-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 samples, which were collected at an
earlier period of time, predict its collection timeline with approximately 78% accuracy.
However, such a distinctive pattern disappears with the inclusion of samples collected
at a later time. We further observe that isolation sources (e.g., oronasopharynx, saliva,
feces, etc.) could not be predicted by the n-mer patterns in these sequences. Finally,

Introduction

Coronaviruses are a large family of RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds [1].
Coronaviruses have been identified broadly in avian hosts along with various mammals, which
include camels, masked palm civets, bats, mice, dogs, cats, and human. The coronaviruses
cause respiratory and neurological diseases in hosts [2]. In human, it causes several illnesses,
ranging from mild common cold to much severe diseases such as SARS-CoV (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS-Cov (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). They are
enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. The genome size of
coronaviruses ranges between 26-32 kb [3], the largest among known RNA viruses [4].
The recent coronavirus outbreak in China [5], originating from Wuhan, has been characterized by the identification of a novel type of betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that infects
human [6]. In this paper, we restrict our study to those samples collected and sequenced
between December, 2019 and January, 2020. In China, 11,791 cases were identified as infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 17,988 were suspected in 34 provinces as of January 31, 2020
[7]. Due to the quick spread of SARS-CoV-2, more than 200 countries and territories around
the world have already been marked with the viral infection [8]. It is therefore interesting
to trace back whether the origin and spread of this virus has any influence on the change of
its nucleotide sequence.
The sequencing of viral genomes has opened up new promises through bioinformatics
analyses [9, 10]. With the recent efforts of sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 samples collected
across the world, hundreds of genomic samples are becoming available day by day [11]. This
has lead to the discovery of new pathophysiological facts about coronaviruses. It is equally
interesting to explore the mutations happening in the samples emerging across the world. In
this paper, we aim to verify whether the changes of sequence in the samples can reveal the
temporal footprints (precisely the month of collection) of this virus.

Related Work

Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late December, 2019,
several studies have already been carried out in understanding the virus and its pathophysiology. The SARS-CoV-2 has been identified by the close genomic observations of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China [12]. Identification of the molecular

mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to prevent and control the disease. Through next
generation sequencing, homology has been observed in the structure of the receptor-binding
domain between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 is found to largely deviate
from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and is closely related to two bat-derived SARS-like
coronaviruses [12].
Another recent work has performed an entropy-based analysis with the diverse genomes
and proteomes of SARS-CoV-2 [13]. The results of this study highlighted low varying genomic sequences within the SARS-CoV-2 sequenced samples where the higher variability was
observed in at least two nucleotide positions in protein-coding regions. The interplay between
the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensinconverting enzyme II (ACE2) complex in human had been extensively studied in several
other papers. As the free energy of RBD-ACE2 binding for SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably
lower than that for SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is epidemically stronger than SARS-CoV
[14].
The presence of high prevalence, ecological distribution, tremendous genetic diversity, and
frequent alterations of coronavirus genomes have already been implicated in the recurrence
of this virus in humans [15]. However, there is hardly any study that links the sequence
patterns (precisely n-mer distributions here) to the timeline of sample collection. There
are many recent resources on coronaviruses due to their repeated outbreak. CoVDBd is a
repository of annotated coronaviruses

[16]. There are recent attempts to understand the

genome composition and divergence of SARS-CoV-2 [17], however, such studies are restricted
to China. Our analysis is more global from this perspective.

The materials and methods used in this paper are all available either from the developers or
from us for public use. Additional details are given below.

3.1

Dataset Details

We collected the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from NCBI Virus portal2 that cover multiple countries. Only those countries that have at least 5 samples were considered and complete
genomic sequences were taken. Total 36 sequences (17 samples from China, 5 samples from
Japan, and 14 samples from USA) were obtained from the 87 genomic sequences of SARSCoV-2 available in NCBI. These samples are gathered from multiple patients. For all these
genomic sequences, we collected the geographical locations, sources of isolation, and months

of collection. The collection month of SARS-CoV-2 samples confirm the presence of the virus
in the patients of China in December, 2019 and January, 2020, of USA in January, 2020, and
of Japan in January, 2020. The exact collection dates are available for the samples of China
(except one) and USA but not for Japan (see Supplementary Dataset 3). The sequences from
Japan have recently been removed from NCBI but are still accessible3 . An inquiry to the
submitter regarding the reason of this removal has resulted in no reply so far. The sequences
of other types of coronaviruses were collected from NCBI for phylogenetic analysis.

3.2

Methods

The Sieve plot was created for geographical location versus isolate (source of viral sample
collection) using the Orange toolbox4 [18]. The area of each rectangle in this is proportional
to the expected frequency of different isolation sources with respect to the countries, while
the observed frequency is shown by the number of squares in each rectangle. The Sieve
diagram highlights frequencies in a two-way contingency table and compare them to expected
frequencies under the assumption of independence. Several classification algorithms were
performed that are standard [19]. The classification results were taken from Orange. For this,
the default values of the parameters set in Orange were considered. The performance of the
classification models are determined in terms of the five evaluation criteria, namely accuracy

T P +T N
),
T P +T N +F P +F N

precision(=

T P +F P

recall (=

F1 score (=

),
2T P +F P +F N

and

AUC (area under ROC curve), where T P , T N , F P and F N stands for the number of true
positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.
FASTX (version 36.3.8h Aug, 2019) was used for multiple sequence alignment of DNA
sequence of the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 with the proteins in UnitProt [20]. The
parameters for FASTX were: BL50 matrix (15:-5), open/ext: -10/-2, shift: -20, ktup: 2, Ejoin: 0.5 (0.0832), E-opt: 0.1 (0.0198) and width: 16. The fast family and domain predictions
were also obtained using FASTX.
The phylogenmetic tree was built using the tool embedded in NCBI Virus and further
processed in the form of a consensus network using SplitsTree (version 5.0.0 alpha). The
original input consisted of 269 taxa. The Consensus Network method [21] was used (with
default options) so as to obtain 535 splits as compatible.

Extraction of Genomic Signatures

The frequency counts for several n-mers (for n = 1, 2 and 3) were extracted yielding a total
84 (4+16+64) features. The frequency values were normalized by dividing with the length of
the sequence. The feature similarity across the different samples showed higher importance
of shorter n-mers (Fig. 1).
To test the power of n-mer features in distinguishing different geographical locations
from where the samples were collected, hierarchical clustering with complete linkage was
performed (with number of clusters set to be 3) on the feature data. On labeling the
clustering result (Fig. 2), a strong group between the samples collected from Japan was
found. The samples from USA and China were highly overlapping. It is interesting to note
that all the samples from Japan were collected in late January, whereas those from USA and
China were collected much earlier. This highlights a possibility of having a temporal change
of SARS-CoV-2 sequences at an early stage.

4.2

Tracing Back the Temporal Change

As the samples we considered were collected over a period of couple of months, classification
results were obtained by setting collection months as the labels against the samples. The
collection months December, 2019 and January, 2020 were used as the labels of the samples
and multiple classification algorithms were applied (with 5-fold cross validation). The classification results (with 5-fold cross-validation), in terms of classification accuracy, precision,
recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC), are reported in Table 1. Close to

Figure 2: The clusters obtained from the samples based on n-mer features by applying
hierarchical clustering with complete linkage. The samples from Japan that were collected
relatively later came under a single group. Note that, all the samples from Japan have a
distinct collection month of January, 2020.
78% prediction accuracy was obtained with the Random Forest model, thereby indicating a
connection between the changes of n-mer in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over time.

As many of the samples from USA and Japan were collected lately, we further studied the
importance of both geographical location and temporal signature to distinguish the footprint
of SARS-CoV-2. On performing a clustering of samples based on the best features labeled
with geographical location and collection time, well segregated groups were found. This
highlights a clear distinction of samples based on collection details (Fig. 3). The gradual
mutations in SARS-CoV-2 sequences might be the reason of the said distinguishing pattern
between the samples collected in December, 2019 and January, 2020. Unfortunately, with
the newer (collected in March and April, 2020)) SARS-CoV-2 samples added to the list, this
distinctive pattern of the corresponding sequences no more exists. However, it is interesting
to note that, our classification attempts consider the class label as month of collection and

the data is skewed over the month. In fact, the samples are now getting sequenced with an
exponential growth. Therefore, further investigation is required for a deeper understanding
of the temporal change of SARS-CoV-2 sequences at a later phase.

4.3

Relevance of Isolation Sources

Countrywise isolation sources were very much overlapped and do not provide any significant
information. The distribution of samples across the different isolation sources as collected
from each geographical location are shown in Fig. 4.
To further verify the significance of isolation sources, multiple classification algorithms
were applied on the feature data with 5-fold cross validation. The same n-mer based normalized features (84 in total) were used. The cross validation results, in terms of classification
accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC), are reported in
Table 2. The classification results were not good based on the sources of isolation of the
samples studied.

On collecting the isolates of the samples, a significant overlap was found (Fig. 5). The
observed frequencies of the geographical location and isolate in these samples indicate that
the isolate is not an important feature to distinguish (N = 36, χ2 = 42.45, p = 0) the

different body parts in human.

Phylogenetic Analaysis

The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the 36 sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 samples
that we studied against the other samples of coronaviruses (Fig. 6). The results highlight a
strong overlap of SARS-CoV-2 with human SARS and bat coronaviruses. Most interestingly,
some of the sample sequences of SARS-CoV-2 collected from USA exhibit a separate phylogenetic closeness than the others. In fact, in a majority of the cases, the samples from the
same location comes under the same branch in this tree, thereby highlighting a evolutionary
connection between the sample and its collection footprint.

Protein Analysis

On comparing the genomic sequence of Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate
Wuhan-Hu-1 complete genome (29903 nt) with the protein sequence data bank UnitProt, two
major proteins were found to match with many different coronaviruses. These include human,
bat, middle east respiratory syndrome-related, murine, bovin, avian, porcine transmissible
gastroenteritis, and feline coronaviruses, with bat coronaviruses having a major share (see
Supplementary Fig. 1). Many of these are in fact experimentally validated (PE=1 as marked
in UniProt). Interestingly, out of the three proteins found, two (Replicase polyprotein 1a
and 1ab) were aligned to many coronaviruses but the third one (spike glycoprotein) was
aligned to human SARS coronavirus only. These proteins are now being studied in many
recent studies to link mutations in them with the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 [17]. The
fast family and domain prediction results (see Supplementary Fig. 2) also highlight a deep

Conclusion

The SARS-CoV-2 is still a poorly characterized virus due to its diverse genomic alterations,
rapid power of proliferation from host to host, and spread over several countries. Due to
such complex characterization, understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 can be
a real challenge. As the samples from China and USA had distinct isolates but they were
closer together in terms of n-mer distribution, hence there are other important factors like
temporal shift of locations where the spread took place. This highlights a high complexity
of understanding the effect of mutations taking place in this virus over time. It is equally
interesting to explore how much dependent such mutations are on the geographic origin of
the samples. As the recurrent occurrence of this virus in human is already characterized
by its diversity [15], its aberrant mutations in different locations raise the possibility of its
outbreak in future.
