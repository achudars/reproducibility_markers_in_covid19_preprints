Abstract

28

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 requires a fast development of

29

antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease,

30

3CLpro) is a potential target for drug design. Crystal and co-crystal structures of the

31

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have been solved, enabling the rational design of inhibitory

32

compounds. In this study we analyzed the available SARS-CoV-2 and the highly

33

similar SARS-CoV-1 crystal structures. We identified within the active site of the Mpro,

34

in addition to the inhibitory ligands’ interaction with the catalytic C145, two key H-bond

35

interactions with the conserved H163 and E166 residues. Both H-bond interactions

36

are present in almost all co-crystals and are likely to occur also during the viral

37

polypeptide cleavage process as suggested from docking of the Mpro cleavage

38

recognition sequence. We screened in silico a library of 6,900 FDA-approved drugs

39

(ChEMBL) and filtered using these key interactions and selected 29 non-covalent

40

compounds predicted to bind to the protease. Additional screen, using DOCKovalent

41

was carried out on DrugBank library (11,414 experimental and approved drugs) and

42

resulted in 6 covalent compounds. The selected compounds from both screens were

43

tested in vitro by a protease activity inhibition assay. Two compounds showed activity

44

at the 50µM concentration range. Our analysis and findings can facilitate and focus

45

the development of highly potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

47

The raging pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 requires a rapid response of the

48

biomedical community1,2. However, novel vaccines and antivirals require time for

49

development, thus repurposing of available drugs is a fast alternative and many

50

attempts using different approaches are made3-6. Antiviral drugs are traditionally

51

aimed at viral enzymes and are able to cure or reduce symptoms in several viral

52

infections (HIV, HCV and HSV-17).

53

SARS-CoV-2,

54

Betacoronavirus and is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, the causative agent of the

55

SARS pandemic outbreak in 20038. Coronaviruses are unsegmented single-stranded

56

positive-stranded RNA viruses, featuring the largest known viral RNA genomes (26 to

57

32 kilobases in length) infecting humans9.

58

SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 27 proteins.

59

First two ORFs at 5ʹ untranslated region are coding for overlapping polyproteins

60

(replicase 1a (pp1a) and replicase 1ab (pp1ab)) approximately 450kD and 750kD,

61

respectively. The two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, mediate all the functions required

62

for viral replication and transcription. The longer polyprotein (pp1ab) encodes for 15

63

nonstructural proteins (viral proteins that are not part of the virions) collectively

64

involved in virus replication and possibly in immune evasion.

65

The functional polypeptides are released from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic

66

processing. This is primarily achieved by the main protease (Mpro), along with the

67

papain-like protease. Together, they cleave the amino acid backbone at 11 sites on

68

the large polyprotein. This cleavage site involves Leu-Gln↓(Ser/Ala/Gly) sequences

The Mpro of the coronaviruses is a homodimer. It cleaves the polyprotein using its

89

catalytic dyad that contains the catalytic residues Histidine 41 (H41) and Cysteine 145

90

(C145) (Fig 1A-C). All of the residues within the active site, including the catalytic

91

residues and adjacent binding residues (polypeptide binding site) belong to one

92

monomer, except for one (Serine 1) from the second monomer11.

93

Several co-crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were recently solved, enabling

94

the rational design of specific inhibitory compounds12-15. The binding site of all the

95

ligands from the co-crystals is found within the Mpro active site. The close relationship

96

of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV-1 is reflected by high sequence identity of 96.1% and

97

similarity of 99% among their entire proteases protein sequence16. In the vicinity of the

98

binding site, the only residue that differs is positioned at residue 46. In SARS-CoV-2 it

99

is a Serine and in SARS-CoV-1 it is an Alanine; however, their side chains point out

100

of the binding site (Figure 1C).

101

The high similarity between the two viruses’ proteins and the fact that their active sites

102

are practically identical, enable the use of SARS-CoV-1 co-crystals17-34 in addition to

103

the available SARS-CoV-2 co-crystals, for understanding the vicinity of the binding site

104

region and defining the important interactions within the SARS-CoV-2 binding site with

105

its inhibitors. In this regard, it was suggested that drugs developed against SARS-

106

CoV-1 might be effective to treat SARS-CoV-216. However, these compounds

107

remained in the preclinical or early clinical stage, without further development into an

108

approved medicine.

109

In this study, we analyzed the available SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro co-

110

crystal structures and the developed SARS-CoV-1 inhibitory compounds and identified

key interactions required to identify and develop an active inhibitor for the main

112

protease. We conducted a virtual screen using a library of only FDA-approved drugs

113

against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure from protein data bank (PDB) [6W63]13 using

114

three docking software tools (GOLD35 and Glide36-38 and DOCKovalent39). Several

115

compounds were selected and tested in vitro using a protease inhibition assay.

Results

117

Analysis of co-crystals flexibility

118

To identify the flexibility of the Mpro binding site, we superimposed the SARS-CoV-1

119

and SARS-CoV-2 apo and co-crystal structures available at the time of our study in

120

the PDB (Table 1). We selected the five most distinct, root-mean-square deviation

121

(RMSD)-wise, structures within the 3D space of the binding site. The selected

122

structures were 2ZU5, 5R80, 6LU7, 6M03, 6Y2F. Three flexible residues within the

123

binding site showed variation in their positions between the different structures:

124

Glutamine 189, Methionine 49 and Asparagine 142 (Figure 1D and E).

125

Covalent and non-covalent co-crystal interactions

126

To find the essential interactions required for inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we

127

analyzed the interactions observed with both covalent and non-covalent inhibitors

128

(Table 1). Most of the co-crystals for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 contain covalent

129

inhibitors (32 structures). To date, only 6 co-crystals contain non-covalent inhibitors.

130

Analyzing the co-crystal interactions of the non-covalent inhibitors revealed that the

131

two SARS-CoV-2 co-crystallized ligands, 3WL [6W63] and N3 [6M2N], form H-bonds

132

with protein NH donors: Histidine 163 (H163) and Glutamic acid 166 (E166) backbone.

133

Interestingly, N3 mediates the H-bond interaction with H163 through a water molecule

134

(Figure 2A). In SARS-CoV-1 co-crystals, three out of the four structures showed both

135

H163 and E166 backbone interactions and all exhibited the E166 backbone H-bond

136

interaction. Interestingly, F3F [2GZ8] mediates the E166 backbone interaction through

137

a water molecule.

148
149

Additional interactions were observed with the following amino acids: The catalytic

150

H41 with D3F [2GZ7] and ML300 [4MDS]. The catalytic C145 forms a H-bond with

151

F3F [2GZ8]. G143 backbone with X77 [6W63] and N142 and F140 with F3F [2GZ8].

152

Many hydrophilic moieties of the ligands are surrounded by water molecules that

153

mediate the interaction of the inhibitor with the protein.

154

All covalent compounds interact with the catalytic C145 in the co-crystals.

155

Interestingly, most (31 out of 32) comprise also a non-covalent interaction, H-bond

156

with H163 similarly to the non-covalent compounds. All of the covalent and non-

157

covalent inhibitors present a H-bond acceptor to the side chain imidazole ring of H163

158

(see for example Figure 2A-C). The only exception, presenting a H-bond donor

159

towards H163, is SLH inhibitor [5C5N] (Figure 2D). Since the hydrogen can reside on

160

either nitrogen, (N1-H or N3-H tautomers) it interacts with the imidazole N acceptor.

161

E166 backbone that is interacting with all non-covalent ligands is also a key residue

162

for most covalent ligands. Most ligands (30 out of 32) form H-bond interactions with

163

the E166 backbone NH and some form an additional interaction with the E166

164

backbone carbonyl oxygen (for example, α-ketoamide 13b [6Y2F], ZU3 [2ZU4], N3

165

[2AMQ and 6LU7] and ZU5 [2ZU5], Figure 2B and C). Few structures mediate E166

with E166 side chain either via salt bridge (for example, N3 [6LU7] and SLH [5C5N])

Other backbone interactions can be detected with G143 [6LU7, 6Y2F and 2ZU4],

185

Docking of the cleavage recognition sequence

186

The proteolytic activity of Mpro catalyzes cleavage between Serine and Glutamine

187

within the viral polypeptides. To characterize the interactions required for cleavage,

188

we analyzed two co-crystals with peptidomimetic inhibitors [2A5I, 3VB5]. In these

189

structures, the side chain of the catalytic C145 binds the peptide Serine backbone.

190

The catalytic C145 side chain is rigid in all co-crystals except for [2A5I] in which the

191

side chain adopts a unique conformation. Interestingly, the peptide Glutamine side

192

chain of the cleavage site is anchored by a H-bond interaction with the H163 imidazole

193

(Fig 2E).

194

To characterize the interactions of the cleavage recognition sequence peptide we

195

chose, based on the peptidomimetic inhibitors, the following sequence: Ala, Val, Leu,

196

Gln, Ser, Ala, Gly. We docked (using Glide) the recognition sequence peptide to SARS

197

CoV-2 6LU7 crystal structure and superimposed the two co-crystals with the peptides

198

[2A5I, 3VB5]. The Glutamine within the recognition sequence adopted the same

199

conformation as in the two co-crystals, presenting the same H-bond interaction with

H163 imidazole (Fig 2F). In addition, the peptide’s Valine and Alanine backbone

interact with the E166 backbone (through water molecules).

Docking of known SARS-CoV-1 Mpro inhibitors

203

Since the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2003, several studies have developed inhibitors

204

for Mpro of SARS-Cov-140. To verify that our observed interactions are required for

205

Mpro inhibition, we docked non-covalent SARS-CoV-1 Mpro inhibitors to the SARS-

206

CoV-2 Mpro binding site [6W63]. The same two common interactions (H163 and E166)

207

were present in all compounds tested (see for example few known inhibitors in Figure

208

3).

In summary, the two hydrophilic interactions with H163 and E166 backbone exist in

215

most of the covalent and non-covalent co-crystal ligands and all of these co-crystals

216

show at least one of these interactions. The known inhibitors show the same pattern

217

of interactions and these interactions seem to play a role in the recognition sequence

218

binding, thus highlighting them as biologically significant. Therefore, in the screening

219

process these interactions were chosen as filtering criteria, allowing to pass only poses

220

that satisfied at least one of these two interactions, for further analysis.

221

In addition, the Schrödinger SiteMap tool41,42 identified two hydrophobic regions within

222

the vicinity of the binding site and we found that most of the covalent and non-covalent

223

co-crystal ligands and the known inhibitors introduced hydrophobic moieties within

224

those regions.

225

Non-covalent docking using GOLD and Glide

226

To identify possible inhibitors from the FDA-approved drugs we used [6W63] protein

227

structure as a template for virtual screening, applying two docking software (as

228

recommended43). The prepared ligand set originating from the ChEMBL drug

229

database was docked either using GOLD, outputting 10 conformations (poses) for

230

each compound resulting in 46,190 poses (3,634 unique drugs), or using Glide,

231

outputting at most 5 conformations (poses) per compound resulting in 22,004 poses

232

(3,620 unique drugs).

233

We filtered the poses based on the two significant interactions identified in our

234

analysis: H163 imidazole H-bond and E166 backbone amine H-bond (see the

235

Materials and Methods section for details). We chose the best docking poses that

236

satisfied either one or both of these interactions, resulting in at most three poses for

237

each compound. This stage resulted in 2,993 unique compounds poses in GOLD and

238

1,969 unique compounds in Glide. We manually selected the filtered poses resulting

239

in 21 compounds in GOLD and 13 in Glide. Altogether, a total of 29 unique compounds

251

compounds were visually inspected and we selected the ones that showed additional

252

interactions to the C145 covalent interaction. We tested 5 nitriles and one Michael

253

acceptor and two of the nitriles (bicalutamide and ruxolitinib) showed 36% and 20%

254

inhibition at 50μM, respectively (Supplementary Table 2)

255

Discussion

256

Antiviral drugs targeting the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 could support the fight against the

257

global COVID-19 pandemic. Here, to identify possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2

258

Mpro, we have explored the co-crystal structures of the Mpro proteins of SARS-CoV-

259

2 and SARS-CoV-1. We identified two common interactions involving H163 and E166

260

that appeared in most co-crystals. We screened in silico drug databases for covalent

261

and non-covalent compounds. Possible compounds were further tested in a protease

262

inhibition assay and we found several compounds that reduce protease activity by

263

more than 30%.

39

. As there are very few possible known drugs that can perform

44

. This database was filtered to contain only compounds with covalent

264

The Mpro protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar (99%) to SARS-CoV-1.

265

In the region of the binding site only one residue is different. Some studies suggested

266

that the differences between the two proteins affected the ability to bind inhibitors45,46.

267

On the other hand, several studies and our protease inhibition assay show that

268

inhibitors identified for SARS-CoV-1 Mpro also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (see

269

Supplementary Table 3). Further co-crystals of SARS-CoV-1 [2MAQ] and SARS-CoV-

270

2 [6LU7] Mpro with the identical inhibitor (N3) show similar interactions with the

271

protease binding site12. Thus, we inferred that the binding to the binding site of both

272

viruses is comparable and therefore we were able to analyze the key interactions

273

based on co-crystals obtained from both viruses.

274

We identified that all co-crystals have at least one of two key interactions with H163

275

and E166. Docking of the recognition sequence peptide into the binding site revealed

276

that H163 and E166 form H-bonds with the peptide. Specifically, the imidazole ring of

277

H163 interacts with the conserved Glutamine of the cleavage site11 while E166

278

interacts with the Alanine and Valine from the recognition sequence. Interestingly,

279

E166 side chain interacts with Serine 1 NH2-terminal of the second monomer11,47. This

280

salt bridge interaction minimizes the conformational flexibility of E166 backbone and

281

assists in generating the correct orientation of the substrate binding site, which

282

explains the importance of dimerization for the catalytic activity47. H163 and E166

283

amino acids are conserved among all human coronaviruses (2 alpha- and 5 beta-

284

coronaviruses Figure 4), unlike H164 and Q189 that were previously identified as

285

important interactions of several inhibitors12,22. Thus, drugs developed to interact with

286

these amino acids may be effective against all human coronaviruses and could

287

potentially prevent the emergence of viral resistance.

295

experiments. Further, these studies used either [6LU7] or [6Y2F], as their template for

296

the computational screening. We used [6W63] as the protein structure for our non-

297

covalent docking, as [6W63] ligand is non-covalent while [6LU7] and [6Y2F] ligands

298

are covalent. The protein structure of [6W63] differs from [6LU7] and [6Y2F] in the

299

identified co-crystals flexibility residues M49, Q189 and N142 (Figure 1D and E). For

300

the covalent docking we used seven different crystal structures (see results) to allow

301

more flexibility in the binding site.

302

Our two screening analyses resulted in two clinically approved drugs that inhibit the

303

Mpro by over 30% in 50μM.: The first one is GSK-256066, a phosphodiesterase (PDE)

304

4 inhibitor53 that was under development in phase 2 for the treatment of chronic

305

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis. It is

306

administered as an inhalation formulation (powder) and as an intranasal formulation

307

(nasal spray suspension). Our model suggests that GSK-256066 forms a H-bond with

308

H163 and additional two H-bonds with the amine and carbonyl of E166 backbone

309

(Figure 5). It inhibits the Mpro by 37% at a concentration of 50μM.

314

Another drug that showed inhibition of the Mpro is bicalutamide, which was selected

315

from the covalent screening. It contains an aryl nitrile that can covalently bind to the

316

protein. Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is

317

comprised of a 50:50 racemic mixture of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers. Bicalutamide

318

binds to the androgen receptor. Our model suggests that its nitrile group covalently

319

binds to C145 and forms two H-bonds with the amine and carbonyl of the E166

320

backbone (Figure 5). Bicalutamide was tested in two experiments and inhibited Mpro

321

by 37% and 33% at a concentration of 50μM.

322

Several compounds that were previously identified as inhibitors with sub-micromolar

323

potency were active in our protease inhibition assay (Supplementary Table 3). Two of

324

these inhibitors with known sub-micromolar activity, showed limited inhibition (39%

325

and 9%) at a concentration of 50μM in our protease activity assay (Supplementary

326

Table 3). Thus, GSK-256066 and bicalutamide, that were identified in our protease

327

inhibition assay, have a similar inhibitory activity at the same concentration. These

328

results suggest that more assays should be conducted to test repurposing of these

329

drugs as anti-SARS therapeutics.

330

In conclusion, our analysis of the structural constraints required for the inhibition of

331

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has suggested key interactions with several amino acids in the

332

active pocket of the protein. We were able to identify several approved drugs with a

333

potential to inhibit Mpro activity, indicating that our analysis could be used for virtual

334

screenings and rational drug development.

Materials and Methods

337

Protein data bank (PDB) search

338

The protein data bank was searched for SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

339

Non SARS-CoV structures and non-human SARS-CoV like structures were omitted.

340

Co-crystals binding fragments were not added to this analysis due to their non-drug

341

like structures. We anticipate that few of the available structures might be overlooked

342

using these search criteria. All PDB structures found and analyzed are mentioned in

343

Table 1. Throughout the text, PDB IDs are marked with square brackets.

344

Preparing a drug library from ChEMBL for non-covalent docking

345

The ChEMBL database contains 6,900 drugs in various stages of clinical trials. To

346

focus our computational screen, the following filters were applied: small molecules that

347

were at clinical phase 2 or higher, number of rotatable bonds < 14, MW freebase 200-

348

990, ATC Class Level 1: all except D-Dermatologics and V-Various. This filtering

349

resulted in a 4,239-compound library. To prepare the ligands for docking simulations,

350

LigPrep (Schrödinger Release 2020-1: LigPrep, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY,

351

2020) was applied on the exported library. The following settings were used: (a) The

352

OPLS3e force field was chosen54; (b) Possible protonation states were generated

353

using Ionizer at a target pH of 7.4 ; (c) All ligands were desalted; (d) No tautomers

354

were generated; (e) At most two stereoisomeric forms were produced per ligand for

355

unspecified chiral centers. These constraints enabled us to expand the initial 4,239-

356

compound library to only 4,623 ligands.

357

Preparing a drug library from DrugBank for covalent docking

358

We used the DrugBank database44 that includes 11414 preclinical and clinical small

359

molecules. These compounds were filtered by ≤500D MW and ≤5 rotatable bonds.

Only

compounds

that

warheads

(Michael

acceptors:

362

C145. The filtering resulted in a library of 437 ligands (258 Michael acceptors and 179

363

nitriles).

364

Docking

365

The 4,623 prepared ligands originating from ChEMBL were docked using Glide

366

(Schrödinger Release 2020-1: Glide, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2020) to the

367

Mpro structure from [6W63], keeping the protein structure rigid and ligands flexible,

368

with no constraints applied on specific receptor-ligand hydrogen bond (H-bond)

369

interactions. The standard precision (SP) mode of Glide was used based on the

370

OPLS3e force field, writing out at most 5 poses per ligand. The 22,003 conformations

371

(poses) were filtered by requiring at least one of the two key H-bond interactions with

372

H163 and E166. The default maximum H-bond distance criterion of 2.5 Å was

373

stretched to 3.0 Å. This filter resulted in three groups of poses: (a) 517 poses

374

interacting with both H163 and E166; (b) 2,088 poses forming a H-bond with H163

375

only; and (c) 2,678 poses forming a H-bond with E166 only. In each of the filtered

376

groups, the pose with the best Glide score per each ligand was selected, resulting in

377

293, 879 and 1,347 poses, respectively. We further narrowed down the number of

378

poses by eliminating drugs with molecular charge below -1 using Maestro’s Ligand

379

Filtering utility. Applying this filter resulted in 260, 820 and 1,283 poses, respectively.

380

Removing the duplicate poses (i.e. those overlapping with one associated with either

381

or both of the two other groups) resulted in a total of 1,969 unique poses.

per ligand). Identical filters as in Glide docking were applied resulting in a total of 2,993

385

unique poses that were grouped by interactions to (a) 86 poses interacting with both

386

H163 and E166; (b) 1,011 poses forming H-bond with H163 only; and (c) 1,896 poses

387

forming H-bond with E166 only.

388

Selection

389

In our manual selection we preferred ligands that in addition to one or two important

390

interactions (H163 and E166) also formed interactions with additional residues that

391

were found in the co-crystal structure (for example Gly143 backbone). In addition, we

392

favored compounds that did not violate the two hydrophobic regions within the binding

393

site as calculated by Maestro’s SiteMap tool (Schrödinger Release 2020-1: SiteMap,

394
