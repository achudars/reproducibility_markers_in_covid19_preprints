ABSTRACT

20

The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae; Betacoronavirus) is the underlying cause of

21

COVID-19 disease. Here we assessed SARS-CoV2 from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia alongside

22

sequences of SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoVs and MERS-CoV, the latter currently detected in this

23

region. Phylogenetic analysis, natural selection investigation and genome recombination analysis

24

were performed. Our analysis showed that all Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences are of the same origin

25

and closer proximity to bat SARS-like CoVs, followed by SARS-CoVs, however quite distant to

26

MERS-CoV. Moreover, genome recombination analysis revealed two recombination events

27

between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like CoVs. This was further assessed by S gene recombination

28

analysis. These recombination events may be relevant to the emergence of this novel virus.

29

Moreover, positive selection pressure was detected between SARS-CoV-2, bat SL-CoV isolates

30

and human SARS-CoV isolates. However, the highest positive selection occurred between SARS-

31

CoV-2 isolates and 2 bat-SL-CoV isolates (Bat-SL-RsSHC014 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45). This further

32

indicates that SARS-CoV-2 isolates were adaptively evolved from bat SARS-like isolates, and that

33

a virus with originating from bats triggered this pandemic. This study thuds sheds further light on

34

the origin of this virus.

AUTHOR SUMMARY

45

The emergence and subsequent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a unique challenge to countries all

46

over the world, including Saudi Arabia where cases of the related MERS are still being reported.

47

Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin. In our analysis,

48

SARS-CoV-2 were more closely related to bat SARS-like CoVs rather than to MERS-CoV (which

49

originated in Saudi Arabia) or SARS-CoV, confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen.

50

Recombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at

51

the origin of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The data shown here give hints on the origin of this virus

52

and may inform efforts on transmissibility, host adaptation and other biological aspects of this

53

virus.

INTRODUCTION

56

A novel human pathogen called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;

57

Coronaviridae; Betacoronavirus) originated from Hubei, China in December 2019 and has since

58

spread all around the world [1]. The disease was named as COVID-19 and human to human

59

transfer has been established [2]. The disease symptoms depicted in SARS-CoV-2 infections were

60

found similar to the infections caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [3], however it

61

would appear that the case case fatality rate is considerably lower [4]. A virus related to SARS-

62

CoV, Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) originated from camels in the

63

Middle East and cases are still reported by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

64

[5, 6].

65

SARS-CoV-2 is different from two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that caused

66

human disease earlier in the twenty-first century. Beforehand, the Coronaviridae Study Group,

67

an ICTV working group, determined each of these later two viruses prototype as a new species in

68

new subgenera of the genus Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus and Merbecovirus [7, 8]. SARS-CoV-2

69

was assigned recently to the sarbecoviruses, a grouping that contains hundreds of known viruses

70

predominantly isolated from humans and diverse bats [9].

71

Coronaviruses are positive sense, non-segmented, single stranded, enveloped RNA viruses with

72

genome size of 26 kb to 32 kb identified to cause respiratory diseases in a variety of animals and

73

humans. Human coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are pathogens of

74

zoonotic origin [10]. Previous sequence analysis showed a high percentage of similarity among

75

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat corona viruses [11, 12].

76

Coronaviruses contains mainly four types of structural and several non-structural proteins [10,

77

13, 14]. The spike protein S is one of the structural protein plays a key role in recognition and

78

attachment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

79

(ACE2) receptor [15, 16, 17]. Structurally, S is composed of two functional subunits essential for

80

binding to the host cell receptor (S1 subunit) and virus-host cell fusion (S2 subunit) [18]. The S1

81

subunit exists within the N-terminal 14–685 amino acids of S, including the N-terminal domain

82

(NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and receptor binding motif (RBM). The S2 subunit involves

83

fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain I and

84

cytoplasmic domain (CP). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 S protein comprises a special S1/S2 furin-

85

detectible site, leading to potentially distinctive infectious properties (12). SARS-CoV-2 genome

86

analysis depicted a similarity index of 79.5% with SARS-CoV and very high resemblance to bat

87

coronaviruses, including SL-COVZC45 and RaTG13 [12, 19, 20]. Such viral sequence analysis

88

provides important information regarding genetic characteristics and origin of viruses, and

89

sequence-dependent data can be used for precise diagnosis of etiological agents and

90

adaptation/support of control measures. SARS-CoV-2 dissemination has been reported globally

91

and new infections are recorded with a fast pace in different regions of the world [21]. The

92

growing number of infections over time may result in emergence of new variants. As such,

93

genome sequence tracking and characterization are important to keep track of such events.

94

SARS-CoV-2 sequences phylogenetic analyses will help us to understand the reservoir species,

95

their potential to human transmission and evolution patterns of coronaviruses. The data

96

generated here, where we focus on an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Saudi

97

Arabia, to further understand the history of this virus.

Phylogenetic analysis of whole viral genomes

111

Whole genome alignments were generated by using ClustalW with opening penalty of 15 and

112

extension penalty of 6.66. Pairwise sequence identity and similarity from multiple sequence

113

alignments was calculated using the server (http://imed.med.ucm.es) that contains the SIAS

114

(Sequence Identity And Similarity) tool. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with Neighbor-

115

Joining (NJ) method, Minimum Evolution (ME) method, Maximum Parsimony (MP) method, and

116

UPGMA with 1000 bootstrap replicates (MEGA X) [22].

117

Genome recombination analysis

118

Potential recombination events in the history of the Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were assessed

119

using RDP4 [23]. RDP4 analysis was carried out based on the complete genome (nucleotide)

120

sequence, using RDP, BootScan, GENECONV, Chimera, SISCAN, maximum chi square and 3SEQ

121

methods. These methods are entirely used and compared in order to get consensus results. A

122

putative recombination event was passed to consequent analysis only if it was plausibly defined

123

by at least 3 of the above-mentioned seven algorithms [24]. The minor parent was defined as the

124

one contributing by the smaller fraction of the obtained recombinant, whereas the major parent

125

was that contributing by the larger fraction of the yielded recombinant [25]. Moreover, the

126

recognized recombination events were detected with a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of

127

0.01. In order to avoid the possibility of false-positive results, phylogenetic analysis of the

128

detected recombination was performed [24, 26]. In addition, the whole dataset alignment of

129

each recognized recombinant was divided at the breakpoint positions. If 2 recombination

130

breakpoints existed in a single sequence, the sequence region between the breakpoints was

131

denoted the “minor” region, triggered by the minor parent, while the remaining part is called the

132

“major” region, provoked by the major parent. As a consequence, Neighbor-joining phylogenetic

133

trees were generated to display the probable topological shifts of specific sequences.

134

Phylogenetic discrepancy is revealed by a putative recombinant whose distance in the phylogeny

135

is obviously close to a single parent whilst far from another for each sequence segment [27].

136

Recombination analysis was repeated for SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences using automated RDP

137

analysis to investigate the presence of a recombinant that might lead to SARS-CoV-2 emergence

138

among in SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

139

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences

140

S gene sequences were obtained for 3 Saudi sequences from the GISAID Epiflu Database. In

141

addition, 7 bat SARS-Like CoV sequences, 2 human SARS-CoV sequences and Saudi MERS-CoV

142

sequence were used for alignment. This was followed by finding the best model that could be

143

implemented when constructing the phylogenetic tree upon analysis. Models with the lowest BIC

144

scores (Bayesian Information Criterion) are considered to depict the substitution pattern best.

145

Moreover, AICc value (Akaike Information Criterion, corrected), Maximum Likelihood value (lnL),

146

and the number of parameters (including branch lengths) are considered For each model [28].

147

Non-uniformity of evolutionary rates among sites may be modeled via applying a discrete

148

Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories and assuming that a certain fraction of sites is

149

evolutionarily invariable (+I). Furthermore, tree topology was automatically computed to

150

estimate ML values. This analysis involved 13 nucleotide sequences. Evolutionary analyses were

151

conducted in MEGA X [22]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the NJ method based on

152

the best fitting substitution model obtained from the previous test with bootstrap of 500

153

replicates.

154

Codon-based Z-test

155

A codon-based test of positive selection (Z-test, MEGA X) was used to analyze the numbers of

156

non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS ratio) in the S gene to check the

157

probability of positive selection occurrences.

158

Molecular clock analysis

159

The molecular clock test was performed by comparing the ML value for the given topology

160

obtained in the presence and absence of the molecular clock constraints under Hasegawa-

161

Kishino-Yano model (+G+I) using MEGA X. Differences in evolutionary rates among sites were

162

modeled using a discrete Gamma (G) distribution and allowed for invariant (I) sites to exist.

163

RESULTS

164

Sequence alignments of whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoVs and MERS-

165

CoV showed an obvious variation in % identity that ranged from extremely high % identities of

166

99.91-100% identity between Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences (suggesting same or similar origin);

167

78.58-88.03% between Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences and bat SARS-like CoVs; 79.18-79.37%

168

between Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences and SARS-CoVs that initiated the SARS pandemic in 2003;

169

to relatively low % identity of 52.28-52.3% between Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences and Saudi

170

MERS-CoV sequence, as shown in Table 2.

Following whole genome alignments, phylogenetic trees were constructed with NJ, ME, UPGMA,

178

and MP methods. The trees had similar topography with significant bootstrap support in case of

179

NJ and ME methods. A tree containing the 3 SARS-CoV-2 Saudi isolates sequences as well as other

180

full-length genomes for the 9 sarbecoviruses of bat and human origin and a merbecovirus, MERS-

181

CoV. Three major clades are observed. The Saudi SARS-CoV-2 isolates form a monophyletic group

182

that nests within a lineage of bat SL-CoVZC45 isolate. This is supported by the percent similarity

183

between the SARS-CoV-2 isolates and bat SL-CoV45 isolate for the full-length genomes (Table 2),

184

which are greater than 87.8%. Eight viruses, 2 human SARS-CoV isolates and 6 bat SARS-like CoV,

185

made up a second distinct lineage and a single MERS-CoV from Abha, a third. In UPGMA, the

186

topology was different, since the monophyletic group comprising the 3 Saudi SARS-CoV-2 isolates

187

was diverged so that it included only 2 isolates, hCoV-19/SA/SCDC-3321 and hCoV-19/SA/SCDC-

188

3324 (100% identity) unlike hCoV-19/SA/KAIMRC-Alghoribi of 99.91% identity to the other 2

189

SARS-CoV-2. However, the MP method resulted in quite a different phylogenetic topology.

190

Phylogenetic trees generated with each method are shown in Fig 1 and Fig S1. Overall,

phylogenetic analysis could reveal that all Saudi viruses with available sequences are of the same

Chimaera & 3SEQ. It included recombination breakpoints at nucleotides 22421 and 22733 which

211

divide the genome into three regions (1-22421, 22422-22732 and 22733- 31294) (Fig 2). The

212

major parent of the recombinant was Bat-SL-CoV_YNL34C while the minor parent was Bat-SL-

213

CoV_RsSHC014 as displayed in the recombination event tree (Fig S2). The recombination rate

214

detected was 3.429 x 10-4 to 1.102 x 10-15 substitutions per site per year at the second region,

215

which comprises the S region. The second recombination event was detected by only 3 detection

216

methods including RDP, Bootscan & 3SEQ. It included recombination breakpoints at 22177 and

217

22375. The major parent of the recombinant was Bat-SL-CoV_RsSHC014 while the minor parent

218

was Bat-SL-CoV_Rf4 displayed in the recombination event tree (Fig S3). The recombination rate

219

detected was 2.462 x 10-15 substitutions per site per year at nucleotides 22134-22217 inside the

220

S region (Fig 3).

Since both recombination events appeared in the S gene region, sequences of S genes of the 13

235

CoVs were extracted for multiple alignment using ClustalW, followed by finding the best

236

substitution model to be implemented in the phylogenetic analysis. GTR and TN93 models were

237

the best fitting owing to achieving the least BIC of 51289.85 and 51325.49, respectively.

238

Consequently, the phylogenetic tree was constructed using TN93 model and although, it was

239

constructed using the NJ method (Fig 4), and the obtained tree was consistent with the tree

240

yielded from UPMGA generated previously for the whole genome. Moreover, according to fig 4,

241

bat-SL-CoVZC45 is the closest relative to Saudi SARS-CoV-2 isolates in terms of the S region.

Positive selection across the SARS-CoV-2 S sequence

248

To investigate the divergence in sarbecoviruses that may have led to emergence of the novel

249

SARS-CoV-2, positive selection pressure was examined. A codon-based Z-test for positive

250

selection, was used to analyze the numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions

251

per site (dN/dS ratio) in the S gene. The test showed that positive selection was occurring between

252

the Saudi MERS-CoV_0800H isolate and the bat SARS-like CoV isolates (Bat_SL_CoVZC45,

253

Bat_SL_Rs7327 and Bat-SL_RsSHC014) and the human SARS-CoV isolates (dN/dS =1.7384, 1.9196,

254

1.7381, 1.89 and 1.8982, respectively, and P < 0.0424, P < 0.0286, P < 0.424, P < 0.0306 and P <

255

0.03, respectively; Table 3). However, there was no positive selection observed in the case of the

256

SARS-CoV-2 Saudi isolates (P > 0.05). It was proposed that the presence of MERS-CoV strain

257

among the other isolates might have masked any positive selection imposed on SARS-CoV-2

258

isolates owing to possessing the lowest % identity to the other isolates. Consequently, the codon-

259

based Z-test was carried out again for all isolates except for the MERS-CoV isolate to ensure the

260

proposed hypothesis. It was found that there was positive selection between the Saudi SARS-

261

CoV-2 isolates, bat SL-CoV isolates and human SARS-CoV isolates (P < 0.05). The highest positive

262

selection was between Saudi SARS-CoV-2 isolates (hCoV-19/Saudi Arabia/SCDC-3324, hCoV-

265

10.4636 and 10.6251, respectively, and P < 0.00001 for all isolates; Table 4), followed by the

isolates.

The whole genome sequences tested for recombination events using RDP revealed the presence

302

of recombination events in the S region. S gene sequences were checked for recombination

303

events in more details. It was found that two new recombination events have occurred among

304

bat SARS-Like coronavirus, human SARS-CoV (that occurred during the SARS pandemic in 2003)

305

and (SARS-CoV-2) hCoV-19/Saudi Arabia/KAIMRC-Alghoribi S genes; and both recombination

306

events were also observed for the other Saudi SARS-Cov-2 isolates. The first recombination event

307

was detected by 5 out of 7 detection methods involving RDP, GENECONV, Bootscan, MaxChi,

308

SiScan & 3SEQ. It included recombination breakpoints at nucleotides 2094 and 2349 which divide

309

the S sequence into three regions (1-2094, 2095-2348 and 2349- 4075). The major parent of the

310

recombinant was Bat-SL-COVZC45 while the minor parent was Hu-SARS-CoV_GD displayed in the

311

recombination event tree (Fig S4). The recombination rate detected by RPD was 1.855 x 10-3

312

substitutions per site per year at 1298-1763 region for all Saudi SARS-CoV isolates (Fig 5),

313

however it increased to 6.039 x 10-3 substitutions per site per year when detected by SiScan for

314

hCoV-19/Saudi Arabia/KAIMRC-Alghoribi as a recombinant. The second recombination event was

315

detected by only 2 detection methods including RDP & 3SEQ and was of low quality although the

316

same recombination rate was obtained, however the major parent in the above recombination

317

event was replaced by bat-SL-CoV_As6526.

DISCUSSION

327

Our knowledge of SARS COV-2 regarding basic and intermediate host species, evolution and

328

genetic variation in relation to other coronaviruses like MERS-COV and SARS-COV is limited. The

329

virus is spreading globally and with an increasing number of infections, its history and evolution

330

needed further investigation. Typically, average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly

331

considered as 10 -4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year [29], which agrees with the current

332

study findings.

333

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Kingdom of Saudi Arabia depicted that they

334

were more similar to bat coronavirus followed by human SARS-CoV, however too distant to

335

MERS-CoV. The results of our phylogenetic analysis are partially in line with a previous study [30,

336

31], indicative of high similarity with bat SARS-like coronavirus sequences with SARS COV-2 and

337

suggesting that Rhinolophus bats may serve as common host for circulating coronavirus. It was

338

previously reported that Rhinolophus bats may serve as hosts for potentially emerging viruses

339

[32]. The MP method used for phylogenetic tree designing had a quite different phylogenetic

340

topology from others. This could be owing to the principle of MP method in which the minimum

341

number of evolutionary changes that interprets the whole sequence evolution (tree length) is

342

computed for each topology, and the topology showing the smallest tree length value is chosen

343

as the preferred tree (MP tree) [33]. Although the ME method shares a similar principle, it was

344

mentioned elsewhere that it is closer to NJ method in defining the correct tree and that MP

345

method is less efficient than NJ and ME methods for obtaining the most fitting and/or the correct

346

topology [34]. Consequently, a different topology was expected although it was found in a

17

347

previous study, that 4 methods led to similar topologies. This may be owing to species differences

348

since the latter was for turkey coronaviruses (group 3 viruses), however the current study was

349

for SARS-CoV-2 virus (group 2 viruses) [35]. Therefore, the suggestion of divergence among Saudi

350

SARS-CoV-2 isolates resulted from MP method was rejected and assumed to be of similar origin.

351

Recombination events can occur in coronaviruses [36, 37]. As per the present study,

352

recombination analysis of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed a common isolate in both

353

recombination events which is bat-SL-CoV_RsSHC014, once as a minor parent and another as a

354

major parent. Moreover, the recombination event was detected in the S region. Interestingly,

355

RsSHC014 isolate, which is a bat coronavirus from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae) was

356

reported to be significantly more closely related to SARS-CoV than any formerly identified bat

357

coronaviruses, especially in the RBD of the spike protein [38]. This contradicts the findings of a

358

recent study that didn’t recognize any evidence for recombination along the entire genome of

359

SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate [12]. This could be owing to the exclusion of the significant isolate

360

RsSHC014 for whole genome recombination analysis, that can largely limit the identification

361

sensitivity of recombination events of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Indeed, the exclusion of the

362

significantly putative recombination parent AF531433 influenced the identification sensitivity of

363

recombination events in classical swine fever virus genomes [27].

364

The current study reported two recombination events between the Saudi SARS-CoV-2 isolates

365

and bat SARS-like CoVs, in the S region, which complements previous suggestions [39, 40]. Such

366

events may relate to the divergence in host tropism. Since the S protein mediates both receptor

367

binding and membrane fusion [40] and is essential for defining host tropism and transmission

368

capacity [41], these sequences were investigated specifically. Recombination events were

369

detected from phylogenetic analysis of S sequences and whole genome. Interestingly, MERS-CoV

370

was found to mask the presence of any positive selection pressure among the Saudi SARS-CoV-2

371

isolates. This could be due to the distant difference between the two lineages as well as the

372

positive selection pressure sites. Positively selected sites for MERS-CoV are present in the region

373

included the two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and their linker in S2 domain [42], however

374

positively selected sites are located in NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 [43].

375

Examining the dN/dS ratios for the S gene in Saudi SARS-CoV-2 isolates showed that positive

376

selection was occurring between viruses isolated in 2017 (bat-SL-CoVZC45, Zhoushan

377

city/Zhejiang province/China) and 2020 (hCoV-19/Saudi Arabia/KAIMRC-Alghoribi/2020, hCoV-

378

19/Saudi Arabia/SCDC-3321/2020 and hCoV-19/Saudi Arabia/SCDC-3324/2020, Riyadh/Saudi

379

Arabia) and between viruses isolated in 2011 (bat-SL-CoV_RsSHC014, Yunnan Province/China)

380

and

381

3321/2020 and hCoV-19/Saudi Arabia/SCDC-3324/2020, Riyadh/Saudi Arabia), after the

382

emergence of the disease in humans. Recombination analysis of S gene and of SARS-CoV-2 whole

383

genome suggested bat SARS-like CoV as the major parental strain. Recombination analysis of S

384

sequence added the possibility of contribution of a SARS-CoV-like sequence though this requires

385

further examination. This finding was supported by a previous study that reported about past

386

recombination detected in the S gene of WHCV (WH-Human 1 coronavirus referred to as ‘2019-

387

nCoV’ of Wuhan, China), SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs including WIV1 and RsSHC014 isolates

388

[12]. The later isolate agrees with our recombination analysis results obtained for SARS-CoV-2

389

whole genome. However, recombination analysis of S region revealed another major parental

390

strain which is bat-SL-CoVZC45. This isolate was reported to have a significant nucleotide identity

391

(82.3 to 84%) with SARS-CoV-2 S sequence and is a closer relative [2, 12], and might therefore act

392

as a closer probable ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 [44]. Moreover, the second recombination event,

393

that considered bat-SL-CoV_As6526 isolate as a major parent, was reported to be of low-quality

394

owing to being below the acceptable limit (approved by 2 out of 7 algorithms; minimum approval

395

limit is 3). This might be because of the fact that bat-SL-CoV_As6526 isolate (Betacoronavirus

396

Clade 2) was reported to have deletions in the RBD [45] resulting in enhanced entry using ACE-2

397

receptor only upon protease treatment, unlike SARS-CoV-2 [46]. However, bat-SL-CoV_As6526

398

as a recombination contributor is still possible since SARS-CoV-2 S contains most of the contact

399

points with human ACE2 present in clade 1 (Containing SARS-CoV some bat-SL-CoVs as SCH014),

400

besides some amino acid variations which are distinctive to clade 2 (containing the As6526 isolate

401

and other bat-SL-CoVs) and 3 (containing the BM48-31 isolate) [46].

In conclusion, our analysis of 3 Saudi SARS-2-CoV-2 and 7 representative bat SARS-like CoV, 2

403

human SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV gives further hints about origin of this pandemic virus, in

404

particular with regards to recombination events that underlie SARS-CoV-2 evolution.
