Abstract
COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
which spread worldwide in 2020, is an urgent problem to be overcome. The ORF8 of
SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to be associated with the symptoms of COVID-19,
according to reports of clinical studies. However, little is known about the function of
ORF8. As one of the ways to advance the functional analysis of ORF8, mass production
of ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure is necessary. In this study, we
attempted to produce ORF8 protein by chemically inducible protein production system
using tobacco BY-2 cells. An ORF8-producing line was generated by the Agrobacterium
method. As a result, the production of ORF8 of 8.8 ± 1.4 mg/L of culture medium was
confirmed. SDS-PAGE and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis confirmed that
the ORF8 produced by this system is a dimeric form with a single structure, unlike that
produced in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was suggested that the ORF8 produced by
this system was glycosylated. Through this study, we succeeded in producing ORF8
folded into a single structure in a chemically inducible protein production system using
tobacco BY-2 cells. It is expected that the functional analysis of ORF8 will be advanced
using the ORF8 produced by this system and that it will greatly contribute to the
development of antibodies and therapeutic agents targeting ORF8.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and characterized by severe pneumonia, spread worldwide
in 2020. To overcome the threat of SARS-CoV-2, the development of therapeutic agents
and vaccines based on functional elucidation is urgently needed. The SARS-CoV-2
genome was sequenced recently (Acc. No.: NC_045512.2, Fig. 1a). Interestingly, open
reading frame 8 (ORF8), an accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2, has lower homology than
that of the closely related SARS virus, unlike other SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Instead, ORF8
of SARS-CoV-2 shows high homology with ORF8 of bat coronavirus (Lu, et al. 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 mutants lacking ORF8 were reported to be less likely to cause severe
disease (Young, et al. 2020). ORF8 is reported to be highly immunogenic, and anti-ORF8
antibodies are formed in the early stage of infection (Hachim, et al. 2020). Furthermore, it
has been reported that a significant T-cell response to ORF8 is observed in recovered
patients (Grifoni, et al. 2020). Thus, ORF8 is predicted to be closely associated with the
symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2. An X-ray crystallization study has revealed the
three-dimensional structure of ORF8 (Flower, et al. 2020) and that ORF8 affects the
immune system (Zhang, et al. 2020). Further studies on ORF8 function are warranted.

To analyze ORF8 function, a large amount of homogeneous protein folded into a single
structure needs to be produced, which can also be used for developing antibodies and
therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19. A plant-based production system can be used to
mass produce eukaryotic proteins that are physiologically active. We have developed a
highly efficient chemically inducible protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells,

utilizing the extremely high protein production capacity of tobamovirus (ToMV) (Dohi,
et al. 2006). In this study, we used an improved expression system that provided positive
feedback on transcription factor (XVE) expression (Fig. 1b). Protein production using
plant-cultured cells is a large-scale process that is uniform, aseptic, and GMP-compliant.
Our system can mass produce eukaryotic proteins with multiple disulfide bonds with
sufficient quality for structural and functional studies. We have successfully produced
proteins that were difficult to produce uniformly in Escherichia coli. including
plant-bioactive (Costa, et al. 2014; Ohki, et al. 2011) and animal (Ohki, et al. 2008)
proteins and have determined their structures using solution nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR). Mature ORF8 contains seven cysteines, six of which form three intramolecular
disulfide bond pairs and one forms an intermolecular disulfide bond for dimerization
(Flower, et al. 2020) (Fig. 1c). In addition, one N-glycosylation site has been predicted for
ORF8 (Fig 1c). Our production system is expected to be suitable for uniform ORF8
protein production with these structural features.

To produce ORF8, we designed the amino acid sequence for the 8 His-tagged ORF8
fusion protein with an extracellular signal peptide added to the N-terminus. Next,
artificial ORF8 was synthesized by optimizing codons in tobacco and introducing
restriction enzyme sites for cloning at both ends (IDT, Coralville, USA; Acc. No.:
LC586256). The artificially synthesized ORF8 was introduced into a chemically
inducible tobamovirus vector (pBICLBSER-ToMV-SP-His-ORF8, Fig. 1d). Next,
pBICLBSER-ToMV-SP-His-ORF8 and pBICHgLBSXVE (Fig. 1d) expressing the

artificial transcription factor XVE, which activates transcription by binding with
17β-estradiol (Dohi, et al. 2006), were introduced into tobacco BY-2 cells by the
Agrobacterium method, and the ORF8-producing line was selected (Fig. 1e). The
ORF8-producing cells were suspension-cultured in normal MS medium and MS medium
labeled with an 15N nitrogen source for NMR analysis. ORF8 production was induced by
adding 10 µM 17β-estradiol (Fig. 1e). After 4 days, the induced tobacco BY-2 cells had
significantly suppressed proliferation due to viral vector replication compared to
non-induced cells (Fig. 1f). ORF8 production was confirmed in the induced cells. ORF8
was the major protein found in the culture medium (Fig. 1g). This production system
could produce 8.8 ± 1.4 mg of ORF8 per liter culture medium. Following purification
using a nickel column, ORF8 in the culture medium could be obtained in the form of a
single protein (Fig. 1h). In E. coli, ORF8 did not form the correctly folded
three-dimensional structure and required refolding; moreover, a mixture of monomers
and dimers was produced (Flower, et al. 2020). In contrast, the molecular weight of ORF8
produced by tobacco BY-2 cells was changed by approximately 50% in the presence of
2-mercaptoethanol (2ME) compared with that in the absence of 2ME. This result
indicates that ORF8 produced in tobacco BY-2 cells are dimers due to the formation of
disulfide bonds (Fig. 1i). Furthermore, 1H and 1H-13C HSQC NMR analysis suggested
that ORF8 was glycosylated (Fig. 1j, k), indicating that ORF8 is glycosylated in infected
individuals. Moreover, distribution, line-shape, and intensity of the peaks in 1H and
1

H-15N HSQC strongly indicated that ORF8 produced using the BY-2 system forms a

stable β-sheet-rich three-dimensional structure (Fig. 1j, l). The number of peaks in 1H-15N

HSQC was less than expected, probably because the larger molecular size due to
glycosylation and dimerization caused line broadening.

In this study, we successfully produced ORF8 that is folded into a single structure in a
ToMV-mediated chemically induced protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells.
Furthermore, the purification process could be simplified by releasing ORF8 into the
culture medium that was low in plant-derived contaminants. Our finding shows that it is
possible to produce ORF8 folded into a single structure in large quantities with high
efficiency. Because ORF8 has an intact three-dimensional structure, it can be used for
functional analysis and the production of antibodies and therapeutic agents targeting
ORF8.
