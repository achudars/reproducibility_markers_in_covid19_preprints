Abstract
Seasonal coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) are endemic to the human population,
regularly infecting and reinfecting humans while typically causing asymptomatic to mild
respiratory infections. It is not known to what extent reinfection by these viruses is due to
waning immune memory or antigenic drift of the viruses. Here, we address the influence of
antigenic drift on immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence that at least
two of these viruses, OC43 and 229E, are undergoing adaptive evolution in regions of the viral
spike protein that are exposed to human humoral immunity. This suggests that reinfection may
be due, in part, to positively-selected genetic changes in these viruses that enable them to
escape recognition by the immune system. It is possible that, as with seasonal influenza, these
adaptive changes in antigenic regions of the virus would necessitate continual reformulation of a
vaccine made against them.

Introduction
Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s and, in the decades that followed, human
coronaviruses (HCoVs) received a considerable amount of attention in the field of infectious
disease research. At this time, two species of HCoV, OC43 and 229E, were identified as the
causative agents of roughly 15% of common colds (McIntosh 1974; Heikkinen and Järvinen
2003). Infections with these viruses were shown to exhibit seasonal patterns, peaking in
January-March in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as yearly variation, with the greatest
incidence occurring every 2-4 years (Monto and Lim 1974; Hamre and Beem 1972).
Subsequently, two additional seasonal HCoVs, HKU1 and NL63, have entered the human
population. These 4 HCoVs endemic to the human population usually cause mild respiratory
infections, but occasionally result in more severe disease in immunocompromised patients or
the elderly (D. X. Liu, Liang, and Fung 2020). In the past 20 years, three additional HCoVs
(SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) have emerged, which cause more severe
respiratory illness. At the writing of this paper, amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, no vaccine
for any HCoV is currently available, though many candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in
production and clinical trials (Krammer 2020).
Coronaviruses are named for the ray-like projections of spike protein that decorate their surface.
Inside these virions is a positive-sense RNA genome of roughly 30kB (F. Li 2016). This large
genome size can accommodate more genetic variation than a smaller genome (Woo et al.

2009). Genome flexibility, coupled with a RNA virus error-prone polymerase (Drake 1993) and a
high rate of homologous recombination (Pasternak, Spaan, and Snijder 2006), creates genetic
diversity that is acted upon by evolutionary pressures that select for viral replication. This
spawns much of the diversity within and between coronaviruses species (Woo et al. 2009; Hon
et al. 2008), and can contribute to the virus’ ability to jump species-barriers, allowing a
previously zoonotic CoV to infect and replicate in humans.
The battle between virus and host results in selective pressure for mutations that alter viral
antigens in a way that evades immune recognition. Antigenic evolution, or antigenic drift, leaves
a characteristic mark of positively selected epitopes within the viral proteins most exposed to the
host immune system (Smith et al. 2004). For CoVs, this is the spike protein, exposed on the
surface of the virion to human humoral immunity. Some human respiratory illnesses caused by
RNA viruses, like seasonal influenza (Smith et al. 2004), evolve antigenically, while others, like
measles, do not (Fulton et al. 2015a). Because of this, seasonal influenza vaccines must be
reformulated on a nearly annual basis, while measles vaccines typically provide lifelong
protection. Whether HCoVs undergo antigenic drift is relevant not only to understanding HCoV
evolution and natural immunity against HCoVs, but also to predicting the duration of a vaccine’s
effectiveness.
Early evidence that closely-related HCoVs are antigenically diverse comes from a 1980s human
challenge study in which subjects were infected and then reinfected with a variety of 229Erelated strains (Reed 1984). All subjects developed symptoms and shed virus upon initial virus
inoculation. After about a year, subjects who were re-inoculated with the same strain did not
show symptoms or shed virus. However, the majority of subjects who were re-inoculated with a
heterologous strain developed symptoms and shed virus. This suggests that immunity mounted
against 229E viruses provides protection against some, but not all, other 229E strains. This is a
result that would be expected of an antigenically evolving virus.
More recent studies have identified 8 OC43 genotypes and, in East Asian populations, certain
genotypes were shown to temporally replace other genotypes (Lau et al. 2011; Y. Zhang et al.
2015; Zhu et al. 2018). Whether certain genotypes predominate due to antigenic differences
that confer a fitness advantage is not known. However, evidence for selection in the spike
protein of one of these dominant OC43 genotypes has been provided by dN/dS, a standard
computational method for detecting positive selection (Ren et al. 2015). This method has also
been used to suggest positive selection in the spike protein of 229E (Chibo and Birch 2006).
Additionally, two genetically distinct groupings (each of which include multiple of the
aforementioned 8 genotypes) of OC43 viruses have been shown to alternate in prevalence
within a Japanese community, meaning that the majority of OC43 infections are caused by one
group for about 2-4 years at which point the other group begins to account for the bulk of
infections. It has been suggested that antigenic differences between these groups contribute to
this epidemic switching (Komabayashi et al. 2020).
However, a similar surveillance of the NL63 genotypes circulating in Kilifi, Kenya found that
NL63 genotypes persist for relatively long periods of time, that people become reinfected by the

same genotype, and that reinfections are often enhanced by prior infection (Kiyuka et al. 2018).
These findings are inconsistent with antigenic evolution in NL63.
Here, we use a variety of computational approaches to detect adaptive evolution in spike and
comparator proteins in HCoVs. These methods were designed as improvements to dN/dS with
the intention of identifying adaptive substitutions within a serially-sampled RNA virus population.
We focus on the seasonal HCoVs that have been continually circulating in humans: OC43,
229E, HKU1 and NL63. Our analyses of nonsynonymous divergence, rate of adaptive
substitutions, and Time to Most Recent Ancestor (TMRCA) provide evidence that the spike
protein of OC43 and 229E is under positive selection. Though we conduct these analyses on
HKU1 and NL63, we do not observe evidence for adaptive evolution in the spike protein of
these viruses. For HKU1, there is not enough longitudinal sequencing data available for us to
confidently make conclusions as to whether or not this lack of evidence reflects an actual lack of
adaptive evolution.

Results
Phylogenetic consideration of viral diversity and recombination in OC43 and 229E
We constructed time-resolved phylogenies of the OC43 and 229E using publicly accessible
sequenced isolates. A cursory look at these trees confirms previous reports that substantial
diversity exists within each viral species (Y. Zhang et al. 2015; Komabayashi et al. 2020; Lau et
al. 2011). Additionally, the trees form ladder-like topologies with isolate tips arranged into
temporal clusters rather than geographic clusters, indicating a single global population rather
than geographically-isolated populations of virus. The phylogeny of OC43 bifurcates
immediately from the root (Figure 1), indicating that OC43 consists of multiple, co-evolving
lineages. Because of the distinct evolutionary histories, it is appropriate to conduct phylogenetic
analyses separately for each lineage. We have arbitrarily labeled these lineages ‘A’ and ‘B’
(Figure 1).
Because recombination is common amongst coronaviruses (Pasternak, Spaan, and Snijder
2006; Hon et al. 2008; Lau et al. 2011), we built separate phylogenies for each viral gene. In the
absence of recombination, each tree should show the same evolutionary relationships between
viral isolates. A dramatic difference in a given isolate’s position on one tree versus another is
strongly indicative of recombination (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006). Comparing the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike trees reveals this pattern of recombination in
some isolates (Figure 1- figure supplement 1A). A comparison of the trees of the S1 and S2
sub-domains of spike shows more limited evidence for intragenic recombination (Figure 1-figure
supplement 1B), which is consistent with the fact that the distance between two genetic loci is
inversely-related to the chance that these loci remain linked during a recombination event.
Though intragenic recombination likely does occur occasionally, analyzing genes, rather than
isolates, greatly reduces the contribution of recombination to genetic variation in our analyses.

Figure 1. Phylogenetic trees for spike gene of seasonal HCoVs OC43 and 229E. Phylogenies built from A: OC43
spike sequences from 389 isolates over 53 years, and B: 229E spike sequences from 54 isolates over 31 years.
OC43 bifurcates immediately after the root and is split into two lineages: lineage A (dark teal) and lineage B (light
teal). 229E and contains just one lineage (dark blue). For the analyses in this paper, the evolution of each gene (or
genomic region) is considered separately, so phylogenies are built for each viral gene, and those phylogenies are
used to split isolates into lineages for each gene. These are temporally resolved phylogenies with year shown on the
x-axis. The clock rate estimate is 5 × 10–4 substitutions per nucleotide site per year for OC43 and 6 × 10–4 for 229E.

Thus, in all of our analyses, we use alignments and phylogenies of sequences of single genes
(or genomic regions) rather than whole genome sequences of isolates. We designate the
lineage of those genes (or genomic regions) based on the gene’s phylogeny. Though most
isolates contain all genes from the same lineage, some isolates have, say, a lineage A spike
gene and a lineage B RdRp gene. This strategy allows us to consider the evolution of each
gene separately, and interrogate the selective pressures acting on them.
It is worth noting that the analyses we use here to detect adaptive evolution canonically
presume that selective pressures are acting on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
However, it is possible that recombination also contributes to the genetic variation that is acted
on by immune selection. This would be most likely to occur if two closely-related genomes
recombine, resulting in the introduction of a small amount of genetic diversity without disrupting
crucial functions. Our analyses do not aim to determine the source of genetic variation (i.e.
SNPs or recombination), but rather focus on identifying if and how selection acts on this
variation.
Because of its essential role in viral replication and lack of antibody exposure, we expect RdRp
to be under purifying selection to maintain its structure and function. If HCoVs evolve
antigenically, we expect to see adaptive evolution in spike, and particularly in the S1 domain of
spike (Hofmann et al. 2006; Hulswit et al. 2019), due to its exposed location at the virion’s
surface and interaction with the host receptor. Mutations that escape from population immunity
are beneficial to the virus and so are driven to fixation by positive selection. This results in
adaptive evolution of the virus population.

Phylogenetic inference of substitution prevalence within spike
Using phylogenies constructed from the spike gene, we tallied the number of independent
amino acid substitutions at each position within spike. The average number of substitutions per
site is higher in S1 than S2 for HCoV lineages in OC43 and 229E (Figure 2A). We focus on S1
rather than the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) within S1 in our analyses, because it is known
that neutralizing antibodies bind to epitopes within the N-Terminal Domain (NTD) as well as the
RBD of S1 (L. Liu et al. 2020; S. Zhang et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2019). A greater occurrence of
repeated substitutions is expected if some mutations within S1 confer immune avoidance.
Alternatively, these repeated substitutions could be a result of high mutation rate and random
genetic drift as has been shown at particular types of sites in SARS-CoV-2 (van Dorp et al.
2020). However, this latter hypothesis should affect all regions of the genome equally and
should not result in a greater number of repeated substitutions in S1 than S2.

Figure 2. More sites mutate repeatedly within spike S1 versus S2. A: Number of substitutions observed at each
amino acid position in the spike gene throughout the phylogeny. S1 (gray) and S2 (white) are indicated by shading
and the number of substitutions per site is indicated by a dot and color-coded by HCoV lineage. The putative
receptor-binding domains for 229E (Z. Li et al. 2019) and the putative domain for OC43 (Lau et al. 2011) are
indicated with light yellow bars. Asterisks indicate two example positions (192 and 262), which mutate repeatedly
throughout the OC43 lineage A phylogeny. The OC43 phylogeny built from spike sequences and color-coded by
genotype at position 192 and 262 is shown in B) and C), respectively.

If the repeated mutations are a product of immune selection, not only should S1 contain more
repeated mutations, but we would also expect these mutations to spread widely after they occur
due to their selective advantage. Additionally, we expect sites within S1 to experience
diversifying selection due to the ongoing arms race between virus and host immune system.
This is visible in the distribution of genotypes at the most repeatedly-mutated sites in OC43
lineage A (Figure 2B and 2C).

Nonsynonymous and synonymous divergence in RdRp and subdomains of spike
An adaptively evolving gene, or region of the genome, should exhibit a high rate of
nonsynonymous substitutions. For each seasonal HCoV lineage, we calculated nonsynonymous
and synonymous divergence as the average Hamming distance from that lineage’s most recent
common ancestor (Zanini et al. 2015). The rate of nonsynonymous divergence is markedly
higher within spike versus RdRp of 229E and OC43 lineage A (Figure 3A). While
nonsynonymous divergence increases steadily over time in spike, it remains roughly constant at
0.0 in RdRp. These results suggest that there is predominantly positive selection on OC43 and
229E spike, but predominantly purifying selection on RdRp. Separating spike into the S1
(receptor-binding) and S2 (membrane-fusion) domains reveals that the majority of
nonsynonymous divergence in spike occurs within S1 (Figure 3B). In fact, the rates of
nonsynonymous divergence in S2 are similar to those seen in RdRp, suggesting S2 evolves
under purifying selection while S1 evolves adaptively.

Figure 3. Nonsynonymous divergence is higher in OC43 and 229E Spike S1 versus S2 or RdRp. A:
Nonsynonymous (dashed lines) and synonymous divergence (solid lines) of the spike (dark orange) and RdRp (dark
gray) genes of all 229E and OC43 lineages over time. Divergence is the average Hamming distance from the
ancestral sequence, computed in sliding 3-year windows which contain at least 2 sequenced isolates. Shaded region
shows 95% confidence intervals. Note that the absence of a line means there fewer than 2 sequences available at
this timepoint and that, therefore, the divergence is not calculated. B: Nonsynonymous and synonymous divergence
within the S1 (light orange) and S2 (light gray) domains of spike. Year is shown on the x-axis and is shared between
plots.

Though we would expect synonymous divergence to be equivalent in all areas of the genome,
this is not born out in our results. It is unclear whether the difference in synonymous divergence
between genes reflects an actual biological difference. However, the ratio of nonsynonymous
divergence in spike to nonsynonymous divergence in RdRp is consistently higher than the
equivalent ratio of synonymous divergence (Figure 3- figure supplement 2). Thus, despite
differences in synonymous divergence, spike is accumulating more relatively more
nonsynonymous divergence than RdRp.

We compared our analysis of divergence to the results a more standard approach for detecting
positive selection on certain branches of a phylogeny. This approach, called MEME, is
maximum-likelihood method which gives a single dN/dS value for each gene (Murrell et al.
2012; Weaver et al. 2018). In agreement with measures of nonsynonymous divergence over
time, dN/dS estimates are higher in Spike than RdRp and higher in S1 than S2 (Table 2). Our
estimate of dN/dS in OC43 spike is similar to the previously reported estimate of roughly 0.3
(Ren et al. 2015). However, we believe the standard dN/dS approach is not the ideal tool for
detecting adaptive evolution in HCoVs because it is a phylogenetic approach, which may be
biased by recombination, and also because some assumptions of the model hold true for
mammalian genomes, but not necessarily for RNA viruses.

Rate of Adaptation in RdRp and subdomains of spike
Therefore, as a complement to the divergence analysis, we implemented an alternative to the
dN/dS method that was specifically designed to detect positive selection within RNA virus
populations (Bhatt, Holmes, and Pybus 2011). Compared with traditional dN/dS methods, the
Bhatt method has the advantages of: 1) measuring the strength of positive selection within a
population given sequences collected over time, 2) higher sensitivity to identifying mutations
that occur only once and sweep through the population, and 3) correcting for deleterious
mutations (Bhatt, Katzourakis, and Pybus 2010; Bhatt, Holmes, and Pybus 2011). Briefly, this
method defines a class of neutrally-evolving nucleotide sites as those with synonymous
mutations or where nonsynonymous polymorphisms occur at medium frequency. Then, the
number of fixed and high-frequency nonsynonymous sites that exceed the neutral expectation
are calculated. This method compares nucleotide sequences at each timepoint (the ingroup) to
the consensus nucleotide sequence at the first time point (the outgroup) and yields an estimate
of the number of adaptive substitutions within a given genomic region at each of these
timepoints.
We adapted this method to detect adaptive substitutions in seasonal HCoVs. As shown in
Figure 4, OC43 lineage A has continuously amassed adaptive substitutions in spike over the
past >30 years while RdRp has accrued few, if any, adaptive substitutions. These adaptive
substitutions are located within the S1, and not the S2, domain of spike (Figure 4). We observe
a largely linear accumulation of adaptive substitutions in spike and S1 through time, although
the method does not dictate a linear increase. This observation suggests that spike (and S1 in
particular) is evolving in response to a continuous selective pressure. This is exactly what would

be expected if these adaptive substitutions are evidence of antigenic evolution resulting from an
evolutionary arms race between spike and the host immune system.

Figure 4. Adaptive substitutions accumulate over time in OC43 lineage A spike S1. Adaptive substitutions per
codon within OC43 lineage A spike, S1, S2 and RdRp as calculated by our implementation of the Bhatt method.
Adaptive substitutions are computed in sliding 3-year windows, and only for timepoints that contain 3 or more
sequenced isolates. Red dots display estimated values calculated from the empirical data and red lines show linear
regression fit to these points. Grey lines show the distribution of regressions fit to the computed number of adaptive
substitutions from 100 bootstrapped datasets. Year is shown on the x-axis.

We estimate that OC43 lineage A accumulates roughly 0.61 × 10–3 adaptive substitutions per
codon per year (or 0.45 adaptive amino acid substitutions in S1 each year) in the S1 domain of
spike, while the rate of adaptation in OC43 lineage B is slightly higher and is estimated to result
in an average 0.56 adaptive substitutions in S1 per year (Figure 5). The S1 domain of 229E is
estimated to accrue 0.26 adaptive substitutions per year (a rate of 0.47 × 10–3 adaptive
substitutions per codon per year).
A benefit of the Bhatt method is the ability to calculate the strength of selection, which allows us
to compare these seasonal HCoVs to other viruses. We used our implementation of the Bhatt
method to calculate the rate of adaptation for influenza A/H3N2, which is known to undergo
rapid antigenic evolution (Rambaut et al. 2008; Yang 2000), measles, which does not (Fulton et
al. 2015a), and influenza B strains Vic and Yam, which evolve antigenically at a slower rate than
A/H3N2 (Bedford et al. 2014). We estimate that the receptor-binding domain of influenza
A/H3N2 accumulates adaptive substitutions between 2 and 3 times faster than the HCoVs
OC43 and 229E (Figure 6). The rate of adaptive substitution in influenza B/Yam and B/Vic are
on par with the seasonal HCoVs. We detect no adaptive substitutions in the measles receptorbinding protein. These results put the evolution of the S1 domain of OC43 and 229E in context,
indicating that the S1 domain is under positive selection, and that this positive selection
generates new variants in the putative antigenic regions of these HCoVs at about the same rate
as influenza B strains and about half the rate of the canonical example of antigenic evolution,
the HA1 domain of influenza A/H3N2.

Validation that rate of adaptation is not biased by recombination
Because coronaviruses are known to recombine, and recombination has the potential to impact
evolutionary analyses of selection, we sought to verify that our results are not swayed by the
presence of recombination. To do this, we simulated the evolution of OC43 lineage A spike and
RdRp genes under varying levels of recombination and positive selection (representative
phylogenies of simulated spike evolution can be seen in Figure 7- figure supplement 2) and
used our implementation of the Bhatt method to identify adaptive evolution. As the strength of
positive selection increases, we detect a higher rate of adaptive evolution, regardless of the
level of recombination (Figure 7). This demonstrates that our estimates of adaptive evolution are
not biased by recombination events.

Figure 7. Detection of positive selection is not biased by recombination. OC43 lineage A sequences were
simulated with varying levels of recombination and positive selection. The Bhatt method was used to calculate the
rate of adaptive substitutions per codon per year for S1 (light orange), S2 (light gray) and RdRp (dark gray). The
mean and 95% confidence interval of 10 independent simulations is plotted.

Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) of RdRp and subdomains of spike
Finally, we know that strong directional selection skews the shape of phylogenies (Volz, Koelle,
and Bedford 2013). In influenza H3N2, immune selection causes the genealogy to adopt a
ladder-like shape where the rungs are formed by viral diversification and each step is created by
the appearance of new, antigenically-superior variants that replace previous variants. This
ladder-like shape can also be seen in the phylogenies of the OC43 and 229E (Figure 1). In this
case, selection can be quantified by the timescale of population turnover as measured by the
Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA), with the expectation that stronger selection

will result in more frequent steps and therefore a smaller TMRCA measure (Bedford, Cobey,
and Pascual 2011). We computed average TMRCA values from phylogenies built on Spike, S1,
S2 or RdRp sequences of OC43 lineage A and 229E (Table 2). We did not compute TMRCA for
OC43 lineage B because the limited number of available RdRp sequences for this lineage mean
that TMRCA can only be calculated for about 4 years, which could artificially skew the TMRCA
estimates. Our estimates of HCoV spike TMRCA are roughly 2-2.5 longer the estimated
TMRCA for influenza A/H3N2 hemagglutinin (Bedford, Cobey, and Pascual 2011).
We observe that, for both OC43 lineage A and 229E, the average TMRCA is lower in spike than
RdRp and lower in S1 versus S2. These results suggest strong directional selection in S1, likely
driven by pressures to evade the humoral immune system. The difference in TMRCA between
S1 and S2 is indicative not only of differing selective pressures acting on these two spike
domains, but also of intra-spike recombination. This is because the immune selection imposed
on S1, should also propagate neutral hitch-hiker mutations in closely-linked regions such as S2.
The difference in TMRCA suggests that recombination may uncouple these regions.
Recombination can also push TMRCA to higher values, though this should not have a larger
impact on RdRp than S1. The contributions of the forces of directional selection and
recombination are difficult to parse from the TMRCA results. This emphasizes the importance of
using methods, such as the Bhatt method, that are robust to recombination to detect adaptive
evolution.

Application of methods for identifying adaptive evolution to HKU1 and NL63
Because HKU1 was identified in the early 2000’s, there are fewer longitudinally-sequenced
isolates available for this HCoV compared to 229E and OC43 (Figure 1- figure supplement 2).
Consequently, the phylogenetic reconstructions and divergence analysis of HKU1 have a higher
level of uncertainty. To begin with, it is less clear from the phylogenies whether HKU1
represents a single HCoV lineage like 229E or, instead, should be split into multiple lineages
like OC43 (Figure 1). Because of this, we completed all antigenic analyses for HKU1 twice:
once considering all isolates to be members of a single lineage, and again after splitting isolates
into 2 separate lineages. These lineages are arbitrarily labeled ‘A’ and ‘B’ as was done for
OC43. When HKU1 is considered to consist of just one lineage, there is no signal of antigenic
evolution by divergence analysis (Figure 3- figure supplement 1B) or by the Bhatt method of
estimating adaptive evolution (Figure 5- figure supplement 1A). However, when HKU1 is
assumed to consist of 2 co-circulating lineages, HKU1 lineage A has a markedly higher rate of
adaptive substitutions in S1 than in S2 or RdRp (Figure 5- figure supplement 1B).

To demonstrate the importance of having a well-sampled longitudinal series of sequenced
isolates for our antigenic analyses, we returned to our simulated OC43 S1 datasets. We
mimicked shorter longitudinal series by truncating the dataset to only 24, 14, 10, or 7 years of
samples and ran the Bhatt analysis on these sequentially shorter time series (Figure 7- figure
supplement 1). The rates of adaptation estimated from the truncated datasets can be compared
to the “true” rate of adaptation calculated from all simulated data. This simulated data reveals a
general trend that less longitudinal data reduces the ability to detect adaptive evolution by
skewing the estimated rate away from the “truth” and increasing the uncertainty of the analysis.
Given the dearth of longitudinal data for HKU1, we do not feel that it is appropriate to make
strong conclusions about adaptive evolution, or lack thereof, in this HCoV.
Despite being identified at roughly the same time as HKU1, substantially more NL63 isolates
have been sequenced (Figure 1- figure supplement 2) making the phylogenetic reconstruction
and evolutionary analyses of this virus correspondingly more reliable. We do not observe
evidence for adaptive evolution in NL63 (Figure 3- figure supplement 1A and Figure 5- figure
supplement 1A) and this lack of support for adaptive evolution in the NL63 spike gene is more
likely to reflect an actual lack of adaptive evolution in this virus.

Discussion
Using several corroborating methods, we provide evidence that the seasonal HCoVs OC43 and
229E undergo adaptive evolution in S1, the region of the spike protein exposed to human
humoral immunity (Figures 3, 4 and 5). We additionally confirm that RdRp and S2 do not show
signals of adaptive evolution. We observe that S1 accumulates between 0.3 (229E) and 0.5
(OC43) adaptive substitutions per year. We infer that these viruses accumulate adaptive
substitutions at roughly half the rate of influenza A/H3N2 and at a similar rate to influenza B
viruses (Figure 6). The most parsimonious explanation for the observation of substantial
adaptive evolution in S1 is that antigenic drift is occurring in which mutations that escape from
human population immunity are selectively favored in the viral population leading to repeated
adaptive changes. However, it is formally possible that the adaptive evolution we detect is a
result of selective pressures other than evasion of the adaptive immune system. Showing that
this is truly antigenic evolution could involve a serological comparison of isolates that differ at S1
residues under positive selection.
In seasonal influenza and measles, the rates of adaptive evolution we estimate correlate well
with relative rates of antigenic drift reported by other groups (Fulton et al. 2015b; Bedford et al.
2014). The relative rates of adaptation we calculate also match the relative frequency of vaccine
strain updates, as would be expected since vaccines must be updated to match antigenicallyevolving viruses. Since 2006, the A/H3N2 component of the seasonal influenza vaccine has
been updated 10 times (11 different A/H3N2 strains), 4 different B/Vic strains and 4 different
B/Yam strains have been included in the vaccine, and the measles vaccine strain has not
changed (Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System
(GISRS), https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/en/). Using these numbers as guidance,

our results suggest that a vaccine against OC43 or 229E might need to be updated as
frequently as the B/Vic and B/Yam components of the influenza vaccine are.
We do not observe evidence of antigenic evolution in NL63 (Figure 3-figure supplement 1 and
Figure 5- figure supplement 1). This likely represents a lack of marked adaptive evolution in S1.
Our finding fits with a study of NL63 in Kenya, which identified multiple genotypes of NL63 and
show that people regularly become reinfected with the same genotype of NL63 (Kiyuka et al.
2018). Additionally, Kiyuka et al found that these genotypes circulate locally for a long period of
time, suggesting a decent amount of viral diversity and a potential lack of evolution due to
immune selection. Though our results cannot explain why OC43 and 229E likely evolve
antigenically while NL63 does not, Kiyuka et al observe that NL63 reinfections are sometimes
enhanced by a previous infection and hypothesize that NL63 is actually under purifying
selection at epitope sites (Kiyuka et al. 2018).
Though analysis of all HCoVs would benefit from more sequenced isolates, there is
substantially less longitudinal sequencing data available for HKU1. Thus, despite finding no
evidence of antigenic evolution in HKU1 (Figure 3-figure supplement 1 and Figure 5- figure
supplement 1), it is possible that a more completely sampled time series of HKU1 genome
sequences could alter the result for this virus (Figure 7-figure supplement 1).
Our conclusions of adaptive evolution in S1, arrived at through computational analyses of
sequencing data, agree with studies that observe reinfection of subjects by heterologous
isolates of 229E (Reed 1984), sequential dominance of specific genotypes of OC43 (Lau et al.
2011; Y. Zhang et al. 2015), and common reinfection by seasonal HCoVs from longitudinal
serological data (Edridge et al. 2020). In this latter study, HCoV infections were identified from
longitudinal serum samples by assaying for increases in antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N)
protein of representative OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63 viruses. This study concluded that the
average time between infections was 1.5–2.5 years, depending on the HCoV (Edridge et al.
2020). In comparison, influenza H3N2 reinfects people roughly every 5 years (Kucharski et al.
2015). Thus, frequent reinfection by seasonal HCoVs is likely due to a combination of factors
and suggests waning immune memory, and/or incomplete immunity against reinfection, in
addition to antigenic drift.
Human coronaviruses are a diverse grouping split, phylogenetically, into two genera: NL63 and
229E are alphacoronaviruses, while OC43, HKU1, MERS, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 are
betacoronaviruses. The method of cell-entry does not seem to correlate with genus.
Coronaviruses bind to a remarkable range of host-cell receptors including peptidases, cell
adhesion molecules and sugars. Amongst the seasonal HCoVs, OC43 and HKU1 both bind 9O-acetylsialic acid (Hulswit et al. 2019), while 229E binds human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) and
NL63 binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (D. X. Liu, Liang, and Fung 2020).
Despite a relatively large phylogenetic distance and divergent S1 structures, NL63 and SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 bind to the same host receptor using the same virus-binding motifs
(VBMs) (F. Li 2016). This VBM is located in the C-terminal domain of S1 (S1-CTD), which fits
within the trend of S1-CTD receptor-binding in CoVs that bind protein receptors (Hofmann et al.

2006; F. Li 2016). This is opposed to the trend amongst CoVs that bind sugar receptors, where
receptor-binding is located within the S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) (F. Li 2016). This
localization roughly aligns with our observations that the majority of the repeatedly-mutated sites
occur toward the C-terminal end of 229E S1 and the N-terminal end of OC43 S1 (Figure 2).
Here, we have provided support that at least 2 of the 4 seasonal HCoVs evolve adaptively in the
region of spike that is known to interact with the humoral immune system. These two viruses
span both genera of HCoVs, though due to the complexity of HCoV receptor-binding and
pathology mentioned above, it is not clear whether or not this suggests that other HCoVs, such
as SARS-CoV-2, will also evolve adaptively in S1. This is important because, at the time of
writing of this manuscript, many SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in production and most of these
exclusively include spike (Krammer 2020). If SARS-CoV-2 evolves adaptively in S1 as the
closely-related HCoV OC43 does, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would need to be
frequently reformulated to match the circulating strains, as is done for seasonal influenza
vaccines.

Materials and methods
All data, source code and analyses can be found at https://github.com/blab/seasonal-covadaptive-evolution. All phylogenetic trees constructed and analyzed in this manuscript can be
viewed interactively at https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/seasonal-cov-adaptive-evolution.
All analysis code is written in Python 3 (Python Programming Language, SCR_008394) in
Jupyter notebooks (Jupyter-console, RRID:SRC_018414).
Sequence data
All viral sequences are publicly accessible and were downloaded from ViPR (www.viprbrc.org)
under the “Coronavirdiae” with host “human” (Pickett et al. 2012). Sequences labeled as
“OC43”, “229E”, “HKU1” and “NL63” were pulled out of the downloaded FASTA file into 4
separate data files. Additionally, a phylogeny of all downloaded human coronaviruses was made
and unlabeled isolates that clustered within clades formed by labeled OC43, 229E, HKU1 or
NL63 isolates were marked as belonging to that HCoV type and added to our data files. Code
for these data-parsing steps is located in datawrangling/postdownload_formatting_for_rerun.ipynb.
Phylogenetic inference
For each of the 4 HCoV datasets, full-length sequences were aligned to a reference genome
using the augur align command (Hadfield et al. 2018) and MAFFT (Katoh et al. 2002). Individual
gene sequences were then extracted from these alignments if sequencing covered 50% or more
of the gene using the code in datawrangling/postdownload_formatting_for_rerun.ipynb. Sequence files for each
gene are located in the data/ directory within each HCoV parent directory (ex:
oc43/data/oc43_spike.fasta). A Snakemake file (Köster and Rahmann 2012) within each
HCoV directory follows the general outline of a Nextstrain build (Nextstrain, RRID:SCR_018223)
and was used to align each gene to a reference strain and build a time-resolved phylogeny with
IQ-Tree v1 (Nguyen et al. 2015) and TimeTree (Sagulenko, Puller, and Neher 2018).

Phylogenies were viewed to identify the distribution of genotypes throughout the tree, different
lineages, and signals of recombination using the nextstrain view command (Hadfield et al.
2018). The clock rate of the phylogeny based on spike sequences for each isolate (as shown in
Fig. 1 and Fig. 1 Supplement 2) was 0.0005 substitutions per nucleotide site per year for OC43,
0.0006 for 229E, 0.0007 for NL63, and 0.0062 for HKU1. All NL63 and HKU1 trees were rooted
on an outgroup sequence. For NL63, the outgroup was
229e/AF304460/229e_ref/Germany/2000 and for HKU1 the outgroup was
mhv/NC_048217_1/mhv/2006. Clock rates for the phylogenies built on each individual gene can
be found within the results/ directory within each HCoV parent directory (ex:
oc43/results/branch_lengths_oc43_spike.json).
Mutation counting
Amino acid substitutions at each position in spike were tallied from the phylogeny. In other
words, the phylogenetic reconstruction of spike sequences returns nucleotides changes to the
ancestral sequence along each branch. The number of times this changed amino acid identity at
each position was tallied. This analysis was conducted using code in
antigenic_evolution/site_mutation_rank.ipynb.
Divergence analysis
For each HCoV lineage and each gene, synonymous and nonsynonymous divergence was
calculated at all timepoints as the average Hamming distance between each sequenced isolate
and the consensus sequence at the first timepoint (founder sequence). The total number of
observed differences between the isolate and founder nucleotide sequences that result in
nonsynonymous (or synonymous) substitutions is divided by the number of possible nucleotide
mutations that result in nonsynonymous (or synonymous) substitutions, weighted by kappa, to
yield an estimate of divergence. Kappa is the ratio of rates of transitions:transversions, and was
calculated by averaging values from spike and RdRp trees built by BEAST 2.6.3 (Bouckaert et
al. 2019) using the HKY+gamma4 model with 2 partitions and “coalescent constant population”.
All BEAST results are found in .log files in gene- and HCoV-specific subdirectories within
beast/ . Divergence is calculated from nucleotide alignments. Sliding 3-year windows were
used and only timepoints that contained at least 2 sequences were considered. The concept for
this analysis is from (Zanini et al. 2015) and code for our adaptation is in
antigenic_evolution/divergence_weighted.ipynb. The ratios of divergence shown in
Figure 3- figure supplement 2 are also calculated in this notebook.
Calculation of dN/dS
A dN/dS value was calculated for RdRp, spike, S1 and S2 of each HCoV using the Datamonkey
(Weaver et al. 2018) implementation of MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution) (Murrell et al.
2012). Aligned FASTA files (ex: oc43/results/aligned_oc43_rdrp.fasta) were
uploaded to Datamonkey (http://datamonkey.org/meme) and dN/dS value was recorded as the
calculated Global MG94xREV model non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio.

Implementation of the Bhatt method
The rate of adaptive evolution was computed using an adaptation of the Bhatt method (Bhatt,
Holmes, and Pybus 2011; Bhatt, Katzourakis, and Pybus 2010). For each lineage and each
genomic region, we partitioned all available sequences into sliding 3-year windows and only
used timepoints that contained at least 3 sequences in the analysis. We compared nucleotide
sequences at each timepoint (the ingroup) to the consensus nucleotide sequence at the first
time point (the outgroup). Eight estimators (silent fixed, replacement fixed, silent high frequency,
replacement high frequency, silent mid-frequency, replacement mid-frequency, silent low
frequency and replacement low-frequency) are calculated by the site-counting method (Bhatt,
Katzourakis, and Pybus 2010). In the site-counting method, each estimator is the product of the
fixation or polymorphism score times the silent or replacement score, summed for each site in
that frequency class. Fixation and polymorphism scores depend on the number of different
nucleotides observed at the site and whether the outgroup base is present in the ingroup.
Selectively neutral sites are assumed to contain the classes of silent polymorphisms and
replacement polymorphisms occurring at a frequency between 0.15 and 0.75. A class of
nonneutral, adaptive sites is then identified as having an excess of replacement fixations or
polymorphisms (Bhatt, Holmes, and Pybus 2011). For each lineage and gene, 100 bootstrap
alignments and ancestral sequences were generated and run through the Bhatt method to
assess the statistical uncertainty of our estimates of rates of adaptation (Bhatt, Holmes, and
Pybus 2011). The rate of adaptation (per codon per year) shown in Fig. 5 is calculated by linear
regression of the time series values of adaptive substitutions per codon (Fig. 4). Our code for
implementing the Bhatt method is at
antigenic_evolution/bhatt_bootstrapping.ipynb.
Estimation of rates of adaptation of measles and influenza viruses
Influenza and measles alignments were generated by running Nextstrain the respective
Nextstrain builds from https://github.com/nextstrain/seasonal-flu and
https://github.com/nextstrain/measles (Hadfield et al. 2018). The seasonal influenza build was
run with 20 year resolution for H3N2, H1N1pdm, Vic and Yam. The rates of adaptation of
different genes was calculated using our implementation of the Bhatt method described above.
The receptor-binding domain used for influenza was HA1, for measles was the H protein, and
for the HCoVs was S1. The membrane fusion protein used for influenza was HA2, for measles
was the F protein, and for the HCoVs was S2. The polymerase for influenza was PB1, for
measles was the P protein, and for the HCoVs was RbRd (nsp12). Our code for this analysis is
at antigenic_evolution/bhatt_nextstrain.ipynb.
Simulation of evolving OC43 sequences
The evolution of OC43 lineage A Spike and RdRp genes was simulated using SANTA-SIM
(Jariani et al. 2019). The OC43 lineage A root sequence was used as a starting point and the
simulation was run for 500 generations and 10 simulated sequences were sampled every 50
generations. The spike and RdRp genes were simulated separately. Purifying selection was
simulated across both genes. Evolution was simulated in the absence of recombination and with
moderate and high levels of recombination during replication. Under each of these
recombination paradigms, we simulated evolution in the absence of positive selection within

spike and with moderate and high levels of positive selection. Positive selection was simulated
through exposure-dependent selection at a subset of spike S1 sites proportional to the number
of epitope sites in H3N2 HA (Luksza and Lässig 2014). The simulated selection allows
mutations in these “epitope” sites to rise in frequency while also encouraging “epitopes” to
change over time (to mimic antigenic novelty). All simulations were run with a nucleotide
mutation rate of 1x10-4 (Vijgen et al. 2005). Config files, results and source code for these
simulations can be at santa-sim_oc43a/ and the Bhatt method is implemented on the
simulated data in antigenic_evolution/bhatt_simulated_oc43_data.ipynb.
Estimation of TMRCA
Mean TMRCA values were estimated for each gene and each HCoV using PACT (Bedford,
Cobey, and Pascual 2011). Briefly, PACT computes TMRCA values by creating a series of
subtrees that include only tips positioned within a temporal slice of the full tree and finding the
common ancestor of these tips. The overall mean and 95% confidence interval were calculated
from the list of TMRCA values in these time slices. The PACT config files and results for each
run are in the directory antigenic_evolution/pact/. The TMRCA estimations and
subsequent analyses are executed by code in antigenic_evolution/tmrca_pact.ipynb.
