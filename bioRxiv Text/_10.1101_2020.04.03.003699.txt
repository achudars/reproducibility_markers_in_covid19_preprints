ABSTRACT

23

Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin that have gained

24

worldwide distribution. OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All

25

three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE

26

acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity

27

towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to

28

humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced

29

evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site

30

mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations

31

selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation

32

of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site

33

substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to

34

optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor

35

usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among

36

CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental

37

to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human

38

and animal pathogens.

INTRODUCTION

40

The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae comprises a group of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses of

41

clinical and veterinary significance. Adding to the socio-economic impact of coronaviruses (CoVs)

42

already extant in humans and livestock, the emergence of ’new’ CoVs through cross species

43

transmission poses an ever-looming threat to public health, animal health, and food production.

44

Seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans, but not all of them have become established. The

45

introduction of SARS CoV in 2002 from horseshoe bats with masked palm civets as incidental transient

46

hosts, was rapidly contained through quarantine measures1. MERS CoV, natural to dromedary camels,

47

causes a classical zoonotic infection with limited human-to-human spread2. December 2019, a

48

member of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), called

49

SARS-CoV-2 and 79.5% identical to the 2002 SARS CoV variant, emerged in Wuhan, China3,4 to progress

50

to full scale pandemicity. Chances are, SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become established in the human

51

population.

52

Four other respiratory coronaviruses of zoonotic origin already did succeed in becoming true human

53

viruses with world-wide distribution5–7. Among them are HKU1 and OC43 (subgenus Embecovirus,

54

genus Betacoronavirus), related yet distinct viruses that arose from different zoonotic progenitors and

55

entered the human population independently. OC43 is far more related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV),

56

its presumptive ancestor, with early isolates sharing 97% genome identity8,9. Together with viruses of

57

swine, canines, equines and lagomorphs, OC43 and BCoV are considered host range variants of the

58

virus species Betacoronavirus-1 (collectively referred to as β1CoVs throughout)7. OC43 apparently

59

emerged 70 to 130 years ago from a single cross species transmission event that gave rise to a human-

60

only virus8–10. Like OC43, other β1CoVs also exhibit host specificity8,11. While these observations attest

61

to the host promiscuity and zoonotic potential of embecoviruses and β1CoVs in particular, they are

62

also indicative for the existence of host barriers, the breaching of which selects for adaptive mutations

63

that result in host specialization and, ultimately, virus speciation. Conceivably, comparative studies of

3

64

BCoV and OC43 may identify factors that promote or restrict cross species transmission of CoVs and

65

thus further our understanding of the requirements for colonization of the human host.

66

Embecoviruses, OC43 and BCoV included, differ from other CoVs in that they encode two types of

67

surface projections. Homotrimeric ‘peplomers’ comprised of spike protein S and extending 20 nm

68

from the viral membrane, mediate virion attachment to entry receptors and membrane fusion12.

69

Interspersed are stubby 8-nm homodimeric projections comprised of the hemagglutinin-esterase

70

(HE)13–15, a dual function protein typically encompassing a receptor-binding lectin domain specific for

71

O-acetylated sialic acid (O-Ac-Sia) and a receptor destroying sialate-O-acetylesterase domain16–20. The

72

HE lectin domain contributes to virion attachment, but at the same time enhances sialate-O-

73

acetylesterase activity towards clustered sialoglycotopes11.

74

Some embecoviruses, like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and related CoVs in rodents, attach to 4- or 9-

75

O-acetylated sialosides (4- or 9-O-Ac-Sias) via HE21–25 and to a proteinaceous entry receptor via S26,27.

76

Others, animal β1CoVs included, bind to 9-O-Ac-Sias via HE28 but, remarkably, also via S29,30 or, in the

77

case of human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, even exclusively via S11,31,32.

78

Structure function analyses of HE and S proteins have yielded a wealth of data on ligand binding,

79

substrate selection and protein-glycan interactions. The receptor binding sites (RBSs) of CoV HE lectin

80

domains and those in related proteins of toro- and influenza C/D viruses 22,33–35 differ in sequence and

81

structure yet conform to a common architectural design with a deep hydrophobic pocket (‘P1’) to

82

accommodate the crucial sialate-O-acetyl moiety, and an adjacent pocket or depression (‘P2’) to

83

accept the 5-N-acyl group17,21,22,33. Characteristically, P1 and P2 are separated by an aromatic side

84

chain and binding of the ligand is stabilized further through electrostatic protein-glycan interactions

85

typically involving distinctive Sia functions such as the Sia glycerol side chain, the 5-N-Acyl and/or the

86

Sia carboxylate. The RBS for 9-O-Ac-Sia in the S proteins of BCoV and OC43, identified by comparative

87

structural analysis32 and confirmed by the cryo-EM holostructure of OC43 S36, conforms to this

88

blueprint. Moreover, this site is structurally and functionally conserved in HKU132.

89

Much less is known about the functional relationship between S and HE, and the role of HE in particular

90

remains poorly understood. In MHV, HE expression is dispensable for replication and rapidly lost

91

during cell culture propagation15. Conversely, in β1CoVs, HE seems critical for infection. In OC43, loss

92

of HE-associated acetyl esterase activity abrogates the production of infectious virus and virus

93

dissemination in cell culture37. Moreover, acetyl-esterase inhibitors impede BCoV replication19, and

94

antibodies against HE neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo38–40. Still, even among β1CoVs there are

95

differences in HE function apparently correlating with host specificity. Whereas HE lectin activity is

96

strictly maintained in BCoV28, OC43 lost this function through progressive accumulation of mutations

97

in the HE RBS, apparently as an adaptation to replication in the human respiratory tract11.

98

Nevertheless, isolates of either virus propagate in cultured cells. To better understand the

99

consequences of loss of HE lectin function as it occurred during OC43 and also HKU1 evolution, we

100

took a reverse genetics/forced evolution approach with BCoV as a model. The findings reveal that HE

101

and S are functionally interdependent and that the acquisition of HE by a proto-embecovirus allowed

102

its β1CoV descendants to adopt strategies for reversible virion-sialoglycan attachment, remarkably

103

similar to those of influenza A viruses.

RESULTS

105

Disruption of HE lectin function selects for mutations in S. To study the role and importance of HE in

106

β1CoV propagation, we developed a reverse genetics system for BCoV strain Mebus (sFig. 1A) based

107

on targeted RNA recombination41,42. Recombinant ‘wildtype’ BCoVs (rBCoV) with parental type HE and

108

S, but with accessory ORF4a replaced by the Renilla luciferase gene (rBCoV-Rluc), were readily

109

generated upon seeding acceptor-virus-infected, donor RNA-transfected mouse LR7 cells onto

110

monolayers of feeder HRT18 cells. rBCoV-Rluc arose and within seven days grew to final titers

111

routinely obtained for wildtype BCoV (~108 TCID50/ml).

112

Generating BCoV-Rluc derivatives defective in HE lectin function proved more cumbersome. To

113

abolish the HE RBS, we substituted Phe211, which is key to ligand binding17(sFig. 1B), by Ala via two

114

nucleotide substitutions to block reversion. Mutant viruses were recovered eventually, but, in 3 out

115

of 4 successful trials, a multistep 160-hr rescue did not suffice and an additional 72-96 hr blind passage

116

was required (Fig. 1A).

117

Sequence analysis of clonal virus populations, obtained by endpoint dilution, confirmed the presence

118

of the HE Phe211Ala substitution in all cases. Surprisingly, the purified viruses all suffered single site

119

mutations in S, clustering in domain S1A (aa 15-302) in proximity of the RBS (Figs. 1A-C; sFig. 2). Two

120

of the trials yielded multiple S variants and some variants -Thr83Ile and Leu89Pro- emerged

121

independently in separate experiments (Fig. 1A). The mutations map to three distinct S RBS elements

122

(Fig. 1C, sFig. 2C; nomenclature according to32). Ile26Ser and Asn27Ser locate in the S1A β1 element

123

within the N-terminal L1-β1-L2 segment (aa 15-33) that walls pocket P1; P1 is crucial for ligand binding

124

as it accommodates the all-important sialate-9-O-acetyl moiety32,36. Moreover, in the OC43 S cryo-EM

125

holostructure, the Asn27 side chain hydrogen bonds with the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl36. Leu89Pro in S1A

126

element 3101 is immediately adjacent to Trp90. The latter is arguably the most critical residue in the

127

RBS as its indole side chain separates the P1 and P2 pockets, and its replacement precludes receptor-

128

binding and virus infectivity32. Finally, Gly82Glu and Thr83Ile substitutions occurred in S1A element β5

129

that interacts with the sialate carboxylate through hydrogen bonding with Lys81 and Thr83.

130

As measured by solid phase lectin binding assay (sp-LBA) with S1A-Fc fusion proteins and bovine

131

submaxillary mucin (BSM) as ligand, all mutations significantly reduced S binding to 9-O-Ac-Sia albeit

132

to widely different extents. S1A-Fc binding affinities of the mutants were 500-fold (Asn27Ser) to more

133

than 10.000-fold (Ile26Ser; Gly82Glu) lower than that of parental BCoV S1A-Fc (Fig. 1D).

134

Loss of the HE lectin RBS would both abolish HE-assisted virion attachment to 9-O-Ac-Sia receptor

135

determinants as well as reduce virion-associated receptor-destroying sialate-O-acetylesterase activity

136

towards clustered glycotopes11. The findings suggest that the HE-Phe211Ala substitution creates a

137

fitness defect that can be alleviated not by increasing but by dramatically reducing the affinity of the

138

S RBS. Thus, the defect apparently is caused by loss of virion-associated RDE activity rather than by

139

loss of overall virion avidity.

140

Loss of HE lectin function exerts a fitness cost by affecting reversible virion attachment. In principle,

141

downregulation of HE esterase activity consequential to loss of lectin function, could affect virus

142

propagation at two stages of the infectious cycle, namely virus release, which would require depletion

143

of intracellular and cell surface receptor pools, and (pre)attachment. We recently reported that G-

144

deficient vesicular stomatitis (VSV) virions pseudotyped with wildtype BCoV S require exogenous HE

145

for efficient infection32. S1A mutations that reduce S affinity inhibit infection, but, as we now show,

146

only when HE is present. VSV virions pseudotyped with low affinity mutant S proteins were less reliant

147

on or even inhibited by exogenous HE with decreasing S RBS affinity (Fig. 1E). The findings provide

148

direct proof that the S1A mutations act at the level of virion attachment and support the notion that

149

the S1A mutations, selected for in HE-defective rBCoVs, restore reversibility of receptor binding by

150

lowering S affinity and thereby protect against inadvertent attachment to decoy receptors.

151

HE lectin-deficient recombinant BCoVs are genetically stable when grown in the presence of

152

exogenous receptor-destroying enzyme. To test whether loss of virion-associated RDE activity in

153

rBCoV-HE-F211A/Swt/Rluc might be compensated for by adding exogenous soluble HE to the culture

154

medium, we seeded infected/transfected LR7 cells onto HRT18 cell monolayers, supplemented the

7

155

cell culture supernatant with BCoV HE-Fc17 to final concentrations of 1 pg to 10 μg/ml, and allowed

156

infection to proceed for 120 hr. While in the absence of HE-Fc there was no sign of virus propagation

157

as detectable by IFA, concentrations of exogenous sialate-O-acetylesterase as low as 1 ng/ml to up to

158

1 μg/ml promoted virus growth (Fig. 2A).

159

To determine whether these conditions would allow isolation of rBCoV-HE-F211A without mutations in

160

S1A, we performed targeted recombination and rescued recombinant viruses by 160 hr multistep

161

propagation as before, but now with culture supernatant supplemented with 100 ng/ml HE-Fc (Fig.

162

2B). Sanger sequence analysis of RT-PCR amplicons showed that all viruses cloned by endpoint dilution

163

of the 160-hr stock (n=4) coded for mutant HE-Phe211Ala in combination with wildtype S1A. To assess

164

the stability of clonal rBCoV-HE-F211A/Swt/Rluc, the virus population resulting from a subsequent 120-

165

hr amplification in the presence of exogenous HE-Fc was analyzed by Next-Generation Sequencing

166

(NGS), which allows for the detection of low frequency mutants. Sequence variation in HE and S1A was

167

distributed randomly and did not exceed background levels (<0.15%). More than 99.5% of the viruses

168

coded for HE-Phe211Ala, while preserving parental type S1A (Fig. 2B).

169

Loss of HE lectin function gives rise to mixed virus population with competition and cooperativity

170

among S affinity variants. With a clonal, virtually pure stock of rBCoV-HE-F211A/Swt available, we

171

performed controlled forced evolution experiments. The virus was serially passaged involving three

172

consecutive 120-hr multistep propagation rounds in HRT18 cells but now in the absence of exogenous

173

HE-Fc, with the initial infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005 (Fig. 2C). In trial 1, viral titers

174

in passage 1 (p1) increased only slowly to 3 x 104 and 2 x 104 TCID50/ml (measured with or without

175

exogenous HE-Fc, respectively). The withdrawal of exogenous RDE during viral passage immediately

176

selected for mutations in S1A. Virus cloning by endpoint dilution of the 120-hr p1 sample yielded S RBS

177

mutants Asn27Ser, Thr83Ile and Ile26Ser (Fig. 2C) – all three of which had been seen before (Fig. 1A).

178

NGS analysis revealed the true complexity of the p1 population (Fig. 2C) and identified two additional

179

S1A variants with substitutions -His173Tyr and Arg197Cys- more distal from the RBS (sFigs. 2D, 3A, B).

180

His173Tyr also reduced the relative binding affinity of S1A-Fc albeit less dramatically than the other
8

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.003699; this version posted April 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

181

mutations, namely by 30-fold (Table 1). The Arg197Cys mutation seemingly falls in a separate category

182

as it reduced S1A-Fc expression levels by more than 90% suggestive of defective folding (sFig. 3C).

183

Apparently, aberrant disulfide-bonding causes most of the fusion protein to be retained in the ER with

184

only a minor, presumably properly folded fraction slipping through to become secreted.

185

All in all, the p1 population was comprised for virtually 100% of HE-Phe211Ala mutants, 40% of which

186

in combination with parental BCoV S, the remaining 60% with second-site mutations in S1A (Fig. 2C;

187

Table 1). Of the latter, the ultra-low affinity variant S1A-Ile26Ser was the most abundant at 46% and

188

the Asn27Ser variant the least at less than 1%. However, upon a subsequent round of 120-hr multistep

189

propagation, the tables were turned with S1A-Asn27Ser now comprising almost 40% of the p2

190

population and the Ile26Ser variant reduced to 0.7%. In addition, four other S1A variants emerged. One

191

of these had a mutation in S1A RBS loop L1, Val29Gly, and a relative binding affinity close to that of the

192

Asn27Ser mutant (Fig. 2C; Table 1). We also identified at position 75 a second S1A Cys-substitution

193

mutant, which like Arg197Cys, presumably disrupts the RBS through aberrant disulfide bonding (sFig.

194

3). Remarkably, two other S1A variants arose with mutations -Arg88Thr and Pro174Leu- that affected

195

the relative binding affinity only modestly to 0.25 and 0.5 of that of wildtype S1A-Fc, respectively

196

(Table 1). Even more remarkably, upon further passage these mutants increased to dominate the p3

197

population, effectively outcompeting variants with low affinity spikes as well as those with parental

198

spikes (Fig. 2C, D). However, when the p1, p2 and p3 stocks were cloned by endpoint dilution in the

199

absence of exogenous HE-Fc, only virus variants with low affinity mutations in S1A were isolated (Fig.

200

2C; Table 1). Strikingly, from the p3 stock, the S1A-Asn27Ser variant was isolated exclusively against all

201

odds (10/10 tested; p < 10-6) when calculated purely from its frequency in the population (21%).

202

Conversely, virus cloning by endpoint dilution in the presence of exogenous HE-Fc yielded high affinity

203

S1A mutants Pro174Leu (5/11) and Arg88Thr (4/11), parental virus rBCoV-HE-Phe211Ala/Swt (1/11), and

204

intermediate S affinity variant His173Tyr (1/11).

205

Notably, the conditions selected not only for mutations in S but also in HE. Variants with an Ala211Val

206

substitution in HE emerged in p2, rising to 17% of the p2 end population, to stabilize around this
9

207

frequency in p3. As a result of this mutation, HE lectin affinity was regained albeit to levels solely

208

detectable by high-sensitivity nanobead hemagglutination assay, while esterase activity towards

209

clustered glycotopes in BSM increased 4-fold as compared to HE-Phe211Ala, but still remained 125-fold

210

lower than that of wildtype HE (sFig. 4). Apparently, the increase in HE function, minor as it may be,

211

provides a selective advantage, but apparently one that benefits both low and high affinity S variants,

212

because the mutation was found in cloned viruses of either type.

213

Loss of HE lectin function selects for virus swarms with low affinity S escape mutants promoting the

214

emergence and propagation of high-affinity S variants. To corroborate our observations, the

215

controlled forced evolution experiment was repeated (sFig. 5). As compared to the first trial, there

216

was a much faster population built-up already in p1 at 120 hr p.i. with final titers reaching 4 x 108 and

217

3.4 x 107 TCID50/ml, when measured in the presence or absence of exogenous HE-Fc, respectively.

218

Surprisingly, in stark contrast to trial 1, the trial 2 p1 population was comprised for about 94% of

219

viruses expressing wildtype BCoV S. Less than 6% consisted of variants with mutations in S1A, four of

220

low receptor binding affinity (Thr22Ile, Asn27Tyr, Val29Gly, His173Tyr), one of near-wildtype binding

221

affinity (Pro174Leu), and, with the exception of Thr22Ile, all at positions seen before (Tables 1, 2).

222

Consistent with our previous findings, however, virus purification through endpoint dilution in the

223

absence of exogenous HE-Fc yielded low affinity mutants (11/11 tested) exclusively (sFig. 5). If the

224

variants in the trial 2 p1 population were all of equal replicative fitness under the conditions applied,

225

the odds of this result would be less than 1.10-12.

226

At first glance, the two trials would seem to differ in their outcomes. We offer, however, that the

227

results are in fact consonant and that the main difference is in the speed with which the virus

228

populations increased and evolved. There is an inherent stochastic element to the experimental

229

approach and whether the developing quasispecies undergoes slow track (experiment 1) or fast track

230

evolution (experiment 2) is likely dependent on the time of advent of the first mutant virus and its

231

properties, for instance whether it is an ultralow (like Ile26Ser) or low affinity variant (like Asn27Ser).

232

The findings allow for several conclusions. (i) They confirm and firmly establish that loss of HE lectin
10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.003699; this version posted April 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

233

function selects for mutations in S1A that reduce S receptor-binding affinity and virion avidity. (ii) The

234

possibilities to reduce the affinity of the S RBS through single site mutations are finite. In several

235

independent experiments, substitutions in S1A occurred at a limited number of positions albeit not

236

necessarily by the same residue. For example, Asn27 was replaced both by Ser and Tyr. (iii) The

237

mutations that reduce S affinity fall into different categories. Most map within or in close proximity of

238

the RBS to affect receptor-ligand interaction directly. Others, like His173Tyr and Pro174Leu, are more

239

distal from the RBS and apparently affect ligand binding indirectly through long range conformational

240

effects. A third type of mutations, quasi-random Cys substitutions, apparently disrupt S1A folding by

241

promoting non-native disulfide-bonding. While an Arg197Cys substitution strongly decreased secretion

242

of the S1A-Fc fusion protein, the biosynthesis and intracellular transport of native trimeric spikes was

243

seemingly affected to lesser extent. At least, the uptake of S-Arg197Cys into VSV pseudotypes was not

244

noticeably impaired as compared to that of wildtype S (sFig. 3E). Still, the mutation did alter the

245

infectivity of the pseudotyped particles making them less dependent on exogenous HE-Fc (sFig. 3F)

246

presumably by reducing the avidity of S trimers through local S1A misfolding and consequential

247

disruption of the RBS in one or more monomers. (iv) Perhaps most surprisingly, quasispecies

248

developed in which loss of HE lectin function was compensated at the level of the viral population

249

with minority low affinity variants, constituting less than 6% of the swarm, not only sustaining the

250

replication of high affinity variants but actually allowing the latter to flourish and amplify to become

251

the majority phenotype.

252

S and HE proteins co-evolve to attain functional balance and optimal virion avidity. Among the first

253

mutations fixed upon zoonotic introduction and early emergence of OC43, was a HE-Thr114Asn

254

substitution, which created a glycosylation site at the rim of the lectin domain RBS11 (Fig. 3A). Glycans

255

attached to HE Asn114 hamper binding to 9-O-Ac-Sia through steric hindrance, causing a 500-fold

256

reduction in HE avidity (Fig. 3B) and a 125-fold in sialate-O-acetylesterase-activity, respectively (Fig.

257

3C). We introduced the HE Thr114Asn substitution in BCoV, expecting that the glycosylation site would

258

be rapidly lost through any of several single-nucleotide restorative mutations in HE. Indeed, NGS

259

analysis of the virus swarm arising after targeted recombination showed the glycosylation site to be

260

destroyed but only in 10% of the population and exclusively by Ser116Phe substitution (Fig. 3D). This

261

mutation partially restores HE receptor binding and receptor destruction to 0.125 and 0.17 of that of

262

wildtype HE, respectively (Fig. 3B, C). In the vast majority of viruses, the newly introduced HE

263

glycosylation site was retained and, instead, S1A mutations that reduced S affinity were selected again,

264

with S-RBS Thr83 replaced either by Ile (69%) -as seen before (Figs. 1A, 2C; Table 1)- or by Asn (10%)

265

(Fig. 3D). The latter mutation reduces S1A affinity to 0.008 of that of wildtype.

266

Virus cloning by endpoint dilution yielded, in three out of five isolates, S1A-Thr83Asn variants with the

267

newly introduced N-glycosylation site in HE intact (HE-Thr114Asn). Furthermore, a single S1A-Thr83Ile

268

variant was isolated, but this virus in addition had the N-glycosylation site in HE destroyed (HE-

269

Thr114Asn/Ser116Phe) (Fig. 3D). The observations led us to entertain the possibility that the mutations

270

in S1A and HE did not occur independently and that, even in viruses expressing low affinity spikes,

271

partially restorative mutations in HE would yet provide a selective advantage. To test this, the clonal

272

S1A-Thr83Asn/HE-Thr114Asn variants were serially passaged. All three viruses independently lost HE

273

Asn114 glycosylation over time and, saliently, through Ser116Phe substitution exclusively. Even more

274

remarkably, with HE-Ser116Phe mutants gaining dominance, variants emerged that had restored S

275

affinity to (near)wildtype through substitution of S1A-Asn83 either by Thr or by Ser (Fig. 3E).

276

For one of the five clonal populations obtained by endpoint dilution, we unfortunately failed to

277

determine its genotype for technical reasons. From the NGS analysis of the p1 population, we deduced

278

that the starting mutant must have been a low affinity S1A-Leu89Pro variant that, like the S1A-

279

Thr83Asn/Ile variants described above, quickly lost the HE-Asn114 glycan through an HE-Ser116Phe

280

substitution. Oddly enough, the Leu89Pro substitution had not been detected by NGS in the pre-cloning

281

virus stock. Note, however, that this mutation had been selected before twice independently in trials

282

with rBCoV-HE-F211A (Table 2). Possibly, it arose spontaneously during end point dilution procedure.

283

Be that as it may, its in vitro evolution proved informative (Fig. 4A). NGS analysis of a passage p1

284

population, resulting from 120-hr multistep propagation, showed that 100% of the viruses coded for

285

HE-Thr114Asn/Ser116Phe in combination with S1A-Pro89 (53.3%), - Thr89 (40.5%), or -Ser89 (2%). Note that

286

the relationship between these variants and the course of evolution –from Leu89 in the parental

287

recombinant virus to Pro and from Pro to Thr or Ser– is evident from the codon sequences

288

(CTA→CCA→T/ACA) and that the Thr89 and Ser89 substitutions restored S RBS affinity almost to that

289

of wildtype RBS (Fig. 4B). All three variants - S1A-Pro89, -Thr89 and -Ser89, were readily cloned and

290

isolated by standard endpoint dilution, and propagated independently without a requirement for

291

exogenous RDE. p1 also contained a minor population of viruses with parental S1A, presumably

292

regenerated from S1A-Pro89, which as for the S1A-Thr89 and Ser89 variants would have required only a

293

single nucleotide substitution (CCA→CTA). Apparently, with HE lectin function partially restored,

294

viruses that regained (near) wildtype S affinity had a selective advantage. At the end of passage p2,

295

S1A-Pro89 variants had dwindled to less than 1.5%, S1A -Thr89 had become dominant at 75% and viruses

296

with parental S1A-Leu89 had rapidly risen from 2.25% in p1 to 23% (Fig. 4A).

297

In summary, the introduction of a glycosylation site in the HE lectin domain that reduced receptor-

298

binding affinity and, thereby, reduced sialate-O-acetylesterase activity towards clustered glycotopes,

299

triggered a series of successive mutations in S and HE. Thus, the data directly demonstrate HE-S co-

300

evolution. Moreover, the findings suggest that virions are under selective pressure not only to balance

301

receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities in apparent relation to cell-surface receptor-

302

densities, but also, within these constrains, to maximize virion avidity.

303

Cell culture adapted BCoV and OC43 strains differ in their set point of the S/HE balance. The impact

304

of loss of function mutations in the BCoV HE lectin domain was unexpected, because this defect seems

305

well tolerated by the prototype OC43 laboratory strain USA/1967. In HRT18 cells, it grows to titers

306

comparable to those of BCoV reference strain Mebus. Next gen sequencing of OC43 stocks revealed

307

heterogeneity, but no indications for the existence of low S affinity minority variants that would

308

support replication of majority high S affinity viruses. Also, clonal virus populations obtained by end

309

point dilution (10/10) all conformed to the S1A master sequence. We offer that instead OC43-

310

USA/1967 may have reached a viable S/HE balance compatible with efficient in vitro propagation

311

through adaptations in S that reduced receptor-binding affinity and/or altered receptor fine-

312

specificity. When measured by solid phase assay with bivalent S1A-Fc fusion proteins, binding of the S

313

protein of OC43 USA/1967 to bovine submaxillary mucin, containing both mono- and di-O-acetylated

314

α2,6-sialoglycans, is 16 to 32-fold lower than that of BCoV-Mebus32. sp-LBA with BSM preparations,

315

selectively depleted for either 9-O- or 7,9-di-O-Sias, showed that BCoV S, like BCoV HE28, preferentially

316

binds to 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias (sFig. 6A). OC43 USA/1967 S1A may not share this preference. Apparently

317

due to its low affinity, detectable binding to BSM was lost upon depletion of either type of Sia (sFig.

318

6A). Moreover, even though BCoV-Mebus S preferably binds to 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sia, monovalent one-on-

319

one binding of the BCoV S1A domain to α2,6-linked 9-O-acetylated Sia is still 3-fold stronger than that

320

of OC43-USA/1967 as measured by biolayer interferometry (sFig. 6B). On a cautionary note, the

321

isolation and complex passage history of OC43-USA/196743,44 entailed several passages in human

322

tracheal organ culture, suckling mouse brain and many rounds of replication in cultured cells9, which

323

would have given the virus ample opportunity to adapt to the in vitro conditions. Thus, the binding

324

characteristics of its spike may not faithfully reflect those in circulating field variants. Indeed, OC43

325

variants in sputum samples, contrary to the OC43 USA/1967, replicate in airway epithelial cell cultures

326

but not in tissue culture cells45.

DISCUSSION

329

Co-evolution and functional interdependence of embecovirus S and HE proteins. Our findings

330

demonstrate that in the prototypic β1CoV BCoV the envelope proteins S and HE are functionally

331

entwined and co-evolve. We posit that the same holds for other members of the species

332

Betacoronavirus-1, including its zoonotic descendant human coronavirus OC43 and related viruses of

333

swine, rabbits, dogs and horses, as well as for other Embecovirus species, most prominently among

334

which human coronavirus HKU1. The data lead us to conclude that the respective activities of S and

335

HE in receptor-binding and catalysis-driven virion elution are balanced to ensure dynamic reversible

336

virion attachment and, thereby, efficient virus propagation. In consequence, for the viruses listed

337

above, the roles of S and HE during natural infection cannot be understood in isolation but must be

338

considered in unison.

339

Using a reverse genetics-based forced evolution approach with BCoV as a model system, we showed

340

that loss of HE lectin function causes an offset in S-HE balance, practically incompatible with virus

341

propagation and spread. With the HE lectin domain as modulator of esterase activity, mutations that

342

decrease or abolish HE RBS affinity reduce virion-associated sialate-O-acetylesterase activity towards

343

clustered glycotopes on hypervalent glycoconjugates11 such as are present in the mucus and

344

glycocalyx in natural tissues and on the surface of cultured cells. The extent of the resultant defect is

345

such that compensatory second-site mutations in S are selected for that dramatically reduce S RBS

346

affinity, apparently to restore reversibility of binding as an escape ticket from inadvertent virion

347

attachment to non-productive sites.

348

The single-amino acid mutations in receptor-binding domain S1A were limited to a finite number of

349

positions, either within or proximal to the RBS to directly affect protein-ligand interactions, or more

350

distal to reduce RBS affinity through long range effects or by disrupting local folding through aberrant

351

disulfide-bonding. Whereas the parental recombinant viruses, defective in HE lectin function but with

352

wildtype S RBS affinity, require an external source of receptor-destroying enzyme for propagation,

353

their progeny escape mutants regained propagation-independence by lowering S affinity.

354

In expanding clonal populations of HE-defective rBCoV-HE-F211A, propagated in the absence of

355

exogenous receptor-destroying enzyme activity, viruses with reduced S affinity gained a selective

356

advantage initially. Upon prolonged passage, however, quasispecies developed in which loss of HE

357

lectin function was compensated at the population level. Variants that combined the HE-Phe211Ala

358

mutation with (near) wildtype affinity S proteins increased to dominate the swarm at least

359

numerically. Still, these high affinity S variants for their proliferation were strictly reliant on minority

360

low affinity S variants. This relationship extends beyond cooperativity and group selection described

361

for other systems46–52 and amounts to a state of dependency. We propose that the virions of the low

362

affinity minority variants provide aid by serving as a source of exogenous sialate-O-acetylesterase

363

activity. They themselves evade decoy receptors through enhanced reversibility of virion attachment,

364

but this phenomenon increases their motility -whether by sliding diffusion or binding-rebinding-

365

causing them to deplete cell surface 9-O-Ac-Sias, decoy receptors and functional receptors alike. With

366

increasing concentrations of low affinity virions in the culture supernatant, high affinity variants would

367

profit progressively, whereas falling cell surface receptor densities would put the low affinity viruses

368

increasingly at a disadvantage.

369

The forced evolution trials performed with rBCoV-HE-F211A were restricted in course and outcome by

370

design, because full reversion would require simultaneous mutation of two adjacent nucleotides.

371

Moreover, the crucial role of the Phe211 in ligand binding (sFig. 1) obviates conservative substitutions

372

17

373

marginally increases HE RBS affinity and sialate-O-acetylesterase activity.

374

In contrast to the HE-Phe211Ala mutation, the deleterious effect of N-glycosylation at HE-Asn114 can be

375

reversed, completely or partially, through various single-nucleotide substitutions in codons 114 and

376

116 and would therefore more readily allow for compensatory mutations also in HE. Indeed, serial

377

passage of the rBCoV-HE-Thr114Asn resulted in a succession of mutations alternatingly in HE and S. The

378

order of appearance of these mutations and their effect on protein function indicated that they were

379

not fixed to merely restore the balance between attachment and catalysis-driven virion elution. The

. Although rBCoV-HEA211V variants did emerge in two separate experiments, this mutation only

380

HE-Thr114Asn substitution initially selected for second-site mutations that reduced S affinity (Thr83Ile,

381

Thr83Asn and Leu89Pro), but with propagation thus recovered, derivatives rapidly emerged with

382

increased HE lectin and esterase activity through a Ser116Phe mutation. Apparently, this created an

383

HE-S disbalance that in turn favored the selection of viruses with revertant mutations in S that raised

384

S RBS affinity again to wildtype (Thr83 → Ile → Thr; Leu89 → Pro → Leu) or near wildtype levels (Thr83 → Ile

385

→ Ser; Leu

386

overall avidity, compensatory to loss of HE function, virus particles regained the capacity of eluding

387

non-productive attachment to decoy receptors, but at a fitness penalty. The decrease in S RBS affinity

388

would predictably lower the specific infectivity of virus particles through a decrease in productive host

389

cell attachment. The rapid selection of the HE-Ser116Phe mutation in a low-affinity S background can

390

thus be understood to have increased virion avidity, albeit through HE and rather than through S. HE

391

does have a dual function after all and in influenza viruses C and D as well as in murine coronavirus-1,

392

it is a receptor-binding protein first and foremost22,35,53–56. Of note, the partial Ser116Phe reversion of

393

HE consistently seen in multiple independent experiments, suggests that a return to (near) wildtype

394

lectin and esterase activity along with a low affinity S would have tipped the scale too much towards

395

catalytic virion release. We posit that in addition to an optimal balance between receptor-binding and

396

receptor-destruction, the system strives towards optimal virion avidity (Fig. 4C).

397

Under natural circumstances, the set-point of the S/HE balance would be tailored to conditions met

398

in the target tissues of the intact host. The spontaneous loss of HE lectin function in OC43 and HKU1

399

may thus be understood to have arisen through convergent evolution as an adaptation to the

400

sialoglycan composition of the mucus in the human upper respiratory tract and that of the glycocalyx

401

of the respiratory epithelia11. This change, which would predictably reduce virion-associated receptor-

402

destruction and hence decrease virion elution/increase or prolong virion attachment, might have been

403

selected for by low density occurrence of 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans in the human upper airways. In

404

accordance, limited tissue array analyses with HE-based virolectins suggested that these sugars are

405

not particularly prevalent in the human respiratory tract and by far not as ubiquitous as in the gut28.

406

However, full understanding of how the S-HE balance was reset in OC43 and HKU1 upon their zoonotic

407

introduction and why awaits further analysis of the binding properties and ligand fine-specificity of

408

the S proteins of naturally occurring variants as well as more quantitative and comprehensive inter-

409

host comparative analyses of airway sialoglycomes. As an added complication, virion particles

410

encounter widely different circumstances while traversing the mucus layer, at the epithelial cell

411

surface, during local cell-to-cell dissemination, and during transmission. It is an open question whether

412

this selects for majority phenotypes that can cope individually and independently with each of these

413

different conditions by striking an uneasy compromise with regard to HE/S balance and overall virion

414

avidity, or whether there is loco-temporal selection for swarms of variants that collectively allow the

415

virus population as a whole to overcome each hurdle.

416

Similarities between embeco- and influenza A viruses point to common principles of virion-

417

sialoglycan receptor-usage. The embecovirus HE gene originated from a horizontal gene transfer

418

event, presumably with an influenza C/D-like virus as donor17,57. Like the orthomyxovirus

419

hemagglutinin-esterase fusion proteins, the newly acquired coronavirus HE protein provided the

420

acceptor virus with an opportunity to reversibly bind to 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans26. This in turn would seem

421

to have prompted a shift in the receptor-specificity of S through adaptations in S1A that created a 9-

422

O-Ac-Sia binding site de novo so that virions could now attach to these receptor determinants also via

423

S. The embecoviruses thus adopted a strategy of receptor usage entailing a concerted and carefully

424

fine-tuned activity of two envelope proteins that is unique among coronaviruses, but uncannily similar

425

to that of influenza A viruses. In the latter, the hemagglutinin (HA), as a pendant of S, mediates binding

426

to either α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialosides, while the neuraminidase, like HE, is a receptor-destroying

427

enzyme with a substrate fine-specificity that closely matches HA ligand preference58. For influenza A

428

virus, the existence and biological relevance of a functional balance between receptor-binding and

429

receptor destruction is well recognized59–62. This balance is critical for receptor-associated virus

430

motility through the mucus and at the cell surface63–68. Complete or partial loss of NA activity -whether

431

invoked spontaneously, through reverse genetics or by viral propagation in the presence of NA

432

inhibitors- selects for mutations around the HA receptor-binding pocket that reduce HA affinity60,69,70.

433

Furthermore, as proposed here for HE, NA contributes to virion attachment and even compensates

434

for loss of virion avidity in mutant viruses with reduced HA affinity71. Different from HE, NA may do so

435

via its catalytic pocket which doubles as a Sia-binding site72. However, NA also possesses a second Sia

436

binding site73,74, which like the HE lectin domain, regulates NA activity and which, in further analogy,

437

is conserved or lost in apparent correlation with host tropism75–77. Finally, among many other

438

similarities to embecoviruses, influenza A variants with different set points in their HA-NA functional

439

balance may cooperate to support their propagation in cultured cells48. Our observations establish

440

that there are common principles of virion-sialoglycan interactions that prompted convergent

441

evolution of β1CoVs and influenza A viruses. Although these two groups of viruses essentially differ in

442

genome type and replication strategy, envelope proteins, and receptors, they seem to be subject to

443

the same rules of engagement with respect to dynamic receptor-binding, the differences between

444

them constituting variations on a theme. This implies that observations made for the one system are

445

informative for the other. Perhaps more importantly, insight into the overriding principles of virus-

446

glycan interactions may open avenues to common strategies for antiviral intervention.

supernatant followed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. One clonal population was used to grow a

492

p0 stock of rBCoV-HE-F211A and HE and S1A diversity was assessed by next gen illumina sequence

493

analysis (NGS). The virus was used to inoculate 5 × 106 HRT18 cells at an MOI of 0.005 TCID50/cell and

494

serially passaged. Cell culture supernatants were harvested at 120 hr p.i. and virus diversity was

495

assessed by subcloning and genetic analysis of purified viruses as in Fig. 1. In addition, viral RNA was

496

extracted, and diversity determined by RT-PCR amplification and NGS. Frequencies of S1A variants are

Methods

567

Cells and viruses. Human rectal tumor (HRT) 18 (ATCC® CCL-244™) and mouse LR741 cells were

568

maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS),

569

penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). BCoV strain Mebus and OC43 strain USA/1967,

570

purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), were propagated in HRT18 cells.

571

Reverse genetics through targeted recombination. A reverse genetics system based on targeted RNA

572

recombination was developed for BCoV strain Mebus essentially as described15,41,78. Using

573

conventional cloning methods, RT-PCR amplicons of the 5’-terminal 601 nts and 3’-terminal 9292 nts

574

of the BCoV strain Mebus genome (reference Genbank sequence U00735.2) were fused and cloned in

575

plasmid pUC57, downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promotor and upstream of a 25-nt poly(A) tract

576

and a PacI site, yielding pD-BCoV1. From this construct, BCoV ORF 4a was deleted (nts 27740-27853)

577

and replaced by the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gen, yielding pD-BCoV-Rluc. A second pD-BCoV1

578

derivative, pD-mBCoVΔHE, was created by replacing the coding sequence for the ectodomain of BCoV

579

S (nts 23641-27433) by the corresponding MHV-A59 sequence and by deleting the BCoV HE gene (nts

580

22406-23623). The nucleotide sequences of pD-BCoV1, pD-BCoV-Rluc and pD-mBCoVΔHE,

581

determined by bidirectional Sanger sequence analysis, were deposited in Genbank (accession codes:

582

XXX).

583

To generate a recombinant chimeric acceptor virus, mBCoV∆HE, HRT18 cells were infected with BCoV-

584

Mebus at a MOI of 10 TCID50/cell and trypsinized and re-suspended in PBS. An aliquot of this

585

suspension, containing 1.5 × 106 cells in 0.8 ml, was mixed with capped synthetic RNA that had been

586

produced by in vitro transcription using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo

587

fisher) with PacI-linearized mBCoV∆HE vector as template. The mixture was subjected to two

588

consecutive electrical pulses of 850 V at 20 μF with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad) and the

589

cells were then seeded on a confluent monolayer of LR7 feeder cells in a 35mm dish. Incubation was

590

continued at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 18 hours post transfection until wide-spread cytopathic effect (CPE) was

591

apparent. The cell culture supernatant was harvested and cleared by low speed centrifugation at 1200

592

rpm, and mBCoV∆HE was purified by end-point dilution and used to generate stocks for future usage

593

in LR7 cells.

594

To generate luciferase-expressing rBCoVs with the BCoV HE and S genes reconstituted, i.e. rBCoVwt or

595

rBCoV-HE-Phe211Ala, LR7 cells, infected with mBCoV∆HE at MOI 5, were electroporated as described

596

above with synthetic RNA transcribed from pD-BCoV-Rluc and derivatives thereof. The infected and

597

transfected cells were then seeded on HRT18 cell monolayers in 35-mm plates for up to 160 hr. For

598

rescue and propagation of rBCoV-HE-Phe211Ala without second-site mutations in S, the cell culture

599

supernatants were supplemented with 100 ng/ml of BCoV HE-Fc protein17. After 5-7 days of incubation

600

at 37°C, samples of the cell culture supernatants were tested for infectivity by transferring them to

601

HRT18 cell monolayers grown on 12-mm glass coverslips in 15.6-mm wells. Incubation was continued

602

for 12 hr after which the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and immunofluorescence staining

603

was performed with polyclonal antiserum from a BCoV-infected cow.

604

Virus titration, purification and characterization of viral populations. mBCoV was titrated and cloned

605

by endpoint dilution on LR7 cells with cytopathic effect as read-out. rBCoVs were titrated and cloned

606

in HRT18 cells. To identify infected wells, cell supernatants were analyzed by hemagglutination assay

607

with rat erythrocytes26 and by Renilla luciferase assay (Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System,

608

Promega). Titers were calculated by the Spearman-Kaerber formula. Clonal virus populations were

609

characterized by isolating viral RNA from 150 µl aliquots of the cell culture supernatant with the

610

NucleoSpin® RNA Virus kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL) followed by conventional RT-PCR and bidirectional

611

Sanger sequence analysis.

612

Controlled forced evolution experiments. Confluent HRT18 monolayers (5 × 106 cells) grown in 25-

613

cm2 flasks, were inoculated with rBCoV-HE-F211A at an MOI 0.005 in PBS for 1 hr at 37°C. The cells were

614

washed three times with PBS to remove residual exogeneous HE-Fc and incubation was continued in

615

DMEM + 10% FCS at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 120 hr post infection (pi) with samples collected every 24 hours

616

(passage 1). Subsequent 120-hr passages were performed by adding 10 µL of supernatant to new

617

cultures of HRT18 cells in 25-cm2 flasks.

618

Expression and purification of HE-Fc and S1A-Fc proteins. BCoV HE, either enzymatically-active (HE+)

619

or rendered inactive through a Ser40Ala substitution (HE0), and OC43 S1A were expressed as Fc fusion

620

proteins in HEK293T cells and purified from the cell supernatant by protein A affinity chromatography

621

as detailed17,32. Monomeric S1A was obtained by on-the bead thrombin cleavage32. pCD5-BCoVHE-T-Fc

622

vectors17 encoding mutant BCoV HE derivatives were constructed with the Q5® Site-Directed

623

Mutagenesis Kit per the instructions of the manufacturer.

624

Pseudovirus entry assays.

625

The production of BCoV S-pseudotyped VSV-DG particles, their characterization by Western blot

626

analysis, and infectivity assays in HRT18 cells were as described32.

627

Solid-phase lectin binding assay (sp-LBA). sp-LBA was performed as described32 with bovine

628

submaxillary mucin (BSM; Sigma-Aldrich), coated to 96-Well Maxisorp® microtitre ELISA plates (Nunc,

629

0.1 µg BSM per well), serving as a ligand. Binding assays were performed with 2-fold serial dilutions of

630

HE0-Fc, S1A-Fc, or mutated derivatives thereof. Receptor-destroying esterase activities of soluble HEs

631

were measured by on-the-plate 9-O-Ac-Sia depletion assays as described11,28.

632

Hemagglutination assay (HAA). HAA was performed with rat erythrocytes (Rattus norvegicus strain

633

Wistar; 50% suspension in PBS). Standard HAA was done with two-fold serial dilutions of HE0-Fc

634

proteins (starting at 25 ng/well) as described17. High sensitivity nanoparticle HAA (NP-HAA) was

635

performed as in32,79. Briefly, self-assembling 60-meric nanoparticles, comprised of lumazine synthase

636

(LS), N-terminally extended with the immunoglobulin Fc-binding domain of the S. aureus protein A,

637

were complexed with HE0-Fc proteins at a 1:0.6 molar ratio for 30 min on ice. The HE0-Fc-loaded

638

nanoparticles were then 2-fold serially diluted and mixed 1:1 (vol/vol) with rat erythrocytes (0.5% in

639

PBS). Incubation was for 2 hr at 4°C after which HAA titers were read.

640

NGS analysis. Viral RNA from culture supernatants was isolated as described above. HE and S1A coding

641

regions from viral genome of different virus populations were obtained by RT-PCR with primer sets

642

HEF 5’-TTAGATTATGGTCTAAGCATCATG-3’ and HER 5’-TTAGATTATGGTCTAAGCATCATG-3’, S1AF 5’-

643

ACCATGTTTTTGATACTTTTA-3’ and S1AR 5’-AGATTGTGTTTTACACTTAATCTC-3’, respectively. Amplicons

644

were processed in the NGSgo® workflow for Illumina according to the Instructions for Use (Edition 4),

645

except that the fragmentation was prolonged to 40 min at 25°C (protocol 3A). Briefly, amplicons were

646

subjected to fragmentation and adapter ligation using NGSgo-LibrX (GenDx). Size selection and clean-

647

up of the samples was performed with SPRI beads (Machery-Nagel). Unique barcodes were ligated to

648

each sample using NGSgo-IndX (GenDx), after which all samples were pooled and subsequently

649

purified with SPRI beads, resulting in a library of fragments between ~400 and 1000 bp. The DNA

650

fragments were denatured and paired-end sequenced on a MiSeq platform (Illumina) using a 300 cycle

651

kit (V2). FASTQ files were analyzed in NGSengine® (GenDx), which aligned the reads to the reference

652

sequences of HE and S (reference Genbank sequence U00735.2 for BCoV strain Mebus, and

653

NC_006213.1 for OC43 strain USA/1967). For the characterization of each virus sample, amplicons

654

from five independent RT-PCR reactions were analyzed in parallel and mutation frequencies were

655

determined by averaging the results from these five replicates.
