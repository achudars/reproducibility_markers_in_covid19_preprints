Abstract
Several related human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are endemic in the human population, causing mild
respiratory infections1. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a recent zoonotic infection that has
quickly reached pandemic proportions2,3. Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses is thought to
occur in the absence of pre-existing immunity in the target human population. Using diverse assays
for detection of antibodies reactive with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, we demonstrate the
presence of pre-existing humoral immunity in uninfected and unexposed humans to the new
coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies were readily detectable by a sensitive flow cytometrybased method in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals and were particularly prevalent in children and
adolescents. These were predominantly of the IgG class and targeted the S2 subunit. In contrast,
SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titres of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, targeting both
the S1 and S2 subunits, as well as concomitant IgM and IgA antibodies, lasting throughout the
observation period of 6 weeks since symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera also
variably reacted with SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleoprotein (N), but not with the S1 subunit or the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of S on standard enzyme immunoassays. Notably, SARS-CoV-2uninfected donor sera exhibited specific neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S
pseudotypes, according to levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to
those of COVID-19 patient sera. Distinguishing pre-existing and de novo antibody responses to SARSCoV-2 will be critical for our understanding of susceptibility to and the natural course of SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Results
Immune cross-reactivity among seasonally spreading human coronaviruses (HCoVs) has long been
hypothesised to provide cross-protection, albeit transient, against infection with distinct HCoV
types1,4,5. To determine the degree of cross-reactivity between HCoVs and the recently introduced
zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, we developed a sensitive flow cytometry-based assay for
detection of SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies (Methods). The main target for such antibodies is the
spike (S) glycoprotein, which is proteolytically processed into the S1 and S2 subunits, mediating
target cell attachment and entry, respectively6,7. To ensure detection of antibodies targeting all
available epitopes in naturally processed S, we transfected HEK293T cells with an expression vector
encoding the wild-type S of SARS-CoV-2 and stained them with primary serum samples.
Staining with the S1-reactive CR3022 monoclonal antibody (IgG class) identified a smaller percentage
of SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing HEK293T cells and was of lower intensity than staining with COVID-19
convalescent sera (Extended data Fig. 1), indicating that polyclonal IgG antibodies targeted a wider
range of epitopes presented on these cells. As well as IgG antibodies, this assay readily detected
SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgM and IgA antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent sera (Extended data Fig. 2).
Consistent with prior reports8-18, titres of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies varied by several orders
of magnitude between COVID-19 convalescent sera, with some reliably detected only at the highest
serum concentration (1:50 dilution) (Extended data Fig. 2), which was used for subsequent sensitive
measurements. Whilst the intensity of IgM and IgG staining decreased proportionally with serum
dilutions, the intensity of IgA staining peaked at intermediate serum dilutions (Extended data Fig. 2),
likely owing to competition with IgG antibodies at higher serum concentrations. Therefore, the
intensity of staining with each of the three main Ig classes might reflect their relative ratios, as well
as their absolute titres. In contrast, the percentage of cells stained with each Ig class was less
sensitive to serum dilutions and was chosen as a correlate for seropositivity. Indeed, the percentage
of SARS-CoV-2 S-transfected cells stained with all three Ig classes (IgM+IgG+IgA+) distinguished
COVID-19 sera from control sera with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity (Extended data Fig.
3a-c). A total of 170 RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients at University College London Hospitals
(UCLH) and 262 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected patients and healthy donors (Table S1) were tested by the
flow cytometry-based assay, demonstrating overall 91.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity of
seropositivity detection (Extended data Fig. 3b). All but one of the antibody-negative COVID-19
patient samples were collected between days 2 and 16 post symptoms onset (Extended data Fig.
3d). Consequently, for samples taken after day 16 post symptoms onset, the flow cytometry-based
assay demonstrated 99.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity of seropositivity detection, with no
evidence of decline at the latest time-point examined (day 43 post onset of symptoms) (Extended
data Fig. 3c).
The single COVID-19 patient without a concurrent IgM, IgG and IgA response on day 29 post
symptoms onset, when all other COVID-19 patients had seroconverted, did exhibit SARS-CoV-2 Sreactive IgG antibodies detected by this assay in the absence of the other two Ig classes (Extended
data Fig. 3d). Inspection of patient records indicated that this was a 60-year-old bone marrow
transplant recipient, who tested positive for HCoV infection in February 2020 and subsequently
contracted SARS-CoV-2, testing positive by RT-qPCR the following month (Extended data Fig. 4).
Serum samples taken around the diagnosis of HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections were negative for
SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies, likely due to the immunosuppressed state of this patient
(Extended data Fig. 4). However, serum taken 3 weeks later contained SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG, in
the absence of other antibody classes (Extended data Fig. 4). This profile was more consistent with
an anamnestic response to HCoVs, than a de novo response to SARS-CoV-2. This patient described
only mild COVID-19 symptoms that did not necessitate hospitalisation, but appeared chronically
infected with SARS-CoV-2, having tested repeatedly positive for viral RNA for over a month
(Extended data Fig. 4).
To examine whether SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, detectable by the FACS-based assay,
might have been induced by prior HCoV infection, we tested sera from SARS-CoV-2-uninfected

patients with or without RT-qPCR-confirmed HCoV infection, sampled before or during the early
spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK (Table S1). Although the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive
antibodies of all three Ig classes effectively distinguished COVID-19 patients, remarkably, a
proportion of SARS-CoV-2-uninfected patients also had SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibodies (Fig. 1a).
Again, sera from the latter group contained predominantly lower levels of S-reactive IgG and no IgM
or IgA antibodies (Fig. 1a), suggesting the presence of cross-reactive immunological memory.
The S2 subunit exhibits a higher degree of homology among coronaviruses than S1 (Extended data
Fig. 5) and was likely the main target of cross-reactive antibodies6. Indeed, whereas the addition of
recombinant soluble S1 completely abolished binding of the S1-reactive CR3022 antibody19 to SARSCoV-2 S-expressing cells, it did not affect the binding of HCoV patient sera (Fig. 1b,c). Binding of
COVID-19 patient sera was reduced by approximately 30% by soluble S1, indicating recognition of
both S1 and S2 (Fig. 1b,c). Consistent with these observations, sera from both COVID-19 and HCoV
patients reacted comparably in a SARS-CoV-2 S-coated ELISA, whereas only those from COVID-19
patients reacted in a SARS-CoV-2 S1-coated ELISA (Fig. 1d). These data highlighted cross-reactivity of
HCoV patient sera with SARS-CoV-2 S, and specific recognition of the S1 subunit by COVID-19 patient
sera.
To confirm and determine the extent of such cross-reactivity using an independent assay, we
developed ELISAs with a number of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins (Methods). These included
the stabilised trimeric S ectodomain, the S1 subunit, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the
nucleoprotein (N). In a cohort of 135 COVID-19 patients (Table S1), the sensitivity of ELISAs was
lower than that of the FACS-based assay, with 20 COVID-19 samples testing negative on ELISA coated
with the S1 subunit, 8 of which also tested negative on S-coated or N-coated ELISAs (Extended data
Fig. 6). Overall, the S1-coated ELISA for IgG detection demonstrated 92.1% sensitivity and 99.6%
specificity of seropositivity detection for all samples taken after day 16 post symptoms onset
(Extended data Fig. 7a-c). Rates of IgG seropositivity determined by SARS-CoV-2 S1-coated ELISA
were congruent with, but overall lower than those determined by FACS, underscoring the higher
sensitivity of the FACS-based assay (Extended data Fig. 7d,e).
We next tested our initial cohort of COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals (SARSCoV-2 -), which included earlier samples of unknown HCoV status and more recent samples of
known HCoV status (Table S1), in the different assays. SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies were
detected by FACS in 5 of 34 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals with recent HCoV infection, as well as
in 1 of 31 individuals without recent HCoV infection (Fig. 2a). This suggested that these antibodies
might have persisted from earlier HCoV infections, rather than having been induced by the most
recent one. The 3 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals with the highest cross-recognition of S on FACS,
and a further 4 individuals, also had IgG antibodies detectable on ELISA coated with SARS-CoV-2 S
ectodomain, as well as with SARS-CoV-2 N (Fig. 2b-e), also highly conserved among coronaviruses
(CoVs). In contrast, none of the control samples had IgG antibodies detectable on ELISAs coated with
the less conserved SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD (Fig. 2c,e). Collectively, these results suggested that a total
of 12 of 95 control samples exhibited IgG antibodies cross-reactive with conserved epitopes in SARSCoV-2 proteins (S2 and N). Moreover, a sample from an 81-year-old COVID-19 patient in this cohort
collected on day 16 post mild COVID-19 symptoms exhibited only IgG reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 S, but
not to S1, which would be more characteristic of pre-existing antibody memory to HCoVs, than a de
novo response to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2a-e).
Although the data presented here and emerging in the recent and unrefereed literature14,20,21
suggest extensive antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs, the potential
consequences of pre-existing immunity for the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection or susceptibility to
COVID-19 have not been fully considered. One of the ways in which HCoV-elicited antibodies might
protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection is inhibition of entry into the target cell. SARS-CoV-2 binding to
one identified cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)2,6,7,22, is mediated by the
RBD. As HCoV-induced antibodies cross-react with S2, but not the RBD, they might not be expected
to block ACE2-RBD interactions. However, SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies that do not block

RBD-ACE2 interaction have been reported23,24, as have neutralising antibodies targeting the S2
subunit of SARS-CoV25,26 or of SARS-CoV-224. It is therefore plausible that HCoV patient sera targeting
the S2 also neutralise, either by indirectly affecting ACE2-mediated viral entry or by interfering with
alternative routes of entry. Indeed, entry of SARS-CoV-2 can also be facilitated by the alternative
receptor CD147, also known as basigin (BSG)27, neuropilin 128,29, and possibly also by receptorindependent mechanisms, as has been described for other CoVs30,31. To examine the ability of HCoV
patient sera to inhibit viral entry, we used HEK293T cells as targets. These cells lack ACE2 expression,
but are nevertheless permissive to entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S
(Extended data Fig. 8). Moreover, transduction efficiency of HEK293T cells by SARS-CoV-2 S
pseudotypes was not further increased by ACE2 overexpression (Extended data Fig. 8), highlighting
ACE2-independent entry. In contrast, HEK293T cells expressed high levels of BSG and NRP1,
encoding CD147 and neuropilin 1, respectively (Extended data Fig. 8).
Sera from seroconverted (Ab +) COVID-19 patients efficiently neutralised SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes,
consistent with prior reports10,15,17,32,33, whereas those from COVID-19 patients that had not yet
produced binding antibodies (Ab -) did not (Fig. 3a). Surprisingly, sera from SARS-CoV-2-uninfected
patients that contained SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies neutralised these pseudotypes, with
efficiencies comparable with sera from seroconverted COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3a). None of the sera
neutralised lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the control glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV) (Fig. 3a). Titres of neutralising antibodies in COVID-19 patient sera correlated well with titres of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding antibodies, determined by ELISA and with titres of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding
antibodies, determined by FACS (Fig. 3b). Despite the low numbers, the correlation between
neutralising antibodies in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected patient sera with SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG
antibodies determined by FACS was even stronger (Fig. 3c). Collectively, these data indicated that
HCoV-elicited cross-reactive antibodies can interfere with at least one mode of SARS-CoV-2 entry
into target cells. To confirm these findings in different experimental setting, we used infection of
Vero E6 cells with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and assessed the ability of patient sera to reduce the
number and size of plaques formed. All COVID-19 patient sera tested had measurable neutralising
activity in this assay (Fig. 3d). Importantly, 5 of 6 sera from SARS-CoV-2-uninfected patients with
FACS-detectable SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies also neutralised SARS-CoV-2 in this assay, albeit
on average less potently than COVID-19 patient sera, whereas none of the sera from SARS-CoV-2uninfected patients from the same cohort, but without FACS-detectable SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive
antibodies did (Fig. 3d), supporting the functional relevance of FACS-detectable SARS-CoV-2 Sbinding IgG antibodies.
Together, our results from four independent assays demonstrated the presence of pre-existing
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals. Given their potential importance in shaping the
natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we next examined the prevalence of such cross-reactive
antibodies in healthy donors. We further tested samples from a cohort of 50 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected
pregnant women (Table S1), none of which had SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies of all three Ig
classes (IgG, IgM and IgA) concurrently (Extended data Fig. 9). However, at least 5 of these samples
(all collected in May 2018) showed evidence for lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies
alone, which could not have been elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Extended data Fig. 9). An
additional 2 samples reacted with N, but not S or S1 on ELISA (Extended data Fig. 9). These data
suggested that a minimum of 10% of this cohort had pre-existing antibodies cross-reactive with
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In a separate cohort of 101 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donors (all sampled in May
2019), 3 had SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies (Extended data Fig. 10), which did not correlate
with antibodies to diverse viruses and bacteria also present in several of these samples (Table S1).
SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgM and IgA were also detected in 2 of these donors (aged 23 and 33), albeit
at considerably lower levels than those in COVID-19 patients (Extended data Fig. 10), suggestive of
recent or ongoing response.
The last two cohorts of SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals were sampled in late spring, a season
when HCoV spread typically declines, and it was therefore less likely that they had experienced very

recent HCoV infection. To examine if recent infection with a particular type of HCoV correlated with
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies, we tested an additional 13 donors who had each
been infected with one of the 4 HCoV types between 12 and 55 days prior to sampling (Table S1). Of
these 13 donors, only 1, recently infected with HCoV-OC43, had SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG
antibodies, and these at very low levels (Extended data Fig. 11), suggesting that their emergence is
not simply a common transient event following each HCoV infection in this age group (median age
51 years; Table S1). Instead, given that HCoV-reactive antibodies are present in virtually all adults3436
, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 S-cross-reactive antibodies in a relatively small proportion of adults
(15 of 262; 5.72%), indicates additional requirements, such as random B cell receptor repertoire
focusing or context of initial exposure or frequency of HCoV infection, than time since the most
recent HCoV infection. Indeed, the frequency of infection with each HCoV type displays a
characteristic age distribution with children and adolescents experiencing the highest overall
infection frequency1,35-39. We therefore examined a cohort of younger SARS-CoV-2-uninfected
healthy donors (aged 1-16 years; Table S1). Remarkably, at least 21 of these 48 donors had readily
detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies (Fig. 4a,b). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
S-reactive IgG antibodies increased with age, peaking at 62% after 6 years of age (Fig. 4c), when
HCoV seroconversion in this age group also peaks34,35,37,38, and was significantly higher than in adults
(p<0.00001, Fisher's exact test). Moreover, sera from SARS-CoV-2-uninfected children and
adolescents efficiently neutralised SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes, but not VSVg pseudotypes in vitro
(Fig. 4d). Sera from two SARS-CoV-2-uninfected adolescents, from which sufficient sample was
available for testing, also neutralised authentic SARS-CoV-2 with comparable efficiency (Fig. 4e).
These observations support a model whereby exposure to HCoVs elicits humoral immunity that
cross-reacts with conserved protein domains in other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Infection
with SARS-CoV-2 additionally induces de novo antibody responses to variable domains unique to this
virus, specifically S1. Consistent with this model, SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive class-switched antibodies
were detected by FACS concurrently with IgM antibodies in our COVID-19 patients, kinetics typically
associated with anamnestic responses. A similar flow assay was recently used to demonstrate crossreactivity of COVID-19 patient sera with the S proteins, but not the RBDs of the other two zoonotic
CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS10. Sera from SARS-CoV-recovered patients have been suggested to
neutralise, to a degree, SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes7. Moreover, infection with SARS-CoV-2 has
recently been shown to increase IgG seroreactivity to HCoVs33. SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive T helper cells,
a prerequisite for class-switched antibody responses, have been detected in the majority of COVID19 patients, as well as between one-third and two-thirds of healthy individuals, albeit at lower clonal
frequencies20,40. In agreement with the specificity of the antibody response we describe here, T
helper cells from COVID-19 patients targeted both subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S, whereas those from
healthy individuals targeted the S2 subunit20.
Collectively, these studies highlight the existence of potentially functionally relevant antigenic
epitopes in the S2 subunit, which is conserved among HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2. They echo findings
with antigenic epitopes in the F subdomain of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin, which is also
highly conserved among all influenza A virus 16 subtypes and the target of broadly neutralising
antibodies41,42.
Over its entire length, SARS-CoV-2 S exhibits closer homology with the S proteins of the two
betacoronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, than of the alphacoronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and
HCoV-229E (Extended data Fig. 12a). Infections with HCoV-OC43 are more prevalent than with
HCoV-HKU1, also in the UK and in children and adolescents in particular38. Although these
considerations would incriminate HCoV-OC43 as the likely inducer of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive
antibodies, other HCoVs are sufficiently homologous with SARS-CoV-2 to elicit cross-reactive
humoral immune responses. To probe potential shared epitopes targeted in SARS-CoV-2 S, we
constructed overlapping peptide arrays spanning the last 743 amino acids of SARS-CoV-2 S and
tested the reactivity of adult and adolescent SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera that had crossreactive antibodies detectable by FACS (SARS-CoV-2 - Ab +) (Extended data Fig. 12b). As controls, we

also used sera from seroconverted COVID-19 patients (SARS-CoV-2 + Ab +) and sera from adult SARSCoV-2-uninfected donors without cross-reactive antibodies detectable by FACS (SARS-CoV-2 - Ab -).
Multiple peptides in the array were recognised by the sera, identifying several putative epitopes in
S2 (Fig. 5a,b; Extended data Fig. 12b). However, there were at least 5 epitopes recognised more
strongly by sera with cross-reactive antibodies, particularly from adolescent donors, than by control
sera (Fig. 5a,b). These included epitopes S901-906 (QMAYRF) and S810-816 (SKPSKRS) (Fig. 5), which were
embedded in immunodominant regions previously experimentally defined in SARS-CoV and
computationally predicted in SARS-CoV-2, respectively43. Both these epitopes were conserved
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as among all four HCoVs (Fig. 5a,b). We further
identified epitopes S851-856 (CAQKFN), S1040-1044 (VDFCG) and S1205-1212 (KYEQYIKW), all of which were
highly conserved among HCoVs (Fig. 5a,b). Epitopes CAQKFN and KYEQYIKW mapped to a surface
loop and the membrane-proximal region of S2, respectively, and were therefore missing from prior
structures. However, the loop containing the CAQKFN epitope is present in the most recently
reported structure44, where, similarly to other identified epitopes, it was located on the surface of S2
and accessible by antibodies (Fig. 5c). Lastly, epitope S997-1002 (ITGRLQ), also targeted more strongly
by cross-reactive than control sera, was not located on the surface of pre-fusion S conformation (Fig.
5c), suggesting that additional epitopes might be accessible in alternative conformations, such as
after the loss of the S1 subunit or after premature acquisition of the post-fusion conformation, as it
was recently proposed45,46. Cross-reactivity with the identified epitopes was examined by ELISAs
coated with synthetic peptides, which provided evidence for cross-reactivity (Extended data Fig. 13).
Indeed, sera from seroconverted COVID-19 patients reacted with the selected peptides, as did those
from SARS-CoV-2-uninfected adults or adolescents, in some cases more strongly than the former
(Extended data Fig. 13). Reactivity with at least two peptides (containing epitopes CAQKFN and
FIEDLLFN) appear restricted to SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor samples with FACS-detectable crossreactive antibodies and was not seen in control samples without FACS-detectable cross-reactive
antibodies (Extended data Fig. 13).
These findings further supported the notion of pre-existing and de novo responses targeting
conserved and unique SARS-CoV-2 S epitopes, respectively. However, the sequence conservation of
the identified epitopes among the 4 HCoVs did not indicate if one was more likely than the others to
have induced cross-reactive antibodies against these epitopes. We therefore examined reactivity of
the sera against the S proteins of the 4 HCoVs separately using our FACS-based assay (Extended data
Fig. 14). As expected, all sera exhibited some level of reactivity with one or more HCoVs, with HCoV229E being the most frequent (Fig. 5d and Extended data Fig. 13). However, levels specifically of IgG
antibodies against each of the 4 HCoV types, determined by this assay, were higher in sera from
COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-infected donors with FACS-detectable cross-reactive antibodies
to SARS-CoV-2 S, than the respective control sera (Fig. 5d). Indeed, IgG and IgA reactivity against
HCoVs was higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected adults with, than without SARS-CoV-2-reactive IgG
(p=1.4×10-6 for IgG and p=0.017 for IgA, Student’s t-test), and in SARS-CoV-2-infected children or
adolescents with, than without SARS-CoV-2-reactive IgG (p=0.010 for IgG and p=0.021 for IgA,
Student’s t-test), supporting a direct link between the two. Accordingly, IgG reactivity against each
HCoV type was independently correlated with the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5d). Weak correlation was also seen for IgA reactivity specifically against HCoVOC43, but not the other HCoV or for IgM reactivity against any HCoV (Fig. 5d). Consistent with
sequence conservation of the putative targeted epitopes, these data suggest the presence of IgG
memory reactive with HCoVs, as well as SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions
Cross-reactivity between seasonal HCoVs and the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 needs to be carefully
considered in the development and interpretation of assays for precise detection of SARS-CoV-2specific antibodies. The FACS-based method we employed demonstrated the highest degree of
specificity and sensitivity of the assays used here. This assay allows the distinction between pre7

existing and de novo antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, based on the levels of SARS-CoV-2 Sreactive IgG and parallel detection of IgM and IgA. These distinguishing features were maintained
and, indeed, appear to increase during the first 43 days post onset of COVID-19 symptoms (the latest
time-point we have examined). It is possible that these features are maintained for longer periods
post SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is also expected that the discriminating ability will be lost over
time. Within each assay, increasing specificity by using higher positivity thresholds or omitting
conserved protein domains may be at expense of sensitivity. This is evident in the use of less
conserved SARS-CoV-2 protein domains such as S1 and RBD, which exhibited approximately 78%
sensitivity during the first 43 days post onset of COVID-19 symptoms in our study, and which is likely
to drop further with waning antibody titres over longer periods.
The ability of HCoV patient sera to neutralise authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes
raise similar concerns regarding the specificity of neutralisation assays. For example, 5 of 1,000
samples from healthy Scottish blood donors collected in March 2020 neutralised SARS-CoV-2 S
pseudotypes and 1 of 100 samples collected in 2019 also had neutralising activity in the absence of a
strong ELISA signal32. Notably, these samples were described to have low or no SARS-CoV-2 Sreactive IgM antibodies32, a feature we would associate with immune memory of HCoVs.
In addition to its implications for serology assay development and interpretation or for the design of
vaccination studies, potential cross-reactivity between seasonal HCoVs and the pandemic SARS-CoV2 has important ramifications for natural infection. Thorough epidemiological studies of HCoV
transmission suggest that cross-protective immunity is unlikely to be sterilising or long-lasting39,
which is also supported by repeated reinfection of all age groups4, sometimes even with
homologous HCoVs47. Nevertheless, prior immunity induced by one HCoV has also been reported to
reduce the transmission of homologous and, importantly, heterologous HCoVs, and to ameliorate
the symptoms where transmission is not prevented1,4,5. A possible modification of COVID-19 severity
by prior HCoV infection might account for the age distribution of COVID-19 susceptibility, where
higher HCoV infection rates in children than in adults5,35,37, correlates with relative protection from
COVID-1948, and might also shape seasonal and geographical patterns of transmission.
Public health measures intended to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 will also prevent the spread of
and, consequently, maintenance of herd immunity to HCoVs, particularly in children. It is, therefore,
imperative that any effect, positive or negative, of pre-existing HCoV-elicited immunity on the
natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is fully delineated.

Methods
Patients and clinical samples
Serum or plasma samples were obtained from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) COVID-19
patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR and sampled between March 2020 and
April 2020. An initial cohort of 35 patients (31 annotated) and an extended cohort of 135 patients
were tested between 2 and 43 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (Table S1). A total of 262
samples form SARS-CoV-2-uninfected adults and 48 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected children and adolescents
were also used (described in Table S1). Samples from adults were obtained from UCLH and Public
Health Wales, University Hospital of Wales, and samples from children and adolescents were
obtained from the Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology Versus Arthritis at University College
London (UCL), UCLH, and Great Ormond Street Hospitals (GOSH), and Great Ormond Street Institute
for Child Health (ICH) with ethical approval (refs 11/LO/0330 and 95RU04). All patient sera and sera
remaining after antenatal screening of healthy pregnant women were from residual samples prior to
discarding, in accordance with Royal College Pathologists guidelines and the UCLH Clinical
Governance for assay development and GOSH and ICH regulations. All serum or plasma samples
were heat-treated at 56oC for 30 min prior to testing.
Viral infection RT-qPCR diagnosis
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids were detected at Health Services Laboratories, London, UK, by an RT-qPCR
method as recently described49. HCoV nucleic acids were detected by RT-qPCR, as part of a
diagnostic panel for respiratory viruses, run by Health Services Laboratories (HSL), London, UK.
Cell lines and virus
HEK293T cells were obtained from the Cell Services facility at The Francis Crick Institute, verified as
mycoplasma-free and validated by DNA fingerprinting. Vero- E6 cells were from the National
Institute for Biological Standards and Control, UK. HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 were
generated by transfection, using GeneJuice (EMD Millipore), with a plasmid containing the complete
human ACE2 transcript variant 1 cDNA sequence (NM_001371415.1) cloned into the mammalian
expression vector pcDNA3.1-C’ FLAG by Genscript. Cells were grown in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s
Medium (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Lglutamine (2 mmol/L, Thermo Fisher Scientific), penicillin (100 U/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and
streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV19/England/02/2020 was obtained from the Respiratory Virus Unit, Public Health England, UK,
(GISAID EpiCovTM accession EPI_ISL_407073) and propagated in Vero E6 cells.
Flow cytometry
HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression vector (pcDNA3) carrying a codon-optimised
gene encoding the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S (UniProt ID: P0DTC2) (kindly provided by Massimo
Pizzato, University of Trento, Italy), using GeneJuice (EMD Millipore). Similarly, HEK293T cells were
transfected with expression vectors (pCMV3) expressing HCoV-229E S (UniProt ID: APT69883.1),
HCoV-NL63 S (UniProt ID: APF29071.1), HCoV-OC43 S (UniProt ID: AVR40344.1) or HCoV-HKU1 S
(UniProt ID: Q0ZME7.1) (all from SinoBiological). Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinised
and transferred into V-bottom 96-well plates (20,000 cells/well). Cells were incubated with sera
(diluted 1:50 in PBS) for 30 min, washed with FACS buffer (PBS, 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05%
sodium azide), and stained with BV421 anti-IgG (Biolegend), APC anti-IgM (Biolegend) and PE antiIgA (Miltenyi Biotech) for 30 min (all antibodies diluted 1:200 in FACS buffer). Cells were washed
with FACS buffer and fixed for 20 min in CellFIX buffer (BD Bioscience). Samples were run on a Ze5
(Bio-Rad) running Bio-Rad Everest software v2.4 or an LSR Fortessa with a high-throughput sampler
(BD Biosciences) running BD FACSDiva software v8.0, and analysed using FlowJo v10 (Tree Star Inc.)

analysis software. Transfection efficiencies were determined by staining with a fixed concentration
of the S1-reactive CR3022 antibody (100 ng/ml) (Absolute Antibodies) and control convalescent sera
(1:50 dilution), followed by BV421 anti-IgG antibody. Staining with convalescent sera, detecting
epitopes over the entire S ectodomain, was consistently higher than staining with CR3022, detecting
only the S1 epitope, and was taken as the maximum transfection efficiency. This varied between
68% and 95% between experiments.
Recombinant protein production
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 constructs, spanning SARS-CoV-2 S (UniProt ID: P0DTC2) residues 319541 (RVQPT…KCVNF) and 1-530 (MFVFL…GPKKS), respectively, were produced with C-terminal twin
Strep tags. To this end, the corresponding codon-optimised DNA fragments were cloned into
mammalian expression vector pQ-3C-2xStrep50. A signal peptide from immunoglobulin kappa gene
product (METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGD) was used to direct secretion of the RBD construct. Stabilised
ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (residues 1-1208) with inactivated furin cleavage site
(RRAR, residues 682-685 mutated to GSAS) and a double proline substitution (K986P/V987P)51,52 was
produced with a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization domain and a hexahistidine (His6) tag from the
pcDNA3 vector. Expi293F cells growing at 37oC in 5% CO2 atmosphere in shake flasks in FreeStyle 293
medium were transfected with the corresponding plasmids using ExpiFectamine reagent (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Conditioned medium containing secreted proteins was harvested twice, 3-4 and 68 days post-transfection. Twin Strep- and His6- tagged proteins were captured on Streptactin XT (IBA
LifeSciences) or Talon (Takara) affinity resin, respectively, and purified to homogeneity by size
exclusion chromatography through Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Full-length SARS CoV2 N gene product was produced with an N-terminal His6
tag from pOPTH-1124 plasmid (kindly provided by Jakub Luptak and Leo James, Laboratory for
Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). Escherichia coli C43(DE3) cells (Lucigen) transformed with
pOPTH-1124 were grown in terrific broth medium, and expression was induced by addition of 1 mM
Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 37oC. Bacteria, harvested 4 h post-induction, were
disrupted by sonication in core buffer (1M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0)
supplemented with BaseMuncher nuclease (Expedion; 1 ml per 40 ml cell suspension) and Complete
EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix (Roche). The extract was precleared by centrifugation, and His6tagged protein was captured on NiNTA agarose (Qiagen). Following extensive washes with core
buffer supplemented with 20 mM imidazole, the protein was eluted with 500 mM imidazole. SARS
CoV-2 N, was further purified by cation exchange and heparin affinity chromatography prior
polishing by gel filtration through a Superdex 200 16/40 column (GE Healthcare), which was
operated in 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0. Purified SARS CoV2 antigens, concentrated
to 1-5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration using appropriate VivaSpin devices (Sartorius), were snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen in small aliquots and stored at -80oC.
ELISA
96-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight at 4oC with purified
protein in PBS (3 µg/ml per well in 50 µL) and blocked for 1 hr in blocking buffer (PBS, 5% milk, 0.05%
Tween 20, 0.01% sodium azide). Sera was diluted in blocking buffer (1:50) and 50 µL added to the
plate then incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing 4 times with PBS-T (PBS, 0.05%
Tween 20), plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG
(1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hr. Plates were developed by adding 50 µL of alkaline
phosphatase substrate (Sigma Aldrich) for 15-30 min after 6 washes with PBS-T. Optical densities
were measured at 405 nm on a microplate reader (Tecan). CR3022 (Absolute Antibodies) was used
as a positive control for ELISAs coated with S, S1, and RBD. For ELISAs with synthetic peptides, 96well Nunc Immobilizer Amino Plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for coating overnight at
4oC with peptides (10 µg/ml per well in 50 µL)

Lentiviral particle production and neutralisation
Lentiviral particles pseudotyped with either SARS-CoV-2 S or Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein
(VSVg) were produced by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding either of these
glycoproteins together with a plasmid encoding the SIVmac Gag-Pol polyprotein and a plasmid
expressing an HIV-2 backbone with a GFP encoding gene, using GeneJuice (EMD Millipore). Viruscontaining supernatants were collected 48 hr post-transfection and stored at -80oC until further use.
For neutralisation assays, lentiviral pseudotypes were incubated with serial dilutions of patient sera
at 37oC for 30 minutes and were subsequently added to HEK293T cells seeded in 96-well plates
(3,000 cells/well). Polybrene (4 ug/mL, Sigma Aldrich) was also added to the cells and plates were
spun at 1,200 rpm for 45 min. The percentage of transduced (GFP+) cells was assessed by flow
cytometry 72 hours later. The inverse serum dilution leading to 50% reduction of GFP+ cells was
taken as the neutralising titre.
SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralisation test
Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells were incubated with 10-20 plaque-forming units (PFU) of
SARS-CoV-2 strain hCoV-19/England/2/2020 and two-fold serial dilutions of human sera (previously
heat-treated at 56C for 30 min) starting at 1:40 dilution, for 3 hours at 37C, 5% CO2, in triplicate
per condition. The inoculum was then removed and cells were overlaid with virus growth medium
containing avicel at a final concentration of 1.2%. Cells were incubated at 37C, 5% CO2. At 24 hours
post-infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with 0.2% Triton-X100/PBS and virus plaques were visualised by immunostaining, as described previously for the
neutralisation of influenza viruses53, except using a rabbit polyclonal anti-NSP8 antibody and antirabbit-HRP conjugate and detected by action of HRP on a tetra methyl benzidine (TMB) based
substrate. Virus plaques were quantified and IC50 for sera was calculated using LabView software as
described previously53.
Peptide arrays
Peptide arrays were synthesised on an Intavis ResPepSL Automated Peptide Synthesiser (Intavis
Bioanalytical Instruments, Germany) on a cellulose membrane by cycles of N(a)-Fmoc amino acids
coupling via activation of carboxylic acid groups with diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) in the presence
of Ethyl cyano(hydroxyimino)acetate (Oxyma pure) followed by removal of the temporary α-amino
protecting group by piperidine treatment. Subsequent to chain assembly, side chain protection
groups were removed by treatment of membranes with a deprotection cocktail (20 mls 95%
trifluoroacetic acid, 3% triisopropylsilane 2% water 4 hours at room temperature) then washing (4 ×
DCM, 4 × EtOH 2 × H20, 1 × EtOH) prior to being air dried. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in
blocking buffer (PBS, 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% sodium azide), then stained with pooled sera
(1:100 in blocking buffer) for 2 hours at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 times in
PBS-T, then stained with IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Human IgG (Licor; 1:15,000 in blocking buffer) for 1
hour at room temperature in the dark. Membranes were washed 3 times in PBS-T and once in PBS
before imaging on an Odyssey CLx Infrared scanner (Licor). Scanned images were analysed in Image
Studio v5.2 (Licor).
Individual peptide synthesis
Individual peptides were synthesised on an Intavis ResPepSLi Automated Peptide Synthesiser (Intavis
Bioanalytical Instruments, Germany) on Rink amide resin (0.26 mmole/g, 0.1 mmol) using N(a)-Fmoc
amino acids and HATU as the coupling reagent. Following amino acid chain assembly, peptides were
cleaved from the resin by addition to cleavage cocktail (10 ml, 92.5% TFA, 2.5% H2O, 2.5% EDT, 2.5%

Extended data Fig. 4. Sequential HCoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and clinical observations in an individual
case. A bone marrow transplant recipient, with graft versus host disease (GvHD) and associated
immunosuppression tested positive by RT‐qPCR for HCoV in February 2020. The patient’s sera did not contain
SARS‐CoV‐2 S‐binding antibodies at that time. The patient later acquired likely nosocomial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection
with first RT‐qPCR confirmation in March 2020. The patient’s sera remained negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 S‐binding
antibodies at the second sampling time‐point, but exhibited an only IgG+ profile three weeks later (April 2020).
The patient experienced mild COVID‐19 symptoms that did not require hospitalisation, but remained positive
for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, with RT‐qPCR confirmation in late April 2020. None of the serial serum samples had
significant neutralising activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudotypes.
