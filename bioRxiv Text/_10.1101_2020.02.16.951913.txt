Abstract
The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China,
has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be
expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low,
especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to
facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene
expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell coexpression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins.
Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung
AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs,
stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate
co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human
tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and
DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential
receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell
crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found
that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and
phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense
and immune pathogenesis.

Introduction
In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection emerged in Wuhan. Over
30 thousand of people are infected with 2019-nCoV until February 8, showing that 2019-nCoV
is highly contagious. Coronavirus is a type of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus [1] Before
the emergence of 2019-nCoV, there are 6 known human coronaviruses, including the Middle
East respiratory syndrom coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV infection include acute
respiratory distress syndrome (~29%), acute cardiac injury (~12%) or acute kidney injury
(~7%)[2], implying that 2019-nCoV may infect various human tissues.
Viruses bind to host receptors on target cell surface to establish infection. Membrane
proteins mediated membrane fusion allowed the entry of enveloped viruses[3]. As recently
reported, both nCoV and SARS-CoV could use ACE2 protein to gain entry into the cells[4].
Since the outbreak, many data analysis have showed a wide distribution of ACE2 across human
tissues, including lung[5], liver[6], stomach[7], ileum[7], colon[7] and kidney[8], indicating
that 2019-nCoV may infect multiple organs. However, these data showed that AT2 cell (the
main target cell of 2019-nCoV) in the lung actually expressed rather low levels of ACE2[8].
Hence, the nCoVs may depends on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to
facilitate its infection. It is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their
host factors[9]. For example, Hoffmann et al. recently showed that 2019-nCoV-S uses ACE2
for entry and depends on the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming[10], showing that 2019nCoV infections also require multiple factors. Understanding the receptors usage by the viruses
could facilitate the development of intervention strategies. Therefore, identifying the potential
co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for 2019-nCoV is of great significance.
For this purpose, we collected single cell gene expression matrices from 13 relatively
normal human tissues, consisting of lung[11], liver[12], ileum[13], rectum[13], blood[14], bone
marrow[15], skin[16], spleen[17], esophagus[17], colon[18], eye[19], stomach[20] and
kidney[21] from published literatures. We analyzed the single cell co-expression profiles of 51
known ssRNA viral receptors and 400 membrane proteins, including ACE2, in the identified
119 cell types across the 13 human tissues. Consistent with other recent studies, ACE2 was
found to be present in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon. Using hierarchy clustering

and correlation calculation, we found that ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP showed co-expression
pattern with ACE2 across the 13 human tissues, suggesting that they may act as potential coreceptors for 2019-nCoV, and all human CoVs should have similar targets across different
human tissues..After conducting “CellPhoneDB”, we further reveal that macrophages
frequently crosstalks with CoVs-target cells, in multiple tissues.

Materials and Methods
Data collection
The gene raw counts or normalized gene expression matrix for each single cell were
downloaded from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or Human Cell Atlas
(https://www.humancellatlas.org) database (Table S1). In total, we collected single cell gene
expression data of 13 tissues, including liver, lung, colon, ileum, rectum, blood, spleen, bone
marrow, eye, skin, stomach, oesophagus and kidney. The data source and the sample

The high-quality virus-host receptor interactions were downloaded from Viral Receptor
database (http://www.computationalbiology.cn:5000/viralReceptor), which curated 152 pairs
of mammalian virus-host receptor interactions and 51 virus receptors from 9 mammal species.
They curated five types of virus, consisting of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus, doublestranded (dsDNA) virus, single-stranded (ssRNA) virus, double-stranded (dsRNA) virus and

retro-transcribing virus. We only focus on ssRNA virus in this study. The membrane proteins
were extracted from Membranome database (https://membranome.org).
Data processing, quality control and normalization
The raw count matrix (UMI counts per gene per cell) was processed by Seurat[22]. Cells
with less than 100 expressed genes (UMI count > 0) and higher than 25% mitochondrial
genome transcript were removed. Genes expressed in less than three cells were removed. Then,
we normalized the gene expression data using “NormalizeData” function with default settings.
The sources of cell-cell variation driven by batch were regressed out using the number of
detected UMI and mitochondrial gene expression, which was implemented by ‘‘ScaleData’’
function. The corrected expression matrix was used for cell clustering and dimensional
reduction.
Cell clustering, dimensional reduction and visualization
The cell clustering and dimensional reduction were performed by Seurat package. Before
that, we choose 2000 highly variable genes (HVGs) from the corrected expression matrix and
then centered and scaled them. It was implemented by ‘‘FindVariableGenes’’ function in the
Seurat package. We then performed principle component analysis (PCA) on the HVGs using
‘‘RunPCA’’ function. To remove the signal-to-noise ratio, we select a number of significant
principal components by implementing “JackStraw” function, which was implemented by
permutation test. Specifically, we firstly identified 50 principal components as a result and then
selected the significant components according to the p-values produced by “ScoreJackStraw”
function for further analysis. The batch effects were removed by harmony package[23].
Cells were then clustered utilizing the ‘‘FindClusters’’ function through embedding cells into
a graph structure in PCA space. We set the parameter resolution as 0.8 to identify only major
cell types, e.g. T cells, B cells or macrophages. The clustered cells were then projected onto a
two-dimensional space using “RunUMAP” function. The clustering results were visualized by
“DimPlot” function.
Cell type identification
To annotate cell clusters, we firstly identified the differentially expressed genes on each
cluster by performing “FindMarkers” function. The cell clusters were then annotated according
to curated known cell markers (Figure S1). The cell clusters consistently expressed the same

Cell-cell interaction analysis
We conducted cell-cell interaction analysis utilizing cellphonedb function curated by
CellPhoneDB database[24]. The significant cell-cell interactions were selected with p-value <
0.01.

Results
Cell type identification in 13 human tissues
We collected the single cell RNA sequencing data (raw count gene expression matrix or
normalized gene expression matrix) from published literatures, which have been deposited in
public database, e.g. GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or Human Cell Atlas
(https://www.humancellatlas.org). Totally, we curated single cell gene expression matrices of
13 human tissues, including lung[11], liver[12], ileum[13], rectum[13], blood[14], bone
marrow[15], skin[16], spleen[17], esophagus[17], colon[18], eye[19], stomach[20] and
kidney[21] (Table S1). The raw count matrix was normalized and scaled by Seurat package[22]
(Materials and Methods). For each tissue, we performed cell clustering and dimension
reduction on gene expression matrix using Seurat package. After filtering out low quality cells,
we obtained 8443, 43474, 4248, 5282, 3279, 30693, 97695, 17131,4335, 11552, 4871, 8880,
20197 cells from liver, lung, colon, ileum, rectum, blood, spleen, bone marrow, eye, skin,
stomach, esophagus and kidney, respectively (Table S1). The cell clusters were then annotated
using canonical markers searched from the published articles (Figure S1). We finally annotated
119 cell types from 13 human tissues.
Lung belongs to respiratory system, in which 13 cell types were identified (Figure S2). These
cell types consist of macrophages, Alveolar Type 2 cells (AT2), monocytes, NK&T cells,
ciliated cells, basal cells, mast cells, neutrophils, Alveolar Type 1 cells (AT1), fibroblasts,
endothelial cells, lymphatic cells and B cells. Among them, ~31% cells are alveolar cells (AT2
and AT1) and ~54% cells are immune cells (B cells, T cells and Myeloid cells).
Ileum, rectum, esophagus, colon, and stomach are part of digestive system. In esophagus, 7
cell types were identified (Figure S2). Keratinocytes show the highest percentage (~66%) of

total cells. The remaining cells are B cells, epithelial basal cells, glands cells, stroma cells, T
cells and vessel cells. We detected 11 cell types in stomach (Figure S2), in which epithelial
cells (~29%) and pit mucous cell (PMCs) (~23%) constitute the largest group. Besides, B cells,
endothelial cells (ECs), enteroendocrine cells, fibroblasts, antral basal gland mucous cell
(GMCs), macrophages, neck-like cells, proliferative cell (PCs) and T cells were identified in
stomach. In ileum (Figure S2), 7 cell types, including enterocytes (ECs), enteroendocrine cells
(EECs), goblet cells (Gs), Paneth cells (PCs), progenitor cells (PROs), stem cells (SCs),
transient amplifying (TAs), were annotated. Enterocytes are the largest cell population (~64%)
in ileum. Rectum share cell types with ileum. Whereas, the largest cell population in rectum is
progenitor cells (~37%). A total of 9 cell types was detected in colon (Figure S2). The
percentage of colonocytes (colonocytes and crypt top colonocytes) is 53%, which constitute the
largest cell population in colon. BEST4+ cells, enteroendocrine cells (EECs), goblet cells,
innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, T cells and undifferentiated cells were also identified.
Liver, spleen and skin play vital roles in immune systems. Immune cells (~45%) and
hepatocyte (~42%) account for the vast majority of cells in liver (Figure S2). Cholangiocytes,
endothelial cells and erthyroid cells were also detected. Spleen is the immune organs in human
body, in which all the cells are immune cells (Figure S2). Spleen composed of a large
proportion of T cells (~33%) and B cells (~43%). Other immune cells, including CD34
progenitor cells, cDCs, dividing cells, innate lymphoid cells, macrophages, monocytes,
neutrophils, NK cells and pDCs, also make up the spleen cell populations. Skin is a physical
barrier against the external environment. We identified a total of 7 cell populations in skin
(Figure S2), in which pericytes (~31%) and fibroblasts (~21%) are the most enriched
populations. The immune cells, comprising T cells and myeloid cells were also identified. In
addition, basal cells, endothelium cells, and suprabasal keratinocyte constitute the skin cell
populations.
The kidneys are the part of urinary system that makes urine. Most of the cells in kidney are
proximal tubule cells (Proximal Ts) (~82%) (Figure S2). Besides, we also annotated immune
cells (~8%), collecting duct intercalated cells (Collecting DIs), collecting duct principal cells
(Collecting DPs), distal tubule cells (Distal Ts) and glomerular parietal epithelial cells
(Glomerular PEs) in kidney.

The eyes are sensory organs in nervous system. Ten cell types were identified in eyes (Figure
S2). Fibroblasts and immune cells composed of ~31% and ~25% of total cells, respectively.
Eyes also contain endothelial cells, melanocytes, pericytes, retinal pigment epithelium (RPEs)
and Schwann cells.
Bone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis. We identified large number of NK/NKT
cells (~44%) and erythrocytes (~28%) cells in bone marrow (Figure S2). B cells, hematopoietic
stem cells, MK progenitors, monocytes, neutrophils and DCs were also detected in bone
marrow.
Blood is circulated around various tissues. Monocytes (~32%) and T cells (~55%) make up
the largest proportion of blood cells (Figure S2). In addition, we also identified B cells, cDCs,
macrophages, NK cells, pDCs and platelets in blood.
These 13 tissues play different roles in virus infection and proliferation. For the viral life
cycle, the viruses firstly bind the host receptors on the cell surface. Hence, the distribution of
viral receptors in different cell types of diverse tissues can reveal the viral tropism and potential
transmission routes. We therefore explored the expression spectrum of host receptors in the
following section.

Expression atlas of ACE2, ssRNA viral receptors and other membrane proteins in 13
human tissues
We firstly analyzed the expression pattern of ACE2 across 13 tissues (Figure 1). Our results
reveal that ACE2 expresses in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus
keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules,
consistent with the recent reports[5-8]. However, ACE2 expression levels are rather low in lung
AT2 (4.7-fold lower than the average expression level of all ACE2 expressing cell types). We
assume that the presence of co-receptors or other auxiliary membrane proteins in AT2 cells may
facilitate the binding and entry of the nCoV.
We then analyzed the co-expression features of the human ssRNA viral receptors and
membrane proteins. We collected a total of 152 pairs of virus-host receptor interaction from
Viral Receptor database[9] (http://www.computationalbiology.cn:5000/viralReceptor) which
curated a number of validated viral receptors. These virus-host receptor interactions contain 51

host receptors in 9 hosts and 96 viruses (Table S2). Furthermore, 400 membrane proteins were
extracted from Membranome database[25] (https://membranome.org). Totally 451 genes were
curated, 95.7% (432/451) of which express in at least one of the 13 tissues. We examined the
expression spectrum of the 432 genes across the 119 cell types.
To elaborate the potential relationship between ACE2 and other membrane proteins or viral
receptors, we calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between each two genes in the
curated reservoir. The findings show that 94 genes are significantly correlated with ACE2
(P<0.01) in a manner of gene expression. Of note, ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are the top three
genes correlated with ACE2 (R>0.8) (Figure 2). ANPEP, alanyl aminopeptidase, is a host
receptor targeted by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, human coronavirus 229E, feline
coronavirus, canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and infectious bronchitis
virus. These viruses all belong to Coronaviridae. Besides skin, ANPEP also mainly expresses
in colon, ileum, rectum, kidney and liver (Figure S3 & Figure S4), demonstrating that receptor
of coronavirus may have similar expression profiles in human body. ENPEP, Glutamyl
Aminopeptidase, belongs to the peptidase M1 family which is the mammalian type II integral
membrane zinc-containing endopeptidases. ENPEP regulates blood pressure regulation and
blood vessel formation through the catabolic pathway of the renin-angiotensin system[26]. The
relationship between ENPEP and viral infection is unknown. DPP4, the receptor of MERS-CoV,
shows expression similarity with ACE2, except that DPP4 expresses in some T cells of all the
observed tissues (Figure S3 & Figure S4). All of the three genes encode peptidase, which are
uniquely adopted by coronavirus as their receptors [27]. This result raised the possibility that
ENPEP may be another yet unknown receptor for coronavirus. To further consolidate the
findings, we calculated the Euclidean distance between all the curated proteins and constructed
their hierarchy relationships across the 119 cell types. DPP4 was the first gene clustered with
ACE2.
Together, our data demonstrates that the coronavirus receptors tend to share co-expression
pattern across different tissues, consistent with the fact that CoVs infect similar types of cells
and CoV-infected patients share similar clinical symptoms.

Macrophages are frequently interacted with the ACE2-expressing cells

Virus-infected cells can recruit and modulate immune cells through secreting chemokines or
other cytokines. We sought to identify potential immune cells crosstalking with CoVs-targeted
cells. The cell-cell interaction analysis was conducted by CellPhoneDB[24]. The interactions
with p-value < 0.01 were adopted to construct the interaction relationship between cell types in
each tissue.
Using the cell type expressing ACE2 as ligand-secreting cells, we calculated the total number
of interactions with each receptor-secreting cell type. As a result, we found that macrophages
showed highest active interaction with ACE2-expressing cells in liver, lung and stomach
(Figure 3A) sharing a CD74-MIF signaling pairs (Figure 3B). CD74 is expressed on the cell
surface of antigen-presenting cells and act as a receptor for the cytokine in immune cells. MIF,
macrophage migration inhibitory factor, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine participating in
inflammatory and immune responses. Besides, PROs, SCs and TAs show high activity
responding to the ACE2-expressing cells in ileum and rectum. In colon, ILCs were found
frequently interacted with the ACE2-expressing cells. Glomerular parietal epithelial cells and
epithelial basal cells in kidney and esophagus also correlated with the cells transcribing ACE2
at very high frequency.
We conclude that the nCoV-targeted cells (ACE2-expressing), can interact with various cell
types in different tissues, especially macrophages in lung, liver and stomach. Macrophages may
be recruited by nCoV-targeted cells through CD74-MIF interaction and other signaling
pathways during infection, play defensive and destructive functions.

Discussion
The coronaviruses are a large family of ssRNA viruses causing respiratory diseases in
humans. Most of the coronaviruses are associated with mild clinical symptoms, except SARSCoV and MERS-CoV, showing fatality rate of 9.6% and 34%, respectively[28, 29]. In late
December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A
total of 37,251 2019-nCoV infected cases involving across different regions of China have been
confirmed until February 9, 2020, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is also highly infectious. The
phylogenic tree constructed from full-genome sequences indicated that 2019-nCoV is a distinct

clade from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV[4].
The most common symptoms of patients infected with 2019-nCoV are fever and cough[30].
However, a proportion of patients showing multi-organ damage and dysfunction was also
observed, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (17%), acute respiratory injury (8%)
and acute renal injury (3%). It is also increasingly recognized that 2019-nCoV could be
transmitted via multiple routes.
The viruses target host cells via binding host receptors before engaging the infection cycle.
ACE2 was proved to be the cell receptor of 2019-nCoV, the same receptor as SARS-CoV[5,
10]. The expression profiles of ACE2 across different cell types of different organs will reveal
clues of the virus transmission routes and its potential pathogenesis. In previous studies, ACE2
was found to express in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, absorptive
enterocytes from ileum and colon, alveolar type II cells in lung, liver cholangiocyte and kidney
proximal tubules [5-7]. These findings suggested that the clinical symptoms of hepatic failure,
respiratory injury, acute kidney injury or diarrhoea may be associated with the pervasive ACE2
expressing cells in these tissues. However, we and others found that ACE2 is lowly expressed,
especially in the lung (the main target organ of nCoVs), raising the possible existence of coreceptors facilitating nCoV infection. It is well recognized that ssRNA viruses tend to have
multiple receptors[9]. For example, ACE2, CD209 (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3-Grabbing
Non-Integrin 1), CLEC4G (C-type lectin domain family 4 member G) and CLEC4M (C-type
lectin domain family 4 member M) are receptors of SARS-CoV[31-34]. In addition, other
membrane proteins may also assist virus entry[3]. Since the viral receptor and co-receptors
should be co-expressed on the same cell types, we analyzed single cell co-expression patterns
covering 400 membrane proteins and 51 known viral receptors in this study. After calculating
their gene expression similarity, we found ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are top three genes
correlated with ACE4 (R>0.8). Interestingly, both ANPEP and DPP4 are viral receptors of
human coronaviruses [35], while ENPEP is also a peptidase, despite that its involvement in
virus infection is unclear. For mysterious reasons, human coronaviruses use peptidases as their
receptors[27]. Now, we showed co-expression profiles of these molecules, indicating that
different human CoVs actually target the similar cell types across different human tissues. It
also explains why,patients infected with different human CoVs manifest similar clinical

symptoms. We propose that further experimental validations should be performed to explore
the role of these peptidase in 2019-nCoV and other CoVs infection.
Host immune response plays crucial roles in the fight against viruses. Generally, virally
infected cells release interferons to suppress viral activities [36-38]. The interferons also act on
warning the neighboring cells of virus attack. It can signify the the nearby cells to upregulate
MHC class I molecules to notify the CD8+ T cells to identify and eliminate the viral infection[39,
40]. Understand the potential cell-cell communication mechanisms across different tissues is
important for understanding immune reactions. In this study, we investigated the cells
communicated with CoVs-targets (ACE2-expressing cells) in each tissue. Our results illustrate
that macrophages frequently crosstalk with the ACE2-expressing cells, in lung, liver and
stomach etc. This suggests that macrophages play the sentinel role during human CoVs
infection. Future studies should investigate these signaling pairs in the setting of CoVs infection
in patients and animal models.

ECs, enterocytes, EECs, enteroendocrine cells; Gs, goblet cells; PROs, progenitor cells; SCs,
stem cells; TAs, transient amplifying; EECs, enteroendocrine cells; RPEs, retinal pigment
epithelium). None of the ACE2 transcripts was found in bone marrow and blood.
Figure 2 Pearson correlation coefficients between the curated ssRNA viral receptors and
membrane proteins. The warm colors mean positive correlation, and the cold colors mean
negative correlation. The stars represent the correlation coefficients greater than 0.8. ANPEP,
ENPEP and DPP4 show highest correlation with ACE2.
Figure 3 Cell-cell interactions between cell types in 8 tissues expressing ACE2. (A) The
cell-cell interaction analysis in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, rectum, colon, esophagus and
kidney was conducted by CellPhoneDB. Cell types are nodes and interactions are edges. Red
nodes indicate major cell types expressing ACE2 in each tissue. Size of cell type is proportional
to the total number of interactions with the red nodes. (B) The cytokines that connected ACE2expressing cells and the macrophages. Macrophages expression receptors and ACE2expressing cells express ligands.

Figure S1 Cell type identification in 13 human tissues. The cell types were annotated by
curated known cell markers searched from their corresponding publications (see Table S1 and
materials and methods).
Figure S2 Cell type proportion for each human tissue. Proportion of each cell type was
calculated for each tissue.
Figure S3 Heatmap of ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 expression in 13 human tissues. We
depicted single cell expression maps of ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 in lung, liver, stomach,
ileum, rectum, colon, blood, bone marrow, spleen, esophagus, kidney, skin and eye, totally
including 119 cell types. The expression was were log scaled.
