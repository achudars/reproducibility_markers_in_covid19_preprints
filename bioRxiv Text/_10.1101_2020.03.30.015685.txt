Abstract

31

In depth evolutionary and structural analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome

32

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from bats, pangolins, and humans are necessary

33

to assess the role of natural selection and recombination in the emergence of the current

34

pandemic strain. The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein unique features have been

35

associated with efficient viral spread in the human population. Phylogeny-based and

36

genetic algorithm methods clearly show that recombination events between viral

37

progenitors infecting animal hosts led to a mosaic structure in the S gene. We identified

38

recombination coldspots in the S glycoprotein and strong purifying selection. Moreover,

39

although there is little evidence of diversifying positive selection during host-switching,

40

structural analysis suggests that some of the residues emerged along the ancestral

41

lineage of current pandemic strains may contribute to enhanced ability to infect human

42

cells. Interestingly, recombination did not affect the long-range covariant movements of

43

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation but, on the contrary,

44

could contribute to the observed overall viral efficiency. Our dynamic simulations

45

revealed that the movements between the host cell receptor binding domain (RBD) and

46

the novel furin-like cleavage site are correlated. We identified threonine 333 (under

47

purifying selection), at the beginning of the RBD, as the hinge of the opening/closing

48

mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer functional to hACE2 binding.

49

Our findings support a scenario where ancestral recombination and fixation of amino

50

acid residues in the RBD of the S glycoprotein generated a virus with unique features,

51

capable of extremely efficient infection of the human host.

Introduction

54

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single strand, positive sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA)

55

viruses, with diverse tropism, able to infect respiratory, enteric, and hepatic tissues of

56

several species (Fehr and Perlman 2015). Within the CoVs family, Beta CoVs have

57

repeatedly proven the ability to shift from their natural reservoir and adapt to human

58

hosts (Su, et al. 2016). Several CoVs, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1,

59

and HcoV-NL63, are mostly associated with mild symptoms (Bucknall, et al. 1972; Woo,

60

et al. 2005). Few CoVs caused limited outbreaks of more severe illness, such as the

61

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome

62

(MERS) (Leung, et al. 2004; Zaki, et al. 2012), and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2

63

(Wu, et al. 2020)). First reported in China in December 2019, CoV disease 2019

64

(COVID-19) quickly turned into a pandemic, with nearly 7,000,000 cases and hundreds

65

of thousands of deaths reported worldwide as of June 2020 (Kamel Boulos and

66

Geraghty 2020). An early study hypothesized SARS-CoV-2 emergence from snakes (Ji,

67

et al. 2020), but further phylogenetic analyses traced its origins to CoVs circulating in bat

68

(Zhou, Chen, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020) and pangolin (Xiao, et al. 2020).

69

Contacts between different animal species prior to human exposure might facilitate host

70

shift, possibly through adaptation to intermediate hosts, such as camels in the case of

71

MERS-CoV (Dudas and Rambaut 2016; Su, et al. 2016) or civets or pigs in the case of

72

SARS-CoV-1 (Wang and Eaton 2007).

73

While most RNA viruses use low-fidelity RNA polymerases, CoV genomes encode a

74

proofreading and mismatch correction pathway, resulting in less error prone replication

75

and translating into lower mutation rates (Ferron, et al. 2018; Li, Wang, et al. 2020). This

76

feature might ultimately limit the mutagenic variability of the virus, and recombination

77

might prove a prominent driving factor in the evolution and expansion of species range

78

and cellular tropism. Recombination can take place whenever a single host is infected

79

with multiple, genetically different, strains, and is an important factor driving viral

80

diversity (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011; Mavian, et al. 2017). Recombination has

81

been reported as a possible mechanism favoring cross-species transmission of CoVs

82

and increasing their adaptability to new host (Graham and Baric 2010; Su, et al. 2016).

83

There is copious evidence of such events having occurred in the ancestral history of

84

both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 (Lau, et al. 2015; Dudas and Rambaut 2016;

85

Anthony, et al. 2017) and CoVs in general (Lai, et al. 1985; Decaro, et al. 2009; Terada,

86

et al. 2014; Tian, et al. 2014), but evidence regarding the recombinant origin of SARS-

87

CoV-2 is not conclusive (Ji, et al. 2020; Liu, et al. 2020; Paraskevis, et al. 2020; Zhou,

88

Chen, et al. 2020). Paraskevis et al., who made the case for a non-recombinant origin of

89

the virus, used a limited dataset, which did not include pangolin CoVs (Paraskevis, et al.

90

2020). Based on genetic similarity plots, Ji et al. and Liu et al. hypothesized a possible

91

recombination event with an undetermined viral isolate in the ancestry of SARS-CoV-2

92

(Ji, et al. 2020; Liu, et al. 2020). A very recent publication by Li et al. (Li, Giorgi,

93

Marichannegowda, et al. 2020) also hypothesized a recombination event between bat

94

and pangolin viruses as progenitor of the human CoV-2. While recent studies have used

95

simple recombination detection algorithms, leading to various results that may depend

96

on the assumptions of the specific algorithm and the data set of choice (Boni, et al.

97

2020; Li, Giorgi, Marichann, et al. 2020; Wong, et al. 2020), we performed an in-depth

98

analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and closely related SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-like CoVs lineages

99

using seven different methods, including phylogeny-based and genetic algorithms (see

100

Methods section) (Kosakovsky Pond, et al. 2006; Martin, et al. 2015), with the purpose

101

of achieving higher sensitivity (Jia, et al. 2018). Our analysis in fact revealed that the

102

recombination pattern of the S glycoprotein is far more complex than previously thought.

103

Because of the lack of sensitive recombination methods (Li, Giorgi, Marichannegowda,

104

et al. 2020) and the comparison with only close relative of SARS-CoV-2, i.e. bat-SARS-

105

CoV-2 RaTG13 and RmYN02 (Zhou, Chen, et al. 2020), it is possible that the likely

106

mosaic nature of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was masked.

107

The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer is responsible for the crucial step of fusion of the

108

viral membrane with the host cell membrane (Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001; Simmons,

109

et al. 2013). Complex structural rearrangements follow the interaction of RBD (that must

110

be in an exposed state referred as “up” conformation) with the peptidase domain (PD) of

111

hACE2 (Wrapp, et al. 2020; Yan, et al. 2020). Conversely, the “down” conformation

112

corresponds to the receptor-inaccessible state. The RBD up/down rotation is made

113

possible by a hinge region at the N-term of RBD (Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020) and our

114

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations identified threonine 333 as the hinge residue. A

115

two-step sequential protease cleavage model has been proposed for activation of CoV S

116

proteins, as shown for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Belouzard, et al. 2009; Millet and

117

Whittaker 2014), priming cleavage at the S1/S2 domain junction (Li 2016; Gui, et al.

118

2017), allowing the projection of the fusion peptide toward the target cell membrane

119

(Bosch, et al. 2008) and activating cleavage on S2’ site (Ou, et al. 2020).

120

An important peculiarity of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other CoVs is the presence of a

121

furin-like cleavage sequence (Madu, et al. 2009; Lai, et al. 2017). Exposure of this

122

cleavage site to the soluble furin protease is an important step in the viral infection

123

(Wrapp, et al. 2020), and explain, at least in part, the enhanced infectivity and

124

pathogenicity of the virus (Bosch, et al. 2003).

On the origin of SARS-CoV-2 lineage: recombination in bat and pangolin

132

available full genome sequences (bat and pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 isolates, bat-

133

SL-CoVs, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-like isolates) using a neighbor network (NNet) based

134

algorithm (Bryant and Moulton 2004). Unlike standard phylogenetic inference methods,

135

network approaches can naturally represent the presence of conflicting phylogenetic

136

signal in the data (which is a hallmark of recombination), as we found in the analysis of

137

the coronavirus genomes (Figure 1a). Conflicting phylogenetic signal in the data,

138

however, is not sufficient to infer recombination (Huson and Bryant 2006). To test

139

whether the NNet topology is due to recombination we used the pairwise homoplasy

140

index (PHI) test (Bruen, et al. 2006), and the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple

141

testing (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). Recombination signal (q << 10-6) was detected

142

among all included isolates (Figure 1a). SARS-CoV-1 and human SARS-CoV-2

143

monophyletic clades do not display net-like topology, and recombination signal of a sub-

144

dataset including only these lineages was not significant (q = 0.14). SARS-like and bat-

145

SL-CoVs, on the other hand, show a high degree of conflicting phylogenetic signals

146

reflected by intricate networks (Figure 1a). SARS-like isolates are ancestors of SARS-

147

CoV-1 isolates, bat-SL-CoVs stand as intermediate link between SARS-CoV-1 and

148

SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Bat-SARS-CoV-2 RaTG13 (NCBI accession no. MN996532;

149

GISAID id EPI_ISL_402131, isolated from bat in 2013 in China) and pangolin-SARS-

150

CoV-2 isolates (EPI_ISL_410538-43 isolates denoted with “a” ; and EPI_ISL_412860

151

and EPI_ISL_410721 isolates indicated as “b”, were isolated in 2017 and 2019 in China

152

respectively, Figure 1a) are ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in humans. When

153

scanning sub-sets of the alignment including only SARS-CoV-2 and its ancestors,

154

recombination signal was highly significant (q < 1x10-6). A signal for recombination was

155

also detected for SARS-CoV-2 with pangolin-SARS-CoV-2 ancestral isolates (q = 0.03),

156

and when testing SARS-CoV-2 bat (EPI_ISL_402131) and pangolin isolates (q = 0.002).

157

We next scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genomes for putative recombination breakpoints

158

using RDP, GENECOV, MAXCHI, CHIMAERA, SISCAN, and 3SEQ, implemented in

159

RDP4 (Martin, et al. 2015). This pipeline allows for the identification of recombinants as

160

well as potential their parental isolates - if present in the sampled sequences. Sixty-eight

161

potential recombination events distributed along the genome were found in bat-SL-

162

CoVs, SARS-CoVs, and SARS-like CoVs isolates (Table S1). We found that human

163

SARS-CoV-2 isolates were potentially either parental or recombinant sequences in

164

recombination events with pangolin-SARS-CoV-2 isolated in 2019 and bat-SARS-CoV-2

165

genomes. Uncertainty in the estimation (the parental may be the recombinant

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015685; this version posted June 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

166

sequences, or vice versa) suggests missing links in SARS-CoV-2 lineages, which is

167

likely, given the sparse sampling of the wildlife coronavirus diversity, or low sensitivity of

168

the recombination algorithms. Because the recombination event between CoVs of

169

pangolin “b” and human origin involved the region of the S glycoprotein that binds to the

170

cell receptor (Figure 1b-c and Table S1), exactly matching the ACE2 binding region

171

where residues are shared between pangolin and human (Liu, et al. 2020), we conclude

172

that the SARS-CoV-2 human lineage is the result of recombination between a strain

173

belonging to the pangolin “b” lineage, potential minor parental, with a strain belonging to

174

the bat lineage close to bat-SARS-CoV-2 RaTG13.

175

We corroborated the potential recombination event by phylogenetic inference based on

176

the recombinant and non-recombinant genome fragments from human, bat, and

177

pangolin CoV-2 sequences, after assessing for the presence of phylogenetic signal

178

(Table S2 and S3). Trees inferred using the recombinant region (part of the S

179

glycoprotein) supported pangolin and CoV-2 ancestral relationship, while the segment

180

derived by the major parent kept the CoV-2 clade clustering with the bat sequence

181

(Figure S1).

182

We investigated further recombination patterns with a very sensitive genetic algorithm,

183

GARD, based on a likelihood model selection procedure that searches multiple

184

sequence alignments for evidence of recombination breakpoints (Kosakovsky Pond, et

185

al. 2006). Extensive simulations have shown that such an in-depth analysis can detect

186

recombination events with higher power and accuracy than tools based on phylogeny

187

discordance among large genomic segments. Indeed, GARD detected a more complex

188

mosaic-like structure of the S gene (Figure 1d), comprised of at least four distinct non-

189

recombinant segments, in addition to a segment (S gene nucleotide position 1502-2262)

190

with statistically significant evidence of further intra-segment recombination (Table S4).

191

The mosaic is the result of multiple independent events involving different ancestral

192

lineages during the evolutionary process that eventually gave rise to the current

193

pandemic strain. The first two non-recombinant segments of the S gene (nt 1-906 and nt

194

907-1316) show a human/bat ancestor (that subsequently splits in Bat-SL-CoVs and

195

SARS-CoV-2) sharing a common ancestor with Pangolin A and Pangolin B CoVs,

196

respectively. The third segment (nt 1317-1501), which overlaps with the one identified by

197

RDP4 analyses involving the RBD domain (Table S4), confirms its SARS-CoV-

198

2/pangolin B CoVs common ancestry. The fourth segment (nt 1502-2262) appears to be

199

itself a complex mosaic, although exact location of each putative breakpoint could not be

200

calculated given the complexity of all possible patterns. The fifth segment (nt 1502-2262)

201

shows, again, the human/bat ancestor sharing a common ancestor with Pangolin B

202

CoVs. Overall, we hypothesize that the evolutionary past of the currently circulating

203

pandemic strains included multiple recombination events between an ancestor of human

204

SARS-CoV-2, or a closely related to bat-SARS-CoV-2, and an ancestor of pangolin-

205

SARS-CoV-2 lineage b (but not necessarily in a pangolin host). Given that some regions

206

in the SARS-CoV-2 genome show similarity to these clades (Figure S2), it is likely that

207

one or more missing links among these strains have yet to be sampled in the animal

208

reservoir.

209

Prediction of recombination hot- and cold- spots in SARS-CoV-2

210

Recombination hotspots analysis was performed through a permutation test in RDP4,

211

which randomly distributes the inferred breakpoints across the genome on the variable

212

nucleotide positions between the three sequences involved in the event. From the

213

permutations, density plots are drawn, and the distribution of observed breakpoints is

214

compared to the permutations results. Permuting the detected breakpoints relative to

215

variable positions takes into account the fact that breakpoints might be easier/more

216

difficult to detect based on the local nucleotide diversity. Segments that had more

217

observed breakpoints than the local maximum number of breakpoints of 99% of 1,000

218

permutations were considered hotspots (p=0.01); in the same fashion, segments that

219

had fewer breakpoints than the local minimum of 99% of permutations were considered

220

coldspots (Heath, et al. 2006). The algorithm uses a sliding window of a set size, which

221

is moved across the genome one nucleotide at the time. The size of the sliding window

222

may affect the sensitivity of the test, since smaller window sizes might detect tightly

223

clustered hotspots, but might miss dispersed hotspots or coldspots. Thus, we used the

224

windows size range 100-200 as suggested by the program authors. We plotted the

225

locations of inferred recombination breakpoints and analyzed their distribution through

226

permutations to predict hot- and coldspots of recombination across the coronavirus

227

genomes (Figure 2).

228

We identified nine potential recombination hotspots based on an analysis with sliding

229

windows of size 100 bp. Seven of them were located in the polyprotein segment (Figure

230

2), which spans three quarters of the viral RNA; the remaining two involved protein E,

231

orf8, and protein N. It has been reported that the orf8 gene plays a role in regulating the

232

viral replication in the host cell (Muth, et al. 2018), and was probably acquired by the

233

whole lineage of SARS-CoV-1 from the SARS-related CoV from Greater Horseshoe bats

234

(SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs) following a recombination event with a Chinese horseshoe bat

235

coronavirus (SARSr-Rs-BatCoV) (Lau, et al. 2015). Three recombination coldspot

236

regions were detected using a sliding window of size 200 (Figure 2). Despite the S

237

glycoprotein being recombinant in nature, the N-terminal region holds two coldspots

238

away from the recombination breakpoints: the first is located between residues R34 to

239

D53, while the second between residues F201 to L229, (p ≤0.01). Another coldspot was

240

found in the N-terminal region of Pp1ab. Coldspots might be possibly related to

241

maintaining specific segments of the protein, or to the function of the viral transcription

242

regulatory sequences (Kim, et al. 2020).

243

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein acquired unique features driven by

244

recombination and purifying selection

245

We provide a full description of all residues unique to the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2

246

isolates circulating among humans by comparison with SARS-CoV-2 from bat and two

247

pangolin (lineage “a” isolates isolated from pangolin in 2017 in China; and “b” isolates

248

isolated from pangolin in 2019 in China) (Table S5). The overall structure of the SARS-

249

CoV-2 has significant structural homology to its SARS-CoV-1 counterpart (Wang, et al.

250

2020). In comparison with the latter available structure (Gui, et al. 2017), and a recently

251

published study (Lan, et al. 2020), the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is composed of the

252

S1 subunit, that binds to hACE2 (Li 2016), and the S2 subunit which plays a role in

253

membrane fusion (Bosch, et al. 2003). In particular, S1 is composed of an N-terminal

254

domain (NTD, residues 14-294 in SARS-CoV-1 and 14-303 in SARS-CoV-2) and three

255

C-terminal domains (CTD1, CTD2, and CTD3) (Figure 3). The CTD1 (residues 320-516

256

for SARS-CoV-1 and residue 333-529 for SARS-CoV-2, see Methods) functions as the

257

RBD, which allows SARS-CoV-2 to directly bind to the PD of the hACE2 (Li, et al. 2005).

258

For simplicity, we show canonical hACE2 binding residues F486, Q493, S494 and N501,

259

as reported by Andersen et al (Andersen, et al. 2020). The S2 subunit is located

260

downstream of S1 after the S1/S2 cleavage site (residue 667 for SARS-CoV-1 and

261

residue 684 for SARS-CoV-2). The majority of the residues that differentiate human

262

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein from bat or pangolin ones were found within the S1 subunit

263

(Figure 3a, Table S6). While the S glycoproteins of MERS-CoV, HcoV-OC43, and HKU1

264

display the canonical (R/K)-(2X)n-(R/K)* (or RXXR*SA) motif for the S1/S2 cleavage (Li

265

2016; Gui, et al. 2017), the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 presents a solvent exposed

266

furin-like cleavage sequence (PRRARS*V) in positions 681-684 (Andersen, et al. 2020),

268

(Figure 3). The cleavage site within the S1/S2 junction of the S glycoprotein is the target

269

for furin protease and essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans (Hoffmann, et al.

270

2020). The high activity of the human furin, compared to bat, may enhance the kinetic of

271

the infection, as the cleavage of S1 and S2 is a crucial step for virus entry into cells.

272

For selection analyses, we retained only unique sequences (removing all other identical

273

sequences) resulting in an alignment of 119 sequences. Because of the negative impact

274

of recombination events on selection analyses (Schierup and Hein 2000; Posada and

275

Crandall 2002; Shriner, et al. 2003), we used the additional partitioning identified by

276

GARD for the selection analyses. On lineages that separate host clades (Figure 4), the

277

S glycoprotein is under strong purifying selection (mean dN/dS = 0.0165), and 582

278

variable residues out of 838 found to be evolving with dN/dS < 1 (p-value ≤ 0.1)

279

(Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005), including 106 residues out of 197 located in the

280

RBD (Table S7). The recombination coldspots hosted a proportion of sites under

281

purifying selection similar to the rest of the alignment. There was no evidence of

282

episodic diversifying selection, either at the level of the entire alignment (dN/dS = 0.0

283

with weight 86.71%, dN/dS = 0.09 with weight 13.28%, p = 0.5) (Murrell, et al. 2015), or

284

at individual sites (p < 0.1) (Murrell, et al. 2012), and no evidence was found of lineage

285

specific episodic adaptation (p < 0.05). Focusing on internal branches for selection

286

analyses removes the biasing effects of unresolved intra-host evolution or sequencing

287

errors (Smith, et al. 2015). To identify sites which may be evolving adaptively in the

288

SARS-CoV-2 clade, we tested for episodic diversifying selection only for internal

289

branches in the human clade (Murrell, et al. 2012) and identified twenty-one such sites,

290

eight in S1 (p < 0.1) (Figure 4, Table S6). Next, we investigated whether residues were

291

evolving under the same selective pressure (Poon, et al. 2007). A total of five pairs of

292

codons were found to coevolve together at posterior probability ≥ 0.9 (Figure S3); some

293

of these residues are involved in epistatic interactions between residues in the RBD and

294

external residues.

295

Polybasic furin-like cleavage and prefusion conformation correlate with “up”

296

conformation

297

The RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein for the pre-fusion conformation rotates

298

outward from center of the triangular head to an “up” position, while this conformation for

299

SARS-CoV is “down”(Gui, et al. 2017; Wrapp, et al. 2020) (Figure 3d). The recognition

300

step between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 is a dynamic process in which the protein

301

surface of both partners adapts one to the other, in line with cryo-EM evidences that

302

shows how the receptor binding can open up RBD (Song, et al. 2018). In general, the

303

RBD of each S monomer, prior to CoV infection, is buried in the inactive “down”

304

conformation (prefusion state) and cannot bind to hACE2 due to steric clash (Wrapp, et

305

al. 2020; Yan, et al. 2020). In the course of infection, one RBD monomer turned “up” to

306

expose enough space to hACE2 (postfusion state), inducing further conformational open

307

and loose for proteolysis (Gui, et al. 2017; Song, et al. 2018). Homology modeling of

308

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein showed a “up” conformation of one SARS-CoV-2 S

309

monomer during the prefusion state, which was not showed for SARS-CoV-1.

310

We performed dynamic simulations (MD) to understand whether the genotype changes

311

that we identified earlier played an important role in shaping the structure of the S

312

glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, fundamental for viral binding to human cells. We carried

313

out essential dynamics analysis on the MD trajectories, in order to separate the large

314

collective protein movements connected to functional properties from the small and

315

uninteresting motions (Amadei 1993). This analysis is based on the diagonalization of

316

the covariance matrix built from the atomic fluctuations after the removal of the

317

translational and rotational movement. It is usually applied on the c-alpha atoms only,

318

since they describe the motion of the protein main chain. Interestingly, projection of the

319

MD molecular trajectory along the first eigenvector (i.e. the direction that contains the

320

majority of the protein total motion as shown by eigenvector values) is dominated by the

321

up/down (opening/closing) motion of the RBD (see Figure 5a-b and Suppl. Movies 1-2).

322

We identified threonine 333 (corresponding to T333 and T331 in bat and pangolin,

323

respectively) as the hinge of this movement. Noticeably, we verified that this motion is

324

conserved within the SARS-CoV-2 lineage, and therefore is observed in human, bat, and

325

pangolin S glycoproteins (Figure 5f-g and h-i, respectively). It is also worth noting that

326

residues 325-344 (mostly under negative/purifying selection) are nearly completely

327

conserved between SARS-CoV-2, bat and pangolin CoVs (Figure 3a), in line with the

328

key role of this protein region in guiding the up/down RBD movement.

329

The conformational flexibility of the S protein during the sampled 100 ns trajectory was

330

assessed by means of root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), calculated after

331

superimposing each individual structure of a trajectory onto the initial structure by means

332

of least-squares fitting, to remove rotational and translational motions. Projection of the

333

MD molecular trajectory along the first three eigenvectors (that cumulatively contain 90%

334

of the total protein motion) allowed to highlight co-variant movements (simultaneously

335

changing) among long distance S glycoprotein regions, functional to the protein

336

rearrangement during the pre-fusion step (Figure 5c-e). In detail, projection along

337

eigenvector 1 (Figure 5c) shows a correlated movement between RBD and the region

338

828-852 (highlighted by cyan lines in Figure 5c), encompassing the C-terminal portion of

339

the fusion peptide, defined by residues 816-833. The up conformation of RBD, in

340

particular, corresponds to a more solvent exposed conformation of the fusion peptide,

341

that is functional to the fusion of the viral and the host cell membranes (Figure S4 and

342

Suppl. Movie 3). Projection along eigenvector 2 (Figure 5d) shows a correlated

343

movement between a more restricted portion of RBD (residues 470-494, highlighted by

344

red lines in Figure 5d), and again the previously defined region 828-852. A third peak in

345

RMSF along this eigenvector is observed in the region 620-640, in CTD3. It is significant

346

that the indicated portion of RBD includes three out of the four hACE2 binding residues,

347

i.e. F486, Q493 and S494, demonstrating a direct structural communication between the

348

ACE2 binding region and the fusion peptide (see Figure S5 and Suppl. Movie 4).

349

Projection along eigenvector 3 (Figure 5e), finally, showed a correlated movement

350

between residues 244-265 in the NTD region (blue lines in Figure 5e), residues 460-494

351

in CTD1 (red lines in Figure 5e), and residues 673-692 (orange lines in Figure 5e), which

352

encompass the furin-like cleavage site typical of SARS-CoV-2. Also in this case, the up

353

conformation corresponds to a more solvent exposed surface of the furin-like cleavage

354

site. A peak of fluctuation for the furin-like cleavage site is observed also along

355

eigenvector 2 (Figure 5d), even though of minor amplitude as compared to the

356

highlighted three co-variant regions (i.e. hACE2 binding residues, fusion peptide and res

357

620-640 in CTD3) along eigenvector1. The long-range effects between the hACE2

358

binding residues and the furin-like cleavage site (see Figure S6 and Suppl Movie 5),

359

might therefore be functional to the novel acquired capabilities of this virus. This motion,

360

paired with the open/up conformation of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein that exposes the

361

whole interaction interface of RBD and the fusion peptide to hACE2 and host cell

362

membrane, might explain why SARS-CoV-2 has been shown greater infectivity and

363

spread than previous CoVs.

364

Discussion

365

Recombination is a hallmark of CoV evolution (Graham and Baric 2010). Although our

366

results clearly point to several recombination events occurred between ancestral

367

pangolin- and bat- SARS-CoV-2 lineages, the limited sampling of these animal hosts

368

makes difficult to draw definitive conclusions about its origin. According to our results,

369

one of these events led to the current configuration of SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 binding

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015685; this version posted June 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

370

residues, including recently described residues forming hydrogen bonds with the host

371

cell receptor (Yan, et al. 2020).

372

Current algorithms cannot fully distinguish recombinant sequences from the parental

373

ones, at least for some recombination events. Yet, the lack of positive diversifying

374

selection on the branch, in the S glycoprotein phylogeny, that leads to the recent human

375

CoV-2 lineage, and the strong purifying negative selection exerted on the majority of the

376

S glycoprotein codons, support our hypothesis that recombination constitutes the main

377

drive to escape a local fitness maximum (Weinreich and Chao 2005), successfully

378

expanding host tropism. It is likely that the ancestral lineages that actually recombined is

379

part of a yet unsampled population. A more extensive sampling of wildlife CoVs would

380

help in clarifying the events that led to the jump to humans. Our analyses were based on

381

sequences obtained from strains circulating relatively early in the epidemic; future work

382

including later strains’ genomes might discover marks of further adaptation to the new

383

host, as new mutations emerge and get fixed in the human population.

384

Despite the frequency of recombination events involving the S glycoprotein, the N-

385

terminal region appears to host two recombination coldspots. While

386

mutation/recombination events in the glycoprotein RBD could result in expanded viral

387

tropism, recombination coldspots and negative/diversifying selective pressure limit

388

variability, thus maintaining essential structure and function. It must be noted that the

389

high diversity between CoVs in the glycoprotein region, as compared to the rest of the

390

alignment, might have an impact on this analysis, thus in vitro studies might be needed

391

to verify these findings. Yet, while RBD is definitively a good target for therapeutic

392

development, regions in coldspots or those undergoing negative/diversifying selective

393

pressure may be helpful for successful vaccine design.

394

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein gained specific features that have facilitated the successful

395

spread of the virus as compared to its predecessors.

396

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein presents two notable changes: a favorable furin-like

397

cleavage site (Andersen, et al. 2020), and RBD up in pre-fusion mode (Wrapp, et al.

398

2020). Furin is ubiquitously expressed at different levels in all tissues (Schalken, et al.

399

1987; Hatsuzawa, et al. 1990), but kinetics of furin-like enzyme activity are different

400

among species – e.g., human lung cells display quicker kinetic than bat (Pteropus

401

alecto) (El Najjar, et al. 2015) – and may not fully explain SARS-CoV-2 boosted

402

infectivity. Thus, the assumption that the insertion of a furin-cleavage site allowed a bat

403

CoV to gain the ability to infect humans facilitating the host specie jump once the

404

conditions were favorable cannot be excluded. On the contrary S glycoprotein of

405

previously circulating SARS-CoV isolates do not have a favorable furin-like cleavage site

406

(Andersen, et al. 2020) and remains un-cleaved after biosynthesis (Belouzard, et al.

407

2009). Furin has the potential to cleave specifically viral envelope glycoproteins, to

408

enhance viral fusion with host cell membranes (Izaguirre 2019), thereby any

409

variation/mutational changes in amino acid composition at cleavage sites may impact

410

tissue and cell tropism, host range, and pathogenesis (Klenk and Garten 1994), as

411

reported for other respiratory viruses (Klenk and Garten 1994; Peng, et al. 2017;

412

Izaguirre 2019). MD simulations correlated more solvent-exposed surface in furin-like

413

cleavage site and fusion peptide the S protein up conformation, identifying a conserved

414

region that acts as a hinge in the opening/closing mechanism of all the SARS-CoV-2

415

lineage. Development of inhibitors of such motion may reduce substantially pre-fusion

416

conformation and therefore the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the presence of

417

coevolving sites might derive from host tropism; recent in silico and in vitro studies have

418

already found evidence of epistatic effects in coronavirus genes (Donaldson, et al. 2007;

419

Stobart, et al. 2012; Forni, et al. 2016). These connections might be linked to host

420

adaptation (Bhatt, et al. 2013; Longdon, et al. 2014; Bedhomme, et al. 2015). Further in

421

vitro research is needed to verify these findings and investigate the driving biological

422

mechanisms behind it.

423

In summary, our study provided novel molecular insights on SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein

424

features and placed SARS-CoV-2 lineage in a new context within the evolutionary

425

trajectory that has led to the current pandemic. Extensive recombination of isolates

426

circulating in bat, pangolin and/or potentially other unsampled hosts such as civets or

427

pigs, has been a crucial factor facilitating the emergence of a highly infectious virus,

428

capable both to elude the immune system (Yuan, et al. 2020) and infect target cells

429

more efficiently (Andersen, et al. 2020). The landscape of CoVs diversity still needs to

430

be exhaustively explored, and future emergence of novel recombinant CoVs, and other

431

viruses as well, should be an urgent concern. Strengthening surveillance of viral

432

populations and improving our understanding of their dynamics will help the prevention

433

of new zoonotic outbreaks and spread of emerging pathogens.

437

Publicly available genomic CoVs sequences were obtained from GenBank and GISAID

438

(Table S5 and S7). To gather closely related CoVs BLASTn was performed using the

439

ViPR database and keeping the first 100 hits. Genome sequences were aligned using

440

MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 2016) and refined manually. Alignments for the

441

glycoprotein were extracted from the genome alignment.

442

Recombination breakpoint and hotspot analyses

443

The presence of conflicting phylogenetic signals (i.e. distinct tree topologies compatible

444

with the same set of aligned sequences) in the full genome data set was investigated,

445

first, by inferring networks using neighbor-net (Bryant and Moulton 2004) implemented in

446

SplitsTree4 (Huson and Bryant 2006). Significant presence of recombination signal was

447

then assessed with the pairwise homoplasy index (Phi) test (Bruen, et al. 2006).

448

Identification of putative recombinant events and associated breakpoints was performed

449

using the RDP(Martin and Rybicki 2000), GENECOV (Padidam, et al. 1999), MAXCHI

450

(Smith 1992), CHIMAERA (Posada and Crandall 2001), SISCAN (Gibbs, et al. 2000)

451

and 3SEQ (Boni, et al. 2007) algorithms implemented in RDP4 (Martin, et al. 2015)

452

software (http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~darren/rdp.html), v.4.97. Statistical evidence of

453

recombination was indicated by p-values < 0.05, after Bonferroni correction for multiple

454

comparisons. A putative recombination events were considered as such if supported by

455

at least five of the six algorithms used. Full table with recombination results id given in

456

Table S1. BOOTSCAN (Salminen, et al. 1995) plots were generated using RDP4.

457

Phylogenetic signal for the subset alignment including bat, human and pangolin CoV-2

458

sequences was l was confirmed with TREE-PUZZLE(Schmidt, et al. 2002), and

459

weighted SH and AU tests (Shimodaira 2002) implemented in PAUP* v.4.04a build 167

460

(Hancock 2014). Neighbor joining, maximum likelihood and Bayesian trees were

461

calculated respectively with Q-Tree v.2.0 (Nguyen, et al. 2015) and MrBayes (Ronquist,

462

et al. 2012); best models for the alignments were chosen using Model Finder

463

(Kalyaanamoorthy, et al. 2017).

464

Recombination hotspots analysis was also performed using RDP4 through a

465

permutation test, which randomly distributes the observed breakpoints across the

466

genome on the variable nucleotide positions between the three sequences involved in

467

the event. From the permutations, density plots are drawn, and the distribution of

468

observed breakpoints is compared to the permutations results. Two iterations were

469

performed, with sliding windows of size 100 and 200, moved one nucleotide at the time,

470

with different sensitivity to hotspots and coldspots. Segments that had more observed

471

breakpoints than the local maximum number of breakpoints of 99% of 1,000

472

permutations were considered hotspots (p=0.01); in the same fashion, segments that

473

had less breakpoints than the local minimum of 99% of permutations were considered

474

coldspots (Heath, et al. 2006).

475

To identify the recombinant structure used to correct selection analyses, we used a

476

genetic algorithm, GARD (Kosakovsky Pond, et al. 2006), on the subset of sequences

477

including all bat and pangolin isolates, as well as five randomly chosen SARS-CoV-2

478

sequences; the reason for this subsampling is that for a fixed number of sites, GARD

479

loses power when there are many nearly related sequences.

480

Signature pattern and selection analyses

481

To identify new features of CoV-2, we used a higher number of isolates permit to explore

482

a larger evolutionary landscape. VESPA algorithm (Korber and Myers 1992) was used

483

with a dataset comprising the 728 genomes of SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 isolates

484

from the closely related bat (EPI_ISL_402131, 2013, Accession MN996532.1) and

485

pangolin lineage “a” (EPI_ISL_410538-43 isolates isolated in 2017 in China) and lineage

486

“b” (EPI_ISL_412860 and EPI_ISL_410721 isolates isolated in 2019 in China) (Table

487

S8). Positions are numbered with SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Accession

488

MN908947.3) as reference (Table S9).

489

For selection analyses, we used GARD results to partition the 119 unique sequences

490

subset. We inferred ML trees separately for each segment using raxml-ng and the

491

GTR+G+I model with 5 random parsimony starting trees. In these trees, we further

492

identified three branches that included host-switching events and the branch separating

493

2017 and 2019 pangolin isolates (see Figure 4).

494

We used BUSTED (Murrell, et al. 2015) to assess the presence of selection on the gene

495

S partitions. We ran FEL (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005) and MEME (Murrell, et al.

496

2012) methods on this partitioned alignment to look for pervasive (FEL) or episodic

497

(MEME) diversifying positive selection affecting the four inter-clade branches, and, in a

498

separate analysis, affecting only SARS-CoV-2 clade. To look for lineage specific

499

selection on inter-clade branches we used the aBSREL (Smith, et al. 2015) method

500

separately on each partition (since it cannot be applied to multi-partition data). Finally, to

501

look for co-evolution between sites, we applied BGM (Poon, et al. 2007) to each partition

502

separately, focusing only on internal branches and sites that accumulated at least two

substitutions on internal branches. All selection analyses were carried out in HyPhy

504

v2.5.14 (Pond, et al. 2005).

506

Structure homology modeling

507

As a first step, the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 (Accession

508

QHD43416) and EPI_ISL_402131 (bat, 2013, Accession MN996532.1) were submitted

509

to Swiss-model (Waterhouse, et al. 2018) . The best models showing high values of

510

Global Model Quality Estimation (GMQE) were selected and used as templates. Amino

511

acid alignments of targets and templates were performed using EMBOSS Needle

512

(Madeira, et al. 2019). The 3D homology homo-trimer models were created with the

513

Modeller v9. 23 (Eswar, et al. 2006; Webb and Sali 2014) automodel class using the

514

alignment as a guide. Then Discreet Optimised Protein Energy Score (DOPE) based

515

model selection (Shen and Sali 2006) and refinements were conducted using Modeller

516

v9.23 scripts. The final structure model validation was conducted with ProSA (Sippl

517

1993; Wiederstein and Sippl 2007) and QMEAN servers (Benkert, et al. 2009; Benkert,

518

et al. 2011). Visualization of the atomic models, including figures and movies, is made

519

with Chimera v1.12 (Pettersen, et al. 2004) and VMD v1.9.2 (Humphrey, et al. 1996).

520
521

Molecular Dynamics simulation

522

The structure of SARS-CoV-2, bat and pangolin, obtained for homology modeling, were

523

used as starting structures for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. In detail, topology

524

file was generated with the pdb2gmx Gromacs tool (Páll 2015), using the amber99sb

525

forcefield (Lindahl, et al. 2017)..The proteins were embedded in a triclinic box, extending

526

up to 15 Å from the solute, and immersed in TIP3P water molecules (Jorgensen 1983).

527

Counter ions were added to neutralize the overall charge with the genion gromacs tool.

528

After energy minimizations, the systems were slowly relaxed for 5 ns by applying

529

positional restraints of 1000 kJ mol-1 nm-2 to the protein atoms. Then unrestrained MD

530

simulations were carried out for a length of 100 ns for each system, with a time step of 2

531

fs, using GROMACS 2018.3 simulation package (Páll 2015) (supercomputer Galileo,

532

CINECA, Bologna, Italy). V-rescale temperature coupling was employed to keep the

533

temperature constant at 300 K (Bussi 2007). The Particle-Mesh Ewald method was used

534

for the treatment of the long-range electrostatic interactions (Darden 1993). The first 5 ns

535

portion of each trajectory was excluded from the analysis.

We carried out the Essential Dynamics analysis to identify the main 3N directions along

537

which the majority of the protein motion is defined (Amadei 1993). This analysis is based

538

on the diagonalization of the covariance matrix built from the atomic fluctuations after the

539

removal of the translational and rotational movement and we applied it on the c-alpha

540

atoms of each monomer (residue 27-1146 in our model of SARS-CoV-2), after

541

concatenating their trajectories (255 ns total sampling).

clarity) for each partition is shown, and the four inter-clade branches representing

601

potential zoonotic events depicted in dark red. The branch ancestral to SARS-CoV-2

602

isolates has an arrow pointing to it. Branches longer that 0.25 subs/site (under the MG94

lines. The impact of selective forces at individual sites is shown in two vertical bars at the

605

top, where MEME p-values are shown either for the SARS-CoV-2 clade (top bar) or the

606

inter-clade branches (bottom bar) as trail plots. Tick-marks between the bars correspond

607

to the location of sites that were inferred to be subject to diversifying positive selection in

608

the SARS-CoV-2 clade (there were none in the inter-clade branches), and those subject

correlated motion in the protein. The peak in fluctuations involving residues 828-852,
