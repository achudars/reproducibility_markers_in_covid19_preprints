Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major public health concern. A handful of static
structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with
its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition,
binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple all atom molecular
dynamics simulations of at least 500 ns each were performed to better understand the structural
stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and
reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were
observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with
ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Asp30 of
ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493, and Gln498 of SARSCoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35, and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the SARSCoV-ACE2 interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the
binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these
simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special
consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and
treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.

Introduction
The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected all walks of life. Genomic studies
have established that SARS-CoV-2 belong to the betacoronavirus genus, which also includes
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that were associated with previous outbreaks of relatively smaller
scale 1-3. These coronaviruses attach to the host cell with the aid of the spike glycoprotein present
on its envelope. Coronavirus spike glycoprotein is composed of two subunits - the S1 subunit is
important for binding to the host cell receptor and the S2 subunit is responsible for the fusion of
the virus and the host cell’s membrane. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme
located on the outer surface of a wide variety of cells, is the primary host cell target with which
the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 associates

4-6

. The receptor binding domain

(RBD) of the S1 subunit of these viruses binds to outer surface of the claw like structure of ACE2
7

.

The sequence similarity of the RBD region of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is
between 73% to 76% 7. Fourteen residues of the SARS-CoV spike protein RBD have been reported
to interact with human ACE2. These are Tyr436, Tyr440, Tyr442, Leu443, Leu472, Asn473,
Tyr475, Asn479, Gly482, Tyr484, Thr486, Thr487, Gly488, and Tyr491

8,9

. Only eight of these

9

residues are conserved in SARS-CoV-2 The equivalent conserved residues in SARS-CoV-2 are
Tyr449, Tyr453, Asn487, Tyr489, Gly496, Thr500, Gly502, and Tyr491, while Leu455, Phe456,
Phe486, Gln493, Gln498, and Asn501 are substituted.
The atomic level three-dimensional structure of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins have now been
determined

10-13

. These X-ray crystallography based structures provide remarkable insights into

macromolecular structure and intermolecular interactions. However, molecular recognition and
binding are dynamic processes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation often complement
traditional structural studies for looking at the dynamics of these processes at the atomic level 14,15.
Such simulations can provide insights into the structural stability of macromolecular complexes,
flexibility of interacting subunits and the interactions of residues in the interface.
Here, we report the stability and binding dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD bound to ACE2,
and compare this with the dynamics of SARS-CoV spike RBD, by running multiple 500 ns allatom MD simulations. High resolution X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD bound

to ACE2 illustrate fourteen positions that are associated with the interaction between SARSCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. The primary objective of this study was to identify both similarities
and dissimilarities in the dynamics of the interactions between SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and
ACE2 and to identify key residues that could be vital to the integrity of this interface. This would
provide insights into residues that could be targeted for disrupting this interface.

Results
MD simulations of SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 and SARS-CoV-ACE2 complexes
500 ns MD simulations of SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) and SARS-CoV-ACE2
complex (PDB: 2AJF) were performed in triplicate. One of the 500 ns simulations of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 complex was further extended to 1 µs to ensure that the interactions are faithfully retained
for a longer duration. Additionally, triplicate 500 ns simulations of a second SARS-CoV-2-ACE2
structure (PDB ID: 6LZG) was also performed to ensure that results were not biased by a single
structure. The overall structural integrity of all stimulations of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 complex were
retained with a Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the starting structure that was less
than 4 Å. In the case of the SARS-CoV-ACE2 simulations, one of simulations had a Cα RMSD
that was under at 5 Å. The oscillating RMSD of this simulation was characteristic of the
closing/opening motion of the ACE2 claw like structure 16 (Figures 1A and Figure 1B). The other
two SARS-CoV-ACE2 simulations had a higher RMSD that was associated with the detachment
of the spike protein from one end of interface (Figure 1B). Interestingly, the other end remained
attached as evident from specific contacts that were retained throughout the simulations.

also projected as beta factors in PDB structures and visualized (Supplementary Figure 2). Three

480-491. In the SARS-CoV2-ACE2 complex, the loops between residues 474-485 and 488-490
exhibited a comparatively higher fluctuation with respect to the rest of the RBD structure while
the 494-505 loop demonstrated very limited fluctuations (Figure 2B) However, in SARS-CoV
RBD, both loops demonstrated higher fluctuations throughout the simulations (Figure 2D).
Interestingly, the region around Lys417 showed very limited fluctuations in SARS-CoV-2.
Overall, the backbone of SARS-CoV-2 exhibited lower fluctuations compared to SARS-CoV
(Figures 2B and Figure 2D).

Spike RBD structures were extracted from the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV complexes and
simulated independently to study how the RBD structures behave when not bound to ACE2. The
RMSF of the RBD-only structures were then compared to the corresponding RBD bound to ACE2.
Interestingly, in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, residues between 469-505, that form loops, exhibited
higher fluctuations when not bound to ACE2 (Supplementary Figure 3A). The equivalent region
of the SARS-CoV RBD did not produce such a marked difference in bound and unbound
simulations (Supplementary Figure 3B). It would appear that this region in SARS-CoV-2 RBD is
effectively stabilized after binding to ACE2. Several residues between 484-505 are vital to the
ACE2-spike RBD interface. The loop region between residues 384-392 in SARS-CoV-2 fluctuated
more when bound to ACE2, while there was no noticeable difference in the SARS-CoV
simulations (Supplementary Figures 3A and 3B). This loop is not located in the interface and, thus,
it is not clear if it has any significance.
To look at the effect of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV binding on backbone stability and residue
fluctuations of ACE2, the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of backbone Cα atoms of ACE2
were evaluated (Figures 2A and 2C). The fluctuation of ACE2 backbone in both SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV complexes were comparable and showed limited fluctuations except in loop
regions (residues 130-138 and 278-291) where the SARS-CoV-2 bound complex showed lower
fluctuations compared to SARS-CoV bound complex (Figures 2A and 2C). More importantly,
residues in the interfacial region of ACE2 (residues 78-83 and 353-357) exhibited slightly lower
fluctuations in SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, loop regions of ACE2 - 82-89 and 351-354 - also
exhibited slightly lower fluctuations in SARS-CoV-2 (Figures 2A and 2C).
Interfacial residue contact duration differs substantially between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
bound complexes
Several intermolecular contacts were observed to form, break and reform during the simulations.
This included salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, π-π and cation-π interactions (Supplementary Table
1). Some of these interactions were more persistent than others. The residues of SARS-CoV2/SARS-CoV spike RBD that interacted with ACE2 consistently are shown in Figures 3A and 3B.

The duration of specific intermolecular contacts between SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV and ACE2
interfaces and the dynamics of the salient ones along the length of the simulation trajectories are
shown in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures 4 and 5.

did not interact with Lys31 in the SARS-CoV-2 simulations. Instead, Glu484 and Gln493 of
SARS-CoV-2 formed extremely weak interactions with Lys31 (Supplementary Table 1). The
likelihood of an interaction between Gln493 of SARS-CoV-2 and Lys31 residue of ACE2 was
reported recently 7.
Next, the backbone of Gly488 of SARS-CoV consistently interacted with Lys353 of ACE2 in all
three simulations, while the Gly502 at the equivalent location in SARS-CoV-2 formed sustained
interactions with Lys353 of ACE2 in only one simulation (Figures 4A and 4B). Additionally, the
side chain of Gln498 and backbone of Gly496 of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD formed sustained
interactions in three and two simulations, respectively, with Lys353 of ACE2. Such an interaction
was absent in equivalent residues of SARS-CoV (Figures 4A and 4B). This suggests that SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV differs in how they target the basic Lys31 and Lys353 residues of ACE2.
Tyr449 and Tyr489, two conserved residues in SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, consistently interacted
with Asp38 and Gln24 of ACE2 in multiple simulations. Tyr453 and Tyr505 were observed to
interact with His34 and Gln37, respectively, of ACE2 for at least 80% of one simulation each
(Figures 4A and 4B). The corresponding residues in SARS-CoV did not appear to form such
sustained interactions except Tyr491 which consistently interacted with Gln37 in two simulations.
Furthermore, Gln493 and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 showed sustained interactions with Glu35 and
Asp38, respectively, while the corresponding Asn479 and Tyr484 in SARS-CoV exhibited
extremely weak interactions (Figures 4A and 4B). This is in agreement with recent work that shows
the likely existence of Tyr449-Asp38, Tyr453-His34, Tyr489-Gln24, and Gln493-Glu35
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and ACE2 16-18.
Three residues which are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 (Ala475, Lys417 and Gly446) interacted with
ACE2 residues (Gln24, Asp30 and Gln42). Such interactions were not observed in corresponding
residues of SARS-CoV (Figures 4A and 4B, Supplementary Table 1). Significantly, a very strong
salt bridge was established and sustained between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and Asp30
of ACE2 for nearly the full duration of all simulations. Notably, this salt bridge is absent in SARSCoV since the equivalent residue is Val404, which is incapable of forming such an interaction
(Figures 4A and 4B). Gly446 maintained an interaction with Gln42 of ACE2 for majority of only
one simulation (Figure 4A), while Ala475 exhibited only weak interactions with Gln24 in the
simulations.

To look at the dynamics of the interface, interactions that were maintained for at least 50% of the
total simulation time in three simulations in the two complexes were evaluated. Four interfacial
residues in SARS-CoV-2 (Lys417, Gln493, Tyr449 and Gln498) and two in SARS-CoV (Thr486
and Gly488) maintained such interactions with four (Asp30, Glu35, Asp38 and Lys353) and two
(Lys353 and Asp355) residues of ACE2 respectively (Figures 4A and 4B). Hence, there are
noteworthy differences between how the two viral spike proteins interact with ACE2 and the larger
number of sustained interactions in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be associated with a higher
binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, similar dynamics of interacting residues were also
observed in triplicate 500 ns simulations of another complex structure of SARS-CoV-2-ACE2
(PDB: 6LZG) that was simulated to ensure that the results were not biased by one structure
(Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 1).
The total number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the two complexes were monitored
throughout the simulation. A higher number of hydrogen bonds were observed in the SARS-CoV2-ACE2 complex when compared to SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex (Supplementary Figure 7).
Contact distance of the most stable interfacial residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were also
evaluated and plotted since this gives a better indication of interactions rather than preset cutoffs
used for determination of an interaction. The contact distance density plot of consistently
interacting residues showed sharper peaks (Supplementary Figures 4 and 5). The fewer interactions
and hydrogen bonds in the second and third simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 bound complex was
due to the notable separation of the RBD from one end of the interface near the Lys31 residue of
ACE2 (Figures 3 and 4 and Supplementary Figure 2).
Recent studies, based on models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD, have indicated that
Leu455, Phe486, Ser494, and Asn501 of SARS-CoV-2 are important for binding to ACE2 via
their interaction with Met82, Tyr83, Lys31, and Tyr41 residues

3,7,18

. However, from the

simulations, only a weak π-π interaction was observed between Phe486 and Tyr83 (Supplementary
Table 1). While, Leu455, Ser494, and Asn501 were not observed to form any significant
interactions with ACE2.

spike:Phe490/Leu492, ACE2:Asp38 and spike:Gly496, ACE2:Asn33/His34/Glu37/Asp38 and

Discussion
This study provides insight into the stability of the interactions that define the SARS-CoV-ACE2
and SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interfaces, using extended MD simulations of X-ray crystal structures of
these complexes. Firstly, interactions that were shared by SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 and SARS-CoVACE2 complexes were assessed. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD consistently interacted with
ACE2 in three clusters. At one end, Gln493 and Gln498 formed sustained hydrogen bonds with
Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2. At the other end, Tyr449 formed hydrogen bond with Asp38 of
ACE2. In the middle, Lys417 formed a strong and stable salt bridge with Asp30 of ACE2.
Additionally, several intermittent interactions of SARS-CoV-2 could permit it to bind more stably

than SARS-CoV (Figures 3B and 4A and Supplementary Table 1). These findings were also
supported by the results from two different structures of the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex
(Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 1). Loop regions (residues 484-505) of SARSCoV-2 fluctuated less when bound to ACE2, when compared to SARS-CoV. This is stabilized by
the formation of sustained interactions between Gln493 and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Glu35
and Lys353 of ACE2, respectively (Figures 4A and Supplementary Figure 4).
Unlike SARS-CoV-2, in SARS-CoV, the region in the middle was devoid of any stable
interactions with ACE2. However, at the two ends, a different set of residues in SARS-CoV
formed interactions with ACE2 (Figure 3D). Therefore, it is apparent that there are several
similarities and differences in the structure and dynamics of the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV with ACE2. Hence, antibodies or antiviral treatment modalities that target the spike
protein of SARS-CoV is not expected to produce a similar effect with SARS-CoV-2. Some of the
recent studies that failed to inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2, support these
findings 13,19.
Secondly, two charged virus binding hot spots on human ACE2 (Lys31 and Lys353), which are
essential for the binding of SARS-CoV, have been studied extensively

4,8

. Charge neutralization

of these hot spot lysines has been shown to be important for the binding of coronavirus to ACE2
7,8

. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilizes unique strategies to achieve this. Interestingly, SARS-

CoV-2 residues only formed sustained interactions with Lys353 of ACE2 and these were absent
in SARS-CoV indicating an adaptation to a stronger interface (Figure 4A and 4B). Several of these
vital residues fall in loop regions of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Three loop regions - 474-485,
488-490, and 494-505 of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated limited fluctuation compared to the
corresponding region in SARS-CoV (Figure 2B and 2D). Lower fluctuations, observed in residues
of SARS-CoV-2 that bind to the Lys353 hot spot of ACE2, could be another reason for the better
affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 7,18.
Thirdly, the non-conserved residue Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 formed a very stable salt bridge with
Asp30 of ACE2. This interaction was absent in the corresponding residue (Val404) of SARS-CoV
(Figure 4A and 4B). Lys417 provides a positively charged patch on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2
which is absent in SARS-CoV, where the corresponding residue is Val404. The RBD is also
stabilized by this strong interaction; the RMSF of the region around Lys417 demonstrated lower
13

fluctuations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD compared to the corresponding region of SARS-CoV (Figure
2B and 2D). The strength of this sustained salt bridge between Lys417 and Asp30 could contribute
to the substantially different binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor when compared
to SARS-CoV 16,18. Notably, some of the previously reported residues (Leu455, Phe456, Tyr473,
Phe486, Ser494, and Asn501) that were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV2, were not observed in these simulations 3,16,18.
In conclusion, while SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike RBD bind to the same region of ACE2
and share several similarities in how they interact with ACE2, there are a number of differences in
the dynamics of the interactions. One salient difference is the presence of a stable salt bridge
between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable
hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493, and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35, and
Lys353 of ACE2, which were not observed in the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interface. Stable viral binding
with the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Thus, special consideration should be given to
these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or
disrupt this interface.
Materials and methods
Coordinates of the three dimensional X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 RBD in complex with ACE2 were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The PDB IDs
of the structure used are 6M0J and 6LZG for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD bound to ACE2
and 2AJF for the SARS-CoV spike protein RBD bound to ACE2. Schrödinger Maestro 2019-4
(Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY) was used to visualize and prepare the protein structures for
simulations. The structures were first pre-processed using the Protein Preparation Wizard
(Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY). The protein preparation stage included proper assignment of
bond order, adjustment of ionization states, orientation of disorientated groups, creation of
disulfide bonds, removal of unwanted water molecules, metal and co-factors, capping of the
termini, assignment of partial charges, and addition of missing atoms and side chains. In the case
of the SARS-CoV structure, a loop (residues 376-381) missing in the PDB structure was modeled
using Schrödinger Prime 20. Hydrogen atoms were incorporated, and standard protonation state at
pH 7 was used. Structures of spike protein RBD bound to ACE2 were placed in orthorhombic
boxes of size 125 Å × 125 Å × 125 Å and solvated with single point charge (SPC) water molecules

using the Desmond System Builder (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY). A box size of 85 Å × 85
Å × 85 Å was used for simulations of spike RBD structures isolated from the PDB structures 6M0J
and 2AJF. Simulation systems were neutralized with counterions and a salt concentration of 0.15M
NaCl was maintained. MD simulations were performed using Desmond 21. The OPLS forcefield
was used for all calculations. All systems were subjected to Desmond’s default eight stage
relaxation protocol before the start of the production run. 500 ns simulations were performed in
triplicate with a different set of initial velocities for simulations involving 6M0J, 6LZG and 2AJF
while one 500 ns simulation each were run for the isolated spike protein structures. One of the 500
ns simulations of the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex was extended to 1 µs to ensure that the
interactions are retained for a longer period. For the simulations, the isotropic Martyna-TobiasKlein barostat and the Nose-Hoover thermostat were used to maintain the pressure at 1 atm and
temperature at 300 K, respectively

22,23

. Short-range cutoff was set as 9.0 Å and long-range

coulombic interactions were evaluated using the smooth particle mesh Ewald method (PME) 24. A
time-reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) integrator was employed with an
inner time step of 2.0 fs and an outer time step 6.0 fs

25

. Simulation data was analyzed using

packaged and in house scripts and plotted using R 3.6.0 (https://www.r-project.org).
