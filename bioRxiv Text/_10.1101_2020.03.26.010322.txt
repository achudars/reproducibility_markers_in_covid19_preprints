Abstract
The emergence of the betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, represents a
significant threat to global human health. Vaccine development is focused on the principal
target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, that mediates cell entry and
membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer,
which likely play a role in immune evasion and occluding immunogenic protein epitopes. Here,
using a site-specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen. This analysis enables mapping of the glycanprocessing states across the trimeric viral spike. We show how SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ
from typical host glycan processing, which may have implications in viral pathobiology and
vaccine design.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of
COVID-191,2, induces fever, severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes
an extensively glycosylated spike (S) protein that protrudes from the viral surface to bind to
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host cell receptor, to mediate cell entry3. The S
protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that is composed of two functional subunits
responsible for receptor binding (S1 subunit) and membrane fusion (S2 subunit). Remarkably,
the surface of the virally encoded envelope spike is dominated by an array of host-derived
glycans with each trimer displaying 66 N-linked glycosylation sites. This extensive
glycosylation has important implications for vaccine design.
As obligate parasites, many viruses exploit host-cell machinery to glycosylate their own
proteins. Numerous viral envelope proteins, including HIV-1 envelope (Env), influenza
hemagglutinin (HA) and Lassa virus glycoprotein complex (GPC), possess genetically encoded
N-linked glycan sequons (N-X-S/T motifs, where X is any amino acid except proline). Viral
glycosylation has wide-ranging roles in viral pathobiology, including mediating protein folding
and stability, and shaping viral tropism. The genetically encoded sequons can be under
significant selective pressure as a mechanism for immune evasion by shielding specific
epitopes from antibody neutralization. However, we note the currently reported low mutation
rate of SARS-CoV-2, and as yet that there have been no observed mutations to N-linked
glycosylation sites4. Surfaces with an unusually high density of glycans can also enable
immune recognition5–7. The role of glycosylation in immune evasion by camouflaging
immunogenic protein epitopes has been well studied for other coronaviruses4,8,9.
As the principal antigen presented on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions, the S protein
is a key target in vaccine design efforts. It is apparent that the viral spike will be targeted by
the full assortment of vaccine strategies from nucleic-acid based approaches10, whereby the
viral protein is expressed in vivo, to recombinant strategies whereby viral glycoproteins are
delivered with appropriate adjuvants. Such strategies aim to elicit neutralizing adaptive
immunity with an emphasis on achieving an antibody response at the sites of viral entry.
Understanding the glycosylation of recombinant viral spikes can both reveal
fundamental features of viral biology and can guide vaccine design strategies and
manufacturing. As glycans are enzymatically elaborated in the Golgi apparatus, some features
of processed, so-called complex-type, glycosylation will necessarily be influenced by the

producer cell-line. However, the presence of glycans typical of the early stages of the secretory
pathway on otherwise mature glycoproteins often closely relate to fundamental features of viral
spike architecture. High viral glycan density, or extensive packing of the glycan to the protein
surface, can impair the normal glycan maturation pathway by steric interference of host
enzymes. Under-processed oligomannose- and hybrid-type glycans are found on the majority
of viral envelope proteins such as HIV-1 Env, influenza HA and Lassa virus GPC5. These viral
glycoproteins traffic through the secretory system and the glycosylation processing of
recombinant material often closely captures the glycan maturation state of the virion. This can
be particularly important for viruses such as HIV-1, where viral glycans can also be targeted
by neutralizing antibodies. Coronaviruses have been reported to form virions by budding into
the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC)11–14. However
observations of hybrid- and complex-type glycans on virally derived material suggests that the
viral glycoproteins are subjected to Golgi resident processing enzymes8,15.
As impaired glycan maturation can be a sensitive reporter of local viral protein
architecture16, detailed site-specific analysis has emerged as an indicator of native-like
architecture and is increasingly used to compare different immunogens and in the monitoring
of manufacturing processes. Importantly, in addition to these structural insights, the presence
of oligomannose-type glycans on viral spike-based immunogens has also been shown to
enhance trafficking of glycoprotein to germinal centers via interaction with lectins such as
mannose-binding lectin17.

It is therefore of considerable importance to understand the

glycosylation of recombinant mimetics of the virus spike.
Here, we apply mass spectrometry to understand both the site-specific N-linked glycan
composition and the degree of sequon occupancy on a soluble, native-like SARS-CoV-2 S
protein. The native-like folding of trimeric recombinant material has been recently revealed by
detailed structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy18,19. We have previously validated our
glycopeptide analysis methodology and applied this approach to the study of a range of other
viral glycoprotein immunogens4,20–23, which enables cross-viral comparisons of glycosylation
to be made. We report here the site-specific glycosylation at each of the 22 N-linked glycan
sites found on the SARS-CoV-2 S protomer. As observed on other viral glycoproteins, there is
an elevation in oligomannose- and hybrid-type glycans compared to host-derived glycoproteins,
although compared to many other viruses there are still a large population of complex-type
glycans displayed across the trimer surface. We also report that for each of the 22 glycan sites
the occupancy is nearly fully complete, which means that any epitopes shielded from the

immune system on the virus will also likely be shielded on the immunogen. Site-specific glycan
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 immunogens will help guide vaccine design and manufacturing.

Results and discussion
Localized impairment to SARS-CoV-2 S glycan maturation
To resolve the site-specific glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and visualize the
distribution of glycoforms across the protein surface, we expressed and purified recombinant
soluble material in an identical manner to that which was used to obtain the high-resolution
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure, albeit without glycan processing blockade
using kifunensine18. This soluble recombinant variant of the S protein contains all 22 glycans
on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Figure 1A). Stabilization of the trimeric prefusion structure
was achieved using the “2P” stabilizing mutations24 at residues 986 and 987 in addition to a Cterminal trimerization motif. This ensures that the quaternary structure remains intact during
glycan processing, as in the case of HIV Env mimetics, this is known to influence glycosylation
of certain sites16,25. Prior to analysis, supernatant containing the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 was
purified using a C-terminal StrepTag followed by size-exclusion chromatography to ensure
only native-like trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein is analyzed (Figure 1B). The trimeric
conformation of the purified material was validated using negative stain electron microscopy
(Figure 1C).

Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and alpha-lytic protease were employed to generate three
glycopeptide samples. These proteases cleave at different sites and were selected in order to
generate glycopeptides that contain a single N-linked glycan sequon. The glycopeptide pools
were analyzed by LC-MS, with high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD)

fragmentation, and the glycan compositions at each site were determined for all 22 N-linked
glycan sites on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Figure 2). A diverse range of glycan compositions
were observed across the different glycosylation sites. In order to convey the main processing
features at each site, the abundances of each glycan are summed into oligomannose-, hybridand complex-type glycosylation. In addition, the diverse signals arising from heterogeneous
complex-type glycosylation are simplified by the summation of glycan intensities into a more
limited range of structural categories.
There are three sites on SARS-CoV-2 that are predominantly oligomannose-type: N234,
N709 and N801. The predominant structure observed at each site, with the exception of N234,
is Man5GlcNAc2, which demonstrates that these sites are largely accessible to a 1,2mannosidases but are poor substrates for GlcNAcT-I, which is the gateway enzyme in the
formation of hybrid- and complex-type glycans in the Golgi apparatus. The stage at which
processing is impeded is a signature related to the density and presentation of glycans on the
viral spike. For example, the more densely glycosylated spikes of HIV-1 Env and Lassa virus
GPC give rise to numerous sites dominated by Man9GlcNAc220–22,26.
Interestingly, there are several sites which possess significant populations of hybridtype glycans, most notably at N657. This phenomenon has been observed on other viral
glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 Env20,26, and these structures are not particularly prevalent on
mammalian glycoproteins27,28. Such hybrid-type glycans have been shown to be targeted by
anti-HIV antibodies29 and could also be important for immunogen trafficking since they have
mannose-terminating moieties17.
A mixture of oligomannose-type glycans and complex-type glycans can be found at
sites N61, N122, N165, N603, N657, N717 and N1074 (Figure 2). Of the 22 sites on the S
protein, 10 contain significant populations of oligomannose-type glycans, highlighting how the
processing of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycans is divergent from host glycoproteins. The remaining
12 sites are dominated by processed, complex-type glycans. The predominant category of
complex-type glycans observed on the S protein are fucosylated biantennary structures, very
similar to those abundant on mammalian glycoproteins.
A further feature that can be interrogated using this methodology is the extent of
unoccupancy of glycosylation sites, where a sequon is present but a glycan has not been
attached. In HIV immunogen research, the holes generated by unoccupied glycan sites have
been shown to be immunogenic and potentially give rise to distracting epitopes30. While

unoccupied glycosylation sites were detected on SARS-CoV-2, when quantified they were
revealed to form a very minor component of the total peptide pool. The efficiency of glycan
site occupancy of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 immunogen versus the counterpart for HIV
may well arise due to the somewhat larger spacing of sites along the polypeptide chain. The
high occupancy of N-linked glycan sequons of SARS-CoV-2 indicates that recombinant
immunogens will not require further optimization to enhance site occupancy.

summarize the quantification of these glycans. Glycan sites are colored according to
oligomannose-type glycan content with the glycan sites labelled in green (80−100%), orange

Fully glycosylated model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
Using the cryo-EM structure of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB ID 6VSB)18, we
generated a model to map the glycosylation status of the coronavirus spike mimetic onto the
experimentally determined 3D structure (Figure 3). This combined mass spectrometric and
cryo-EM analysis reveals how the N-linked glycans occlude distinct regions across the surface
of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Glycans were modelled onto each site using predominant glycans
observed (Figure 2) and colored according to the prevalence of oligomannose-type glycans.
Shielding of the receptor binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike by proximal
glycosylation sites (N165, N234, N343) can be observed, especially when the receptor binding
domain is in the “down” conformation. The shielding of receptor binding sites by glycans is a
common feature of viral glycoproteins and has been observed for SARS-CoV S4,8, HIV-1 Env31,
influenza HA32,33, and LASV GPC21. Given the functional constraints of receptor binding sites
and the subsequent low mutation rates of these residues, it is likely that there has been selective
pressure to utilize N-linked glycans as a method to camouflage one of the most conserved and
potentially vulnerable areas of their respective glycoproteins34,35.
It is interesting to note the absence of a specific glycan cluster that is responsible for
the presence of the oligomannose-type glycans but rather there is a dispersion of these glycans
across both the S1 and S2 subunits. This is in significant contrast to other viral glycoproteins,
for example the density of glycans clusters in HIV have even enabled structural classification
of their different modes of interaction36. In SARS-CoV-2 the oligomannose-type structures are
probably protected, to some extent, by the protein component, as exemplified by the N234
glycan which is partially sandwiched between the N-terminal and receptor-binding domains
(Figure 3).

We characterized the N-linked glycans on extended loop structures that were not
resolved in the cryo-EM maps18 (N74 and N149). These were determined to be complex-type
glycans, consistent with the inherent flexibility of these regions and resulting accessibility of
these residues to glycan processing enzymes.

experimentally observed glycosylation site compositions is illustrated on the prefusion
structure of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (PDB ID 6VSB)18, with one RBD in the “up”
conformation and the other two RBDs in the “down” conformation. The glycans are colored
according to oligomannose content as defined by the key. ACE2 receptor binding sites are
highlighted in light blue. The S1 and S2 subunits are rendered with translucent surface
representation, colored light and dark grey, respectively. Note that the flexible loops on which
N74 and N149 glycan sites reside are represented as dashed lines with glycan sites on the loops
mapped at approximate regions.

In addition to the site-specific glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein it is also
important to consider overall trends in glycosylation across the glycoprotein. The averaged
compositions across all 22 glycan sites reveals that the two most common type of N-glycans
on the protein are Man5GlcNAc2 (M5) and fucosylated biantennary (FA2/FA1B) glycans (Sup.

Fig. 1). Oligomannose-type glycans comprise 32% of the total glycan pool, with hybrid-type
and complex-type glycans comprising 7% and 62%, respectively (Sup. Fig. 1). Despite the
potential impact of different local protein structure on glycan processing, the overall
glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 is comparable with SARS-CoV-1 S protein and other
coronavirus S proteins4,8,9,15. We have previously reported that a recombinant SARS-CoV-1 S
mimetic also contained 32% oligomannose-type glycans showing a remarkable conservation
in glycan processing across these coronaviruses. Whilst the oligomannose-type glycan content
is well above that observed on typical host glycoproteins, it is significantly lower than is found
on other viral glycoproteins. For example, one of the most densely glycosylated viral spike
proteins is HIV-1 Env, which contains ~60% oligomannose-type glycans20,37. This suggests
that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less densely glycosylated and that the glycans form much less
of a shield compared with other viral glycoproteins including HIV Env and LASV GPC, which
may be beneficial for the elicitation of potent neutralizing antibodies.
In addition to oligomannose-type glycans, the processing of complex-type glycans is
an important consideration in immunogen engineering. Across the 22 N-linked glycosylation
sites, 16% of the glycans contain at least one sialic acid residue and 48% are fucosylated
(Figure 4). These data suggest high levels of fucosylation but low levels of sialylation,
considering complex and hybrid type glycans make up 69% of the total glycans of SARS-CoV2. Understanding the distribution of glycan modifications across the viral spike illustrates the
differential susceptibility to different processing enzymes while the absolute levels can be
heavily influenced by the cellular expression system utilized. We have previously
demonstrated for HIV-1 Env glycosylation that the processing of complex-type glycans is
driven by the producer cell but that the levels of oligomannose-type glycans were largely
independent of the expression system and is much more closely related to the protein structure
and glycan density38.

Perspectives
Our glycosylation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 offers a detailed benchmark of site-specific glycan
signatures characteristic of a natively folded trimeric spike. As an increasing number of
glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates are being developed, their detailed glycan analysis
offers a route for comparing immunogen integrity and will also be important to monitor as
manufacturing processes are scaled for clinical use. Glycosylation will therefore also be an
important measure of antigen quality in the manufacture of serological testing kits, particularly
as some S protein fragments may offer advantages in terms of production yield but lack
effective glycan mimicry of the natively folded trimeric spike. The lower levels of mannose-

terminating glycans on SARS-CoV-2 compared to many other viral spikes may indicate that
glycan engineering should be considered in the scenario where first-generation glycoproteinbased vaccine candidates be poorly immunogenic. Finally, with the advent of nucleotide-based
vaccines it will be important to understand how those delivery mechanisms impact immunogen
processing and presentation.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification
To express the prefusion S ectodomain, a gene encoding residues 1−1208 of SARS-CoV-2 S
(GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a “GSAS”
substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization
motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was synthesized
and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pαH. This expression vector was used to
transiently transfect FreeStyle293F cells (Thermo Fisher) using polyethylenimine. Protein was
purified from filtered cell supernatants using StrepTactin resin (IBA) before being subjected to
additional purification by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 column
(GE Healthcare) in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3.
Negative-stain electron microscopy and 2D class averaging
Purified SARS-CoV-2 spike was diluted to a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL using 2 mM Tris
pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3 before being applied to a plasma cleaned CF400-Cu
grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Protein was then stained using methylamine tungstate
(Nanoprobes) before being allowed to dry at room temperature for 15 minutes. This grid was
imaged in a Talos TEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Ceta 16M detector.
Micrographs were collected using TIA v4.14 software at a nominal magnification of 92,000×,
corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.63 Å/pix. CTF estimation, particle picking and 2D
class averaging were performed using cisTEM39.
Glycopeptide analysis by mass spectrometry
Three 30 μg aliquots of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were denatured for 1h in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH
8.0 containing 6 M of urea and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Next, the S protein were reduced
and alkylated by adding 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) and incubated for 1h in the dark,

followed by a 1h incubation with 20 mM DTT to eliminate residual IAA. The alkylated Env
proteins were buffer-exchanged into 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 using Vivaspin columns (3 kDa)
and digested separately overnight using trypsin chymotrypsin or alpha lytic protease (Mass
Spectrometry Grade, Promega) at a ratio of 1:30 (w/w). The next day, the peptides were dried
and extracted using C18 Zip-tip (MerckMilipore). The peptides were dried again, re-suspended
in 0.1% formic acid and analyzed by nanoLC-ESI MS with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) system coupled to a Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using
higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. Peptides were separated
using an EasySpray PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 µm × 75 cm). A trapping column (PepMap
100 C18 3μM 75μM x 2cm) was used in line with the LC prior to separation with the analytical
column. The LC conditions were as follows: 275 minute linear gradient consisting of 0-32%
acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 240 minutes followed by 35 minutes of 80% acetonitrile
in 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was set to 200 nL/min. The spray voltage was set to 2.7 kV
and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 40 °C. The ion transfer tube temperature
was set to 275 °C. The scan range was 400−1600 m/z. The HCD collision energy was set to
50%, appropriate for fragmentation of glycopeptide ions. Precursor and fragment detection
were performed using an Orbitrap at a resolution MS1= 100,000. MS2= 30,000. The AGC target
for MS1=4e5 and MS2=5e4 and injection time: MS1=50ms MS2=54ms.
Glycopeptide fragmentation data were extracted from the raw file using ByonicTM
(Version 3.5) and ByologicTM software (Version 3.5; Protein Metrics Inc.). The glycopeptide
fragmentation data were evaluated manually for each glycopeptide; the peptide was scored as
true-positive when the correct b and y fragment ions were observed along with oxonium ions
corresponding to the glycan identified. The MS data was searched using the Protein Metrics
305 N-glycan library. The relative amounts of each glycan at each site as well as the unoccupied
proportion were determined by comparing the extracted chromatographic areas for different
glycotypes with an identical peptide sequence. All charge states for a single glycopeptide were
summed. The precursor mass tolerance was set at 4 ppm and 10 ppm for fragments. A 1% false
discovery rate (FDR) was applied. The relative amounts of each glycan at each site as well as
the unoccupied proportion were determined by comparing the extracted ion chromatographic
areas for different glycopeptides with an identical peptide sequence. Glycans were categorized
according to the composition detected. HexNAc(2)Hex(9−5) was classified as M9 to M5.
HexNAc(3)Hex(5−6)X was classified as Hybrid with HexNAc(3)Fuc(1)X classified as
Fhybrid. Complex-type glycans were classified according to the number of processed antenna

and fucosylation. If all of the following compositions have a fucose they are assigned into the
FA categories. HexNAc(3)Hex(3-4)X is assigned as A1, HexNAc(4)X is A2/A1B,
HexNAc(5)X is A3/A2B, and HexNAc(6)X is A4/A3B. As this fragmentation method does
not provide linkage information compositional isomers are group, so for example a triantennary
glycan contains HexNAc 5 but so does a biantennary glycans with a bisect. Any glycan
containing at least one sialic acid was counted as sialylated.
Model construction
Structural models of N-linked glycan presentation on SARS-CoV-2 were created using electron
microscopy structures (PDB ID: 6VSB) along with complex-, hybrid-, and oligomannose-type
N-linked glycans (PDB ID 4BYH, 4B7I, and 2WAH). The most dominant glycoform presented
at each site was modelled on to the N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites in Coot40.
