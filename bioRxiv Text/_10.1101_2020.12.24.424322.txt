Abstract
Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) are a group of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) which bind
to the exogenous pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) like other PRRs; hence
the main function is to sense the harmness and mediate the innate immune response to
pathogens. TLRs play an important role in innate immune responses to infection. The host
has evolved to use other TLR and PAMP agonists as agents to stimulate a protective
inflammatory immune response against infection. Because only a small number of doses are
given, TLR agonists appear to have greater potential and fewer safety concerns than other
uses as vaccine adjuvants. In the present days, development of peptides targeting immune
response can be approved for survival in biological monitoring systems before vaccine
exposures. Peptide vaccines are easy to synthesize, more stable and relatively safe. In
addition, production of peptides becomes simple, easily reproducible, fast and cost effective.
Getting vaccinated against Covid-19, which has become a pandemic in the human population,
is the most practical way to control the outbreak. The new coronavirus does not contain a
drug or vaccine to prevent it from spreading to humans. To getting a proper vaccine candidate
against the novel coronavirus, the present study used the reverse vaccinology approach by
using a complete set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; such as: Spike, Envelope, Nucleocapsid,
Membrane, NSPs, and ORFs to extract the antigenic elements that produce B-cell, T-cell and
IFN positive epitopes. These epitopes with precise binding to the Toll-Like receptors (1-10)
have developed epitope based vaccine candidates. We have prioritized a set of epitopes based
on their antigenicity, allergenicity, sequence conservation and projected population coverage
world-wide. The selected epitopes were employed for in-silico docking interactions with
Toll-Like receptors and molecular dynamic simulation confirmed the stability of the vaccine
candidates resulting epitope of spike proteins with both the TLR 7 and 8 shows the best
binding affinity. We believe that this ideal epitope vaccine candidate could enhance the
immune response of the host and reduce the reinfection risk.

Introduction
COVID-19 infection and its high transmission rates have spurred research and industry to
develop effective vaccines and drugs. However, since then there has been no effective
vaccine or drug to fight this infection. There is still no suitable strategy for therapeutic
treatment, drugs, or vaccines [1]. Current clinical data indicate that the severity is due to
cytokine storms and immunopathogenesis leading to inflammation in the lungs, especially in
the alveolar tissue. Given the importance of the disease COVID-19 to biology, the TLRSARS-CoV-2 interaction appears to be an appropriate target for the concept of a suitable
therapeutic strategy against the pandemic [2, 3, 4].
Nowadays, the incidence of serious diseases is increasing day by day all over the world due
to the lack of adequate therapy and vaccine development [5, 6, 7, 8]. Vaccination against
Covid-19 which has become a pandemic in the human population is the most practical way to
control the outbreak [9, 10, 11]. The novel coronavirus does not contain a drug or vaccine to
prevent it from spreading to humans. In this regard, we are concerned about the need to
develop a vaccine candidate against this deadly virus. Immunizations are an essential part of
primary health care. Vaccines are the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks.
They contribute to global health security and play an important role against antibiotic
resistance. However, traditional vaccine production methods take decades to overcome
pathogens and antigens, disease and immunity. To support this, reverse vaccinology is an
approach that reduces the time and cost of identifying vaccine candidates whose traditional
methods have failed [12, 13, 14].
Two decades ago, classical or traditional methods of identifying protein targets were used to
develop recombinant vaccines against microbial diseases [15, 16]. Traditional methods for
developing vaccines involving whole organisms or large proteins result in unnecessary
exposure to antigens and an increased likelihood of allergic reactions. This problem can be
overcome by using peptide vaccines containing short fragments of immunogenic peptides
that can cause a strong and targeted immune response, thus avoiding the risk of allergic
reactions. Recent advances in computational biology have opened new doors for the design of
effective silicon vaccines. This study used an immuno-informatics approach to obtain a
peptide vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 [17].
Peptide based vaccines are essentially an in-silico approach that does not require in-vitro
culture [18]. Peptide preparation is simple, easy to prepare, faster and less expensive for solid
phase peptide synthesis. In considering the novelty of a peptide vaccine, it is most important
to choose the right peptide [19, 20]. When selecting the right peptide, the antigen plays an
important role in the effectiveness of the vaccine for example: the pathogen life-cycle,
molecular-pathogenesis including host entry, and pathogen survival. Therefore, vaccines can
be developed to trigger an immune response that can trigger pathogen invasion [21, 22, 23].
The main mechanism of peptide vaccines is based on chemical methods of synthesizing Bcells and T-cell epitopes, which can trigger specific immune responses. B-cell epitopes bind
to T-cell epitopes to make them immunogenic [24, 25]. In this study, we used the Immune
Epitope and Resource Analysis Database (IEDB) to catalog the data available for other
coronaviruses [26, 27, 28]. Parallel bioinformatics prediction a priori identifies potential B
and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. This prognosis can facilitate the effective design of
high priority vaccines against this virus [29, 30, 31].
Various types of immune cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, myelinexpressing T lymphocytes, B cells, initiated microglia and responsive astrocytes, are

important for the pathogenesis of infection [32, 33, 34]. Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) are a
group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which binds exogenous pathogen associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) hence involved in pathogen identification and protection of
hosts located on the surface or endosomes of various cell types such as dendritic cells,
macrophages, B cells, T cells, epithelial cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and endothelial
cells [35], which plays an important role in triggering the innate immune response by
producing IFN Type I inflammatory cytokines and various mediators [36, 37]. TLR agonists
and antagonists have been suggested as compounds with broad therapeutic potential against
various respiratory diseases associated with antiviral drugs and vaccine adjuvants [37, 38].
Among all types, TLR3 receiving double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), TLR7 and 8 viral
transmits single-stranded RNA and is therefore likely involved in SARS-CoV-2 clearing. The
main protein for myeloid 88 differentiation response (MyD88) is an adapter that binds TLRs
to downstream molecules [38]. Activation of TLR via MyD88 and TRIF-dependent pathways
induces nuclear translocation of transcription factors NF-κB -3 and IRF-7 with the
development of innate anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) and type I. IFN-α / β,
which is important for antiviral responses [39].
Currently, immune responsive target peptides can be developed and approved for survival in
biological monitoring systems before vaccines are available for exposure and practical
studies [40]. We believe this ideal epitope vaccine can increase immune response and further
reduce the risk of reinfection by increasing the immunogenicity of the host [41, 42]. In this
study, it was hypothesized that advanced computer screening could identify peptides suitable
for subunit vaccine preparation. We used the complete set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to extract
antigenic elements that produce B-cell and T-cell immunity. By integrating these peptides,
we have developed epitope-based vaccine candidates with precise binding to the Toll like
Receptors 7 and 8 (TLR-7 and 8) for an effective immune response and with the lowest
possible toxicity and hypersensitivity. Since this method has been validated experimentally
with constructs against other pathogenic species, we assume that the proposed structural
formulation has the potential to produce an effective immune response against the coronavirus. Wet laboratory researchers are expected to validate our design with the hope of
providing protection for healthy communities from the COVID-19 pandemic(Figure 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Retrieval of Protein Sequences and selection:
Whole proteomes of the SARS-CoV-2, encoding all proteins were retrieved from NCBI [43]
and reviewed proteins were retrieved from the Universal Protein (UniProt) [44] database in
FASTA format.Pathogen mediated core proteins were determined by using CD-HIT suite
[45] that withdraw proteins sharing sequence identity of 60%.
Antigenicity prediction:
By setting the default parameters, all protein sequences were sent to VaxiJenv2.0 to find out
the highest antigenic protein. VaxiJenv2.0 [46] is designed to predict the most potent
subunit vaccine candidate with an accuracy of 70-90%. All antigenic proteins with the
highest antigenicity scores were selected for further evaluation.
Subcellular localization:
Recognition of immunogenic proteins by immune cells to stimulate the immune response is
one of the crucial factors for the selection of good vaccine candidates, which can be studied
from the subcellular localization. Therefore, CELLO2GO [47] was deployed to estimate the
protein sequences with the highest antigenic score.

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

Linear B-cell epitope prediction:
Based on their spatial structure, the B-cell epitopes can be ordered in two types; a linear or
continuous and another was conformational or discontinuous. The linear B-cell epitopes was
predicted using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) [48]. Surface accessibility,
hydrophilicity and flexibility properties are also important. Therefore different methods were
implemented respectively along with the default parameters of IEDB to predict these
properties, We have predicted the linear B-cell epitope using Bepipred linear epitope
prediction method. The location of linear B-cell epitopes was predicted by Bepipred using a
combination of a Hidden Markov Model and a propensity scale method. The residues with
scores above the threshold (default value is 0.35) were considered to be a part of an epitope.
Helper T-cell (HTL) Epitope Prediction:
The requisite of T cell receptors to epitopes complexed with major histocompatibility
complex class II (MHC) molecule can lead to T cell activation; To predict MHC class II
restricted HTL epitopes, protein sequences were subjected to NetMHCII Pan 3.1 server [49]
with a threshold value of 0.5% and subject to a 2% value for strong binding peptides (SB)
and weakly binding peptides (WB) respectively, to determine the binding affinity of the
MHC-II epitope and allele. Here a firmly binding epitope with the maximum number of
binding HLA-DR, DP and DQ was selected as a possible candidate for the epitope.
Prediction of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte(CTL):
Prediction for CTL epitopes is crucial for consistent vaccine design. Therefore, the amino
acid sequence constituting the CTL epitopes of selected protein was predicted using
NetCTL.1.2 [50] server along with the default parameters.
IFN Gamma (γ) Epitope Prediction:
Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) is a cytokine that is essential for innate and adaptive immunity
and, apart from stimulating natural killer cells and neutrophils, acts as the primary activator
of macrophages. For innate and humoral immunity, IFN-γ plays an important role in
antitumor ,antiviral, and immunoregulatory activities. Therefore, IFN-γ-inducing epitopes
were important for the design of a potential multi-epitope vaccine [19]. For the designed
peptide, 15-mer IFN-γ epitopes were predicted using the IFNepitope server [51]. For the
adjuvant and the main vaccine peptide IFN- γ epitope predictions were carried out separately,
due to the restrictions in the no. of residues that can be used for prediction by the server.
Conservancy analysis:
In order to check the conservancy of the epitopes, they were evaluated among all the strains
present globally by using the epitope conservancy analysis tool at the IEDB [48] analysis
resource.
Allergenicity assessment:
The allergenicity of all the conserved epitopes were taken to be analysed using AllergenF
pv.1.0 server [52], which is based on the amino acids in the protein sequences in data sets
were described by five E-descriptors.

3D Structure of epitopes:
The 3D structures of all the non-allergenic and 100% conserved epitopes were modelled
using I-TASSER [53], ORION: web server [54] and PEP-FOLD 3 server [55].
Homology Modelling and structure analysis of Target proteins:
For homology modelling, all the TLR proteins of human (1-10) were retrieved from UniProt
and modelled using the Phyre2 server [56], followed by refinement of the modelled proteins,
by using 3DRefine server [57]. Model validation is a significant advance to identify possible
errors in rough structures and to analyze the quality of models during the refinement process.
The refined model quality assessment of the model has been done by generating
Ramachandran Plot by using Schrodinger server andPROSA [58]. The ProSA server
assessed the general quality of the protein models as a z-score. At the point when the
predicted model's z-scores are outside the typical range of primary proteins, it demonstrates
an inaccurate structure. The 3D structure of protein was visualized using PyMol [59].
Based upon iterative threading assembly and simulation methods, I-TASSER server33 [60]
generated five 3D models for the individual protein sequence and ranked all the models based
on their C-scores. C-score values measure similarity between the query and template based
on the significance of threading template alignment and the query coverage parameters. The
Ramachandran plot analysis of refined structure revealed the percentage of residues were
located in most favoured region, most allowed and generously allowed region, while also
showed the residues were in disallowed region. However, ProSA-Web calculated Z-score of
−4.52 indicating the model was not in the range of native protein conformation. Furthermore,
the ModFold6 server was used to evaluate the overall quality of the model.

Human Receptor Proteins for Molecular Docking Studies:
For molecular docking study, to ensure the interaction between human receptor proteins
include 10 TLR of human and our predicted non allergenic, 100% conserved CTL epitopes
using the Autodock 4.2.6 [61]. The protein ligand complex showing best binding affinity will
be further proceed for MD-Simulation in order to check the stability.
Molecular dynamics simulations:
Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to check the stability of the anchored
epitope receptor protein complexes using the GROMACS v2016.3 software [62]. For each
complex, a production simulation of 50 ns at 350 K and a pressure of 1 bar was obtained after
protocols for minimal energy savings and for balancing the solvation system had been carried
out. In addition, path analysis was performed to check for H-transition and Root Mean Square
Deviation (RMSD).
Population Coverage:
Population coverages for sets of T cell epitopes were computed using the tool provided by the
Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) [48]. This tool uses the distribution of MHC alleles (with
at least 4-digit resolution, e.g., A*02:01) within a defined population to estimate the
population coverage for a set of T cell epitopes.

Results
Protein targets:
A total 192720 protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2, encoding all types of proteins was
retrieved from NCBI and 14 reviewed proteins were retrieved from the UniProt (Universal
Protein) database in FASTA format. Then, CD-HIT analysis was performed to identify the
pathogen core proteins by “a clustering approach that relies on multiple alignments” and got
31 clusters having proteins sharing identity of 60% (Table s1).
Antigenicity prediction:
In-order to detect the most potent antigenic protein, all the protein sequences were analyzed
by the VaxiJen server, which were also retrieved and revealed the most potent antigenic
protein. Among 31 proteins, 26 proteins were identified as the highest potential antigenic
protein that is 0.6123 of total prediction score as well (Table 1).

Sub-cellular localization
As we all believed that the sub-cellular location of the protein plays an important role in
determining its function. In this study we identified sub-cellular location of all our 26 most
antigenic proteins from which 8 proteins were found in extracellular part of a eukaryote
model likewise 18 proteins were found in plasma membrane, two were found in cytoplasm,
one in mitochondria and three were found in chloroplast. All show diverse molecular
functionality like RNA binding, structural molecule activity, transmembrane transporter
activity, protein binding (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2: The number of proteins shown in each subcellular location represents the number
of ‘locative proteins’. The dataset comprises 38 proteins distributed in 14 subcellular locations.

Primary and secondary antigenic protein structure determination:
In this study, we analyzed the most significant antigenic protein to comprehend the secondary
structure as well as their physiochemical characteristics property. We obtained protein
lengths as well as their molecular weights in theoretical Isoelectric point (PI) and in Daltons
in result. The instability index (II) was computed, which showed that the protein sequences
are all stable. Also we calculated the positively charged and negatively charged residues. The
atoms are found having H, C, N, O, and S with the analysis of amino-acid composition of
these proteins. The striking average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was obtained to be negative
by the calculation of aliphatic index, which indicated the protein hydrophilic nature. So the
protein is liable to have enhanced interaction with other proteins. The study of protein
secondary structure found the dominancy of random coils with extended strand of α- helix
and β turns (Table 2).

Linear B-cell epitopes detection
The most significant steps in epitope based vaccine design are the detection &
characterization of B-cell epitopes in target antigen. The antigenic peptides prediction was
done by IEDB (Immune Epitope Database) analysis resource derived from the Kolaskar and
Tongaonkar’s method, where determination of antigenic epitopes were by analyzing the
physiochemical properties of aminoacid. The output 26 antigenic proteins are found having
430 antigenic peptides in the amino acid range of 5-20 length. We also predicted the
maximum residual score for every amino acid in this analysis. Out of that some residues
were predicted as conformational with CTL epitopes that can be taken as valuable candidates
for peptide based vaccine development. Besides, the result revealed about the average
antigenic propensity score of the predicted epitope was 1.002 and the maximum and
minimum score was 1.237 and 0.550. In the X and Y- axis the graphical representation of
sequence position and antigenic propensity were shown which represents the predicted
antigenic residues.

T-Cell Epitope Prediction
T cells when bound to the MHC molecule, it recognizes epitopes. So epitopes prediction only
is possible after computing their MHC-binding profile. The epitopes binding prediction to
MHC I is more precise than to MHC II as the molecular interactions between epitopes &
MHC I and MHC II complexes are different. In our IEDB analysis study, we identified 765
predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes which were exclusive and established coming from different
T. cruzi known protein regions found in the T. cruzi H > 0.5 masked proteome.At first, 8068
HLA class I epitopes were anticipated inside glycoproteins of SARS-COV-2. Investigation
based on percentile rank sifted 1150 peptide epitopes by setting the boundary of binding
affinity>0.3. Every one of them had an extensive binding affinity for the 12 superfamily
alleles. These epitopes are chosen alongside their highlights and respective binding alleles.
Activation of T cells is possible by binding of T cell receptors with the epitope complex
along with MHC class II molecules. The binding affinities of MHC II and respective epitopes
are determined by the server NetMHCIIpan having threshold values 2% and 0.5% for weak
binding peptides and strong binding peptides respectively. In our case we selected putative
epitopes candidates’ characteristics by the strong binding epitopes with more number of
binding affinity with HLA- DP, DR and DQ allele. From all HLA (DP, DQ and DR) 30,711
epitopes were predicted. We have taken all (765) the epitopes below 50% affinity for further
study. In Table 3 we have provided selected epitopes with their respective alleles.

Antigenicity, Conservancy and allergenicity assessment
The antigenicity nature of vaccine candidates has a vital role in binding ability with the B
and T cell receptor and respective immune response in the host cell. Here we used VaxiJen
v2.0 to predict the antigenicity of the screened proteins. And found antigenicity 0.5999 with
a 0.4% threshold. The findings indicate the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are
antigenic in nature. Similar type of report was reported by Dimitrov et al. where allergen
proteins induce an IgE antibody response. We should take care that vaccine candidates should
not show any allergic reaction in study. For that allergenicity of the sequence was predicted
by the Allertop tool. Our potential protein was not distinguished as an allergen in Allertop
based data. All the peptides were subjected to check the conservancy globally, so as to check
the conservancy nature of the predicted epitopes was evaluated between all the strains present
globally at the IEDB analysis resource by using epitope conservancy analysis tool. Among all
286 peptides showed 100% conserved at a specified identity level are hence taken. We also
checked the allergenicity for ensuring the candidate vaccine, which must not stimulate any
allergic reactions after introduced into the host body. As predicted by AllerTOP Allergen
PHP web servers, as a result we got 148 vaccine candidates was found to be non-allergen
(Table S2).
Modeling of epitopes 3D Structure
The three dimensional structures of all the 148 non-allergenic and 100% conserved epitopes
were modeled using PEP-FOLD server and the receptor TLR proteins were modelled using
Phyre2 server and further refinement was done(Figure 3).

Interaction of Predicted Vaccines with Potential human Receptors:
The human receptor proteins and the CTL epitopes binding affinity were obtained by
Molecular docking. 10 human receptors proteins were docked out of 497 predicted CTL
epitope including the furin and all TLRS. Out of 497, only 56 predicted CTL epitopes gave
strong binding affinities in terms of attractive van der Waals global energy. Among all, seven
epitopes were obtained having elevated degree of conservancy; antigenic amino acid residues
and also positive IEDB immunogenicity score (Table 4). These above explained character of
an epitope based peptide can be a promising peptide vaccine candidate. Besides, the rest of
the epitopes have shown poor binding affinities. All seven epitopes modelled using Pep Fold
server was docked with human Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The predicted CTL epitopes
“ITRFQTLLALHRSYL” and “RGMVLGSLAATVRLQ” exhibited the highest binding
affinity of−6.8 kcal/mol with both TLR8 and TLR2 respectively and
“ITRFQTLLALHRSYL” had -6.5 kcal/mol of binding energy with TLR7(Figure 4) while
“ELLVYAADPAMHAAS” exhibited the lowest binding affinity of −4.8 kcal/mol with TLR
9(Table 5).The Docking energies of previously mentioned epitopes which is having lowest
global energy are nowhere very close to those of top seven epitopes. Moreover, the postdocking result uncovered the presence of five hydrogen bonds in protein-peptide complexes
inside a distance of 3.68 Å-5.0 Å, which is bringing up the solidness of the docked complex.
Furthermore, the unwavering quality of the docked complex looks to be well preserved with
hydrogen bond. in our study we found 7 epitopes that can be taken as potential vaccine
candidate for the epitope based vaccine design because of their strong binding affinity within
the groove of protein, lowest energy, which point out the strength of docked complexes.
Furthermore, this peptide was discovered to be conserved among worldwide strains of SARSCOV-2.

Molecular dynamics simulation
To explore the physical movements of atoms and molecules of the ultimate epitope vaccine
candidate, we performed the molecular dynamics simulation. We mainly took care of its
density, pressure, temperature, energy components and volume, which were evaluated and
their stabilities were confirmed by this dynamic simulation process the stability of the
receptor proteins complexes and multiepitope vaccines candidate as ligand was studied
through root mean square deviation of the protein backbone and all side chain residues
respectively, of the multi-epitope antibody develop for the time-frame of 10 ns. Further to
analyze the stability of the ligand receptor interaction the RMSF of amino acid side chains
was noted. We found here very mild fluctuations in the RMSD graph, which indicates the
uninterrupted interaction between ligand and receptor. In other hand, the RMSF plot showed

The RMSF peaks were found to be very elevated, greater than 6.4Å, which showed high
degree of flexibility in the receptor-ligand complex. The simulation also monitored the
secondary structure elements of proteins(Figure 5).

Population Coverage:
The expected population coverage is the percentage of individuals in the population who are
likely to induce an immune response to at least one T cell epitope in the set. In order to
identify the epitope set associated with the MHC allele that would maximize population
coverage, we took a greedy approach: (i) We first identified the MHC allele with the highest
individual population range and then the set associated with the epitope was initialized (ii)
We gradually added epitopes associated with other MHC alleles, which result in the greatest
increase in accumulated population coverage. As a result, all epitopes had a mean combined
Class I and Class II coverage of 94%. This step was performed using the entire data set for
the world population, and the MHC restricted allele used in this case is (A ∗ 01: 01, A ∗ 02:

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this analysis is to recognize potential crossreactive vaccine candidates and
defensible using a holistic approach to immune informatics and reverse vaccinology. The
reverse vaccinology approach can be useful to reduce the time frame for vaccine candidate
discovery and advantages over traditional methods which tend to Focus more on the
development of pathogens and protein extraction, and this large-scale testing of proteins is
expensive and time consuming [63, 64, 65].Researchers have identified many in-silico
vaccine candidates that can generate enormous clinical and pre-clinical outcomes [66]. In this
study, suspected antigenic proteins identified from B cells (linear and conformal) as well as T
cell epitopes (HTL and CTL) may possibly build a peptide vaccine for SARS-COV-2 [67,
68]. Our investigation revealed 3,354 proteins as non-redundant proteins, although because of
their 60 percent sequencing similarity, 84 proteins were classified as redundant. [69, 70]. The
excess protein has a paralogical function which is caused by duplication during evolution.
Since replication, abnormalities or mutations in excess protein are less dangerous to the
overall health and are of the organism thus not seen as desirable targets for the creation of
vaccines [71]. On the other hand, orthological the proteins are not interchangeable and are
known to be more conserved in microbial species and strains and may also be suitable
vaccine development candidates [72]. In the next step, the non-redundant protein was
compared with the human reference protein. It was found that 556 proteins were human
homologues, while 2798 proteins were non-human homologues. Removal of homologous
host proteins is important because targeting these proteins will elicit a powerful host immune
response. In comparison, homologous host proteins can be integrated and recombined to the
host genome and are therefore avoided for vaccine production [73]. Identifying essential and
non-homologous proteins is very important since most vaccines attack the pathogen's key
cellular processes. The key proteome is a collection of proteins that are required to support
cell life and thus have a wider therapeutic potential [74]. Core pathogen proteins were
classified using the CD-HIT "multiple alignments clustering approach" study and had 31
protein clusters with 60 percent identity.
Recent developments in immunological bioinformatics have culminated in tools and servers
that can decrease the costs and time of producing conventional vaccines. The development of
the effective epitope-based vaccines remains difficult due to the trouble in identifying
appropriate immunodominant and epitope candidates [75]. Appropriate prediction of the
antigenic epitope of the protein target using an immunoinformatics approach is therefore
important for the design of the vaccine on an epitope basis [76, 77].
Here we investigate the development of epitope-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 structural
proteins (spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, non-structural protein, ORF and envelope). This
protein plays an important role In the period of replication and the structure of virus particles.
The spike Protein plays a significant role In the binding of the virus to the receptors on the
host surface and in sequential fusion to induce viral entry into the host cell TLR7 and 8 [78,
79, 80]. Membrane and envelope proteins are essential for replication, particle collection in
human cells, and entry of viruses [81, 82]. Corona virus nucleocapsids are structural proteins
that form complexes with genomic RNA, interact with viral membrane proteins during virion
assembly and play an important role in increasing the efficiency of transcription and viral
assembly [83]. NS proteins (NS1 and NS2) formed by a smallest segment of RNA present in
virus-infected cells. NSP is transported to the nucleus and involved in the Inhibiting host
mRNA synthesis, core viral mRNA export, and viral protein translation, but is not found in
viral particles. NSPs play an important role in viral virulence by combatting the work of a

host interferon. Five major open reading frames (ORF) are encoded by the coronavirus
genome, including a 5 'shifted polyprotein skeleton (ORF1a/ORF1ab) and four 3' canonical
structural proteins essential to all spike(S), membrane(M), envelope(E), and nucleocapsid(N)
proteins, including all coronaviruses. The 3D models of the construction were then created
and an online server was used and then tested by a Ramachandran plot analysis. Moreover,
with the epitope vaccine docking research various toll-like receptors such as TLR2, 3 7, 8 &
9 were performed. We aim TLR7, and mostly TLR8. In the entire antiviral reaction, both
TLR7 and 8 are significant participants. Dendritic plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) and B cells are
activated by TLR7-specific agonists and primarily induce IFN-and IFN-regulated
cytokines.TLR8-specific agonists activate myeloid DCs, monocytes, even monocyte-derived
DCs, and primarily lead to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The
study was performed on the structural protein levels of primary, secondary and tertiary.
Conserved B cell epitopes were forecast by IEDB research resource and BepiPred 2.0 [48].
The epitope location in the 3D structure of the protein was visualized by Pymol [59].They
were tested to further improve the allergenic and physicochemical properties of the expected
epitopes. Analysis of digestion indicates that the peptides administered were stable and safe
to use during the analysis.
A good vaccine should have strong physicochemical properties in its development,
formulation, storage and use, in addition to enhanced immune response capability.
Formational B cell epitopes play a crucial role in induction humoral reactions. The high
propensity of this structure to activate B lymphocytes is shown by the presence of a large
number of B cell epitopes within the vaccine molecule. In order to successfully pass the
vaccine protein to the antigen-presenting cells, the binding affinity of the vaccine to the
immune receptor (TLR7 and 8) is important. The results of the docking analysis revealed a
strong interaction between the vaccine protein and TLR7 and 8.
The outcomes of the antigenicity analysis observed vary, which is known to be the essential
antigenic capacity of a potent peptide, and all immunoinformatics tests have shown similar
numbers. Moreover, the binding domain of HLA-B was found in both experiments to be
preserved and reconciled with current research efforts [84, 85].
Potential of the CTL epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins have been predicted. For
the selected peptides, molecular docking methods were used to evaluate MHC-1 and binding
affinities of peptide [86]. The binding affinity of peptide-MHC-I complexes has also been
validated by other results, including C-terminal cleavage affinities. 140 peptides have been
identified as potential targets for responsive MHC-I protein interactions (HLA-B) with
maximum binding affinities and antigenicity. This increases the likelihood of promising
targets for potential residue vaccine targets. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins were measured
and cross tested with the IEDB server in terms of surface usability, hydrophobic, surface
stability, and antigenicity [87]. Extensive literature studies were conducted and selected
peptides against SARS-CoV-2 were not identified. Predicted peptides have been modeled by
I-TASSER, ORION: Web Server and PEP-FOLD3 server and MHC-1 server for more
refinement using Autodock Vina and Haddock. [88]. PyMOL has been used to check the
interactions of docked complexes. In order to test the stability of the peptide receptor
complex, a molecular dynamic simulation of the docking complexes (peptides and TLR7 and
8) was performed using the GROMACS 5.1.1 version. Various analyzes were then carried
out such as energy minimisation, pressure calculation, temperature measurement and
potential energy measurement. During the production phase, the temperature and pressure of
MD simulation system were roughly 300K and 1 ambient, using high voltage pulses (duration

10 ns and 1000 ps, amplitude 15 kV, repeat frequency 1–30 kHz) a stable simulation system
and a good md run, respectively. MD simulation system temperature and pressure (peptide
and TLR-2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 complexes) during production were approximately 10ns and 1000
ps, respectively, implying stable systems and strong MD activity [89]. The complex of root
mean square deviation (RMSD) plot represents the structural variations in the overall
structure of the peptide complex and the receptor. We have also regularly incorporated
epitopes associated with other MHC alleles, which has resulted in the largest increase in total
population coverage. As a result, all epitopes had a combined Class 1 and Class 2 coverage of
100 per cent of the world population dataset detected in East Africa followed by Central
America, North America and West Africa. Estimates of population coverage are based on
binding impacts. for MHC and/or T cell limitation, but the technique can be used more
widely. The algorithm has been introduced as a web application that can be used by
vaccinations or diagnoses dependent on epitopes can be formulated to maximize population
spread, thus attenuating variability (i.e. the number of distinct epitopes included in the
diagnosis or vaccine) and minimizing disparities in coverage among different ethnic groups.
The development of a potent vaccine includes a detailed analysis and investigation of
immunological associations with SARS-CoV-2 [90, 91]. However, due to the severity and
urgency of the COVID-19 outbreak, innovative approaches would not be adequate to serve
the urgency of the situation. However in the case of silicon and numerical forecasts, it is
helpful to lead researchers in discovering a potential vaccine and helping to monitor COVID19. Vaccine production is a costly and lengthy process with a high risk of failure and a
number of years are needed to produce a successful commercial vaccine. Computational
analyzes indicate that the registered epitope-based peptide vaccine could have the ability to
protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Conclusion
TLR has diverse pleiotropic effects on the immune system and has been shown to promote
antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity, TLR7/8 induce the development of IgG and
the recruitment of B-cell cytokines and the secretion of Interferon- (IFN- ) by natural
killer cells. In our research, immuno-informatics techniques were used to design a possible
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate consisting of CTL, HTL and Interferon- (IFN- )epitopes
that could cause robust immune responses. Possible vaccine candidates for structural, nonstructural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to be both antigenic and
immunogenic. The association analysis between TLR receptor and CTL, HTL epitopes,
resulted in a good binding affinity of spike protein peptides to TLR 7 and 8. The stability of
the vaccine candidate has been confirmed by molecular docking tests. According to many
studies, the creation of an epitope-based vaccine is a successful technique that can contribute
to the production of vaccines with the potential to cause the necessary immunogenicity.
Based on many in vitro and in vivo studies, if scientifically and clinically formulated,
epitope-based vaccines provide several advantages over other vaccine types, including quick
and accurate design, time-and cost-effective formulations, and ideal immunogenicity with
reduced adverse effects. However the findings of this analysis in silicon must be checked
using laboratory and animal models.
