Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-

16

CoV-2) and has spread world-wide with millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths to

17

date. The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective

18

vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the

19

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV

20

genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein

21

expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody

22

and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody

23

responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-

24

specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further

25

development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Significance Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective

38

vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles

39

virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine

40

backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive

41

immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as

42

antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover,

43

the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace,

44

when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19.

45

Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public

46

health threats.

76 Introduction

50

and emerged towards the end of 2019 as causative agent of pneumonia in the Hubei province in

51

China (1). The World Health Organisation named the disease Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-

52

19), and officially declared the pandemic state on March 11, 2020. Human coronaviruses have

53

been known for decades as one of the causative agents of the common cold, but two previous

54

coronavirus outbreaks, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-1) and

55

the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), have demonstrated the remarkable

56

pathogenic potential of human beta coronaviruses. Around 10,000 people have been infected by

57

SARS and MERS, which has resulted in a death toll of about 1,500 patients, but the outbreaks

58

remained largely confined in terms of time or spread, respectively. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2

59

spreads effectively and at a rapid pace by direct transmission with an R0 of at least 2 to 2.5 (2, 3).

60

Due to high transmissibility and extensive community spread, this novel coronavirus has already

61

caused over 12.1 million infections and over 550,000 deaths (as of 10 July 2020;

62

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019), while world-wide shut-downs

63

of social life and economy to confine the spread of this respiratory virus are causing have

64

considerable impact.

65

After the emergence of SARS in 2002 and then MERS in 2012, vaccine development efforts have

66

been initiated, including the use of recombinant measles virus (MeV) vaccine as a platform concept

67

(4) to develop vector vaccine candidates against both agents and showed promising results.

68

Recombinant MeV vectors encoding the unmodified SARS-CoV Spike protein induced high titers

69

of neutralizing antibodies as well as IFN- T cell responses (5, 6) and conferred protection to

70

immunized animals upon pathogen challenge by lowering virus titers more than 100-fold (5). For

71

MERS, we have demonstrated that both, high titers of neutralizing antibodies as well as effective

72

and polyfunctional T cell responses, were induced in vaccinated animals (7, 8) and conferred

73

protection (7). Based on these data, a MeV-based MERS-vaccine candidate has been selected by

74

the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Initiative (CEPI) for further clinical development

75

(www.cepi.net/research_dev/our-portfolio).

76

Here, we explored the potential of recombinant MeV as vectors for the expression of the SARS-

77

CoV-2 spike protein (S) as successfully applied for the development of MERS- (7, 8) and SARS-

78

vaccine candidates (5, 6) as well as numerous other pathogens (4). The S glycoprotein was chosen

79

as antigen for its role as primary target of neutralizing antibodies (6, 7) and the exemplary capability

80

of MERS-CoV S protein to trigger strong cell-mediated immune responses when expressed by MeV

81

in our front-runner MERS vaccine candidate (7, 8). The SARS-CoV-2 S protein-encoding gene was

82

inserted into two different positions of the MeV genome to modulate antigen expression, and both

recombinant MeV were successfully rescued. The virus expressing lower S protein levels resulted

84

in stable amplification over at least 10 passages, while impairment of replication was insignificant.

85

Indeed, immunization of IFNAR-/--CD46Ge mice induced strong and functional humoral and cellular

86

immune responses directed against both MeV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein biased for Th1-type T

cell and antibody responses, illustrating the potential of MeV platform-based COVID-19 vaccine

candidates.

Results

94

Since the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike proteins (S) have been shown to potently induce

95

humoral and cellular immune responses, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was chosen as appropriate

96

antigen to be expressed by the recombinant MeV vaccine platform. A codon-optimized full-length

97

gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein was cloned into two different additional transcription units

98

(ATUs) in the vaccine strain MeVvac2 genome, either downstream of the P (post P) or H (post H)

99

gene cassettes (Fig. 1A). Recombinant viruses were successfully generated and amplified up to

100

P10 in Vero cells with titers of up to 4107 TCID50/ml. The stability of the viral genomes was

101

demonstrated via sequencing after RT-PCR of viruses in P2 or P10. In parallel to Sanger

102

sequencing of the ATU-region encompassing the SARS-CoV-2-S gene, the full genome was

103

sequenced using next generation sequencing with a coverage of 4 to 29,683 reads of each position

104

(Suppl. Fig. S1) in P2. Both methods revealed no mutations across the whole vaccine genomes

105

but a single A to G substitution on position 9 of the non-coding trailer region of the MeVvac2-SARS2-

106

S(H) clone used for in vivo studies.

107

To verify SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression levels, Western blot analysis of Vero cells infected with

108

the MeVvac2-SARS2-S was performed. The S protein expression was slightly attenuated when cells

109

were infected with viruses encoding the antigen in the ATU post-H compared to the post-P

110

constructs (Fig. 1B). However, there was less overall viral protein expression in cells infected with

111

post-P construct. Comparative growth kinetics with the vaccine viruses containing the SARS-CoV-

112

2 S gene and the MVvac2-ATU(P) control virus revealed that the MeVvac2 encoding full-length SARS-

113

CoV-2 S gene in post-P position grew remarkably different to the control virus, with approximately

114

100-fold reduced maximal titers. In contrast, growth of MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) was much closer to

115

MVvac2-ATU(P) with only a slight trend for lower titers (Fig. 1 C and D).

116

The impaired growth of MeVvac2-SARS2-S(P) was accompanied by a hyper-fusogenic phenotype

117

(Fig. 1E, Suppl.Fig. S2A), which was also observed for the post-H vaccine candidate, but to a lesser

118

extent. Therefore, fusion activity was quantified and compared to the parental MVvac2-ATU(P) as

119

well as the MVNSe-GFP(N), which is known for its hyperfusogenic phenotype due to a V94M

120

substitution in the F2 subunit of the MeV fusion protein (9). MVvac2-ATU(P) induced fusion of

121

16.8±0.8 (mean±SD) Vero cells 30 h after infection. MeVvac2-SARS2-S(P) revealed approximately

122

4-fold enhanced fusion activity (syncytia including 70±8 cells) while MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) just fused

123

41±6 cells, thereby representing an intermediate phenotype. However, fusion activity of the latter

124

became surpassed by MVNSe-GFP(N) that fused 56±4 cells in 30 h under the same conditions

125

(Suppl. Fig. S2B).

126

To investigate if this increased fusion activity is due to SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-to-cell

127

fusion, we expressed the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by transfection of the eukaryotic expression

128

plasmid pcDNA3.1-SARS2-S into SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2-negative 293T as well as into

129

receptor-positive Vero cells. Indeed, expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein induced syncytia of

130

Vero, but not of 293T cells (Suppl. Fig. S3).

131

These data demonstrate that the hyperfusogenic phenotype of the SARS-CoV-2 S-encoding MeV

132

is linked to expression of a fusion-active form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating that cells

133

infected by the vaccine candidates express a functional S protein. Thus, cloning and rescue of

134

MeVs expressing correctly folded SARS-CoV-2 S was achieved successfully. Since higher S

135

protein expression levels impaired viral replication, MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) was chosen for further

136

characterization in vivo.

137
138

MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) induces neutralizing antibodies against MeV and SARS-CoV-2

139

To test the efficacy of MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) in vivo, genetically modified IFNAR-/--CD46Ge mice

140

were used, since they are the prime small animal model for analysis of MeV-derived vaccines (10).

141

Groups of 4 - 6 animals were immunized via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route on days 0 and 28 with

142

1105 TCID50 of MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) or empty MVvac2-ATU(P) as a control. As positive control,

143

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide gel (Alum) was injected

144

subcutaneously, and medium-inoculated mice served as mock controls. 21 days after the second

145

immunization, sera of immunized mice were analyzed in comparison to pre-bleed and post-prime

146

immunization sera by ELISA on antigen-coated plates for total IgG antibodies binding to MeV bulk

147

antigens (Fig. 2G-I) or SARS-CoV-2-S protein (Fig. 2A-C). Sera of mice vaccinated with MeVvac2-

148

SARS2-S(H) contained IgG antibodies that bound to SARS-CoV-2-S protein (Fig. 2B and C),

149

whereas no antibodies were found in mice before vaccination (Fig. 2A), or in MeV or mock-

150

immunized control mice. Moreover, final sera of mice vaccinated with any recombinant MeV had

151

IgG in the serum binding to MeV bulk antigens, indicating at least one successful vaccination with

152

MeVs and general vector immunogenicity (Fig. 2G-I). The control S protein vaccine did induce

153

higher levels of S protein-binding IgG than MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H).

154

We next determined the neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2D-F) or MeV

155

(Fig. 2J-L). Most mice immunized with recombinant MeV, including those receiving the control virus,

156

had developed MeV neutralizing antibody titers (VNT) after the first immunization (Fig. 2K).

157

However, one mouse of the MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) cohort initially reacted only weakly and another

158

mouse not at all, reflecting individual differences in response to immunization. All animals had

159

developed neutralizing antibodies after the second immunization, and a 3-fold increase was

160

observed upon the second immunization (257 to 800 VNT, Fig. 2K, L). Neutralizing antibodies

161

against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in mice vaccinated with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) after the second

162

immunization, and reached a titer of 15 to 80 in three out of 6 mice (Fig. 2F). These titers were in

163

the range of human reconvalescent sera tested in parallel (VNT 10 to 60; Fig. 2M). No VNTs against

164

MeV or SARS-CoV-2 were detected in control mice inoculated with medium alone. Interestingly,

165

the alumn-adjuvanted recombinant S protein did not induce any neutralizing antibodies despite

166

higher binding IgG levels in ELISA, indicating that these antibodies bind to other epitopes of S or

167

with lower affinity than those induced by the MeV-based vaccine candidate. In summary, the SARS-

168

CoV-2-S protein-expressing MeV elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses against MeV and

169

SARS-CoV-2.

Splenocytes of animals vaccinated with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) react to SARS-CoV-2 S protein-

172

specific stimulation

173

To assess the ability of MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) to induce SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immune

174

responses, splenocytes of vaccinated animals were analyzed for antigen-specific IFN- secretion

175

by ELISpot assay. Towards this, antigen-specific T cells were re-stimulated by co-cultivation with

176

the syngeneic murine DC cell lines JAWSII or DC2.4 stably expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

177

For JAWSII cells, bulk cultures of transduced cells were obtained by flow cytometric sorting. For

178

DC2.4 cells, single cell clones were generated by limiting dilution of sorted respective of bulks

179

cultures. Antigen expression by transduced DCs was verified by Western Blot analysis (data not

180

shown).

181

ELISpot assays using splenocytes of vaccinated animals in co-culture with DC2.4-SARS2-S cells

182

revealed more than 1,400 IFN- secreting cells per 1106 splenocytes after immunization with

183

MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H), respectively (Fig. 3). In contrast, co-culture with splenocytes of control mice

184

resulted in a background response of less than 50 IFN- producing cells per 1106 splenocytes. As

185

expected, re-stimulation of T cells by DC2.4 presenting no exogenous antigen revealed only

186

reactivity in the range of background (Fig. 3). To rule out clonal or cell line-associated artifacts,

187

antigen-specific IFN- secretion by splenocytes of MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) vaccinated mice was

188

confirmed by stimulation with transgenic JAWSII-SARS2-S bulk cells. These cells also stimulated

189

in excess of 1,400 IFN- secreting cells per 1106 splenocytes in animals receiving the recombinant

190

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, whereas only slight background stimulation was observed by the

191

respective controls. The differences between MeV control and MeVvac2-SARS2-S vaccinated mice

192

were statistically significant for both cell lines. Mice vaccinated with Alum-adjuvanted S protein

193

showed no specific reactivity in IFN- ELISpot.

194

Cellular immune responses upon stimulation with MeV bulk antigens were detected in animals that

195

had been vaccinated with any recombinant MeV virus, as expected. While MeV bulk antigens

196

stimulated only about 300 to 700 IFN- secreting cells per 1106 splenocytes of MVvac2-ATU(P)

197

vaccinated animals, but 400 to 1,400 IFN- secreting cells per 1×106 splenocytes of MeVvac2-

198

SARS2-S(H) vaccinated animals. However, this trend was not statistically significant. Splenocytes

199

of all animals revealed a similar basic reactivity to unspecific T cell stimulation, as confirmed by

200

numbers of IFN- secreting cells upon ConA treatment at the limit of detection. Remarkably,

201

stimulation of splenocytes by DC2.4 expressing SARS-CoV-2-S resulted in at least similar or even

202

higher numbers of IFN-+ cells than after stimulation by MeV bulk antigens, indicating an extremely

203

robust induction of cellular immunity against this antigen. Taken together, these data show that

204

MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) not only induces humoral, but also strong SARS-CoV-2-S protein-specific

205

cellular immune responses.

206
207

SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive T cells are multifunctional

208

To gain more detailed insights in the quality of the observed T cell responses, we further

209

characterized the responsive T cell populations by flow cytometry, determining the expression of

210

IFN-TNF- and IL-2 in CD8+ and CD4+ positive CD3+ T cells upon re-stimulation with SARS-

211

CoV-2 S-presenting DC2.4-SARS2-S cells by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). As a positive

212

stimulus for T cell activation, tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate and ionomycin (TPA/Iono) were used.

213

Exocytosis of cytokines was blocked by addition of brefeldin A (10 g/mL) during stimulation. Cells

214

were permeabilized, labelled, and fixed for flow cytometry. The gating strategy excluded duplicates

215

(Suppl.Fig. S4, top row, middle panel), selected for living cells (Suppl. Fig. S4, top row, right panel),

216

and separated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells on CD3+ cell populations (Suppl. Fig. S4, 2nd row). Selected

217

T cells were then analyzed for their expression of IFN-, TNF-, or IL-2, double- (Suppl. Fig. S4,

218

3rd row), or triple-positive cells (Suppl. Fig. S4, bottom row) as exemplarily shown for CD4+ T cells

219

after re-stimulation with TPA and ionomycin (Suppl. Fig. S4).

220

Vaccination with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) induced a significant amount of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific

221

CD8+ T cells expressing either IFN- (Fig. 4B, left panel), IL-2 (Fig. 4B, middle panel) or TNF-

222

(Fig. 4B, right panel), with means between 0.1% and 0.5% of positive cells for each of these

223

cytokines. Among those, a significant fraction of cells proved to be multifunctional, with a mean of

224

49% of the reactive CD8+ cells expressing two cytokines or 13% of responsive CD8+ cells being

225

positive for TNF-IL-2 and IFN- (Fig. 4C). A much lower portion of responsive CD4+ T cells was

226

observed, varying between 0.01% to 0.07% of CD4+ T cells. Among the responsive CD4+ cells,

227

46% expressed two cytokines and 10% were positive TNF-IL-2 and IFN- Moreover,

228

vaccination induced a significant fraction of vector-specific CD4+ T cells expressing IFN- (Fig. 4A,

229

left panel), IL-2 (Fig. 4A, middle panel) or TNF- (Fig. 4A, right panel) upon re-stimulation with MeV

230

bulk antigen. Among those, multifunctional CD4+ T cells expressing two or all three cytokines were

231

induced with a mean of about 22% and 6% poly-reactive T cells (Fig. 4C), respectively. To

232

conclude, vaccination with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) induces not only IFN-, TNF- or IL-2 expressing

233

T cells directed against SARS-CoV-2 and MeV, but also a significant fraction of multifunctional

234

cytotoxic T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 S and CD4+ T cells specific for MeV antigens, illustrating

235

that a broad and robust SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response is induced by vaccination with

236

MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H).

237
238

MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) induced antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells respond with

239

proliferation.

240

While ELISpot and ICS analyses revealed antigen-specific cytokine secretion by vaccinated mice’

241

T cells, we next aimed at detecting antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which

242

would be important for clearance of virus infected cell and CD4+ T helper cells. For that purpose,

243

proliferation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells upon stimulation with SARS-CoV-2-S was analyzed 3 weeks

244

after the boost via a flow cytometry. Splenocytes of mice were isolated 21 days after the boost, and

245

DC2.4-SARS2-S cells were used for re-stimulation of T cells. The splenocytes were labelled with

246

CFSE and subsequently co-cultured with DC2.4-SARS2-S cells or, as a control, with parental

247

DC2.4 cells for 6 days and finally stained for CD3, CD4, and CD8 before being analyzed for

248

proliferation, detectable by the dilution of the CFSE stain due to cell division.

249

T cells of mice vaccinated with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) revealed an increase in the population of

250

CD3+CD4+CFSElow and CD3+CD8+CFSElow cells after re-stimulation with DC2.4-SARS2-S cells

251

compared to re-stimulation with parental DC2.4 without SARS-CoV-2 S antigen (Fig. 5). In contrast,

252

T cells of control mice did not reveal this pattern, but the CFSElow population remained rather

253

constant. The prominent increase in CD3+CD8+CFSElow cells, which was significant for MeVvac2-

254

SARS2-S(H) vaccinated mice, indicates that CD3+CD8+ CTLs and CD3+CD4+ T helper

255

lymphocytes specific for SARS-CoV-2 S have proliferated upon stimulation. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-

256

specific cytotoxic memory T cells are induced in mice after vaccination with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H).

257
258

Induced T cells reveal antigen-specific cytotoxicity.

259

To demonstrate the effector ability of induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a killing assay was

260

performed to directly analyze antigen-specific cytotoxicity (Fig. 6). Splenocytes of immunized mice

261

isolated 21 days post boost vaccination were co-cultured with DC2.4-SARS2-S or parental DC2.4

262

263

incubated with a defined mixture of EL-4green-SARS2-S target and EL-4red control cells (ratio

264

approximately 1:1), only T cells from MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) vaccinated mice significantly shifted the

265

ratio of live SARS-CoV-2 S protein-expressing target cells to control cells in a dose-dependent

266

manner (Fig. 6B). This antigen-dependent killing was also dependent on re-stimulation with DC2.4-

267

SARS2-S cells, since unstimulated T cells did not significantly shift the ratios of target to non-target

268

cells (Fig. 6A).

269

These results indicate that CTLs isolated from MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H)-vaccinated mice are capable

270

of lysing cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S. Neither splenocytes of control mice re-stimulated with

271

DC2.4-SARS2-S nor splenocytes of SARS-CoV-2-S vaccinated mice re-stimulated with control

272

DC2.4 cells showed such an antigen-specific killing activity, demonstrating that MeVvac2-SARS2-

273

S(H) induces fully functional antigen-specific CD8+ CTLs.

274

Induced immunity is skewed towards Th1-biased responses.

275

While the functionality of both humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses elicited

276

by MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) is reassuring, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development has to proceed with

277

some caution because of the potential risk of immunopathogenesis observed in some animal

278

models, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and enhanced respiratory disease

279

(ERD) which seem to correlate with a Th2-biased immune response. Since in mice IgG1 is a marker

280

for Th2-bias and risk of ADE development, whereas IgG2a antibodies indicate a favorable Th1-

281

bias, IgG subtype-specific ELISA were performed with the sera collected at different time points.

282

Animals vaccinated with alum-adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 S protein, a vaccine concept known for its

283

Th2-bias (11, 12), developed high levels of S protein-specific IgG1 antibodies, whereas few S-

284

specific IgG2a antibodies were detected (Fig. 7A). In comparison, MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) induced

285

100-fold less IgG1 antibodies, but at least 10-fold higher IgG2a levels (Fig. 7A), indicating a

286

favorable Th1-bias in animals immunized with the MeV-derived vaccine candidate.

287

These findings were confirmed by multiplex cytokine analysis of the cytokine profile in the

288

supernatants of splenocytes from vaccinated animals, which were re-stimulated using DC2.4 or

289

DC2.4-SARS2-S cells. All splenocytes revealed secretion of all cytokines after stimulation with

290

ConA demonstrating general reactivity of cells and assay (data not shown). Most likely due to the

291

low number of S-reactive T cells in animals that had been vaccinated with recombinant SARS2-S

292

protein and Alum, no or minimal, constant cytokine levels were measurable in the supernatants of

293

re-stimulated splenocytes (Fig. 7B). In contrast, splenocytes of animals immunized with MeVvac2-

294

SARS2-S(H) reacted specifically with the secretion of IFN-, TNF- and IL-2 upon re-stimulation

295

by DC2.4-SARS2-S (Fig. 7B, top row), in accordance with ELISpot and ICS data. However, we

296

could observe no or minimal up-regulation of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, or IL-10, which would have been

indicative for a Th2-biased response (Fig. 7B, middle row). Also IL-17a, or IL-6 indicative of a Th17

298

or general inflammatory response showed minimal changes (Fig. 7 B, bottom row).

299

Thus, both humoral and cellular responses reveal a Th1-biased immunity induced by MeVvac2-

300

SARS2-S(H), which indicates a relatively low risk for putatively Th2-mediated immunopathologies.

Discussion

306

Spike glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV-2 to induce functional immune responses to protect against

307

COVID-19. We show that MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) replicated comparably to MeV vaccine strain

308

viruses and was genetically stable over extended passaging. Upon vaccination of mice, it induced

309

robust humoral immune responses of the IgG2a subtype directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike

310

glycoprotein S with neutralizing activity in a range already shown to be protective by others. In

311

addition, considerable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced,

312

the major fraction of which were secreting two or even all three cytokines when analysing for IFN-,

313

TNF- or IL-2 upon antigen-specific re-stimulation. These T cells proliferated and specifically

314

depleted antigen-positive target cells in a mixed population. Importantly, all responses were skewed

315

toward Th1-biased immunity. In parallel, the capacity to induce measles-specific immune reactivity

316

remained conserved.

317

This effective MeV Moraten strain-derived recombinant vaccine MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) is a live-

318

attenuated vaccine that encodes the full-length, functional version of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike

319

protein as main target for functional antibodies, but also for induction of T cell responses. Vero cells

320

revealed homogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen by Western Blot analyses and

321

positive immunostaining of syncytia after infection by MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H). Stable antigen

322

expression is a prerequisite for the immune system to encounter the specific antigen to mount

323

robust immune responses and for industrial production of a vaccine. Indeed, IFNAR-/--CD46Ge

324

mice vaccinated with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) in a prime-boost protocol showed uniform induction of

325

antibodies directed against MeV bulk antigens or SARS-CoV-2 S, which had considerable

326

neutralizing activity against both pathogens. We observe antibody responses in these animals at a

327

level that correlate with protection in mouse challenge models (13), as well as with neutralizing

328

activity we found in the serum of 4 reconvalescent human patients. These responses were triggered

329

even though the knock-out of the type I interferon receptor, which is necessary to allow propagation

330

of MeV in mice (10, 14). This knock-out usually should impair the induction of especially humoral

331

immune responses (15). This highlights the remarkable immunogenicity of the MeV vaccine

332

platform technology that also works in this model with partially impaired immune responses.

In this study, we aimed to analyze the efficacy of MeV-derived vaccine candidates encoding the

10

333

However, why did not all immunized animals develop neutralizing activity detectable in our assay?

334

Firstly, determination of the VNT relying on 100% pathogen neutralization is obviously a rather

335

harsh assay in the context of SARS-CoV-2, as evidenced by the modest VNT titers published so

336

far, in general, and absence of VNT in the S+Alum vaccinated group despite high amounts of S

337

binding antibodies. This means that just detectable VNT already indicates considerable neutralizing

338

activity. Secondly, we realized that two of the three animals which did not show a VNT >10 have

339

not responded well to the prime vaccination, at all. These animals developed none or only a minor

340

VNT against MeV after the first vaccination. This observation is rather unusual, and argues for

341

technical issues during the first vaccination in these two animals. Since none of the animals showed

342

VNT against SARS-CoV-2 after one vaccination with the vaccine, it is tempting to speculate that a

343

prime-boost-protocol is associated in this animal model with maturation of antibodies to generate

344

better neutralizing responses. On the other hand, all animals including the two improperly

345

immunized ones revealed significant, multi-functional T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 S,

346

which were still recordable three weeks after the second vaccination, when we already expect

347

constriction of antigen-specific T cell effector populations. These data suggest that anti-S antibody

348

responses mature after repeated vaccination, but on the other hand that a one shot vaccination

349

regime will already induce especially functional memory T cell immune responses, the protective

350

efficacy of which as well as their duration has to be demonstrated in future challenge experiments.

351

In any case, we have observed with other foreign viral antigens that these T cell responses can be

352

detected in mice more than 2 years after vaccination (Hörner & Fiedler et al., unpublished data).

353

This observation is in accordance with the stability of anti-measles immunity (16) also after pediatric

354

vaccination (17) and might be a specific advantage of the measles vaccine platform technology.

355

Also extended passaging of the vaccine candidate did not result in changes of the vaccine as

356

revealed by sequencing of the virus after 10 passages starting with a low MOI. This genetic stability

357

indicates that the slight impairment seen in multi-step growth curves when compared to a vaccine-

358

strain MeV is not critical for the vaccine´s amplification and therefore crucial for product safety. In

359

accordance with its genetic stability, the minor enhancement of fusion activity can also be regarded

360

as non-critical, especially with a view on the fusion activity of MeV used in clinical trials for treatment

361

of tumors. These so called oncolytic MeV have been used in 15 phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials,

362

so far. Thereby, advanced-stage tumor patients suffering from different tumor entities have been

363

treated. Despite constituting in principle a vulnerable patient collective, application of high doses of

364

non-targeted, fusion-active MeV (up to 1×1011 TCID50) (18) systemically or for example directly into

365

the patients´ brains (19) was accompanied by an acceptable safety profile (20). Therefore, the

366

enhancement of fusion activity cannot be expected to be crucial for product safety, while the

367

attenuation of vaccine-strain MeV is multifactorial, anyway, and not just a matter of cell entry

368

tropism and mechanism (21). Likewise, the clinical phase 1 and 2 trials using the MeV vector

369

platform for the generation of bivalent vaccines, which induce immunity against CHIKV (22, 23),

370

have revealed an extremely beneficial safety profile of this recombinant vaccine concept also in

371

human patients, while signs of efficacy became evident.

372

In any case, generation of MeV-derived COVID-19 vaccines encoding a less fusion-active variant

373

of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein might be beneficial to enhance titers of the vaccine virus.

374

In the meantime, stabilized S variants have become available that have attenuated or no cell-cell

375

fusion activity. One variant has a deletion of the multi-basic cleavage motif for furin-like proteases

376

at the S1/S2 boundary that facilitates pre-activation of S (24). A second variant has proline

377

substitutions at residues 986 and 987, which are stabilizing a pre-fusion conformation of S (25).

378

Vaccine candidates encoding S with one of these motifs or a combination thereof in a soluble

379

version as already done for DNA vaccines (26) are under development. These have to show an at

380

least comparable capacity to induce neutralizing antibody responses also in the context of MeV

381

infection, which might be dependent on the respective conformation of the antigen that is expressed

382

by vaccine virus-infected cells in situ.

383

The induction of the “right” antibodies and T cell responses is especially crucial with a view on

384

potential complications that can be observed when coronavirus encounter “wrong” immune

385

responses that can give rise to immunopathologies after infection. In some infected cats, infection

386

with feline coronavirus causes feline infectious peritonitis, a deadly disease characterized by viral

387

infection of macrophages during the acute phase. Interestingly, the switch of pathology after

388

infection from a rather moderate pathogenesis into an acute, devastating disease can be triggered

389

by vaccination of persistently infected cats and has been attributed to the induction of antibodies

390

that mediate enhancement of the disease, a process called antibody-dependent enhancement

391

(ADE). During COVID-19, ADE might be the cause of the severe cases currently observed. Some

392

case reports indicate that severe disease appeared more frequently in patients with high SARS-

393

CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (27). ADE has been most prominent for dengue virus (DENV)

394

infections, especially in secondary infections with a different DENV serotype where enhancement

395

of disease correlated with the induction of non-neutralizing Abs that can mediate an efficient uptake

396

of the virus in FcR-positive cells such as macrophages and other immune cells (28). Moreover,

397

other immune-related adverse events were described for SARS- and MERS-CoV. When animals

398

were immunized with vaccines that pre-dominantly induce Th2-biased T-helper cell responses,

399

vaccinated mice revealed significantly reduced virus loads after challenge, but also an eosinophilic

400

infiltrate into the lungs accompanied by pathological changes of the lung tissue, so called enhanced

401

respiratory disease (ERD) (29). Such immunopathologies upon CoV infection are a major concern

402

for diseases pathology and especially vaccine development. Thus, Th2-biased immune responses

403

as triggered by alum-adjuvanted whole inactivated virus particles or recombinant proteins should

404

be avoided.

405

Interestingly, the live-attenuated MeV vaccine is known for a balanced Th1/Th2-bias of induced

406

immune responses with a bias for Th1 responses at least during the acute phase after vaccination

407

(30). In theory, this should also apply for immune responses induced against all antigens presented

408

during a MeV vaccine virus infection including foreign antigen(s) additionally expressed when MeV

409

is used as vaccine platform. Indeed, our analyses provide evidence that the bias of the immune

410

responses is in favour of Th1 responses, as revealed by the inverted IgG1/IgG2a subtype ratio of

411

antibodies induced against SARS-CoV-2 S by MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) compared to the animals

412

immunized with alum-adjuvanted recombinant S protein. Moreover, the cytokine profile of

413

splenocyte cultures of immunized mice after re-stimulation of S-specific T cells reveals a respective

414

preferable Th1 bias. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the same primary attachment

415

receptor for cell entry, hACE2, and selected hACE2-transgenic mice show differential pathology

416

after inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 (13, 31), studying the impact of the Th1-biased MeV-based

417

immunization in hACE2-transgenic mice during challenge with SARS-CoV-2 will be a matter of

418

future studies. In any case, our data suggest that MeV-derived COVID-19 vaccines have a low

419

likelihood to trigger immunopathogenesis. Another animal model for COVID-19, golden Syrian

420

hamsters, could be an alternative for future challenge studies. This animal model is susceptible for

421

SARS-CoV-2 infection, reveals a moderate, but clearly distinguishable pathology, and shows air-

422

borne transmissibility from infected to naïve animals (32, 33). Therefore, this animal model

423

accurately reflects at least some aspects of the course of human disease and should be valuable

424

for assessment of the protective efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.

425

In conclusion, the bivalent MeV/SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate has a number of desirable

426

properties with respect to its immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the concurrent

427

induction of anti-MeV immunity would allow its use in the context of routine measles immunization

428

schedules. Such a MeV-based COVID-19 vaccine could be included in the currently applied MMR

429

(measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, providing additional protection against SARS-CoV-2. While

430

controversially discussed to which extent, children do become infected and shed the virus, despite

431

them rarely being severely affected. In any case, preventing infection or virus shedding from

432

vaccinated children can also help to contain the disease and protect vulnerable patient groups.

433

Moreover, the capacity to produce large amounts of vaccine doses would be available more or less

434

instantly from routine measles vaccine production, but at no impairment of production of other

435

necessary vaccines, since the measles vaccine property is preserved in the proposed vaccine

436

candidate. Especially since vaccination against the measles should not be impaired also during the

437

COVID-19 epidemic, this is a considerable advantage. Otherwise, parallel epidemics with another,

438

even more contagious respiratory virus are looming when vaccination programs against the

439

measles are stopped in favour of COVID-19 vaccination programs. Therefore, MeVvac2-SARS2-

440

S(H) is a promising vaccine candidate that warrants further investigation.

448

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 2 mM L-

Wuhan-Hu-1 (Genebank accession no. MN908947.1) in plasmids pMA-RQ-SARS2-S flanked with

460

AatII/MluI and NheI/XhoI restriction sites was obtained by gene synthesis (Invitrogen Life

461

Technology, Regensburg, Germany). The antigen was inserted into plasmids pBRPolII-MVvac2-

462

GFP(P) or pBRPolIIMVvac2-GFP(H) via MluI/AatII to generate pBRPolII-MVvac2-SARS2-S(P) or

into pBR-MVvac2-GFP(P) or pBR-MVvac2-GFP(H) (7). For construction of a lentiviral transfer vector

467

encoding SARS-CoV-2 S directly linked to the egfp gene as selection marker, the ORF of SARS-

468

CoV-2 S was inserted via NheI/XhoI into pCSCW2gluc-IRES-GFP (36) to yield pCSCW2-SARS2-

478

stocks were used to transduce murine DC cell lines, DC2.4 and JAWSII, as well as the murine T

479

cell line EL-4, resulting in DC2.4-SARS2-S, JAWSII-SARS2-S, and EL-4green-SARS2-S,

480

respectively, that express the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and GFP and present the respective peptides

481

via MHC-I. Transduced cultures with 1-10% GFP-positive cells were single cell-sorted (BD FACS

482

483

For JAWSII-SARS2-S, the bulk-sorted cells were used in stimulation experiments. For DC2.4-

SARS-CoV-2 S-encoding vaccine candidates MeVvac2-SARS2-S(P) or MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) were

generated as described previously (7, 39). Single syncytia were picked and overlaid onto 50%

489

confluent Vero cells cultured in 6-well plates and harvested as “passage 0” (P0) by scraping and

490

freeze-thaw cycle of cells at the time of maximal infection. Subsequent passages were generated

491

after TCID50 titration of infectious virus according to the method of Kaerber and Spaerman (40).

492

Stocks were generated by infection of Vero cells at an MOI = 0.03, and passage 2 (P2) or P3 were

493

used for in vitro characterization, while vaccine viruses in P3 or P4 were used for vaccination

494

experiments. Vector control virus MVvac2-ATU(P) (41) was used in P5 for vaccination. SARS-CoV-

495

2 (isolate MUC-IMB1) (kind gift of G. Dobler, Bundeswehr Insitute for Microbiology, Germany) was

496

used for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. It was propagated on Vero E6 cells and was titrated

497

via TCID50 as described above for recombinant MeV. All virus stocks were stored in aliquots at -

Multistep viral growth kinetics were analyed by infecting Vero cells at an MOI of 0.03 in 96-well

and cells were scraped into OptiMEM and subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. Released and cell-

520

with 1.8 volume of SPRI Beads (Beckman Coulter), eluted in 27 l of water and subjected to RNase-

521

H (NEB) digestion at 37°C for 30 min followed by heat inactivation. After bead purification the 20 l

522

cDNA elute was used for 2nd strand synthesis in a 50 l reaction containing: 1x NEB Buffer 2, 25

523

nmol dNTP, 5 Us of exo(-) Klenow Fragment (NEB), 200 pmol of NNSR-2 Primer for 30 min at

524

37°C. After bead purification half of the DNA elute was used for a 50-µl PCR reaction containing

525

the NEBNext High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix (NEB), 25 pmol, each, of NNSR-Illumina and NNSR-nest-

526

ind primers with the following cycling conditions: 98°C 10 sec; 5 cycles of 98°C 10 sec, 55°C 30

527

sec, 72°C 30 sec; 20 cycles of 98°C 10 sec, 65°C 30 sec, 72°C 30 sec; 72°C 5 min. 15 l of the

528

PCR reaction was separated on a 1% agarose gel and the smear of 500-700 bp was isolated. The

529

indexed libraries were quantified by qPCR using the NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumia (NEB,

530

mixed and sequenced on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina)) with a 2x250 paired-end setup.

NNNNNN: sample-specific index) and the leading two nucleotides were removed from each read

538

(--trim_front1 2 --trim_front2 2). For quality trimming, bases in sliding windows with a mean quality

539

below 30 (-5 -3 --cut_mean_quality 30) were discarded on both sides of the reads. Base correction

540

in overlapping regions (-c) was applied. Reads with Ns and a length below-< 30 bp after trimming

541

(-n 0 -l 30) were discarded.

542

Mapping was performed with BWA mem v 0.7.12-r1039 (43), using default parameters unless

543

stated otherwise. Host-derived reads were removed by mapping quality controlled reads against

544

the African green monkey genome (Chlorocebus sabeus, RefSeq assembly GCA_000409795.2),

545

specifying the minimum seed length (-k 31). Unmapped reads were extracted using samtools v1.7

547

of either MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) or MeVvac2-SARS2-S(P), as appropriate. Host-free alignments were

548

deduplicated using picard-tools MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) and left-

549

aligned using GATK LeftAlignIndels v4.0 (46).

550

Sample majority consensus sequences were obtained by substituting minor frequency variants in

551

the respective virus reference sequence for alternative variants with allele frequencies > 50%.

552

Variant calling was performed with LoFreq v2.1.3 (47) using default parameters.

553

Immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA)

554

For immunoperoxidase monolayer assay, Vero cells cultured in flat-bottom 12-well plates were

555

fixed overnight with methanol at −20°C two days after infection with a MOI of 0.01. The fixed cells

556

were then washed three times with 1 mL PBS and subsequently blocked with PBS containing 2%

557

bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were then

558

probed for 1 h with a polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2-S protein antibody (1:2,250; ab252690;

559

Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or a rabbit anti-MeV N protein antibody (1:1,000, ab23974, Abcam) in

560

PBS with 2% BSA. The cells were washed 3 times with 1 ml PBS and subsequently incubated with

561

the secondary HRP-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; 611-7202;

562

Rockland, Gilbertsville, USA) for 1 h at 37°C. Then, the cells were washed 3 times, again. For

563

detection, the cells were stained with TrueBlue peroxidase substrate solution (SeraCare, Milford,

564

USA).

565

Western Blot Analysis

566

Cells were lysed and immunoblotted as previously described (48). Rabbit anti-SARS-S protein

567

antibody (1:3,000; ab252690; Abcam), rabbit anti-MeV-N protein polyclonal antibody (1:5,000;

568

ab23974; Abcam), and a mouse anti-ß-actin antibody (1:5,000; ab6276; Abcam) were used.

569

Donkey anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (H&L) polyclonal antibody (1:10,000; 611-7202; Rockland) and goat

570

anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:10,000; A2554-1ML; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) served as secondary

571

antibodies. Peroxidase activity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit

572

(Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) on ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Biorad, Dreieich,

573

Germany).

574

Animal experiments

575

All animal experiments were carried out in compliance with the regulations of German animal

576

protection laws and as authorized by the RP Darmstadt in consideration of the ARRIVE guidelines.

577

Six- to 12-week-old old, treatment-naive IFNAR-/--CD46Ge mice (10) that are deficient for type I

578

580

well-being, and animal weight was additionally controlled once a week during the experiments. For

581

the experiments, animals were randomized for age- and sex-matched groups and housed in IVC

582

cages in groups of 3 to 5 animals with nist packs as environmental enrichment at room temperature

583

with regular 12 h day and night intervalls. Group sizes were calculated based on statistical

584

considerations to yield sufficient statistical power as authorized by the respective competent

585

authority. These animals were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1x105 TCID50 of recombinant

586

vaccine viruses in 200 l volume, or subcutaneously (s.c.) with 10 g recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S

587

protein (Sino Biological Europe, Eschborn, Germany) adjuvanted with 500 g aluminium hydroxide

588

(Alhydrogel adjuvant 2%, vac-alu-250, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) in 100 l volume on days

589

0 and 28. 200 l blood was collected on days 0, and 28, while final serum was collected on day 49

590

post initial immunization (p.i.). serum samples were stored at -20°C. Mice were euthanized on day

591

49 p.i., and splenocytes were harvested for assessment of cellular immune responses.

592

Total IgG and IgG1-/IgG2a quantification

593

MeV bulk antigens (10 g/mL; Virion Serion, Würzburg) or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein (5

594

g/mL) were coated in 50 µl carbonate buffer (Na2CO3 30 mM; NaHCO3 70 mM; pH 9.6) per well

595

on Nunc Maxisorp® 96 well ELISA plates (ebioscience) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The plates

596

were washed three times with 200 µl ELISA washing buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (w/v)) and

597

blocked with 100 L Blocking buffer (PBS; 5% BSA; 0.1% Tween 20) for at least 2 h at room

598

temperature. Mouse sera were 5-fold serially diluted in ELISA dilution buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1%

599

Tween 20), and 50 L/well were used for the assay. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h and

600

washed three times with ELISA washing buffer, followed by incubation with 50 µl/well of HRP-

601

conjugated rabbit anti-mouse total IgG (1:1,000 in ELISA dilution buffer; P0260, Dako Agilent,

602

Santa Clara, CA, USA), goat-anti-mouse IgG1 (1:8,000 in ELISA dilution buffer; ab97240, Abcam,

603

Cambridge, UK), or goat-anti-mouse IgG2a (1:8,000 in ELISA dilution buffer; ab97245, Abcam) at

604

room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the plates were washed four times and 100 L TMB

605

substrate (ebioscience) was added per well. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 L/well

606

H2SO4 (1 N) and the absorbance at 450 nm (specific signal) and 630nm (reference wavelength)

607

was measured.

608

Th1/Th2 cytokine multiplex assay

609

Quantification of Th1/Th2 cytokines in supernatant of splenocytes was performed using mouse

610

high sensitivity T cell magnetic bead panel assay (MHSTCMAG-70K, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

611

5×105 isolated splenocytes were co-cultured with different stimuli in 200 L RPMI + 10% FBS, 2

612

mM L-Gln, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 36 h. For re-stimulation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-

613

specific T cells, splenocytes were co-cultivated with 5x104 DC2.4 dendritic cells, the corresponding

614

cell line transgenically expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein or medium alone. After 36 h, cells were

615

spun down and supernatants were collected and stored at -20°C till assayed. For multiplex assay,

616

cytokines were coupled over night to magnetic beads coated with capture antibodies, labeled with

617

biotinylated detection antibody and incubated with Streptavidin-PE conjugate. Fluorescence was

618

measured using MAGPIX with xPONENT software (Luminex Instruments, Thermo Scientific,

619

Bremen, Germany).

620

Neutralization Assay

621

Virus neutralizing titers (VNT) were quantified as described previously (7). Towards this, sera were

622

serially diluted in 2-fold dilution steps in DMEM in duplicates. A total of 50 PFU of MVvac2-GFP(P)

623

or 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 (isolate MUC-IMB1) were mixed with diluted sera and incubated at

624

37°C for 1 h. MeV or SARS-CoV-2 virus-serum suspensions were added to 1×104 Vero or Vero E6

625

cells, respectively, seeded 4 h prior to the assay in 96-well plates and incubated for 4 days at 37°C.

626

VNTs were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest mean dilution that abolished infection.

627

IFN- ELISpot Analysis

628

Murine interferon gamma (IFN-) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays were

629

performed using the Mouse IFN- ELISPOT Pair kit including capture and detection antibody (BD

630

Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and HRP Streptavidin (BD Bioscience) for ELISpot detection

631

in combination with multiscreen immunoprecipitation (IP) ELISpot polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)

632

96-well plates (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

633

5×105 isolated splenocytes were co-cultured with different stimuli in 200 L RPMI + 10% FBS, 2

634

mM L-Gln, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 36 h. For re-stimulation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-

635

specific T cells, splenocytes were co-cultivated with 5x104 JAWSII, DC2.4 dendritic cells, or the

636

corresponding cell lines transgenically expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In parallel, splenocytes

637

were stimulated with 10 g/mL MeV bulk antigen (Virion Serion). For general T cell stimulation, 10

638

g/mL concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma-Aldrich) was used, and as negative control, splenocytes were

639

left untreated. After 36 h, cells were spun down, supernatants were removed, and cells were lysed

640

in the wells by hypotonic shock. Plates were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-IFN- detection

641

antibodies and streptavidin-HRP according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 3-Amino-9-ethyl-

642

carbazole (AEC; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (Merck Millipore) and

643

used for peroxidase-dependent staining. Spots were counted using an Eli.Scan ELISpot scanner

644

(AE.L.VIS, Hamburg, Germany) and ELISpot analysis software Eli.Analyse V5.0 (AE.L.VIS).

645

Intracellular cytokine staining

646

For flow cytometry-based analysis of cytokine expression by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS),

647

splenocytes of vaccinated mice were isolated, and 2×106 splenocytes per mouse were cultivated

651

0.25 g/mL tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.5 g/mL ionomycin (Iono,

652

Sigma-Aldrich) were used as positive control, and medium alone served as negative control.

653

Splenocytes were stimulated for 5 h at 37°C. Subsequently, cells were stained with fixable viability

654

dye eFluor450 (eBioscience), α-CD4-PE (1:2,000; Cat.-No. 553049 BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA),

655

656

Subsequent to permeabilization with Fixation/Permeabilization Solution (BD) and Perm/Wash

657

Buffer (BD), cells were stained with α-IFN--APC (1:500; Cat.-No. 554413, BD), α-IL-2-

660

analyzed via flow cytometry using an LSRII SORP flow cytometer (BD) and DIVA software (BD).

661

T cell proliferation assay

662

Splenocytes isolated three weeks after the second immunization were labeled with 0.5 M

663

carboxyfluorescein-succinimidyl-ester (CFSE) (ebioscience, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,

664

USA) as previously described (49). In brief, 5105 labelled cells were seeded in RPMI 1640

665

supplemented

666

penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 M 2-mercaptoethanol in 96-wells. 200 L Medium containing 10

667

µg/ml Concanavalin A (Con A, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 g/ml MeV bulk antigen (Virion Serion), or 5103

668

DC2.4-SARS2-S cells were added to each well, and cultured for 6 days. Medium and wild type

669

DC2.4 and JAWSII cells served as controls. Stimulated cells were subsequently stained with CD3-

670

PacBlue (1:50; clone 500A2; Invitrogen Life Technologies), CD8-APC (1:100; clone 53-6.7;

671

ebioscience) and CD4-PE (1:2000; Cat. 553049; BD) antibodies and fixed with 1% PFA in PBS.

672

Finally, the stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD) and

673

FCS Express software (De Novo Software).

674

CTL killing assay

675

For re-stimulation of T cells isolated 3 weeks after the second immunization, 5106 splenocytes

676

were co-cultured with 5104 DC2.4-SARS2-S cells for 6 days in 12-wells in RPMI 1640

677

supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 nM L-Glutamin, 1 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 M

fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and analyzed by flow cytometry using an LSR II flow

683

cytometer (BD) and FCS Express. For indication of Antigen:NC EL-4 ratio the cell count of viable

684

SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing cells was divided by the population of viable negative controls.

685

Statistical analyses

686

To compare the means of different groups in growth kinetics, a non-parametric One-way ANOVA

687

was performed. For ICS analysis, the non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used to

688

compare cytokines levels between DC2.4 and DC2.4-SARS2-S- restimulated splenoycytes within

689

the MeV-vac2-SARS-2-S(H) vaccine group. Note, that these exploratory analyses have been done

690

without correction for multiple testing. For proliferation assay the mean differences were calculated

691

and analyzed using one-tailed Mann-Whitney t-test. To all three groups in CTL killing assays a

692

linear curve was fitted for antigen vs. logarithmised effector-target ratio E:T. The p values testing

693

for differences in slopes were calculated and populations of SARS2-S(H) compared with control

694

ATU vaccinated cells. The p values were not adjusted for multiplicity due to the explorative

695

character of the study. For VNT and fusion activity statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was

696

performed in combination with Tukey’s Multi comparison test to compare all pair means. For

697

multiplex statistical analysis, two-way ANOVA analysis was applied with paired Tukey’s Multi

698

comparison test as post hoc test. For statistical analysis of grouped ELISpot data, two-way ANOVA

699

analysis was applied with paired Tukey’s Multi comparison test.

Fig. 2: Induction of a-SARS-CoV-2 S and a-MeV specific antibodies. Sera of mice vaccinated on
days 0 and 28 with indicated viruses or Alum-adjuvanted S protein were sampled on day 0 (A, D,
E, F), day 28 after prime- (B, E, H, K) and day 49 after boost-immunization (C, F, I, L) and analyzed
for antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 S or MeV. Medium-inoculated mice served as mock. PanIgG binding to recombinant SARS-CoV S (A – C) or MeV bulk antigens (G – I) were determined by
ELISA via the specific OD 450 nm value. Depicted are means and respective standard deviation of
the mean (SEM) of each group (n = 5 - 6). Virus neutralizing titers (VNT) in vaccinated mice for
SARS-CoV-2 (D - F) or MeV (J – L) were calculated as reciprocal of the highest dilution abolishing
infectivity. (M) SARS-CoV-2 VNT of 4 human Covid-19 reconvalescent sera. Dots represent single
individuals; horizontal line represents mean per group. For statistical analysis of VNT data, oneway ANOVA was performed in combination with Tukey’s Multi comparison test to compare all pair
means.

Fig. 3: Secretion of IFN- after antigen-specific re-stimulation of splenocytes. IFN- ELISpot
analysis using splenocytes of mice vaccinated on days 0 and 28 with indicated vaccines, isolated
21 days after boost immunization, and after co-culture with DC2.4 or JAWSII dendritic cell lines
transgenic for SARS-CoV-2 S (SARS2-S) or untransduced controls (untr.). To analyze cellular
responses directed against MeV, splenocytes were stimulated with 10 g/mL MeV bulk antigens or
were left unstimulated as controls (medium). The reactivity of splenocytes was confirmed by
Concanavalin A (ConA) treatment (10 g/mL). The number of cells per 1×106 splenocytes represent
the amount of cells expressing IFN- upon re-stimulation. Dots represent individual animals,
horizontal bars mean per group (n = 5 - 6). Samples above the upper detection limit (ULOD) were
displayed as such. For statistical analysis of grouped ELISpot data, two-way ANOVA analysis was
applied with paired Tukey’s Multi comparison test used as post hoc test. ns, not significant (p>0.05);
****, p<0.0001.

Fig. 4: Detection of multi-functional T-cell responses induced by vaccination with MeVvac2SARS2-S(H). Harvested splenocytes of MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) vaccinated mice (same as depicted
in Fig. 3) were re-stimulated and subjected to intracellular staining (ICS) for IFN-, TNF-, and IL2, and stained for extracellular T-cell markers CD3, CD4, and CD8 for flow cytometry analysis.
Quantification of flow cytometry data of (A) CD4+ and (D) CD8+- positive T cells after co-culture
with antigen-presenting DC2.4-SARS2-S or parental DC2.4 control cells, or after incubation with
indicated stimuli (MeV bulk antigen (MeV bulk), or untreated cells (mock); reactivity of splenocytes
was confirmed by ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment (10 g/mL). Dots
represent individual animals, horizontal bars mean. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare
cytokines levels between DC2.4 and DC2.4-SARS2-S re-stimulated splenoycytes in the MeV-vac2SARS2-S(H) vaccine group without correction for multiple testing because of the exploratory
character of the study. *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01. (C) reveals poly-functional T cells depicted in the piechart as fractions of cell populations expressing one, two, or all three of the tested cytokines and
indicating the size of each fraction among all responsive T cells.

Fig. 6: Antigen-specific killing activity of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific T cells. Killing assay using
splenocytes of mice vaccinated on days 0 and 28 isolated 21 days after the second immunization.
Splenocytes were co-cultured with DC2.4 (A) or with antigen-presenting DC2.4-SARS2-S (B) cells
or for 6 days. Activated CTLs were then co-cultured with EL-4green-SARS2-S target cells (Antigen)
and EL-4red control cells (NC) at indicated E:T ratios for 4 h. Ratio of living target to non-target cells
(Antigen:NC) was determined by flow cytometry. Depicted are means and standard deviation of
each group (open diamonds, MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H); filled circles, mock; filled squares, MVvac2ATU(P); grey triangles: S protein + Alum) (n = 3 - 5). For statistical analysis of grouped ELISpot
data, two-way ANOVA analysis was applied with paired Tukey’s Multi comparison test used as post
hoc test. ****, p<0.0001.

Suppl. Fig. S1: Coverage of of vaccine candidate MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) genome during next
generation sequencing. Schematic depiction of read frequency at each position of the vaccine
virus genome. Blue areas indicate respective viral coding sequences, white areas indicate
intergenic regions and untranscribed terminal regions (UTRs) of the genome. Coverage across the
genome was sufficient for variant detection and reflects the transcription gradient typically observed
in measles virus total RNAseq data. Since the majority of reads are mRNA-derived, low read
numbers decrease strongly between the coding regions and continually towards the 5’ end.
