ABSTRACT
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global public crisis. Although viral RNA modification has been reported
based on the transcriptome architecture, the types and functions of RNA modification are still
unknown. In this study, we evaluated the roles of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in
SARS-CoV-2. Our methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) analysis showed
that SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained m6A modification. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection not only
increased the expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) but also altered its distribution.
Modification of METTL3 expression by short hairpin RNA or plasmid transfection for knockdown or
overexpression, respectively, affected viral replication. Furthermore, the viral key protein RdRp
interacted with METTL3, and METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the
presence of RdRp. RdRp appeared to modulate the sumoylation and ubiquitination of METTL3 via an
unknown mechanism. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the host m6A modification
complex interacted with viral proteins to modulate SARS-CoV-2 replication.
INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus in the Coronavirinae
subfamily of the Coronaviridae family (1-3). The rapid transmission of COVID-19 has been a major
global challenge. Similar to the other two β-category coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a positivesense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 30 kb, with 80% and 50% homology to SARSCoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively (4).
Internal chemical modifications of viral RNA play key roles in the regulation of viral infection. N6methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) have been reported to

be involved in the viral life cycle (5-10). m6A is one of the most abundant internal RNA modifications
6

(11,12). The m A machinery consists of “writers”, “erasers”, and “readers”. The writers, including
methyltransferase-like (METTL) 3, METTL14, WT1-associated protein (WTAP), and other proteins,
catalyze the transfer of the m6A modification (13-23). The “erasers” fat mass and obesity associated
protein (FTO) and AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) are m6A demethylases that remove the methyl groups
6

from RNA (22-25). The “readers” contain a YTH motif that binds to m A sites and play critical roles in
mRNA stability (26-28), RNA processing (25), RNA structure (29), and translation (30,31).
The internal m6A modification of viral RNA was first identified in viruses that replicate in the
cytoplasm, such as vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus, and reovirus, 40 years ago (32-36).
However, the function of m6A began was only recent elucidated in hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus
(ZIKV), dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus

(37,38). In viruses that replicate in the

nucleus, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), simian virus 40, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
6

herpesvirus, and influenza virus, viral m A modifications have been shown to affect viral replication
6

and gene expression (39-46). However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 contains m A
modifications although some potential m6A sites have been discovered by bioinformatics (47). At least
41 sites modified on the SARS-CoV-2 genome are potential sites of RNA modification, with frequent
occurrence of the AAGAA motif, which is particularly enriched at genomic nucleotide positions
28,500–29,500 (48). However, although the m5C modification has been reported, the modification
type is largely unknown (48).
6

Accordingly, in the current study, we investigated the presence of roles of m A modification in
SARS-CoV-2 RNA using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). Overall, our
findings demonstrated that the host m6A modification complex interacted with viral proteins and
modulated SARS-CoV-2 replication.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Virus, cell lines, and cell culture
SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient (49) and passaged in
monkey kidney cells (Vero-E6 cells) for eight generations. The titer of the SARS-CoV-2 working
solution was 106 PFU/mL, as determined by plaque assays in Vero-E6 cells. Vero-E6 cells (American
Tissue Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA, USA; CRL-1586) and HEK293T cell (ATCC; CRL11268) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 116 (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Plasmid construction and transfection
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plasmids pFlag-RdRp and pHA-RdRp were
constructed by inserting the sequences of the RdRp open reading frame (ORF) into the vectors
pXJ40-Flag and pXJ40-HA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively. m6A

methyltransferases and demethylase expression plasmids (pFlag-METTL3, pFlag-WTAP, pMETTL3,
pMETTL14, and Flag-METTL3) were constructed by inserting the ORF sequences of the genes into
the vectors pXJ40-Flag, pcDNA3.0, or pLenti-CMV-3XFlag. The plasmids HA-SUMO, HA-Ubi, HA-63,
HA-48, and myc-ubc9 were kind gifts from Dr. Hanzhong Wang (Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS).
Plasmids were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA; cat. no. 11668-019) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Western blotting and antibodies
Cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times after transfection or infection and separated by
gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 10% gels, and
proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C at the dilution suggested by the manufacturer’s protocols. The
primary antibodies were as follows: anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; cat.
no. 60004-1-lg; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (cat. no. sc47778;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), rabbit monoclonal anti-METTL3 (cat. no. 15073-1-AP;
Proteintech), anti-METTL3 (cat. no. ab195352; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-METTL14 (cat. no.
SAB1104405; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-WTAP (cat. no. ab155655; Abcam), anti-ALKBH5 (cat. no.
ab69325; Abcam), anti-FTO (cat. no. ab124892; Abcam), anti-Flag (cat. no. F1804-1 MG; SigmaAldrich), anti-HA (cat. no. H9658; Sigma-Aldrich), and mouse polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2
nonstructural protein (NP) (gift from Dr. Fei Deng, Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS). The secondary
antibodies including goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (AntiGene Biotech GmbH, Stuttgart,
Germany) were incubated for 1 h at a dilution of 1:5000. Luminescent signals were detected using
Tanon-5200 ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Tanon Science & Technology, Shanghai, China).
Co-immunoprecipitation
Total proteins were collected at 48 h after transfection. Primary antibodies were mixed with
supernatants of cell lysates (2 µg primary antibody per 1 mg protein sample) for 2 h at 4°C and then
incubated with protein G agarose overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by
SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and transferred nitrocellulose membranes, followed by incubation with
primary and second antibodies. Protein detection was performed using Tanon 5200 ChemiDoc MP
imaging system.
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown
shRNA knockdown was performed according to the protocol for shRNA-mediated gene silencing and
Lentiviral Particle packaging from the Addgene website. Stable-knockdown Vero-E6 cell lines were
screened using 10 μg/mL puromycin for selection. shRNA-specific primers were as follows: METTL3
(shMETTL3-1: 5′-GCCAAGGAACAATCCATTGTT-3′, shMETTL3-2: 5′CGTCAGTATATTGGGCAAGTT-3′), FTO (shFTO-1: 5′-TCACCAAGGAGACTGCTATTT-3′, shFTO-2:
5′-GATCCAAGGCAAAGATTTACT-3′).

Immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis were performed as previously described (50). Briefly, Vero-E6 cells
were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.01) and harvested 24 h
postinfection. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100
for 10 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and blocked in 3% bovine
serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C at the dilution suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol and stained with secondary
antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568) for 1 h after three washes with PBS. Nuclei were
visualized with Hoechst 33258 at a dilution of 1:1000. The images were captured under a PerkinElmer
VoX confocal microscope.
Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cells, and reverse transcription was
performed using a HiSeript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Vazyme Biotech Co, Nanjing, China)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by quantitative PCR with SYBR Green (Yeasen
Biotech Co, Shanghai, China) on a CFX Connect Real-Time system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA, USA).
Formaldehyde-crosslinked RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP)
RIP was conducted as previously described (51). Briefly, infected Vero-E6 cells were crosslinked by
adding PBS containing 1% methanol-free formaldehyde and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The
reaction was terminated by adding 2.5 M glycine, and the cells were lysed with 400 μL RIP buffer (150
mM KCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 0.5 mM
dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.5% NP40, 100 U/mL RNase inhibitor, 100 uM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
[PMSF], and 1 μg/mL proteinase inhibitor) on ice for 10 min. The lysates were then centrifugated at
16,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were subjected to IP with IgG or anti-Flag antibodies
overnight. Next, 30 μL protein-G agarose beads was added after washing three times with washing
buffer (300 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5% NP40, 100 U/mL
RNase inhibitor, 100 μM PMSF, and 1 μg/mL proteinase inhibitor) and incubated with the indicated
antibodies for 2 h at 4°C. RNA isolation was performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
for subsequent qualification.
MeRIP-Seq
Total RNA was extracted from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cells and purified with an Oligo (dT) kit
(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The polyA purified RNA was fragmented and subjected to
6

IP using an m A-specific antibody, followed by next-generation sequencing. MeRIP-Seq data were
analyzed as described previously (44).
MeRIP and northern blotting

For MeRIP and northern blotting, 400 μg total RNA from virus-infected Vero-E6 cells was incubated
with an anti-m6A antibody (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany) or an IgG antibody in 300 μL IP
buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]) for 2 h at 4°C. Thirty-five microliters
magnetic beads (NEB; goat anti-rabbit magnetic beads; cat. no. S1432S) were added, and samples
were washed three times and rotated 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed six times and incubated
with 300 μL elution buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 0.05% SDS, and 8.4 μL of
10 mg/mL proteinase K) for 1.5 h at 50°C. The RNA was purified using phenol/chloroform and
precipitated with ethanol. For qRT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase mix
(Vazyme), and relative quantification was performed using specific primers. The data were normalized
to the quantification cycle (Cq) values of GAPDH. For northern blotting, the purified RNA was run on a
1.0% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde for 11 h at 35 V, followed by transfer to a HybondN+ membrane and ultraviolet crosslinking. Finally, membranes were hybridized with a DIG-labelled
SARS-CoV-2 probe (nt 28,274–29,870), and probe detection was performed using a luminescence
detection kit II (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Signals were detected using a
ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Tanon 5200).
Sumoylation and ubiquitination assays
Sumoylation and ubiquitination assays were performed as previously described (52). Briefly, the
indicated plasmids were cotransfected into HEK293T cells, and the cell lysates were harvested by
centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. Next, 50 μL protein G Dynabeads was incubated with
10 μg of the indicated antibodies for 2 h, followed by incubation with cell lysates overnight. The
complexes were washed six times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and subjected to western
blotting.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis of qRT-PCR data was performed using two-tail unpaired t-tests in GraphPad
Prism Software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA.). Data are presented as means ± standard
deviations (n = 3). All experiments were repeated at least three times.
RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the expression patterns of m6A methyltransferases and
demethylases
m6A methyltransferase and demethylases are mainly localized in the nucleus. Infection by viruses that
replicate in the cytoplasm, such as EV71, HCV, and ZIKV, affects the expression and localization of
methyltransferases and demethylase to facilitate their RNA m6A modifications, which promotes viral
replication (37,38,51,53). To check whether SARS-CoV-2 infection had a similar effect, SARS-CoV-2infected Vero-E6 cells were harvested. The expression of viral NP and m6A machinery proteins was
assessed by western blotting with corresponding antibodies (Fig. 1A). Our results showed that the
expression of METTL3 was increased at 48 h postinfection (hpi), whereas the expression levels of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.338558; this version posted October 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

METTL14 and WTAP were not affected (Fig. 1A). The expression of the demethylase FTO decreased
at 48 hpi, whereas that of ALKBH5 was not changed after infection. Moreover, the expression of the
6

m A binding proteins YTHDF1–3, YTHDC1, and YTHDC2 was not altered during SARS-CoV-2
infection (Fig.1A).
6

Previous studies have shown that m A methyltransferases and demethylases colocalize with
nuclear speckle markers and that viral infection affects the subcellular localization of m6A-related
proteins. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the expression of METTL3 and FTO, we next
determined the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the localization of methyltransferases and
demethylases. Consistent with previous results, methyltransferases and demethylases were detected
mostly in the nucleus under normal conditions (Fig. 1B–F). However, METTL3, METTL14, WTAP,
ALKBH5, and FTO were all present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm after infection (Fig. 1B–F). The
colocalization of methyltransferases and demethylases with viral protein NP implied that these
proteins may interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cytoplasm. The above results provided evidence
that SARS-CoV-2 may be modified by the host m6A machinery.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained m6A modifications
At least 41 sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome contain potential sites of RNA modifications, harboring
the AAGAA motif (48). However, the modification type is largely unknown. To investigate whether
6

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was m A modified, total RNAs were purified from large-scale batches of SARSCoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cells, and MeRIP was then performed with m 6A-specific antibodies. The
MeRIP RNA was subjected to northern blotting with SARS-CoV-2 probes spanning nt 28,274–29,870.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then pulled down using anti-m6A antibodies (Fig. 2A), indicating that SARS6

6

CoV-2 contained m A residues. To further confirm the above results and map the m A modification
status in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, MeRIP-Seq was performed. Five m6A peaks were identified
in the 5′ end (nt 36–753 and nt 1023–1324) and the 3′ end (nt 27,493–27,913, nt 28,475–28,706, and
nt 28,944–29,751; Fig. 2B–D), which were located in the ORF1ab-, N-, and ORF10-coding regions
6

(Fig. 2E). These results implied that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was marked by m A modification during
infection.
METTL3 regulated m6A modification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and virus replication
6

The host methyltransferases and demethylases are involved in the m A modification of EV71, HCV,
ZIKV, and HIV because these viruses do not encode any enzymes with m6A methyltransferase
activity (37-41,51,54). To determine whether host m6A machinery was responsible for the viral m6A
modification, the FLAG-tagged METTL3 gene was expressed in Vero-E6 cells by transfection (Fig.
3A). qRT-PCR of the RdRp gene was performed following formaldehyde-crosslinked RIP using an
anti-FLAG antibody to pull down METTL3-bound RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were pulled down by
METTL3 (Fig. 3B), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could interact with METTL3. We next knocked
6

down endogenous METTL3 in Vero-E6 cells using shRNA (Fig. 3D). m A abundance in SARS-CoV-2
RNA was detected by using qRT-PCR (Fig. 3E) or northern blotting (Fig. 3F) after MeRIP. We found

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.338558; this version posted October 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

that silencing METTL3 by shRNA resulted in decreased abundance of m6A in SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Fig.
3D and E). In contrast, overexpression of METTL3 by transfection increased the abundance of m6Abound SAR-CoV-2 RNAs (Fig. 3C). To further confirm our results, MeRIP-Seq was performed after
METTL3 knockdown (Fig. 3G and Fig. S4). Our results showed that the methylation peaks were not
changed, but that the frequency of methylation was significantly decreased, suggesting that the m6A
modification levels in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were linked to METTL3 expression. Taken together,
these results indicated that METTL3 acted as a methyltransferase in the viral genome.
Viral protein expression and progeny virus production by HIV, HCV, and EV71 are affected by the
expression of endogenous methyltransferases or demethylases (37,39-41,51). Endogenous METTL3
(Fig. 4A) or FTO (Fig. 4B) in Vero-E6 cells was knocked down by specific shRNAs, followed by
SARS-CoV-2 infection to check whether METTL3 or FTO affected viral replication. Viral RNA copy
numbers were quantified by qRT-PCR of the N or RdRp gene using standard protocols. We found
that efficient knockdown of METTL3 resulted in not only significantly decreases in viral N and RdRp
gene copy numbers (Fig. 4C and D) but also decreased expression of NP (Fig. 4A). However,
knockdown of FTO had the opposite effect (Fig. 4B, E, F). These results suggested that the m6A
methyltransferase METTL3 was linked to efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication.
SRAS-CoV-2 RdRp interacted with METTL3 and influenced its expression
In our previous study, METTL3 modulated EV71 replication by interacting with EV71 polymerase 3D
and regulating 3D sumoylation and ubiquitination (51). To investigate whether there was a similar
mechanism in SARS-CoV-2, pFlag-METTL3 and pHA-RdRp were cotransfected into HEK293T cells.
The IP experiment with anti-Flag antibodies, followed by staining with anti-HA or vice versa, showed
that METTL3 interacted with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein in the absence or presence of RNase A (Fig.
5A and B, Fig. S1A and B). In addition, our study showed that RdRp interacted with the
methyltransferase complex (Fig. S2). To further confirm our results, the colocalization of METTL3 and
RdRp was checked after cotransfection of the cells with the two plasmids. Notably, METTL3 was
distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm when RdRp was co-expressed (Fig. 5E).The
colocalization of METTL3 and RdRp supported the interaction between these two proteins, which
bound to viral RNAs. Moreover, METTL3 expression was increased as more RdRp was expressed by
transfection or vice versa (Fig. 5C and D), suggesting that the abundance of METTL3 and RdRp
influenced the expression of RdRp or METTL3.
SRAS-CoV-2 RdRp regulated METTL3 sumoylation and ubiquitination
To analyze how viral protein RdRp affected the m6A machinery components, we first checked the
RNA abundance of all the m6A writers, erasers, and readers after different infection times, as
indicated (Fig. 6A). The RNA abundances of METTL3, METT14, WTAP, ALKBH5, FTO, and YTH
were not changed (Fig. 6A and Fig. S3), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 did not influence the RNA levels
of m6A-related proteins. Post-transcriptional modifications, such as ubiquitination and sumoylation,
affect METTL3 protein abundance and function. EV71 3D protein interacted with METTL3 and

affected the expression and localization METTL3, similar to the results observed for SARS-CoV-2
infection. We next investigated whether RdRp affected the modification of METTL3. To this end,
METTL3, pFlag-RdRp, HA-SUMO-1, and myc-Ubc-9 were transfected into HEK293T cells. The
western blotting results showed that sumoylation of METTL3 was reduced in the presence of RdRp
expression (Fig. 6B). Cotransfection with pMETTL3, Flag-RdRp, and HA-Ub resulted in decreased
ubiquitination of METTL3 (Fig. 6C). Further experiments showed that overexpression of RdRp
resulted in decreased K48-linked ubiquitination (Fig. 6D) and K63-linked ubiquitination (Fig. 6E),
which could explain how RdRp regulated METTL3 expression.
DISCUSSION
6

In the current study, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA underwent m A modification by host
m6A machinery. The expression and localization of host m6A components were altered during SARSCoV-2 infection. Knockdown of METTL3 decreased the replication of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that
m6A modification played key roles in viral replication. Further studies showed that the viral polymerase
RdRp interacted with METTL3 and regulated its sumoylation and ubiquitination to affect its expression
and localization. Overall, our study showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was m6A modified and that
METTL3 played a role in regulating viral replication.
RNA modification, such as m6A, m5C, and ac4C, regulates viral protein expression and progeny
virus production (5-10). m6A modification has been identified in RNA viruses replicating both in the
nucleus and cytoplasm (5,9,55). In our previous study, we found that coronavirus WIV-1 harbored an
6

6

m A modification (data not shown). Therefore, we assessed the internal m A modification status of
6

SARS-CoV-2 RNA by MeRIP-Seq; the results demonstrated that m A peaks were mainly distributed
in both 5′ and 3′ ends spanning the ORF1ab-, N-, and ORF10-encoding regions. The m6A
modification pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of host mRNAs (12,56), but different from
6

that of EV71 virus, whose m A sites are distributed in coding regions of the middle of viral genome
6

(51). The m A motif (RRACH) is different from reported RNA modification sites harboring an AAGAA
motif. Notably, 44 m6A motifs were found in the five enriched peaks, most of which were distributed in
the N gene region.
SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in not only elevated expression of METTL3 but also altered
distribution in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. We also found that METTL14, WTAP, ALKBH5, and
FTO colocalized with the viral protein NP, supporting that SARS-CoV-2 infection affected the m6A
methyltransferase and demethylases. The colocalization of viral NP and host m6A proteins supported
6

that the m A modification machinery could modify cytoplasmic SARS-CoV-2 RNA during infection. In
our previous study, we found that METTL3 interacted with EV71 polymerase 3D protein (51).
Cotransfection of cells with METTL3 and 3D resulted in both nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of
METTL3, implying that 3D played roles in the distribution of METTL3 in the cytoplasm; however, the
specific mechanism is still unknown. In the current study, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp
protein induced the expression and cytoplasmic distribution of METTL3.
Most RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, including ZIKV, West Nile virus, and EV71,
hijack the host m6A machinery to modify the RNA and therefore do not encode methyltransferase

(37,38,51). SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins NSP14 and NSP16 have methyltransferase function
and play key roles in the m7G cap and 2’-O-methylation modification (57-59). Our study showed that
6

METTL3 interacted with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Notably, the expression of METTL3 is linked to the m A
6

modification level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Knocking down METTL3 resulted in decreased m A
modification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which was detected either by MeRIP northern blotting or by
MERIP-Seq. However, overexpression of METTL3 resulted in elevated m6A modification, suggesting
that METTL3 may be the methyltransferase modifying viral RNA.
METTL3 is a multifunctional protein that functions during EV71 infection. Viral RpRd 3D protein
binds to the methyltransferase complex, and METTL3 regulates the ubiquitination of 3D to promote
viral replication (51). In this study, knockdown of METTL3 resulted in decreased SARS-CoV-2
replication; this result could be explained by the absence of METTL3 methyltransferase activity, which
catalyzes the methylation of viral RNA. To address whether key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 interacted
with m6A components to facilitate virus replication, we checked the interactions of METTL3 with viral
RdRp, which bound to viral RNA. The results showed that METTL3 not only interacted with RdRp but
also promoted RdRp expression; the opposite result was also true. In contrast to EV71 3D protein, for
which post-translational modification was modulated by METTL3, SARS-CoV-2 RdRp expression
altered the localization pattern of METTL3. The distribution of METTL3 in the presence of RdRp
expression confirmed the interaction between METTL3 and RdRp and may explain the presence of
METTL3 in the cytoplasm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sumoylation and ubiquitination affect the
function and expression of METTL3, respectively (60). To elucidate how RdRp expression increased
the expression of METTL3, we checked the protein modification of METTL3. The results showed that
RdRp expression decreased the sumoylation and overall ubiquitination levels. Moreover, K48- and
K63-linked ubiquitination levels were reduced. These data supported that RdRp not only promoted
methyltransferase activity but also increased METTL3 expression by decreasing its ubiquitination.
In summary, our results provided evidence that the host m6A machinery interacted with viral key
proteins to facilitate the replication of SARS-CoV-2. First, METTL3 functioned as a methyltransferase,
6

adding the m A modification to viral RNA. Second, METTL3 interacted with viral RdRp, which resulted
in METTL3 distribution both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Importantly, RdRp boosted the expression
of METTL3 by altering the ubiquitination pattern through an unknown mechanism (Fig. 7). Further
studies are required to elucidate this mechanism. The functional m6A sites on the SARS-CoV-2 RNA
were not defined in our study yet, which is under investigation.

with anti-Flag (A) or anti-METTL3 (B) antibodies. (C and D) Western blotting. HEK293T cells were
transfected with 1 μg pFlag-METTL3 (C) or pHA-RdRp (D) together with different amounts of pHARdRp (C) or pFlag-METTL3 (D) (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 μg, respectively) in six-well plates. The
expression of METTL3 and RdRp was detected by western blotting. (E) Confocal microscopy images.
HEK293T cells were transfected with pFlag-METTL3 with or without HA-RdRp transfection.
Costaining was performed using anti-Flag (green) and anti-HA antibodies (red). The nucleus (blue)
was stained with Hoechst.
Figure 6. RdRp expression regulated the sumoylation and ubiquitination of METTL3. (A) RNA
expression of host methyltransferases. Total RNA was harvested from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6
cells every 2 h, as indicated. The mRNAs were separated and subjected to next-generation
sequencing. RNA levels of host methyltransferases were normalized according to the sequencing
reads. (B) Sumoylation assay. METTL3 was overexpressed in HEK293T cells by transfection with
pMETTL3, followed by transfection with pFlag-RdRp, pHA-SUMO-1, and pMyc-Ubc9. IP and
immunoblot analyses were performed using the indicated antibodies for the sumoylation assay. (C–E)
Ubiquitination assay. HEK293T cells were transfected with pFlag-RdRp, pHA-Ubi, pHA-K48, and
pHA-K63 after METTL3 overexpression. IP and immunoblot analyses were performed using the
indicated antibodies.
