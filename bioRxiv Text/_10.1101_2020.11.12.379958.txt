Running Title: drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2

Abstract
The current emergency of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 urged the need for
broad-spectrum antiviral drugs as the first line of treatment. Coronaviruses are a large family
of viruses that already challenged humanity in at least two other previous outbreaks and are
likely to be a constant threat for the future. In this work we developed a pipeline based on in
silico docking of known drugs on SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase combined
with in vitro antiviral assays on both SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold human coronavirus
HCoV-OC43. Results showed that certain drugs displayed activity for both viruses at a similar
inhibitory concentration, while others were specific. In particular, the antipsychotic drug
lurasidone and the antiviral drug elbasvir showed promising activity in the low micromolar
range against both viruses with good selective index.

Introduction
The growth in human and animal population density through urbanization and
agricultural development, combined with increased mobility and commercial transportation,
land perturbation and climate change, all have an impact on virus emergence and epidemiology.
Over the past decades, emerging zoonotic RNA viruses continuously gripped the world’s
attention, either briefly (like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-1
in 2003), or continuously. Many RNA virus threats were considered as re-emerging including
Dengue, Zika, Ebola, and Chikungunya virus, and current consensus predicts that novel and
potentially highly pathogenic agents will continue to emerge from the large, genetically
variable natural pools present in the environment. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are of particular
concern due to high case-fatality rates, lack of therapeutics as well as the ability to seed
outbreaks that rapidly cross geographic borders. A large number of highly diverse CoVs have
been identified in animal hosts and especially in bat species, where they may have the potential
to diffuse in other species including humans (Fan et al., 2019).
Coronaviruses consist of a large and diverse family of viruses that cause multiple
respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases of varying severity, including the common
cold, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia (Weiss & Leibowitz, 2011). The CoV family is divided into
four genera (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) and thus far human CoV are limited to the alpha
(HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and beta genera (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1); the latter
includes SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
A new previously unknown coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, was discovered in December
2019 in Wuhan (Hubei province of China) and sequenced by January 2020 (Lu et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19), and
was declared as 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on January 30th, 2020 by
the World Health Organization (www.who.int).

Currently, for the COVID19 outbreak, many known drugs are under clinical
investigation (Kupferschmidt, 2020) (Magro, 2020), following different general principles and
mechanisms of action: 1. the control of cytokine storms due to the hyper-reaction of the
immune system against the virus (e.g. corticosteroids, (Salton et al., 2020)); 2. the control of
coagulopathy (e.g. heparin) 3. the inhibition of viral RdRp (e.g. prodrugs favipiravir and
remdesivir); 4. the inhibition of viral entry (e.g. hydroxychloroquine); 5. the inhibition of the
viral main protease (e.g. lopinavir and ritonavir); 5. the inhibition of viral attachment (the viral
receptor ACE2 antagonist losartan).
Despite their species diversity, CoVs share key genomic elements that are essential for
viral replication, suggesting the possibility to design broad spectrum therapeutic agents to
address the current epidemic and manage possible future outbreaks. The target considered in
this work to identify new inhibitors is the highly conserved RNA dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp), that plays a crucial role in CoV replication cycle, catalyzing the synthesis of new viral
RNA (Te Velthuis et al., 2012). The cryo-EM structure of RdRp of SARS-CoV-1 and of SARSCoV-2, bound to nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors, have been recently solved (PDB codes: 6NUR
(Kirchdoerfer & Ward, 2019), and 6M71 (Gao et al., 2020), respectively). The two proteins
share a sequence identity of 96% (98% conservative substitution) and a structural r.m.s.d. of
0.54 Å (considering 788 Cas).
The exploration of libraries of molecules already in use as human drugs and well
characterized in terms of human metabolism might allow the identification of antivirals that
could be, in principle, rapidly tested in patients. Accordingly, we chose to analyze in silico the
public database of approved drugs (DrugBank library, https://go.drugbank.com/), targeting a
wide region around the active site of SARS-CoV RdRp. The computational work allowed the
selection of 13 commercially available compounds with predicted high affinity for the protein
and favorable solubility properties. These potential inhibitors (together with suramin, known

to inhibit several RNA viruses) have been tested in cell based assays against SARS-CoV-2 and
CoV-OC43 (Su et al., 2016), revealing moderate to high antiviral activities for seven of them.
Our results confirm antiviral properties already described for some of the selected compounds,
and, more importantly, show new interesting properties for the compounds lurasidone and
elbasvir as betacoronavirus inhibitors.

Results
In silico docking of approved drugs.
For the purpose of known drugs repurposing, a total of 6996 molecules were
downloaded from the DrugBank library (https://www.drugbank.ca/) to target a wide region
(~13,300 Å3) around the active site of SARS-CoV RdRp (PDB-ID 6NUR; (Kirchdoerfer &
Ward, 2019)). The in silico screening was divided into two runs: a fast procedure for the
selection of the best 2% of the library (118 compounds), with predicted binding free energy
values (ΔG) from -8.9 to -7.6 kcal/mol, followed by a more accurate analysis with
AutoDock4.2. In this way we ranked 118 known drugs based on the ΔG value of the best pose
for every compound (between -11.7 kcal/mol (predicted Ki=2.7 nM) and -0.12 kcal/mol
(predicted Ki=819 mM). The list of the first best 60 compounds is reported in supplemental
material (Table S1).
From our list a reasonable number of compounds was selected for cell-based assays
(Table 1), taking into account commercial availability and solubility properties. Suramin was
added to the list, since it was already known to inhibit several RNA viruses such as flavivirus
(Basavannacharya & Vasudevan, 2014) (Albulescu et al., 2017), norovirus (Mastrangelo et al.,
2012), but also chikungunya and Ebola viruses (Albulescu et al., 2017) (Henß et al., 2016).

The best in silico docking pose of each of the selected thirteen compounds, in the RdRp
active site, is reported in Figure 1A. The protein region explored is located between thumb,
fingers and palm domains and would host growing dsRNA during polymerase activity. Such
region defines a wide, complex and variable hydrophilic protein surface, and it is therefore able
to host very different types of ligands. In Figure 1B, C, D we report the lurasidone and elbasvir
best docking sites, between the thumb and fingers domains and in palm domain, respectively.

targeting the active site of main protease (PDB-ID: 6LU7 (Jin et al., 2020)) obtaining the results
listed in Table 1. Eight of the selected compounds showed predicted binding affinity for the
protease lower than 50 nM suggesting that such known drugs could be in principle active
against multiple targets.

Antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43
The antiviral activity of the selected compounds was assessed against two pathogenic
CoVs strains: SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43.

Antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. A High Content Assay (HCA) has been developed to
test antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The assay was established using Huh7 cells
engineered with the human ACE-2 receptor (Huh7-hACE2) to promote viral infection. The
readout of the assay was accessed using immunofluorescence to quantify the number of Spikepositive cells to measure infected cells, and number of nuclei to measure cell viability, as shown
in Figure 2.

All 14 compounds were tested from a starting concentration of 100 µM in 2-fold dilutions. 11
compounds showed activity at least in one tested concentration. Lurasidone, grazoprevir,
venetoclax and elbasvir showed the best outcomes, with EC50 in the micromolar range and
cytotoxicity >100 µM. Lurasidone showed an EC50 of 18 µM with a good dose-response curve
devoid of cytotoxicity up to 100 µM. The compound ponatinib reached the lowest EC50 (1.1 µM)

against SARS-CoV2, although the elevated cytotoxicity (CC50=8.7 µM) indicated a poor
selectivity index (calculated as the ratio of the CC50 and the EC50 values).
The known HCV inhibitors elbasvir, simeprevir and grazoprevir showed EC50 values
of 23 µM, 9.3 µM and 16 µM, respectively. However, their activity as HCV inhibitors is in the
low nanomolar range and simeprevir showed an unfavorable CC50 of 47.5 µM. The antiviral
activity of suramin was confirmed, with an EC50 of 64 µM, similarly to previous reports
(Salgado-Benvindo et al., 2020). A weak activity was detected with compounds irinotecan,
teniposide and carbenoxolone, all with an EC50 around 50-100 µM. In conclusion, our data
showed in vitro activity for most of the compounds selected in silico against SARS-CoV RdRp.
Among all, lurasidone grazoprevir and elbasvir showed the best antiviral profile against SARSCoV-2 (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Antiviral efficacy of the best selected compounds against SARS-CoV-2. The
antiviral activity was evaluated by the high-content assay infecting Huh7-hACE2 cells exposed
to increasing amounts of compounds. Number of nuclei were quantified in parallel. The
percentage infectivity inhibition (white dots) was normalized with the average infection ratio
of wells treated with 1% DMSO. Percentage of nuclei (blue triangles) was calculated by
comparing the average number of nuclei of noninfected wells treated with 1% DMSO. Error
bars represent the standard deviation (SD) of 2 independent experiments.

Antiviral activity against HCoV-OC43. In order to evaluate the anti-HCoV-OC43 activity of
the selected compounds, focus reduction assays were performed on MRC-5 cells, as described
in the Materials and Methods section and elsewhere (Marcello et al., 2020). Results on antiviral
activity and cell toxicity are reported in Table 3, Figure 4 and Figure S3.

exerted high antiviral activity against HCoV-OC43, exhibiting EC50 in the low micromolar
range: 1.1 µM and 1.5 µM, respectively. A moderate antiviral activity was shown by tedizolid,
carbenoxolone and suramin, with EC50 ranging from 11.0 µM to 94.0 µM. The afore-mentioned
compounds’ antiviral effect was not a consequence of cytotoxicity, since none of the screened
compounds significantly reduced cell viability at any concentration used in the antiviral assays
(i.e. up to 100 µM), exhibiting CC50 values higher than 1000 µM. By contrast, the remaining
compounds did not exhibit interesting features as anti-HCoV-OC43 molecules, due to either
no antiviral activity (cefoperazone, teniposide, irinotecan, natamycin), or low-moderate
selectivity index (ponatinib, venetoclax, simeprevir, grazoprevir). In summary, these data
showed that alectinib, lurasidone and elbasvir were endowed with strong anti-HCoV-OC43
activity (Figure 4), with minimal toxicity and selectivity indexes higher than 600.

Discussion
An accurate in silico docking search within a wide region around the SARS-CoV RdRp
active site, allowed us to select 13 known drugs from the DrugBank library to be experimentally
tested. We added suramin to the list, a well-known compound able to inhibit different RNA
viruses (Mastrangelo et al., 2012) (De Clercq, 1979) (Albulescu et al., 2015).
Unexpectedly, a rather high percentage (>60%) of the selected compounds showed some in
vitro activity against one or both of the tested CoV strains. A possible explanation for such a
positive result is related to the characteristics of the protein region selected for the in silico
docking. Such a portion of the protein is a wide, complex and rather hydrophilic surface with
many conformational degrees of freedom, allowing it to adapt to the growing dsRNA during
translation. Accordingly, the average crystallographic (or cryoEM) conformation of this region
must be capable to accommodate different kind of ligands (as shown in Figure 1), with a

preferential affinity for large compounds possessing polar/charged moieties and planar
aromatic groups: i.e. compounds that generally mimics RNA backbone and bases. In other
words, the in silico docking on RdRp not only selects compounds potentially capable of
interfering with the polymerase activity but could also act as a molecular filter for the selection
of properties generally favorable for protein binding/inhibition. This explanation is supported
by the predicted high affinity for the main protease of most of the selected compounds (Table
1).
Among the tested compounds lurasidone and elbasvir displayed higher activity and
lower cytotoxicity against both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 strains. Lurasidone lead to
complete inhibition of both strains with EC50 values in the micromolar range (18 and 1.1 µM,
respectively) and favorable selectivity indexes. Lurasidone is an antipsychotic drug for
treatment of acute depression and schizophrenia, known to bind with a low nanomolar affinity
to Dopamine-2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors, and with slightly lower affinity to
alpha-2C adrenergic receptors (Greenberg & Citrome, 2017). Lurasidone was already
identified as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Elmezayen et al., 2020) and
in our in silico analysis it showed good predicted binding affinity for both RdRp and main
protease. Since SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 share a high level of protein sequence
conservation (Vijgen et al., 2005) we hypothesize that mechanisms of action of lurasidone
against these viruses might be the same.
Elbasvir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 with EC50 values in the micromolar
range (about 23 and 1.5 µM, respectively). Previous in silico studies predicted elbasvir as a
high affinity compound for the RdRp, the papain-like protease and the helicase of SARS-CoV2 (Balasubramaniam & Shmookler Reis, 2020), whereas our in silico investigation suggested
a preferential binding for the main protease (1.2 nM). Elbasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A

protein that has not homologues in coronaviruses: in light of our and previous work results, it
has the potential to inhibit different viral proteins.
Alectinib (with the best in silico Ki against RdRp) showed no activity against SARSCoV-2 but it is the best compound against HCoV-OC43 (EC50=0.6 µM, CC50 value >1000
µM). Alectinib inhibits the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase receptor in the
nM range (Kinoshita et al., 2012), binding to the ATP binding site. Therefore, we can speculate
that it might inhibit other kinases essential for HCoV-OC43 replication in MRC-5 cells.
Moreover, we can speculate that the compound could act as a competitive inhibitor of RdRp,
interfering with the nucleotide binding site(s) of the enzyme. In this case a possible explanation
for the different results obtained for SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 could be related to the
differences between the two polymerases (sequence identity of 55.1%) (Elfiky, 2020).
Grazoprevir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 around 16 µM (CC50 value >100
µM). Published computational studies suggested grazoprevir as a potential inhibitor of the
nucleocapsid protein or the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Behera et al., 2020).
Grazoprevir is an inhibitor of HCV protease and it is often used for therapy in combination
with elbasvir (in the drug named zepatier).
Simeprevir, another inhibitor of HCV protease, has been previously shown to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 in synergy with remdesivir (Lo et al., 2020). In our experiments it showed a
similar potency against both SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 about 9.3 µM) and HCoV-OC43 (EC50 about
2.1 µM) but with low SI. From our docking results its effect is likely directed against the
protease, but RdRp inhibition cannot be excluded.
ABT-199, also known as venetoclax, is a potent selective Bcl2 inhibitor, which induces
the apoptosis pathway. An early work showed that Bcl2 expression prevents SARS-CoV

induced apoptosis (Bordi et al., 2006). In addition, previous reports demonstrated that SARSCoV 7a protein was dependent on Bcl2 to induce apoptosis, suggesting Bcl2 as an important
host factor for virus replication and pathogenesis (Tan et al., 2007). However, despite its good
EC50 (about 6.2 µM) against SARS-CoV-2, venetoclax shows high toxicity in the tested cells.
Ponatinib, an oral drug for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia
chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was already proposed as SARS-CoV-2
inhibitor (Nguyen et al., 2020) (Sauvat et al., 2020) (Gordon et al., 2020), and it is shown here
to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 with a poor selective index.
All the other compounds, although some of them have been described in the literature
as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. teniposide (Kadioglu1 et al., n.d.) and irinotecan
(B, 2020), did not show any relevant activity in either of the two viruses tested.

Conclusions
In our work we have: 1. excluded SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity for teniposide
(Kadioglu1 et al., n.d.) and irinotecan (B, 2020), selected from previous computational studies;
2. showed the ability of some of the already described anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds to inhibit
also coronavirus HCoV-OC43 causing the common cold (suramin, ponatinib - although with a
low SI); and most importantly 3. showed the capability of some of the selected drugs to
selectively inhibit HCoV-OC43 (alectinib) or SARS-CoV-2 (grazoprevir) or be active against
both CoV strains (lurasidone and elbasvir). Treatment of CoV infections with drugs that could
inhibit different viral targets, as predicted for lurasidone and elbasvir, would be an effective
way to lower chances of the emergence of drug resistant viral strains.
Of note, in previous works it was demonstrated that alectinib (Song et al., 2015) could
penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) exerting its activity in the central nervous system

(CNS). Since HCoV-OC43, as other coronaviruses, is able to invade the CNS (Dubé et al.,
2018), alectinib might be an interesting candidate for the treatment of HCoV-OC43 persistent
infections in the brain. Moreover, the free levels of alectinib found in both plasma and
cerebrospinal fluid are similar (Herden & Waller, 2018) and its EC50 against HCoV-OC43 (0.6
uM) is lower than the maximum level attainable in human serum with daily recommended
dosage (676 ng/mL corresponding to 1.4 µM) (Ly et al., 2018).
In conclusion, our approach allowed the identification of lead-drugs for further in vitro
and clinical investigation to contain the present outbreak. Furthermore, it could contribute to
the identification of broad spectrum anti-CoV inhibitors / therapies that would allow for a rapid
and effective reaction to future epidemics.

Materials and Methods
In silico docking. The virtual Library of DrugBank (https://www.drugbank.ca/)
employed for the docking analysis (6996 compounds) includes commercially available FDAapproved drugs as well as experimental drugs going through the FDA approval process. The
atomic coordinates of SARS-CoV RdRp (PDB-ID 6NUR) bound to NSP7 and NSP8 cofactors, were chosen as docking model for CoV polymerase. Hydrogen atoms and Kollman
charges (Singh & Kollman, 1984) were added using the program Python Molecule Viewer
1.5.4 (MGL-tools package http://mgltools.scripps.edu/). The protein model was then used to
build a discrete grid within a box of dimensions 22.5x26.3x22.5 Å3 (program autogrid
(Goodford, 1985)) as the explored volume for the docking search. The grid was centered near
the side chain of Lys545, to include a wide region around the protein active site. During the
computational analysis, the protein was constrained as rigid, whereas the small molecules were
free to move. The in silico screen was divided into two runs: a fast procedure using AutoDock

Vina (Trott & Olson, 2009) for the selection of the best compounds, followed by a more
accurate screen using AutoDock4.2 (Morris et al., 2009). The Autodock Vina docking search
produced a ranked list of all compounds, with predicted binding free energy values (ΔG)
ranging between -0.9 kcal/mol and -8.9 kcal/mol. The best 118 compounds (~2% of the library,
ΔG between -7.6 to -8.9 kcal/mol) were further analyzed using AutoDock4.2 (Morris et al.,
2009), with 80 hybrid GA-LS genetic algorithm runs. Among the molecules with higher
predicted affinity for RdRp (ΔG values varying between -0.12 and -11.7 kcal/mol), 13 FDA
approved drugs were selected, taking into account commercial availability and solubility
properties, for in vitro assays. Since among such drugs were present known inhibitor of viral
protease we investigated their binding affinity for CoV main protease (PDB-ID 6LU7; (Jin et
al., 2020)). Briefly, we explored with AutoDock4.2 a region of 15x22.5x22.5 Å3 (after
mutating the active site Cys145 to Ala) centered between the side chains of Asn142 and
Gln189.

SARS-CoV-2 cell based assays
Cell lines and viruses. Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586) , the human hepatocarcinoma Huh7
cells kindly provided by Ralf Bartenschlager (University of Heidelberg, Germany) and Huh 7
engineering by lentivirus transduction to overexpress the human ACE2 (Huh-7hACE2) were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified 7 Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco). Working stocks of SARS-CoV-2 ICGEB-FVG_5 isolated in
Trieste, Italy, were routinely propagated and titrated on Vero E6 cells (Licastro et al., 2020).
Compounds preparation. Compounds were prepared in 2-fold serial dilutions (8 points
dilutions) in DMSO, and then diluted 16x in PBS in an intermediate plate. Finally, compounds
were transferred to the 96 well assay plate containing cells and virus medium (6x in grown
medium, final dilution 100x).

High Content Assay: Huh 7- hACE2 cells were seeded in a 96 wells’ plate, at 8x103 cells/well
density and incubated at 37°C overnight. Cells were treated with serial dilution of the
compounds andthen infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 0.1 MOI. Controls included: positive
controls like infected cells treated with 50 µM of Hydroxychloroquine as well as non-infected
cells treated with vehicle (1 % DMSO), and negative controls such as infected cells treated
with vehicle. Plates were incubated for 20 h at 37°C, and then fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min
at room temperature and washed twice with PBS 1x. Cells were treated with 0.1% of TritonX for 15 min, followed incubation of 30 min in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% of bovine
serum albumin-BSA). Then, a primary recombinant monoclonal Spike antibody (CR3022) was
diluted in blocking buffer and incubate for 2 h at 37°C (Rajasekharan et al., 2020). Cells were
washed 2 times in PBS and incubated the secondary antibody AlexaFluor488-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Cat No. A-11001, Thermo-Scientific) plus DAPI for 1 h at 37°C. Each plate
was washed twice with PBS. All plates were filled up with 150 µl of PBS/well. Digital images
were acquired using a high content imaging system, the Operetta (Perkin Elmer). The digital
images were taken from 9 different fields of each well at 20× magnification. Total number of
cells and the number of infected cells were analysis using Columbus Image Data Storage and
Analysis System (Perkin Elmer).

Data normalization and analysis: Infection ration was defined as ratio between (i) the total
number of infected cells, and (ii) the total number of cells. Data were normalized with the
negative (DMSO-treated, infected cells) and positive (infected cells treated with 50 µM
Hydroxychloroquine) controls. Percentage inhibition was calculated based in infection ratio
values with the formula: (1-( infection ratio samples – Avarage (Av) infection ratio of positive
control) /(Av. infection ratio of negative control – Av. infection ratio of positive control)) x100.

Percentage of nuclei was calculate from values of cell number with the formula: Cell number
test sample/Avg. cell number of positive control) × 100. Values were plotted against dilutions
expressed as antilog. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) and the half maximum
cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated using GraphPad Prism Version 7.

HCoV-OC43 cell-based assays
Reagents. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO).
The mouse anti-coronavirus monoclonal antibody MAB9013 was purchased from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany). The secondary antibody peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F (ab’)2
Fragment Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA, USA).

Cell lines and viruses. Human lung fibroblast cells MRC-5 (ATCC® CCL-171) were propagated
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented
with 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) and heat inactivated,
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Human coronavirus strain OC43 (HCoV–OC43)
(ATCC® VR-1558) was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,
MD, USA). The virus was propagated in MRC-5 cells at 33°C, in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator, and titrated by standard plaque method on MRC-5 cells, as described elsewhere
(Marcello et al., 2020); titers were expressed in terms of plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml).

Cell viability assay. Cell viability was measured using the MTS assay, as described elsewhere
(Lembo et al., 2014). MRC-5 cells were seeded at a density of 2×104 cells/well in 96-well plates
and treated the next day with compounds at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.05 μM, under
the same experimental conditions described for the antiviral assays. Treatment of control wells

with equal volumes of DMSO was performed in order to rule out the possibility of any cytotoxic
effect ascribable to the solvent. After 20 h of incubation, cell viability was determined using the
Cell Titer 96 Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Absorbances were measured using a Microplate Reader (Model 680,
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at 490 nm. The effect on cell viability at different
concentrations of compounds was expressed as a percentage, by comparing absorbances of
treated cells with those of cells incubated with culture medium and equal volumes of DMSO.
The 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) and standard deviation (SD) values were determined
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Antiviral assay. The antiviral activity was determined by focus reduction assay. MRC-5 cells
were seeded, at 2×104 cells/well density, in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C overnight. The
next day, the medium was removed from the plates and infection was performed with ca. 40
PFU of a stock of HCoV-OC43 (MOI 0.2 PFU/cells) in presence of serial dilutions of
compounds, ranging from 100 to 0.005 µM. Control wells were infected in presence of equal
volumes of DMSO. After 20 h of incubation at 33°C in a humified 5% CO2 atmosphere, cells
were fixed with cold acetone-methanol (50:50) and subjected to indirect immunostaining by
using an anti-coronavirus monoclonal antibody (MAB9013). The number of immunostained foci
was counted, and the percent inhibition of virus infectivity was determined by comparing the
number of foci in treated wells with the number in untreated control wells. The focus reduction
assays were conducted in three independent experiments. Where possible, half-maximal
antiviral effective concentration (EC50) and SD values were calculated by regression analysis
using the software GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) by fitting a
variable slope-sigmoidal dose–response curve.
