ABSTRACT (150 words)

23

We present a comprehensive vaccine strategy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

24

2 (SARS-CoV-2) by combining antigen optimization and nanoparticle display. We first developed

25

a receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody column for purification and displayed the

26

RBD on self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SApNPs) using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system.

27

We then identified the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) stalk as a major cause of spike metastability, designed

28

an HR2-deleted glycine-capped spike (S2G∆HR2), and displayed S2G∆HR2 on three SApNPs

29

with high yield, purity, and antigenicity. Compared to the RBD, the RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited

30

a more potent murine neutralizing antibody (NAb) response on par with the spike. S2G∆HR2

31

elicited two-fold-higher NAb titers than the proline-capped spike (S2P), while S2G∆HR2 SApNPs

32

derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers. The

33

S2G∆HR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP also induced critically needed T-cell immunity, thereby

34

providing a next-generation vaccine candidate to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

41

Three beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) have caused outbreaks in humans, including the severe acute

42

respiratory syndrome CoV-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-

43

CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of COVID-19 (1-3) and has resulted in more

44

than 920,000 deaths worldwide (4). Enormous efforts are being undertaken to develop effective

45

therapeutics and prophylactics for SARS-CoV-2. Small molecules that can block the host receptor,

46

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)

47

(5), which is required to process the spike (S) protein, are considered treatment in addition to other

48

interventions (6). While the immunology underlying COVID-19 is yet to be fully understood (6-

49

8), vaccine development is well underway (9, 10). Two inactivated vaccines have exhibited robust

50

neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in animals (11, 12), whereas vectored vaccines based on

51

human adenovirus (Ad) type-5/26 and chimpanzee Ad (ChAdOx1) have been tested in nonhuman

52

primates (NHPs) and human trials (13-16). Nucleic acid vaccines have further accelerated the

53

response to the pandemic (17). Both DNA (18-20) and mRNA (21) vaccines have been rapidly

54

developed, with moderate NAb titers observed for the mRNA vaccine in medium and high dose

55

groups (21). A recombinant spike adjuvanted with lipid nanoparticles (NPs), NVX-CoV2373, was

56

reported to elicit high NAb titers in human trials that were on average four-fold greater than in

57

convalescent patients (22, 23). As of now, no vaccine has yet been approved by the U.S. Food and

58

Drug Administration (FDA) for human use.

59

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a trimer of S1-S2 heterodimers. The S1 subunit contains

60

a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds to ACE2 on host cells to initiate infection. The S2

61

subunit consists of a fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeat regions 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2). Upon

62

endocytosis of the virion, the S1 subunit is cleaved off to facilitate the FP insertion into the host

63

membrane, while the remaining S2 refolds to bring HR1 and HR2 together to fuse the viral and

64

host cell membranes (24). The spike protein harbors all NAb epitopes and is the main target for

65

vaccine development against SARS-associated CoVs (25). Convalescent plasma (CP) has been

66

used to treat COVID-19 patients in severe conditions (26), highlighting the importance of NAbs

67

in protection (27). Due to sequence conservation of RBD (but only around 73%), some previously

68

identified NAbs targeting the SARS-CoV-1 RBD have been shown to bind and cross-neutralize

69

SARS-CoV-2 (28, 29). Using single-cell technologies and SARS-CoV-2 RBD or spike as a bait,

70

potent NAbs have now been isolated from COVID-19 patients (30-36). Camelid-derived single-

71

chain NAbs have also been obtained by panning naïve or immune llama single-chain antibody

72

(VHH) libraries (37, 38). Structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD in unliganded (39, 40),

73

ACE2-bound (41, 42), and antibody-bound (43-45) states determined by x-ray crystallography and

74

cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have paved the way for rational vaccine design. Cryo-EM

75

and cryo-electron tomography (ET) have revealed the inherent spike metastability and the co-

76

existence of pre/post-fusion spikes on virions (46). A double-proline mutation, S2P (46), has been

77

used in most soluble constructs and all but inactivated vaccines, although a HexaPro version with

78

greater yield and stability is now available (47). Cryo-ET analysis has also uncovered a dynamic,

79

triple-hinged HR2 stalk that facilitates viral entry and immune evasion (48-50).

80

In this study, we design and optimize SARS-CoV-2 RBD/spike antigens and display them

81

on self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SApNPs) as COVID-19 vaccine candidates. To facilitate

82

vaccine purification, we developed an immunoaffinity column based on antibody CR3022 that

83

binds to both SARS-CoV-1/2 RBDs (29, 44). We first designed a scaffolded RBD trimer to mimic

84

the “RBD-up” spike conformation. For multivalent display, RBDs were attached to SApNPs using

85

the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system (51), providing a robust and practical strategy for generating RBD

86

SApNP vaccines. We probed the spike metastability by comparing two uncleaved spike antigens,

87

S2P (K986P/V987P) and S2G (K986G/V987G). The SARS-CoV-2 S2G spike exhibited abnormal

88

behavior, suggesting that an unidentified facet of the spike can promote conformational change

89

and block antibody access to the RBD. An HR2-deleted spike, S2G∆HR2, produced high-purity

90

trimers, suggesting that the HR2 stalk may be a trigger of spike metastability consistent with recent

91

findings (48-50). We next displayed S2G∆HR2 on ferritin (FR), E2p, and I3-01 SApNPs (52, 53),

92

of which the latter two contain locking domains (LD) and helper T-cell epitopes within the protein

93

shell (54). In mouse immunization, the S2P spike elicited the lowest level of NAb response. In

94

contrast, the scaffolded RBD trimer registered two-to-three-fold higher NAb titers, with another

95

five-fold increase in NAb titer achieved by multivalent display on FR. S2G∆HR2 elicited up to

96

seven-fold higher NAb titers, while the two large, multilayered SApNPs induced up-to-10-fold

97

higher NAb titers compared to S2P. Further analysis indicated that the S2G∆HR2-presenting I3-

98

01v9 SApNP can elicit a strong Th1 response as well as other types of T-cell response needed for

99

protective cellular immunity. Our study thus identifies the HR2 stalk as a major cause of spike

100

metastability, validates an HR2-deleted spike design, and provides a set of RBD- and spike-based

101

virus-like particles (VLPs) as potential effective vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTS

Rational design of scaffolded RBD trimer and RBD-presenting SApNPs

104

RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor initiates the membrane fusion process (5). The crystal structure

105

of SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex revealed atomic details of receptor recognition (55). The

106

SARS-CoV-2 RBD has been used as a bait to isolate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from patient

107

samples (30-36). For SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, RBD-based vaccines have induced potent

108

NAbs that effectively block viral entry (25). Therefore, the RBD represents a major target for the

109

humoral response during viral infection and can be used to develop epitope-focused vaccines.

110

We first hypothesized that RBD attached to a trimeric scaffold could mimic the “RBD-up”

111

spike conformation and elicit NAbs that block ACE2 binding. To test this possibility, we designed

112

a fusion construct containing SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD, a short 5-aa G 4 S linker (with a 2-aa restriction

113

site), and a trimeric viral capsid protein, SHP (PDB: 1TD0) (Fig. 1A). Structural modeling showed

114

that the three tethered RBDs form a triangle of 92 Å (measured at L492), which is 14 and 18 Å

115

wider than the SARS-CoV-1 “two-RBD-up” spike (PDB: 6CRX, measured at L478) (56) and the

116

MERS-CoV “all-RBD-up” spike (PDB: 5X59, measured for L506) (57), respectively, allowing

117

NAb access to each RBD. We then developed an immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) column

118

to facilitate tag-free purification. Previously, NAb-derived IAC columns have been used to purify

119

HIV-1 Env trimers/NPs (52, 53, 58, 59), hepatitis C virus (HCV) E2 cores/NPs (60), and Ebola

120

virus (EBOV) GP trimers/NPs (54). Tian et al. reported that a SARS-CoV-1 NAb, CR3022, can

121

bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD (29). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CR3022 structure revealed a conserved

122

cryptic epitope that is shared by the two SARS-CoVs, suggesting that transient breathing motions

123

of the spike protein enable CR3022 binding to RBD (44). Here, we examined the utility of CR3022

124

in IAC columns. The SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD-5GS-1TD0 constructs were transiently expressed in

125

100-ml ExpiCHO cells and purified on a CR3022 column prior to size-exclusion chromatography

126

(SEC) using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. While the SARS-CoV-1 RBD construct showed

127

both aggregate (~8.6 ml) and trimer (~12.7 ml) peaks in the SEC profile, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

128

construct produced a single, pure trimer peak at ~12.8 ml (Fig. 1B). In sodium dodecyl sulfate-

129

polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a monomer band of ~37 kD and a trimer band

130

of ~100 kD were observed under reducing and non-reducing conditions, respectively (fig. S1A).

131

Antigenicity was assessed for the two scaffolded RBD trimers in enzyme-linked immunosorbent

132

assay (ELISA) after CR3022/SEC purification (Fig. 1C). RBD-specific NAbs targeting SARS-

133

CoV-1 (CR3022 (61), m396 (62), 80R (63), and S230 (64)) and SARS-CoV-2 (B38 (33), CB6

134

(32), S309 from a SARS survivor (28), and P2B-2F6 (31)), were tested in ELISA. Overall, similar

135

half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values were observed for the two RBD trimers

136

binding to their respective NAbs (Fig. 1C). The SARS-CoV-1 RBD trimer showed greater affinity

137

for CR3022 than its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart with a 1.3-fold difference in the EC 50 value,

138

consistent with previous findings (29, 44). Of the SARS-CoV-2 NAbs, B38 yielded a similar EC 50

139

value to CR3022. Antibody binding kinetics was measured using biolayer interferometry (BLI)

140

(Fig. 1D and fig. 1B). Overall, all tested antibodies exhibited a fast on-rate but with visible

141

differences in their off-rates. B38 showed a faster off-rate than other SARS-CoV-2 NAbs, while

142

CR3022, the antibody used to purify SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD proteins, exhibited a comparable

143

kinetic profile.

144

We then hypothesized that the SpyTag/SpyCatcher (or simply SPY) system can be used to

145

conjugate RBD to SApNPs to create multivalent RBD vaccines capable of eliciting a more potent

146

NAb response (Fig. 1E). The 13-aa SpyTag spontaneously reacts with the SpyCatcher protein to

147

form an irreversible isopeptide bond (51). The SPY system has been successfully used to attach

148

antigens to VLPs (65). Here, SpyTag was fused to the C terminus of RBD, while SpyCatcher was

149

fused to the N terminus of an SApNP subunit, both with a 5-aa G 4 S linker. This design was first

150

tested for the 24-meric ferritin (FR) used in our previous studies (52-54, 60). We compared two

151

production strategies – co-expression of RBD-5GS-SpyTag and SpyCatcher-5GS-FR versus

152

supernatant mix after separate expression – and performed purification on a CR3022 column.

153

Protein obtained from transient transfection in 50-ml ExpiCHO cells was analyzed by SEC on a

154

Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Fig. 1F). Both production strategies produced a peak (12 ml)

155

corresponding to SApNPs. While the SARS-CoV-2 construct outperformed its SARS-CoV-1

156

counterpart in particle yield (0.6-1.0 mg versus 0.3-0.5 mg after CR3022/SEC), the supernatant

157

mix appeared to be superior to co-expression for yield in both cases. Nonetheless, the results

158

suggest that both strategies can be used to produce RBD SApNPs in Good Manufacturing Practice

159

(GMP)-compatible Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Antigenicity was assessed for SEC-

160

purified RBD-5GS-SPY-5GS-FR SApNPs. In ELISA, RBD SApNPs showed slightly improved

161

mAb binding compared to the RBD trimers, as indicated by lower EC 50 values (Fig. 1G). In BLI,

162

a more pronounced effect of multivalent display on antigenicity was observed, showing notably

163

increased binding signals and plateaued dissociation (Fig. 1H and fig. 1C). Structural integrity of

164

various RBD SApNPs was analyzed by negative stain EM (nsEM) (Figs. 1I and 1J). For SARS-

165

CoV-1, an RBD-10GS-FR construct was included for comparison that produced very few SApNPs

166

(Fig. 1I, left). In contrast, the RBD-5GS-SPY-5GS-FR construct produced a high yield of SApNPs

167

with visible surface decorations (Fig. 1I, right). For SARS-CoV-2, the purified RBD-5GS-SPY-

168

5GS-FR SApNPs, irrespective of the production strategy, showed morphologies corresponding to

169

well-formed nanoparticles (Fig. 1J). Following a similar strategy, SARS-CoV-1/2 RBDs were also

170

attached to a multilayered I3-01v9 SApNP (54) (Fig. 1K). Despite the modest yield (Fig. 1L),

171

large SApNPs were readily observed in the EM images (Fig. 1M). In summary, we illustrate the

172

utility of the SPY system for rapid development of RBD-based SApNP vaccines. Compared to the

173

recently reported two-component RBD SApNPs (66), the SPY-linked RBD SApNPs presented

174

here may be more advantageous in terms of stability and manufacturability.

176

In addition to the RBD, the SARS-CoV-1/2 spikes contain other NAb epitopes (25), which are all

177

presented in a trimeric context (Fig. 2A). A double-proline mutation (2P) between HR1 and the

178

central helix (CH) has been used to stabilize the MERS-CoV (67) and SARS-CoV-1 spikes (56).

179

A similar 2P mutation (K986P/V987P) was introduced into the SARS-CoV-2 spike (termed S2P),

180

which has been used to isolate and characterize NAbs (28, 30, 35, 37-40, 43) and is the antigen in

181

almost all current vaccine candidates (13-16, 18-23). However, a recent cryo-EM study revealed

182

an unexpected packing of S1 in the S2P spike, positioned ~12Å outwards, compared to the full-

183

length native spike, as well as a more ordered FP proximal region (FPPR) in S2 (46). New designs

184

have been generated to control the spike conformation (68) or to further stabilize it with more

185

prolines (HexaPro) (47). Recent cryo-EM and cryo-ET studies revealed diverse spike orientations

186

on native virions due to the highly flexible HR2 stalk (48-50). Previously, we identified an HR1

187

bend as the cause of HIV-1 Env metastability (52, 69) and probed the contribution of an equivalent

188

HR1 bend and the HR2 stalk to EBOV GP metastability (54) to facilitate rational vaccine design.

189

It is therefore imperative to understand SARS-CoV-2 spike metastability, and then design an

190

optimized spike as a vaccine immunogen.

191

We first created His-tagged, uncleaved spike ectodomain (S ECTO ) constructs for SARS-

192

CoV-1/2, both containing the 2P mutation (K986P/V987P) and a trimerization motif (1TD0) fused

193

to the C terminus with a 5-aa G 4 S linker. The two constructs were transiently expressed in 50-ml

194

ExpiCHO cells followed by purification on either a Nickel column or a CR3022 column. The

195

S2P ECTO -5GS-1TD0-His 6 protein was characterized by SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column

196

(Fig. 2B, panels 1 and 2). After the Nickel column, both S2P ECTO constructs showed a trimer peak

197

(~12 ml) with shoulders to the left and right indicative of aggregate and dimer/monomer species,

198

respectively. CR3022 purification resulted in a consistent trimer peak and less dimer/monomer

199

species. We then tested a pair of S ECTO constructs containing a double glycine mutation

200

(K986G/V987G, termed 2G). The 2G mutation had little effect on the SARS-CoV-1 spike but

201

produced abnormal SEC profiles and showed no yield for the SARS-CoV-2 spike after purification

202

by Nickel and CR3022 columns, respectively (Fig. 2B, panels 3 and 4). Lastly, we tested a pair of

203

S2G variants without the HR2 stalk (E1150-Q1208), termed S2G∆HR2. Deletion of the HR2 stalk

204

restored the SARS-CoV-2 trimer peak and reduced aggregates for both SARS-CoVs, as shown by

205

the SEC profiles upon CR3022 purification (Fig. 2B, panel 5). Since the triple-hinged HR2 stalk

206

can generate diverse spike orientations on native virions (48-50), and the fusion core is formed by

207

HR1 and HR2, we hypothesized that HR2 may be a key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 spike

208

metastability (Fig. 2C, left). It is possible that the interactions between HR1 and HR2 of two

209

neighboring spikes may facilitate the pre-to-post-fusion transition in addition to ACE2 binding

210

and S1 dissociation. Given the extensive sequence difference in HR1 (9 amino acids in total)

211

compared to SARS-CoV-1 (Fig. 2C, right), we sought to examine the role of HR1 in SARS-CoV-

212

2 spike metastability with two HR1-swapped spike constructs. Interestingly, while HR1 swapping

213

proved ineffective, deletion of the HR2 stalk once again restored the trimer peak (fig. S2, A to C).

214

Therefore, S2G∆HR2 appeared to provide a general spike design for SARS-CoV-1/2 and perhaps

215

other CoVs. Four separate production runs of SARS-CoV-2 S2G∆HR2-5GS-1TD0 in 300-ml

216

ExpiCHO cells resulted in nearly identical SEC profiles with a trimer yield of 0.8-1.0 mg (Fig.

217

2D, left). Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) confirmed the purity of the

218

S2G∆HR2 spike across SEC fractions (Fig. 2D, right). Antigenicity was assessed for freshly

219

produced SARS-CoV-2 S2P ECTO and S2G∆HR2 spike proteins. In ELISA, the S2G∆HR2 spike

220

showed slightly higher affinity for the five representative mAbs than did the S2P ECTO spike (Fig.

221

2E). When tested against three newly identified human NAbs, C105 (43) and CC12.1/CC12.3

222

(36), the two spikes yielded similar EC 50 values (fig. S2D). In BLI, the S2G∆HR2 spike showed

223

higher binding signals than the S2P ECTO spike at the highest concentration, while exhibiting similar

224

binding kinetics (Fig. 2F). The use of NAb P2B-2F6 (31) for spike purification resulted in higher

225

trimer yield with similar purity to the CR3022 column across SEC fractions (fig. S2E). Altogether,

226

we demonstrated that deletion of the HR2 stalk can improve spike properties and S2G∆HR2 may

227

be a more effective spike antigen for vaccine development.

228

Rational design of single-component, multilayered, self-assembling spike nanoparticles

229

Although it was possible to conjugate trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spikes to an SApNP using the SPY

230

system (70), the random, irreversible chemical linking will likely result in irregular display with

231

unoccupied but spatially occluded anchoring sites on the surface. The SPY system is perhaps more

232

suitable for small individual antigens, such as the RBD. Using gene fusion, we previously designed

233

single-component SApNPs displaying stabilized HIV-1 Env trimers (52, 53) and optimized HCV

234

E2 cores (60). Recently, we further engineered the E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers to incorporate locking

235

domains (LDs) and helper T-cell epitopes into the constructs to create highly stable, multilayered

236

SApNPs as multivalent carriers to develop VLP-type vaccine immunogens (54).

237

Native SARS-CoV-2 virions present both pre- and post-fusion spikes on the surface (46,

238

48, 49) (Fig. 3A, top). Here, our vaccine strategy aimed to develop single-component, multilayered

239

SApNPs that each present 8 or 20 stable S2G∆HR2 spikes to the immune system (Fig. 3A,

240

bottom). To explore this possibility, we modeled the S2G∆HR2 spike on ferritin (FR) with a 5-aa

241

G 4 S linker, on E2p with a 5-aa G 4 S linker, and on I3-01v9 with a 10-aa (G 4 S) 2 linker, resulting

242

in SApNPs with diameters of 47.9 nm, 55.9 nm, and 59.3 nm, respectively (Fig. 3B). The three

243

S2G∆HR2 SApNP constructs were transiently expressed in 400-ml ExpiCHO cells, followed by

244

CR3022 purification and SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Fig. 3C). Three production

245

runs generated highly consistent SEC profiles for all three constructs, despite the variation of low-

246

m.w. impurities observed for the FR and E2p SApNPs. Following CR3022/SEC purification, we

247

obtained on average 0.3-0.4 mg, 0.15-0.25 mg, and 0.3-0.35 mg SApNP for S2G∆HR2-5GS-FR,

248

S2G∆HR2-5GS-E2p-LD4-PADRE (or E2p-L4P (54)), and S2G∆HR2-10GS-I3-01v9-LD7-

249

PADRE (or I3-01v9-L7P (54)), respectively. Overall, S2G∆HR2-10GS-I3-01v9-L7P appeared to

250

perform best in terms of particle yield, purity and stability in production. The structural integrity

251

of CR3022/SEC-purified SApNPs was further characterized by nsEM, which showed well-formed

252

particles of 45-65 nm with spikes easily recognizable on their surface (Fig. 4D). Antigenicity of

253

S2G∆HR2-presenting SApNPs was assessed using the same antibody panel as above. In ELISA,

254

three SApNPs showed slightly improved binding to some, but not all, antibodies compared to the

255

individual spike (Fig. 4E). In BLI assays, we observed a clear correlation between peak antibody-

256

binding signal and antigen valency, with E2p/I3-01v9>FR>spike (Fig. 4F). Multivalent display

257

on the two 60-mers significantly improved antibody binding compared to the 24-mer. In previous

258

studies, we observed a similar correlation for HIV-1 gp140 trimer vs. gp140 SApNPs (52) and

259

HCV E2 core vs. E2 core SApNPs (60). In summary, these VLP-size SApNPs with 8 or 20 spikes

260

on the surface provide promising vaccine candidates for in vivo evaluation.

261

SARS-CoV-1/2 vaccine-induced binding antibody response

262

Selected SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD- and spike-based immunogens were evaluated in BALB/c mice to

263

evaluate vaccine-induced antibody responses (Fig. 4A). Groups of five mice were immunized four

264

times at three-week intervals. All vaccine antigens were formulated with AddaVax, an oil-in-water

265

emulsion adjuvant (54), except for I3-01v9, which was formulated with aluminum phosphate (AP)

266

(71). We first performed a longitudinal analysis of binding antibody response, as measured by half

12

267

maximal effective dilution (ED 50 ), in the two SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine groups (Fig. 4B and fig.

268

S4). The RBD SApNP (RBD-5GS-SPY-5GS-FR) elicited significantly higher ED 50 titers than the

269

scaffolded RBD trimer (RBD-5GS-1TD0) at w2 and w5, irrespective of the coating antigen, with

270

a P value of 0.0009 at w8 when RBD was coated. Compared to the stabilized spike (S2G∆HR2-

271

5GS-1TD0), the RBD SApNP elicited significantly higher ED 50 titers against the RBD at w2, w5,

272

and w8 (Fig. 4B, right), demonstrating a strong “epitope-focusing” effect. Mouse sera bound the

273

SARS-CoV-1 spike with lower ED 50 titers than the SARS-CoV-2 spike but with similar patterns

274

(fig. S4A). We then performed a longitudinal analysis of binding antibody response induced by

275

two SARS-CoV-2 spikes, S2P ECTO -5GS-1TD0 and S2G∆HR2-5GS-1TD0, and three SApNPs

276

each displaying 8 or 20 S2G∆HR2 spikes (Fig. 4C and fig. S5). The S2G∆HR2 spike elicited 2~3-

277

fold higher average ED 50 titers than the S2P ECTO spike irrespective of the coating antigen, showing

278

greater immunogenicity (of note, to facilitate a fair comparison, mouse sera from the two spike

279

groups were tested against their respective spikes). Three SApNPs exhibited different temporal

280

patterns depending on the coating antigen. Using spike as the coating antigen, the I3-01v9 group

281

showed a steady increase in average ED 50 titer over time, with the highest average ED 50 titers at

282

two time pints, w2 and w8, and significantly outperforming the S2P ECTO spike at all time points.

283

The I3-01v9 group also showed higher ED 50 tiers than the S2G∆HR2 group throughout, although

284

not with significant P values. The smaller FR SApNP exhibited a similar temporal pattern with

285

lower average ED 50 titers, but still significantly higher than the S2P ECTO group. Among the three

286

SApNPs, E2p registered the lowest average ED 50 titer at w2 and reached the highest at w5, which

287

then decreased slightly at w8. In terms of the RBD-specific response, the five groups showed a

288

clear ranking based on their average ED 50 titers, which remained consistent across time points. At

289

w2, I3-01v9 elicited an average ED 50 titer of 175, whereas all other spike-based vaccine groups

13

290

showed little RBD-specific response. At w5 and w8, S2G∆HR2 elicited higher ED 50 titers (on

291

average by 2-fold) than S2P ECTO , while all three SApNPs outperformed the individual S2G∆HR2

292

spike with a ranking of ED 50 titers correlated with their size (FR<E2p<I3-01v9). Sera reacted with

293

the SARS-CoV-1 spike similarly, albeit at a lower level (fig. S5A). Lastly, we compared binding

294

antibody responses induced by three SARS-CoV-1 immunogens – S2P ECTO spike (S2P ECTO -5GS-

295

1TD0), scaffolded RBD trimer (RBD-5GS-1TD0), and RBD SApNP (RBD-5GS-SPY-5GS-FR)

296

(Fig. 4D and fig. S6). Based on the ED 50 values, the SARS-CoV-1 S2P ECTO spike appeared to be

297

more immunogenic than the SARS-CoV-2 S2G∆HR2 spike, whereas the SARS-CoV-1 RBD

298

SApNP was less advantageous in ED 50 titer than its SARS-COV-2 counterpart. Serum reactivity

299

with the SARS-CoV-2 S2P ECTO spike was observed for all three SARS-CoV-1 vaccine groups

300

(fig. S6A). In summary, RBD SApNPs can elicit RBD-specific antibody titers at a similar or higher

301

level compared to the spike. Furthermore, the S2G∆HR2 spike appears to be more immunogenic

302

than the widely used S2P ECTO spike, in addition to its superior in-vitro properties. The multilayered

303

E2p and I3-01v9 SApNPs are the best performers among the spike-based vaccines, consistent with

304

our previous HIV-1, HCV, and EBOV SApNP vaccine studies (52, 54, 60).

305

SARS-CoV-1/2 vaccine-induced NAb response

306

One major goal in COVID-19 vaccine development is to generate a potent NAb response that can

307

protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pseudoparticle (SARS-CoV-1/2-pp) neutralization assays

308

(72) were used to evaluate serum NAb responses elicited by different vaccine candidates. We first

309

performed a longitudinal analysis of NAb response, as measured by half maximal inhibitory

310

dilution (ID 50 ), in the two SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine groups (Fig. 5A and fig. S7). The RBD

311

SApNP elicited a NAb response against autologous SARS-CoV-2 as early as w2, albeit with low

312

titers, and retained its advantage at the two later time points, suggesting that such RBD SApNP

14

313

vaccines can elicit a rapid NAb response. The scaffolded RBD trimer group showed the lowest

314

average ID 50 titer at w5 but a NAb response comparable to that induced by the stabilized

315

S2G∆HR2 spike at w8. A somewhat different pattern was observed in the SARS-CoV-1-pp assay.

316

At w2, no vaccine group showed detectable heterologous NAb response. At w5 and w8, the

317

S2G∆HR2 spike elicited a more potent SARS-CoV-1 NAb response than both RBD-based

318

vaccines, suggesting that non-RBD epitopes may contribute to cross-neutralization. We then

319

analyzed the NAb response induced by five spike-based vaccines longitudinally (Fig. 5B and fig.

320

S8). In terms of autologous neutralization (Fig. 5B, upper panel), no spike-based vaccine elicited

321

any SARS-CoV-2-pp NAb response at w2 after one injection. But a consistent pattern was

322

observed for serum neutralization at w5 and w8: the S2P ECTO spike showed the lowest average

323

ID 50 titers, 879 and 2481 at w5 and w8, respectively, whereas the S2G∆HR2 spike induced a

324

stronger NAb response with 2.8-6.7-fold higher average ID 50 titers, which did not reach P ≤ 0.05

325

due to within-group variation. Nonetheless, this result confirmed the beneficial effect of the 2P-

326

to-2G substitution and deletion of the HR2 stalk on NAb elicitation; among the three SApNPs,

327

E2p was the best performer at w5, showing an average ID 50 titer of 8435 that is 9.6-fold higher

328

than S2P ECTO and 1.4-fold higher than S2G∆HR2, while I3-01v9 showed the most potent NAb

329

response at w8 with an average ID 50 titer of 17351 that is 7-fold and 2.5-fold higher than S2P ECTO

330

and S2G∆HR2, respectively. A similar temporal pattern was observed in the heterologous SARS-

331

CoV-1-pp assay (Fig. 5B, lower panel). It is worth noting that the I3-01v9 SApNP elicited a SARS-

332

CoV-1 NAb response with an average ID 50 titer of 351 at w2, whereas all other groups showed no

333

detectable serum neutralization. Nonetheless, these results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2

334

S2G∆HR2-based vaccines, particularly SApNPs, may provide protection against both SARS-

335

CoV-1/2. Lastly, we performed a longitudinal analysis of NAb response for three SARS-CoV-1

336

vaccines (Fig. 5C and fig. S9). In the autologous SARS-CoV-1-pp assay, the S2P ECTO spike and

337

RBD SApNP induced significantly more potent NAb responses than the scaffolded RBD trimer at

338

w2 and w5 and all three vaccine groups showed similar ID 50 titers at w8. However, heterologous

339

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was below or at the baseline level for three SARS-CoV-1 vaccines at

340

w2, w5, and w8. The pseudovirus neutralization assay has been validated using a panel of known

341

SARS-CoV-1/2 NAbs (fig. S9C). As a control, the w8 mouse sera were tested against

342

pseudoparticles bearing the murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env, MLV-pps, and did not show non-

343

specific neutralization (fig. S9D). In summary, these results demonstrate an advantage in NAb

344

elicitation by the S2G∆HR2 spike and S2G∆HR2-presenting SApNPs compared to the S2P ECTO

345

spike. Although SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S2G∆HR2 SApNPs are both effective at eliciting NAb

346

responses that target SARS-CoV-2, S2G∆HR2 SApNPs may provide broader protection against

347

SARS-associated CoVs.

348

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced T-cell response

349

While humoral immunity is required to block host-virus interaction and prevent viral infection,

350

cellular immunity is essential for eliminating infected host cells to control viral infection (73-76).

351

Emerging evidence indicates that an early T-cell response (77, 78), as well as T-cell memory (79),

352

is critical for protection against SARS-CoV-2. However, COVID-19 vaccines must induce a CD4+

353

T helper 1 (Th1), but not Th2-type, T-cell response, as the latter has been linked to vaccine-

354

associated enhancement of respiratory disease (VAERD) (10). In addition, T follicular helper cells

355

(Tfh) play an important role in the maturation and production of NAbs. Therefore, understanding

356

T-cell responses is crucial for development of an effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine.

357

Interferon (IFN)-γ-producing Th1 cells are important for generating an optimal antibody

358

response and for induction of cellular immunity (73-75). We first examined various SARS-CoV-

359

2 vaccine formulations on induction of CD4+ Th1 responses specific to the vaccine antigen at w11,

360

two weeks after the fourth immunization, when memory T cells had already developed in spleen

361

(76). Mouse splenocytes from the S2P group and two SApNP groups (E2p and I3-01v9) were

362

analyzed by flow cytometry using naïve samples as a negative control. The I3-01v9 group induced

363

about 1.5- and 2.3-fold higher frequency of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ Th1 cells than the S2P and E2p

364

groups, respectively (Fig. 6A). Notably, following re-stimulation with the respective antigens for

365

as few as 4 hours, both E2p and I3-01v9 groups produced ~2-fold higher frequency of CD107a-

366

producing cytolytic CD4+ T cells than the S2P and naïve groups (Fig. 6B). IFN-γ/IL-4 (interleukin-

367

4) double-positive cells are memory CD4+ T cells that have acquired the ability to produce IL-4

368

while still retaining the ability to produce IFN-γ under Th1 conditions (80). It appeared that I3-

369

01v9 induced 3- and 5-fold more IFN-γ/IL-4 double-positive memory CD4+ T cells than S2P and

370

E2p (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that I3-01v9 can induce both CD4+ Th1 cells and IFN-γ/IL-

371

4 double-positive memory CD4+ T cells. In addition, I3-01v9 induced more IFN-γ/GM-CSF

372

(granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) double-positive CD8+ effector T cells than

373

S2P and E2p (Fig. 6C), suggesting that protective CD8+ T cell responses were also generated in

374

mice immunized with I3-01v9. Of note, CD8+ T cells derived from mice immunized with I3-01v9,

375

rather than those with S2P and E2p, acquired the ability to rapidly produce IFN-γ upon antigen re-

376

stimulation (Fig.6D), suggesting generation of I3-01v9-responsive effector/memory T cells. These

377

findings indicate that the S2G∆HR2 I3-01v9 SApNP can induce robust T-cell responses consisting

378

of CD4+ Th1 cells, IFN-γ/IL-4 double-positive memory CD4+ T cells, and effector CD8+ T cells,

379

thus providing protective cellular immunity in addition to a potent NAb response. Since T cell

380

immunity against the SApNP backbone cannot be ruled out, a more detailed T-cell analysis using

381

spike antigens, SApNP backbones, and peptides for re-stimulation may be warranted.

382

DISCUSSION

383

COVID-19 marks the first worldwide pandemic of this scale since the infamous Spanish influenza

384

over a century ago (81), which caused ~50 million deaths and remains a painful reminder of our

385

vulnerability to a new virus without a protective vaccine. Therefore, the rapid spread of SARS-

386

CoV-2 demands rapid vaccine development (10). Operation Warp Speed (OWS) aims to deliver

387

300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines by January 2021 through a public-private

388

partnership, which has resulted in five vaccine candidates (82) in addition to others being tested in

389

human trials. However, vaccine development during a pandemic against a new virus poses unique

390

challenges, one of which is how to balance public health need and scientific rigor (83-85). The

391

global vaccine campaign also provides a unique opportunity to compare different vaccine design

392

strategies and platforms – especially new ones – against a common target.

393

Here, we approached SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development with a rational design strategy.

394

First, the choice of antigen is key to success of a vaccine irrespective of the delivery platform.

395

Most vaccine antigens including OWS’s vaccine candidates are based on S2P, which produces a

396

spike structure that differs in detail from the full-length wild-type spike, e.g. in FPPR of S2 and in

397

the relative dispositions of the S1 domains (46). These differences may complicate interpretation

398

of vaccine outcome. S2P and other empirical spike designs (47) have attempted to constrain the

399

spike conformation and increase trimer yield. However, as we previously found for HIV-1 Env

400

and EBOV GP (52, 54, 69), it is important to identify and eliminate (if possible) the root cause of

401

spike metastability. During antigen screening, we found that deletion of the HR2 stalk with a 2P-

402

to-2G substitution renders a more stable spike, which is consistent with recent reports on a highly
18

403

flexible HR2 stalk in the native spikes on SARS-CoV-2 virions (48-50). Thus, S2G∆HR2 would

404

seem to present an advance on spike design. Second, single-component SApNPs provide a new,

405

powerful platform for VLP-type vaccine development against diverse viral pathogens (52, 54, 60).

406

S2G∆HR2 was genetically fused, rather than chemically linked, to three SApNPs, including two

407

multilayered SApNPs with enhanced stability and an embedded T-help signal. Such recombinant

408

protein vaccines should be more effective in eliciting a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 NAb response

409

and less likely to induce adverse responses (86). An epitope-focused vaccine strategy was also

410

explored by designing scaffolded RBD trimers and RBD-presenting SApNPs. Third, to achieve

411

high efficacy and ensure safety, vaccine-induced NAb and T-cell responses must be evaluated in

412

animals prior to clinical trials. Indeed, in our mouse study, the S2G∆HR2 spike appeared to be

413

more effective than the S2P spike in NAb elicitation, both alone and displayed on SApNPs. Of

414

note, the S2G∆HR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP elicited not only high NAb titers but also desired

415

T-cell responses. In addition to viral antigen-responsive CD4+ Th1 cells and memory CD4+ T cells,

416

the I3-01v9 SApNP also induced CD107a-producing cytolytic CD4+ T cells, which may directly

417

kill infected host cells, and GM-CSF-producing CD8+ effector T cells, which may promote the

418

generation of macrophages and functional dendritic cells (DCs) to facilitate the clearance of

419

infected cells. Lastly, expression of vaccine antigens in GMP-compatible CHO cells followed by

420

purification using an antibody column, such as CR3022, would allow rapid and industrial-scale

421

vaccine production. In summary, our study provides promising next-generation COVID-19

422

vaccine candidates that are ready for evaluation in human trials.

425

The spike (S) genes of the SARS-CoV-1 isolate Tor2 (GenBank accession #: NC_004718) and the

426

SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession #: MN908947) were used to design all the

427

RBD and spike constructs following codon-optimization for expression in mammalian cells. The

428

RBD sequence is defined as P317-D518 and P330-N532 for SARS-CoV-1 and 2, respectively.

429

The S ECTO sequence is defined as M1-Q1190 and M1-Q1208 for SARS-CoV-1 and 2, respectively.

430

To remove the S1/S2 cleavage site, an R667G mutation and a 682GSAGSV687 modification were

431

introduced in the SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spikes, respectively. The 2P (or 2G) mutation was made to

432

K968/V969 and K986/V987 in the SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spikes, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 C-

433

terminal region (E1150-Q1208) containing the HR2 stalk was removed from S2G ECTO , resulting

434

in an HR2-deleted spike construct termed S2G∆HR2. The viral capsid protein SHP (PDB: 1TD0)

435

was used as a trimerization motif in spike constructs for immunization, whereas the foldon domain

436

from the bacteriophage T4 fibritin (PDB: 1RFO) was used in coating spike antigens for ELISA to

438

cells (Thermo Fisher). Briefly, ExpiCHO cells were thawed and incubated with ExpiCHOTM

439

Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher) in a shaker incubator at 37 °C, 135 rpm and 8% CO 2 . When

440

the cells reached a density of 10×106 ml-1, ExpiCHOTM Expression Medium was added to reduce

441

cell density to 6×106 ml-1 for transfection. The ExpiFectamineTM CHO/plasmid DNA complexes

442

were prepared for 100-ml transfection in ExpiCHO cells following the manufacturer’s instructions.

443

For a given construct, 100 μg of plasmid and 320 μl of ExpiFectamineTM CHO reagent were mixed

444

in 7.7 ml of cold OptiPRO™ medium (Thermo Fisher). After the first feed on day one, ExpiCHO

445

cells were cultured in a shaker incubator at 33 °C, 115 rpm and 8% CO 2 following the Max Titer

446

protocol with an additional feed on day five (Thermo Fisher). Culture supernatants were harvested

447

13 to 14 days after transfection, clarified by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 25 min, and filtered

using a 0.45 µm filter (Thermo Fisher). The CR3022 antibody column was used to extract SARS-

449

CoV-1/2 antigens from the supernatants, which was followed by SEC on a Superdex 200 10/300

SApNPs, spikes, and spike-presenting SApNPs). For comparison, His-tagged S ECTO -5GS-1TD0

452

spike protein was extracted from the supernatants using an immobilized Ni SepharoseTM Excel

column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 500 mM Imidazole prior to SEC. Protein concentration

454

was determined using UV 280 absorbance with theoretical extinction coefficients.

Each well of a CostarTM 96-well assay plate (Corning) was first coated with 50 µl PBS containing

465

0.2 µg of the appropriate antigens. The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, and then washed

466

five times with wash buffer containing PBS and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Each well was then coated

467

with 150 µl of a blocking buffer consisting of PBS, 40 mg ml-1 blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad),

468

and 5% (v/v) FBS. The plates were incubated with the blocking buffer for 1 hour at room

469

temperature, and then washed five times with wash buffer. For antigen binding, antibodies were

470

diluted in the blocking buffer to a maximum concentration of 5 µg ml-1 followed by a 10-fold

dilution series. For each antibody dilution, a total of 50 µl volume was added to the appropriate

472

wells. For mouse sample analysis, serum or plasma was diluted by 20-fold in the blocking buffer

473

and subjected to a 10-fold dilution series. For each sample dilution, a total of 50 µl volume was

474

added to the wells. Each plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then washed 5

475

times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. For antibody binding, a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-

476

human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc), or for mouse sample analysis,

477

a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson

478

ImmunoResearch Laboratories), was then made in the wash buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween

479

20), with 50 µl of this diluted secondary antibody added to each well. The plates were incubated

480

with the secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature, and then washed 5 times with PBS

481

containing 0.05% Tween 20. Finally, the wells were developed with 50 µl of TMB (Life Sciences)

482

for 3-5 min before stopping the reaction with 50 µl of 2 N sulfuric acid. The resulting plate readouts

483

were measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. Of note, the w2 serum binding did not reach the plateau

484

(or saturation) to allow for accurate determination of ED 50 titers. Nonetheless, the ED 50 values at

485

w2 were derived by setting the lower/upper constraints of OD 450 at 0.0/3.2 to facilitate the

486

comparison of different vaccine groups at the first time point.

The kinetics of SARS-CoV-1/2 vaccine antigens, RBD versus RBD-presenting SApNPs as well

490

as spike versus spike-presenting SApNPs, binding to a panel of known antibodies was measured

491

using an Octet RED96 instrument (FortéBio, Pall Life Sciences). All assays were performed with

492

agitation set to 1000 rpm in FortéBio 1× kinetic buffer. The final volume for all the solutions was

493

200 μl per well. Assays were performed at 30 °C in solid black 96-well plates (Geiger Bio-One).

494

For all antigens with the exception of S2G∆HR2-NPs, 5 μg ml-1 of antibody in 1× kinetic buffer

495

was loaded onto the surface of anti-human Fc Capture Biosensors (AHC) for 300 s. For

496

S2G∆HR2-NPs, anti-human Fc Quantitation Biosensors (AHQ) were used. A 60 s biosensor

497

baseline step was applied prior to the analysis of the association of the antibody on the biosensor

498

to the antigen in solution for 200 s. A two-fold concentration gradient of antigen, starting at 950

499

nM for scaffolded RBD trimers, 37 nM for RBD-5GS-SPY-5GS-FR SApNP, 150 nM for spike

500

trimers, and 9/3.5/3.5 nM for S2G∆HR2 presented on FR/E2p/I3-01v9 SApNPs, was used in a

501

titration series of six. The dissociation of the interaction was followed for 300 s. Correction of

502

baseline drift was performed by subtracting the mean value of shifts recorded for a sensor loaded

503

with antibody but not incubated with antigen and for a sensor without antibody but incubated with

504

antigen. Octet data were processed by FortéBio’s data acquisition software v.8.1. Experimental

505

data were fitted with the binding equations describing a 2:1 interaction to achieve optimal fitting.

506

Of note, S2G∆HR2 trimer binding was also measured using AHQ to facilitate the comparison of

507

antibody binding with S2G∆HR2-presenting SApNPs.

Electron microscopy (EM) assessment of nanoparticle constructs

510

The initial EM analysis of RBD and S2G∆HR2-presenting SApNPs was conducted at the Core

511

Microscopy Facility at The Scripps Research Institute. Briefly, SApNP samples were prepared at

512

the concentration of 0.01 mg/ml. Carbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh) were glow-discharged

513

and 8 µL of each sample was adsorbed for 2 min. Excess sample was wicked away and grids were

514

negatively stained with 2% uranyl formate for 2 min. Excess stain was wicked away and the grids

515

were allowed to dry. Samples were analyzed at 80 kV with a Talos L120C transmission electron

516

microscope (Thermo Fisher) and images were acquired with a CETA 16M CMOS camera.

Animal immunization and sample collection

519

Similar immunization protocols have been reported in our previous SApNP vaccine studies.

520

Briefly, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines were followed with

521

animal subjects tested in the immunization study. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased

522

from The Jackson Laboratory and housed in ventilated cages in environmentally controlled rooms

523

at The Scripps Research Institute, in compliance with an approved IACUC protocol and AAALAC

524

(Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) International

525

guidelines. Mice were immunized at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9 with 200 μl of antigen/adjuvant mix

526

containing 50 μg of vaccine antigen and 100 μl of adjuvant, AddaVax or Adju-Phos (InvivoGen),

527

via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Blood was collected two weeks after each immunization. All

528

bleeds were performed through the retro-orbital sinus using heparinized capillary tubes into

529

EDTA-coated tubes. Samples were diluted with an equal volume of PBS and then overlaid on 4.5

530

ml of Ficoll in a 15 ml SepMateTM tube (STEMCELL Technologies) and spun at 1200 RPM for

531

10 min at 20 °C to separate plasma and cells. The plasma was heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min,

532

spun at 1200 RPM for 10 min, and sterile filtered. The cells were washed once in PBS and then

533

resuspended in 1 ml of ACK Red Blood Cell lysis buffer (Lonza). After washing with PBS,

534

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were resuspended in 2 ml of Bambanker Freezing

535

Media (Lymphotec). Spleens were also harvested and ground against a 70-μm cell strainer (BD

536

Falcon) to release the splenocytes into a cell suspension. Splenocytes were centrifuged, washed in

537

PBS, treated with 5 ml of ACK lysing buffer (Lonza), and frozen with 3ml of Bambanker freezing

538

media. Sera were heat inactivated for ELISA binding and pseudovirus neutralization assays.

540

Pseudoparticle (SARS-CoV-1/2-pp) neutralization assays were utilized to assess the neutralizing

541

activity of previously reported antibodies and vaccine-induced murine antibody response. SARS-

542

CoV-1/2-pps were generated by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with the HIV-1 pNL4-3.lucR-

543

E- plasmid (obtained from the NIH AIDS reagent program: https://www.aidsreagent.org/) and the

544

expression plasmid encoding the S gene of SARS-CoV-1 isolate Tor2 (GenBank accession #:

545

NC_004718) and the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession #: MN908947) at a

546

4:1 ratio by lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 48 to 72 hours, SARS-CoV-1/2-

547

pps were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min, aliquoted, and

548

stored at -80 °C before use. The mAbs at a starting concentration of 0.1-10 µg/ml, or mouse serum

549

at a starting dilution of 100-fold, were mixed with the supernatant containing SARS-CoV-1/2-pps

550

and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in white solid-bottom 96-well plate (Corning). A 3-fold dilution

551

series was used in the assay. The HEK293T-hACE2 cell line (catalogue#: NR-52511) and the

552

vector pcDNA3.1(-) containing the SARS-CoV-2 S gene (catalogue#: NR52420) were obtained

553

from BEI RESOURCES (https://www.beiresources.org/) and used in pseudovirus neutralization

554

assays (72). Briefly, HEK293T-hACE2 cells at 1×104 were added to each well and the plate was

555

incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. After incubation, overlying media was removed, and cells were

556

lysed. The firefly luciferase signal from infected cells was determined using the Bright-Glo

557

Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were

558

retrieved from a BioTek microplate reader with Gen 5 software, the average background

559

luminescence from a series of uninfected wells was subtracted from each well, and neutralization

560

curves were generated using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3, in which values from wells were compared

561

against a well containing SARS-CoV-1/2-pp only. Due to the difference in mouse samples (serum:

responses were not compared but included in figs. S7-S9 for the sake of completeness. The same

564

HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with the murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env gene, termed MLV-pps,

565

were produced in HEK293T cells and included in the neutralization assays as a negative control.

Dendritic cell (DC) production

567

Mouse bone marrow (BM) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum

568

and recombinant mouse Flt3L (50 ng/mL) and SCF (10 ng/ml) for 9 days as described (87). To

569

induce DC activation, immature DCs were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/mL),

570

R848 (Resiquimod, 100 ng/mL) or CpG (ODN 1585, 1µM) overnight, which activated Toll-like

571

receptor (TLR)4 , TLR7/8 or TLR9 signaling, respectively. Cells were harvested for experiments.

572

pDCs were sorted to isolate CD11c+B220+ cells using FACS cell sorter and magnetic beads

573

(Miltenyi-Biotech, CA).

574

Antibodies and flow cytometry analysis

575

All antibodies used for immunofluorescence staining were purchased from eBioscience (San

576

Diego, CA), BioLegend (San Diego, CA) or BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Magnetic microbead-

577

conjugated Abs and streptavidin were purchased from Miltenyi-Biotech (Auburn, CA).

578

Recombinant human IL-2 protein was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

579

Recombinant mouse Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) and mouse SCF were purchased from Shenandoah Biotech

580

(Warwick, PA). Cells were stained with appropriate concentrations of mAbs. Dead cells were

581

excluded using Fixable Viability Dye from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Flow cytometry (FC)

582

analyses were performed using LSRII (BD Bioscience, CA) and Canto cytometers (Becton

583

Dickinson, NJ). Cells were sorted on BD FACSAria II (BD Bioscience, CA).

Statistics

590

In antibody analysis, comparison of different vaccine groups was performed in GraphPad Prism

591

8.4.3 using the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. In T cell analysis, comparison of means was

592

done using the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test, ANOVA and then post-hoc t test. P values of

fig. S3. Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S2GHR2 SApNPs. (A) BN-PAGE of CR3022-purified S2GHR2-presenting
SApNPs. Due to the large size and molecular mass, SApNPs would be in the well on the top of the gel, whereas the
unassembled species would be seen on the gel. (B) BLI profiles of SARS-CoV-2 S2GHR2-presenting SApNPs binding to
five antibodies. The SARS-CoV-2 S2GHR2-5GS-1TD0 trimer was included for comparison. Sensorgrams were obtained
from an Octet RED96 instrument using a series of six concentrations (150-4.6nM for the S2GHR2 trimer, 9-0.27nM for
the FR SApNP, and 3.5-0.1nM for the E2p and I3-01v9 SApNPs, respectively, all by twofold dilution) and quantitation
biosensors.

fig. S4. SARS-CoV-2 RBD/RBD-NP vaccine-induced binding antibody response. (A) Plot of ED50 titers (fold of
dilution) calculated from ELISA binding of mouse sera from two SARS-CoV-2 RBD-based vaccine groups (RBD-5GS1TD0 and RBD-5GS-SPY-5GS-FR) to the coating antigen, SARS-CoV-1 S2P-5GS-foldon, with the SARS-CoV-2 spike
vaccine group (S2GHR2-5GS-1TD0) included for comparison. P-values were determined by an unpaired t test in
GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 with (*) indicating the level of statistical significance (*: 0.01<P0.05; **: 0.001<P0.01; ***:
0.0001<P0.001; ****: P0.0001). (B) ELISA binding curves of mouse sera from two SARS-CoV-2 RBD-based vaccine
groups to three coating antigens, SARS-CoV-1 S2P-5GS-foldon, SARS-CoV-2 S2GHR2-5GS-foldon, and SARS-CoV-2
RBD. (C) Summary of ED50 titers measured for two SARS-CoV-2 RBD-based vaccine groups against three coating
antigens. Color coding indicates the level of ED50 titer (white: no binding; green to red: low to high). The ED50 values were
calculated in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3. Of note, the ED50 values at w2 were derived by setting the lower/upper constraints of
OD450 at 0.0/3.2 to achieve greater accuracy.

fig. S5. SARS-CoV-2 spike/spike-NP vaccine-induced binding antibody response. (A) Plot of ED50 titers (fold of
dilution) calculated from ELISA binding of mouse sera from five SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccine groups (S2P-5GS1TD0, S2GHR2-5GS-1TD0, S2GHR2-5GS-FR, S2GHR2-5GS-E2p-L4P, and S2GHR2-10GS-I3-01v9-L7P) to the
coating antigen, SARS-CoV-1 S2P-5GS-foldon. P-values were determined by an unpaired t test in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3
with (*) indicating the level of statistical significance (*: 0.01<P0.05; **: 0.001<P0.01; ***: 0.0001<P0.001; ****:
P0.0001). (B) ELISA binding curves of mouse sera from five SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccine groups to three coating
antigens, SARS-CoV-1 S2P-5GS-foldon, SARS-CoV-2 S2GHR2-5GS-foldon, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. (C) Summary of
ED50 titers measured for five SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccine groups against three coating antigens. Color coding
indicates the level of ED50 titer (white: no binding; green to red: low to high). The ED50 values were calculated in
GraphPad Prism 8.4.3. Of note, the ED50 values at w2 were derived by setting the lower/upper constraints of OD450 at
0.0/3.2 to achieve greater accuracy.

fig. S6. SARS-CoV-1 spike/RBD/RBD-NP vaccine-induced binding antibody response. (A) Plot of ED50 titers (fold of
dilution) calculated from ELISA binding of mouse sera from three SARS-CoV-1 vaccine groups (S2P-5GS-1TD0, RBD5GS-1TD0, and RBD-5GS-SPY-5GS-FR) to the coating antigen, SARS-CoV-2 S2P-5GS-foldon. P-values were
determined by an unpaired t test in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 with (*) indicating the level of statistical significance (*:
0.01<P0.05; **: 0.001<P0.01; ***: 0.0001<P0.001; ****: P0.0001). (B) ELISA binding curves of mouse sera from three
SARS-CoV-1 vaccine groups to three coating antigens, SARS-CoV-1 S2P-5GS-foldon, SARS-CoV-2 S2P-5GS-foldon,
and SARS-CoV-1 RBD. (C) Summary of ED50 titers measured for three SARS-CoV-1 vaccine groups against three coating
antigens. Color coding indicates the level of ED50 titer (white: no binding; green to red: low to high). The ED50 values were
calculated in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3. Of note, the ED50 values at w2 were derived by setting the lower/upper constraints of
OD450 at 0.0/3.2 to achieve greater accuracy.

fig. S9. SARS-CoV-1 spike/RBD/RBD-NP vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody response. (A) Pseudovirus
neutralization curves of mouse sera from three SARS-CoV-1 vaccine groups against two pseudoviruses, SARS-CoV-1-pp
and SARS-CoV-2-pp. (B) Summary of ID50 titers measured for three SARS-CoV-1 vaccine groups against two
pseudoviruses. Color coding indicates the level of ID50 titer (white: no binding; green to red: low to high). The ID50 values
were calculated in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3, with the lower/upper constraints of %neutralization set at 0.0/100.0. (C)
Pseudovirus neutralization curves of 4 known SARS-CoV-1 NAbs against SARS-CoV-1-pps (left) and 4 known SARSCoV-2 NAbs against SARS-CoV-2-pps (right). (D) Pseudovirus neutralization curves of mouse sera from all vaccine
groups at w8 against MLV-pps as negative control. No MLV-pp neutralization was observed.
