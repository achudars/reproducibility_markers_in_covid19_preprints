Abstract
Scientists, medical researchers, and health care workers have mobilized worldwide in response to the
outbreak of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;
SCoV2). Preliminary data have captured a wide range of host responses, symptoms, and lingering
problems post-recovery within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest
differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health
conditions, co-morbidities, genetics, and other factors. As COVID-19-related data continue to accumulate
from disparate groups, the heterogeneous nature of these datasets poses challenges for efficient
extrapolation of meaningful observations, hindering translation of information into clinical applications.
Attempts to utilize, analyze, or combine biomarker datasets from multiple sources have shown to be
inefficient and complicated, without a unifying resource. As such, there is an urgent need within the
research community for the rapid development of an integrated and harmonized COVID-19 Biomarker
Knowledgebase. By leveraging data collection and integration methods, backed by a robust data model
developed to capture cancer biomarker data we have rapidly crowdsourced the collection and
harmonization of COVID-19 biomarkers. Our resource currently has 138 unique biomarkers. We found
multiple instances of the same biomarker substance being suggested as multiple biomarker types during
our extensive cross-validation and manual curation. As a result, our Knowledgebase currently has 265
biomarker type combinations. Every biomarker entry is made comprehensive by bringing in together
ancillary data from multiple sources such as biomarker accessions (canonical UniProtKB accession,
PubChem Compound ID, Cell Ontology ID, Protein Ontology ID, NCI Thesaurus Code, and Disease
Ontology ID), BEST biomarker category, and specimen type (Uberon Anatomy Ontology) unified with
ontology standards. Our preliminary observations show distinct trends in the collated biomarkers. Most
biomarkers are related to the immune system (SAA,TNF-, and IP-10) or coagulopathies (D-dimer,
antithrombin, and VWF) and a few have already been established as cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL4 and IL-2). These trends align with proposed hypotheses of clinical manifestations compounding the
complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology. We explore these trends as we put forth a COVID-19 biomarker
resource that will help researchers and diagnosticians alike. All biomarker data are freely available from
https://data.oncomx.org/covid19.

Introduction
The devastating outbreak of the novel, highly contagious Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), originating in
Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread worldwide since first reported to the world in early January 2020. The
genomic sequence of the causative betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2; SCoV2), was first released on January 7, 2020 with similarity to SCoV (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) 1-5.
COVID-19 has created major challenges for worldwide health systems, caused global disruption, and farreaching consequences to the global economy6, 7. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared a global pandemic; as of August 31st 2020, there are more than 25 million confirmed cases
globally and more than 840,000 reported fatalities5, 8-10. While researchers race to find a drug(s) or
vaccine(s) for the virus, a critical need to identify biomarkers for COVID-19 disease has become evident.
A simple search in Google Scholar for COVID-19 biomarkers retrieves more than 10,000 records since
2020. Not all of these publications describe a biomarker, but many refer to them. Preliminary evaluation
reveals that almost none of the biomarker data described in these references are standardized and
harmonized to existing ontologies and terms.
SCoV2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans 11. Coronaviruses SCoV, MERS-CoV, and
SCoV2 can cause severe disease; while Coronaviruses HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E are associated
with mild disease states12, 13. High recombination rates and genetic diversity of coronaviruses in the wild
suggest that further outbreaks and unpredictable virulence will likely arise in future recombinants 14, which
could lead to different outcomes in patients. Serious clinical manifestations of COVID-19 (in some
individuals) include: severe acute respiratory syndrome, inflammatory pneumonitis, hypoxia, blood clots,
embolisms, gastrointestinal illness, cardiac and vascular damage, and organ damage (lung, heart, kidney,
liver, brain)3. Severity and mortality of COVID-19 appear to be more prevalent in men (3.1/million) than
women (2.7/million) and, overall more so in the elderly with underlying health conditions, such as
hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immunosenescence, immunocompromised systems, and diabetes3,
5, 14-16. Clinical observations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients report lymphopenia and monocytopenia, ,
and hypoalbuminemia, as well as elevated proinflammatory cytokines (“cytokine storm”). In severe cases,
pneumonia with a “ground glass” opacity in chest CT scans, lung injury, and pneumonitis are typically
observed8, 17, 18. Lymphopenia and the cytokine storm may initiate severe COVID-19 pathogenesis, viral
sepsis, inflammatory-induced lung injury and pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and death3, 19, 20. Probability of the severe damage from the direct
or indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 replication can be exacerbated by underlaying injury caused by chronic
conditions like hypertension, diabetes and/or cancer16, 21, 22. Identification of physiological or pathological
differences associated with poor outcomes of the COVID-19 in patients with underlying conditions and
discovery of prospective biomarkers predictive of these outcomes is of paramount importance.
The global impact of COVID-19 has mobilized the biomedical community – from bench to bed – to combat
the pathogen. Scientific and clinical observations have accrued in dispersed resources in the effort to
publicize the data as rapidly as possible for investigation. Representative features of COVID-19 have
therefore begun to surface, but deeper reproducible measures (biomarkers) of COVID-19 pathobiology
and pharmacologic intervention have yet to emerge. Experience suggests that significant data for nucleic
acid, protein, glycan, and other biomarker material await discovery by cross-disciplinary
investigations of COVID-19 publications and repositories. While preliminary discoveries demonstrate
clinical applicability of potential biomarkers, additional research must establish specificity and sensitivity
during risk assessment, diagnostic measurements, or therapeutic applications to a particular disease
state23, 24. For both research and clinical applications, improved methods for aggregation of biomarker
knowledge must be implemented, a process that comparatively lags behind due to the heterogeneous
nature of biomarker data. As a result, improving the methods by which we explore, identify, and
discover biomarkers is a vital and necessary focus of biomedical research. We provide for immediate
use a publicly available compilation of COVID-19 biomarkers that enables academic and regulatory
scientists along with industry researchers to explore up to date COVID-19 biomarkers in different stages
of development and application.

Biomarker Research and Data Integration Challenges
The FDA-NIH Biomarker Working Group (FNBWG) defines a biomarker as a “characteristic that is
measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an
exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions” 25. Molecular biomarkers (also known as
molecular markers or signature molecules) may be genes, proteins, glycans, or metabolites, for example,
that may be used in different stages of disease assessment and treatment evaluation, but differ from clinical
assessments and have distinct
functions in biomedical research,
clinical practice, and medical
product development. The FNBWG

data elements in the COVID-19
biomarker resource.

Standards and Ontologies
The biomarker list is created for easy integration in other biomarker knowledgebases that use standards
and ontologies such as our recently developed infrastructure (OncoMX) 35, a biomarker knowledgebase
designed to integrate cancer-centric data and combine it with newly generated data, establishing a strong
application customized for biomarker research. This platform implements strict adherence to accepted
standards used in major resources, such as National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 36,
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) 37, Alliance of Genome Resources38, and others. These resources,
and OncoMX, rely heavily on existing and new biomedical standards and ontologies for semantic
unification of datasets, which can enable efficient knowledge modeling, information retrieval, and data
sharing across otherwise diverse data 39-43. The emphasis on leveraging existing standards and ontologies
promotes extensibility and sustainability, allowing the platform to focus on data quality, integration,
standardization, and knowledgebase maintenance and extension. The Uberon Anatomy Ontology44 and
other ontologies are employed in OncoMX, for example, to support efficient cross comparison of biomarker
data of human and model organism orthologs.

Materials and Methods
The goal of the project is to collect and harmonize COVID-19 biomarkers that will assist researchers
working on the development of diagnostics or drugs by organizing biomarker data from publications and
bioinformatic databases into a standardized table. Various steps - from data collection, organization,
standardization, and integration of the data elements - are involved to bring together the COVID-19
biomarkers (as depicted in Fig. 2).

available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

Crowdsourcing
With the exponential rise in the number of publications and publication drafts on COVID-19 biomarkers it
was clear that a crowdsourcing effort using a robust data model was needed to rapidly collect and crossvalidate the data. The project was advertised to collaborating faculty members which led to the recruitment
of approximately 30 volunteers. Key staff members of the OncoMX team led the volunteers and served as
reviewers for all annotations. The groups were organized into reviewers and curators. Curators read
publications and filled in tables. Reviewers then read the publications and ensured that the cell entries
were correct prior to moving them to the reviewed biomarker table.
Data Collection and Compilation
Curators searched for “COVID-19
biomarkers” in Google Scholar that
were publicly available after January
2020. Information about a biomarker
and its role in COVID-19 was
retrieved from selected articles and
filled into a structured format. The

the biomarker such as biomarker
accession and BEST biomarker type were further mapped to each biomarker entry. Biomarker accession
could include the canonical UniProtKB accession45, PubChem Compound ID46, Cell Ontology ID47, Protein
Ontology ID48, and Disease Ontology ID49. The curator could write notes in a free text column that
documented any comments regarding the data curated. Each curator would upload their file into a shared
drive once every week. Reviewers would then compile the data from all the curators into a single cohesive
dataset file marked Unreviewed.

Review Processing and Quality Check
The unreviewed data file was then scrutinized by at least two reviewers with experience in curation of
biomarkers and ontology mapping. All annotations were checked for content. These checks included:
confirmation of biomarker name mentioned in the article, appropriate mapping of the biomarker accession,
suitable representation of the BEST biomarker type based on the article and definitions provided by the
FNBWG, and documentation of the specimen type with mapping to Uberon anatomical IDs. Table 1
provides details on the rubric of approved data types in each of the columns. Curator notes were carefully
assessed during reviews of the biomarker entries to answer any queries that arose while curating the data.
The data points were checked for completeness and adherence to the rubric of data collection (Table 1).
Resulting entries were compiled and quality checked to ensure integrity and format stability.

Results and Discussion
The first phase of the project lasted approximately six weeks (June 22 – July 31, 2020). Based on
usefulness of the collected biomarkers and availability of volunteers the cycle will be repeated monthly.
The data model for the COVID-19 biomarkers is based on the OncoMX cancer biomarker model.
Crowdsourcing allowed us to annotate and cross-validate 265 biomarker type combinations. In this effort,
we have found a number of issues. For example, we note that the same biomarker is often known by
multiple different names in the domain of biomarkers, which might differ from the name used in
standardized databases - thus potentially making the connection between biomarker and underlying
biology less amenable to discovery. One such case is Carbohydrate Antigen 15-3, also commonly known
as Krebs von den Lungen-6, which is called Mucin-1 in UniProtKB. Our knowledgebase has solved these
discrepancies by including all such entries identified by respective studies, and then unifying them under
common identifier links to standardized databases. Another issue involves discerning exactly what is being
measured. For example, what substance is being assayed when using alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as
a biomarker? Is it alanine aminotransferase 1, alanine aminotransferase 2, or both? It is both. Finally, there
is a chance that a biomarker obtained from one source could be diagnostic for a particular disease, but
that same biomarker obtained from a different source might not be. For example, soluble urokinase
plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) isolated from ovarian cysts appears to distinguish between
malignant vs benign cysts50, but that same substance is only prognostic (for a number of diseases) when
obtained from blood51. Such common issues, often faced while compiling of a knowledgebase based on
an expansive literature, have been addressed in our resource.
A total of 138 biomarkers were
corroborated, and classified into the
diagnostic,
monitoring,
prognostic,
predictive, risk, response and safety
categories for COVID-19.The top few
biomarkers in terms of the number of
manuscripts in which they were

(22), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)

indicate the emergence of a pattern that points to specific pathways and cell types targeted by SARS-CoV2. Our manually curated resource shows that most biomarkers belong to these biological processes within
specific tissue systems and supports the idea that further investigations using multidrug combination
therapies targeting these biological processes, is needed.
CRP was identified as a top biomarker, appearing in forty-one independent studies. A high level of CRP
indicates disease progression and has been positively correlated with lung lesions 52. It has been used as
a monitoring biomarker in early stages of the disease to determine progression from mild to severe 52, 53.
IL-6 expression is high in lung and arteries for healthy individuals54. IL-6 is a known cancer biomarker35. It
was also used as a disease progression monitoring biomarker in multiple studies and its elevated levels
were shown to be strongly associated with respiratory failure in symptomatic COVID-19 patients.
Diagnosticians have used this biomarker to determine the need for mechanical ventilation 55. Other
interleukins, such as IL-4 and IL-2, were also proposed in some studies. Of note, interleukins can be both
pro and anti-inflammatory, and as such, use of these biomarkers should be coupled with other indicators
of disease progression. Interestingly, Herold et al. found no correlation between IL-6 levels and age,
comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate, or qSofa score of patients 55; on the other hand, IL-4
was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication partially through down regulation of ACE2 expression in vitro56.
While this study investigated SARS-CoV and not SARS-CoV-2, research advises screening of all patients
for hyper inflammation57 and the use of inflammation biomarkers to assess severity of disease. NLR was
also suggested as a prognostic biomarker in over 10 independent studies. It has been commonly used as
a marker for subclinical or systemic inflammation and a high NLR has been linked to poor clinical outcome
in many solid tumors. For COVID-19 patients of advanced age, this ratio, if elevated, should serve as a
prognostic biomarker to determine access to valuable limited clinical resources like intensive care units
(ICUs) or ventilators58. Another biomarker reported by multiple research groups, in agreement with
aggravated inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients, is SAA. SAA was used as both a monitoring and
a prognostic biomarker by multiple independent research groups to evaluate severity and prognosis of
COVID-19. Dynamic changes in SAA have been proposed as prognostic markers in COVID-19
progression59. This is because it belongs to the family of apolipoproteins that are constitutively expressed
in plasma. SAA is a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation 60. MCSF, another biomarker that
plays an important role in macrophage homeostasis, and has been proposed as a therapeutic target that
warrants further analysis61, 62. A common theme from our resource points to the immune system of the
patients and the inflammatory response to the disease. Other concurrent biomarkers in our resource are
tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interferon- inducible protein-10 (IP-10), CD4+ counts and CD8+ counts,
all of which are suggestive of the immune system of the patient as a central target to determine disease
progression, therapy, and possibly, prevention.
Another biomarker that has been extensively studied is D-dimer which is a degradation product of
crosslinked fibrin resulting from plasmin cleavage63. Several independent studies from Wuhan, China, have
shown that elevated levels of D-dimer in COVID-19 patients are associated with higher mortality. Indeed,
it has been used as a prognostic biomarker to predict mortality rates in patients with COVID-1964. However,
since it is a product of cross-linked fibrin there are many other common conditions in which it can be
elevated and, consequently, use of this biomarker warrants caution. The most common substances
resulting in analytical interference with D-dimer levels are paraproteins, bilirubin, lipids, and hemolysis 63.
As such, establishing a fold-change cutoff specific for the patient for this prognostic biomarker before
drawing conclusions is essential. Interestingly, our resource suggests the use of other biomarkers from
similar biological processes, though these have been studied less extensively. These include VWF and
antithrombin, among others. VWF, made within endothelial cells, helps platelets stick together, assists clot
formation, and transports coagulation factor VIII to areas of clot formation 65. High levels of VWF have been
linked to potential efficacy of COVID-19 treatment and have also been used as a prognostic biomarker for
endothelial damage66. Escher et al. observed an approximate 500% increase in VWF and coagulation
factor VIII expression in COVID-19 patients during later stages of stay in an intensive care unit (ICU). This
increase was observed in patients that registered an increase in D-dimer expression in the earlier stages
of their stay in the ICU. These patients underwent extensive endothelial stimulation and damage, which
can be explained by the presence of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, on the surface of endothelial

cells67. Similarly, antithrombin, a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in controlling coagulation 68, was also
proposed as a biomarker by at least 2 independent studies. Decreased levels of antithrombin, along with
increased levels of D-dimer and VWF, in conjunction with other proposed biomarkers like fibrinogen
expression and platelet counts, point to recurrent coagulopathies in COVID-19 patients.
A biomarker that seems to have given interesting results, in the context of metabolic syndrome, diabetes,
and hyperlipidemia, is Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL)69-71. Subjects with pre-existing hyperlipidemia appear
to have decreased in LDL at the onset of the disease, with lower levels predicting worse outcome69. It is
possible that virus particles require LDL to proliferate and replicate. The drop in LDL at the onset indicates
huge virus reproduction capability, rather than a good indicator in the context of metabolic syndrome.
However, even in these subjects, lowering of endogenous LDL production with medications such as statin
may help to reduce or at least impair virus reproduction capability69.
Finally, our resource has also registered biomarkers like EWS, Cit-H3, and ACE2, that have extensive
ramifications in various cancers. EWS, primarily implicated in Ewing’s Sarcoma, plays a role in
transcriptional repression, and promotes tumorigenesis by forming fusion proteins 72, 73. Cit-H3 plays an
important role in neutrophil release of nuclear chromatin, also called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs),
which have been associated with tumor progression in colon cancer 74, 75. Notably, NETs have also been
proposed as a biomarker for SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients and is known to play a role in
thrombosis, thereby strengthening our observation that specific biological processes are activated during
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE2 that serves as a receptor for the
spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, shows stabilized protein levels in colorectal and renal cancers, and
has also been proposed to be used as a biomarker 76. This suggests that the majority of cancer patients,
and not just immunocompromised patients, also have an elevated risk of contracting the disease, and
might have a poorer prognosis when compared to non-cancer individuals with COVID-19.
Taken together, these data suggest that hyper-activation of the immune system, coagulopathies and the
targeting of specific types of cells that are indispensable for vasculature like the endothelial cells are the
primary modus operandi of SARS-CoV-2, and combination therapies targeting these biological processes
may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients. Additionally, risk biomarkers like cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and cancer, need to be taken into consideration while devising
therapeutic regimens. Our manually curated and regularly updated resource will help researchers and
diagnosticians get a broad perspective of the most widely used - as well as the rare - biomarkers for
COVID-19. The resource also encompasses risk biomarkers that will help the research and medical
community stay abreast of the extensive research being conducted in the face of the ongoing pandemic.

Conclusion
There is an urgent need within the research community to have an integrated and harmonized COVID-19
Biomarker resource. Variations in symptoms have not only exacerbated the diagnosis, prognosis and
monitoring of COVID-19, but have also made it difficult to identify and develop vaccines and drugs. This
resource has drawn from our extensive experience in integrating large biomarker (OncoMX https://www.oncomx.org/) and glycoprotein (Glygen - https://www.glygen.org/) datasets to prepare a
repository for COVID-19 biomarkers. As such, it currently includes over 500 biomarker entries, that
encompassing both vastly studied and largely cross-referenced biomarkers, as well as rare and risk
biomarkers. An overview of the current repository shows that the COVID-19 research community around
the world is focused on the effects of the infection on the patient’s immune system, and various
coagulopathies. Risk biomarkers included in our resource also shed light on at-risk patient populations and
allows investigation of underlying comorbidities that might affect prognosis and treatment outcome. To
further develop and improve the COVID-19 Biomarker resource, we envision (1) extending the search for
new biomarkers in future curation rounds with adjusted query terms and parameters; (2) extending the
data model and further data analyses to find possible correlations of biomarkers with patient features; and
(3) examining possible multivariate biomarker profiles. To these ends, we recognize the need for
standardization and formalization of the collected information in an ontology that connects biomarkers with

their indications. Construction of such an ontology is underway. Nonetheless, in these early stages of
understanding the pathology of this infectious disease, we provide this biomarker resource to support
continued research around the world to better understand and manage COVID-19. Collective analyses of
these biomarkers using a resource such as ours will help researchers gain a wider perspective of the
disease state, with potential positive clinical impact. We encourage feedback and welcome contributions

arrows, fulfils a distinct role “as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes,
or responses to an exposure or intervention.” Tests for specific instances of potential COVID-19
biomarkers (in brackets) provide measurable evidence data of existing or potential health status.
