Summary

53

SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus with a positive-sense RNA genome, has caused the

54

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although a large number of transcriptional profiling studies

55

have been conducted in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, little is known regarding the

56

translational landscape of host and viral proteins. Here, using ribosome profiling in SARS-

57

CoV-2-infected cells, we identify structural elements that regulate viral gene expression,

58

alternative translation initiation events, as well as host responses regulated by mRNA

59

translation. We found that the ribosome density was low within the SARS-CoV-2

60

frameshifting element but high immediately downstream, which suggests the utilization of

61

a highly efficient ribosomal frameshifting strategy. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, although

62

many chemokine, cytokine and interferon stimulated genes were upregulated at the

63

mRNA level, they were not translated efficiently, suggesting a translational block that

64

disarms host innate host responses. Together, these data reveal the key role of mRNA

65

translation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and highlight unique mechanisms for therapeutic

66

development.

INTRODUCTION

79

The Coronavirus (CoV) group encompasses of a number of single-stranded, positive-

80

sense RNA viruses with unusually large genomes (27-32 kb), which infect a wide range

81

of animal species, including humans (Masters, 2006, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005).

82

Previously, outbreaks of two members of this group, severe acute respiratory syndrome

83

(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), have caused lethal

84

respiratory illnesses in 2002 and 2012, respectively (de Wit et al., 2016). Presently, SARS-

85

CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)

86

pandemic, has infected millions of people worldwide and has devastated the global

87

economy. Currently, there are limited options for antiviral or immunomodulatory treatment

88

against SARS-CoV-2, with only few therapies being currently recommended for more

89

severe COVID-19 cases. A basic understanding of the replicative mechanisms of SARS-

90

CoV-2 and associated host responses potentially can foster the development of virus-

91

specific therapies.

92
93

The first two-thirds of the 5’ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is composed of two

94

overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode for two

95

polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Nakagawa et al., 2016). Pp1a is produced when translation

96

of the genomic RNA terminates at the stop codon of ORF1a. Pp1ab is generated via a

97

programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (PRF) that occurs at the overlap between ORF1a

98

and ORF1b, permitting the elongating ribosomes to bypass the termination signal in

99

ORF1a (Plant and Dinman, 2008). Following synthesis, pp1a and pp1ab are cleaved by

100

viral proteases to generate 15-16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp) (Nakagawa et al.,

101

2016). Many proteins encoded in ORF1b, are part the replication complex, thus making

102

the -1 PRF to generate pp1ab a critical translational event for SARS-CoV-2 replication.

103

Frameshifting in coronaviruses is regulated by a highly conserved heptanucleotide

104

slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and an RNA pseudoknot structure a few nucleotides

105

downstream (Plant and Dinman, 2008). The current models of PRF suggest that

106

ribosomes stall upon encountering the pseudoknot (Plant et al., 2003, Korniy et al., 2019).

107

This event presumably enhances the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting by forcing the

108

ribosomes to pause on the slippery sequence, which in turn promote the -1 slippage. Once

109

the pseudoknot unwinds and resolves, the ribosome goes on to translate the alternate

110

ORF.

111
112

Another well-known frameshifting mechanisms in human viruses is employed by

113

retroviruses through a stem-loop structure that regulates the expression of Gag/Gag-Pol

114

transcripts (Jacks et al., 1988, Wilson et al., 1988). Frameshifting here is thought essential

115

for maintenance of the ratio of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins as well as viral infectivity

116

(Shehu-Xhilaga et al., 2001, Garcia-Miranda et al., 2016). While frameshifting is thought

117

to be highly inefficient in HIV-1, with only 5-10% of ribosomes continuing into the Pol ORF

118

(Baril et al., 2003, Dulude et al., 2006, Jacks et al., 1988), CoV frameshifting is thought to

119

occur at a much higher efficiency (Irigoyen et al., 2016). However, to date, the behavior of

120

ribosomes within the frameshifting element for neither SARS-CoV-2 nor HIV-1 in infected

121

cells has been empirically assessed.

122
123

In addition to hijacking the host translational machinery, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate host

124

mRNA translation so as to suppress the immune system to ensure efficient propagation.

125

Indeed, several viral proteins reportedly impair host gene expression post-transcriptionally

126

(Lokugamage et al., 2012, Xiao et al., 2008, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006, Huang et al.,

127

2011, Zhou et al., 2008, Kamitani et al., 2009, Narayanan et al., 2008, Nakagawa et al.,

128

2016). SARS-CoV nonstructural protein nsp1 induces endonucleolytic cleavage in the 5’-

129

UTR of cellular mRNAs, accelerating their turnover, but not in viral mRNAs (Kopecky-

130

Bromberg et al., 2006). Furthermore, nsp1 tightly binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and

131

blocks translation initiation (Kamitani et al., 2009). This dual capacity to cleave host

132

mRNAs and directly inhibit their translation may allow SARS-CoV-2 to overcome the type

133

I IFN response in infected cells, as has been demonstrated for SARS-CoV (Narayanan et

134

al., 2008). On the other hand, the bulk of published research on SARS-CoV- and SARS-

135

CoV-2-host interactions has relied on transcriptional profiling to study the immune

136

response to infection (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020, Butler et al., 2020, Menachery et al., 2014,

137

Mitchell et al., 2013, Wilk et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020). Such approaches may not fully

138

capture the host immune response to infection, in the face of viral mechanisms that block

139

host mRNA translation.

140
141

Here, we have conducted in-depth ribosome profiling studies to gain insight into the role

142

of translational regulation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and the resulting host responses.

143

We found that ribosome occupancy on viral mRNAs was temporally regulated and partly

144

dependent on RNA abundance. In addition, ribosomes engaged with novel translation

145

initiation sites (TIS) and other potential regulatory elements on SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Viral

146

mRNAs encoding E, S and ORF1ab were more efficiently translated than other viral

147

mRNAs, but the overall translation efficiency of viral mRNAs was not substantially different

148

than cellular mRNAs. In addition, we found that ribosomes were depleted rather than

149

enriched on the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting site and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting was more

150

efficient than HIV-1. Remarkably, while numerous inflammatory chemokines, cytokines

151

and ISGs were upregulated transcriptionally in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we found that

152

many were not efficiently translated. Overall, our study defines the translational landscape

153

of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, revealing novel events that may promote viral replication

154

and disarm host immune responses at the level of mRNA translation.

RESULTS

157
158

Ribosome profiling reveals key features of SARS-CoV-2 translational program

159

To study the relationship between transcriptionally and translationally regulated events at

160

early and late phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Vero E6 cells infected at low and high

161

multiplicity of infection (MOIs, 0.1 and 2 plaque forming units [PFU]/cell, respectively))

162

were monitored by RNA-seq and ribo-seq during the course of infection (Fig. 1A). Viral

163

antigen staining of infected cells revealed that the majority of the cells were infected by 24

164

hpi for low MOI and by 12 hpi for high MOI infections (Fig. S1A, S1B). High quality

165

duplicate sequencing libraries with favorable mapping statistics were generated (Tables

166

S1-S4). The quality of each ribo-seq library was assessed as follows. First, the length of

167

distribution of ribo-seq reads that mapped to cellular and viral transcriptomes were within

168

the expected range of ribosome protected fragments (Fig. S2A, S2B, S3A, S3B) (Ingolia

169

et al., 2012, Ingolia et al., 2009). We noted that in one experiment read lengths trended to

170

be longer likely due to lesser extent of nuclease digestion (Fig. S3A, B). Second, the

171

majority of ribo-seq reads mapped to coding sequences and 5’ UTRs, with clear reduction

172

in the fraction of reads mapping to 3’UTRs when compared to RNA-seq experiments done

173

in parallel (Fig. S2C, Fig. S4). Third, mapped ribosome footprints within the CDSs were

174

enriched in fragments that align to the translated frame (Fig. S2D, Fig. S5).

175
176

For low MOI infections, ~50% of the uniquely mapping RNA-seq reads were derived from

177

SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs by 24 hours post infection (hpi) (Fig. 1B). By 48 hpi >80% of the

178

uniquely mapping reads were viral (Fig. 1B) demonstrating that viral mRNAs quickly

179

dominate the total cellular mRNA pool. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2-derived mRNAs

180

did not increase further at 72 hpi (Fig. 1B), partly due to virus-induced cytotoxicity.

181

Comparatively, a smaller percentage of ribosome-associated mRNAs were derived from

182

SARS-CoV-2, approximating 20 to 40% at early and late time points in infection,

183

respectively (Fig. 1C). Despite their relative abundance in the cytosol, viral RNAs were

184

not specifically enriched in ribosome-bound pool. As we observed significant levels of

185

cytotoxicity at 72 hpi, we focused our analyses on the earlier 24 and 48 hpi time points.

186
187

Plotting of RNA-seq reads on the viral genome demonstrated that N-derived sgRNAs were

188

highly abundant throughout infection (Fig. 1D-E, and S5), a finding consistent with

189

previous RNA-seq studies (Kim et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2020). Expectedly, the majority

190

of these reads were derived from positive sense viral mRNAs, albeit substantially lower

191

copies of anti-sense transcripts were also detectable (Fig. S6). Furthermore, ribosomes

192

were enriched on N mRNAs, with a high peak surrounding the translation start site, at 24

193

hpi (Fig. 1D). As expected from the low abundance of ORF10 encoding sgRNAs, we noted

194

that ribosome occupancy fell abruptly after the N stop codon, although footprints were still

195

detectable within the ORF10 coding sequence with an average read count of 136 per

196

nucleotide, A second high ribosome occupancy site was observed within the M ORF at 24

197

hpi, again with a distinct peak around the translation start site (Fig. 1D). ORFs downstream

198

from S also were bound by ribosomes, albeit at lower levels (Fig. 1D). By 48 hpi, we found

199

that high ribosome occupancy sites shifted from the N ORF to upstream ORFs, and

200

numerous high ribosome occupancy sites were observed throughout the viral RNAs (Fig.

201

1E). In particular, at 48 hpi, ORF1a and ORF1b translation appeared to be more efficient,

202

considering the low level of mRNA abundance observed by RNA-seq (Fig. 1E and S7B).

203

Ribosome occupancy within ORF1a and ORF1b was non-uniform and did not correlate

204

with proteolytic cleavage events occurring within these polyproteins (Fig. S7A-B).

205

Ribosome footprints were also observed on antisense transcripts (Fig. S8), albeit fairly

206

infrequently and with read length distributions not matching those expected from ribosome

207

protected fragments (Fig. S2E).

208
209

Similar to other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting is thought to be mediated by the

210

conserved heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and a RNA pseudoknot

211

downstream from it spanning nucleotides 13408-13540 (Fig. 1F). Of note, ribosome

212

occupancy was fairly low within the frameshifting site but increased immediately following

213

it (Fig. 1G), suggesting a relatively high efficiency of frameshifting. Length distribution of

214

reads that mapped to ORF1ab was similar to other virally mapping reads (Fig. S2F) and

215

within the expected range of ribosome-protected fragments. Average ribosome density

216

within ORF1b was modestly lower, and comparison of ribosome densities between ORF1a

217

and ORF1b revealed a frameshifting efficiency of %63 (+/- 3%), in line with published

218

reports of frameshifting efficiency with SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses

219

(Irigoyen et al., 2016, Dinan et al., 2019, Finkel et al., 2020). In addition, we noted that

220

ribosome density was also depleted ~100 nucleotides upstream of the frameshifting site

221

(Fig. 1G). Based on this, we speculate that the pseudoknot structure may sterically hinder

222

translating ribosomes upstream of the frameshifting site or that the RNA structure may

223

extend to upstream sequences.

224
225

Kinetics of early translationally regulated events in SARS-CoV-2 replication

226

To identify early translationally regulated events in SARS-CoV-2 replication, we conducted

227

similar experiments in Vero E6 cells infected at a higher MOI but monitored at earlier times

228

in infection (Fig. 1A, S1B). At 2 hpi, only a small fraction of mRNAs was derived from

229

SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, though by 12 hpi, nearly 80% of the total mRNA pool was viral (Fig.

230

2A). Viral RNAs were more abundant in the ribosome bound pool at 2 hpi and by 12 hpi

231

~50% of the ribosome-protected fragments contained viral sequences (Fig. 2B). As

232

before, viral RNAs did not appear to be specifically enriched in the ribosome-bound pool

233

(Fig. 2B).

234
235

N-derived sequences were the most abundant viral RNA species throughout the infection

236

(Fig. 2C-G) and consistent results were obtained from replicate experiments (Fig. S9-

237

S10). Analysis of ribosome footprints on viral RNAs at 2 hpi revealed the presence of a

238

high occupancy site (Fig. 2C, Fig. S11A, and S12A), which accounted for the majority of

239

ribo-seq reads derived from viral RNAs (Fig. 2B). This region, spanning nucleotides

240

27371-27457 is located between ORF6 and ORF7, is not fully conserved between SARS-

241

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. S13A), and is predicted to form a structured hairpin loop with

242

high probability (Fig. S13B). Reads that mapped to this region displayed a length

243

distribution around 29-34 nt, suggesting that they are authentic ribosome protected

244

fragments rather than aberrant products of PCR or digestion bias.

245

occupancy in this region was maintained throughout the infection (Fig. S13C) and across

246

biological replicates (Fig. S11A and S12A).

High ribosome

247
248

Following a high MOI infection, ribosome occupancy on viral RNAs increased significantly

249

by 6 hpi, featuring N and M coding mRNAs constituting as the most frequently translated

250

RNAs (Fig. 2D, Fig. S11B, and S12B). Ribosome occupancy across viral RNAs increased

251

further by 12 hpi (Fig. 2E, S11C and S12C) and remained high during the remainder of

252

infection (Fig. 2F, 2G, S11D, S11E, S12D and S12E). Ribosome footprints were non-

253

uniform with numerous high and low frequency binding sites observed reproducibly across

254

viral RNAs (Fig. 2C-G, S11, S12). Of note, the frameshifting element had a generally low

255

ribosome density compared to the surrounding sequences throughout the infection (Fig.

256

S14A-E). Ribosome occupancy was low upstream of the frameshifting site (Fig. S14A-E),

257

again suggesting the possibility of an alternative RNA structure and/or steric hindrance by

258

the frameshifting element on translating ribosomes. Once again, read length distribution

259

ribo-seq reads mapping to ORF1ab was similar to other virally mapping reads (Fig. S14F

260

vs. Fig. S3B). Comparison of read density distribution between ORF1a and ORF1b

261

indicated a relatively high efficiency of frameshifting ranging from %75 to %100 throughout

262

the course of infection (Fig. S14G).

263
264

Analogous to SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1 also utilizes -1 ribosomal frameshifting, in this case for

265

generation of the Gag-Pol polyprotein (Jacks et al., 1988, Wilson et al., 1988). HIV-1

266

frameshifting is regulated by a slippery sequence followed by a structured hairpin loop

267

(Mouzakis et al., 2013, Staple and Butcher, 2005). To compare the frameshifting efficiency

268

of SARS-CoV-2 to HIV-1, we next performed paired ribo-seq and RNA-seq experiments

269

in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T-cells isolated from two independent donors (Table S5 and S6).

270

Length distribution of ribo-seq derived reads that mapped to cellular (Fig. S15A) and viral

271

(Fig. S15B) mRNAs were within the expected range of ribosome-protected fragments. In

272

addition, ribo-seq reads that mapped to cellular mRNAs had a 3-nt periodicity in frame

273

with annotated CDSs (Fig. S15C) and were largely depleted off of 3’ UTRs (Fig. S15D),

274

highlighting the high quality of the ribo-seq experiments.

275
276

We found that, in contrast to SARS-CoV-2, ribosome occupancy was high within the HIV-

277

1 frameshifting element (Fig. S16B) but dropped substantially 3’ to it and remained low

278

throughout the Pol ORF (Fig. S16A and 16C). This suggests that ribosomes may pause

279

and accumulate within the frameshifting site but only a small fraction of them continue

280

translating into the Pol ORF, a finding that agrees with prior estimates of low (5-10%) HIV-

281

1 frameshifting efficiency (Biswas et al., 2004, Dulude et al., 2006, Shehu-Xhilaga et al.,

282

2001, Baril et al., 2003, Jacks et al., 1988). Thus, we conclude that programmed ribosomal

283

frameshifting is regulated through distinct mechanisms between HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2,

284

despite the similar structural elements that regulate this process.

286

We next tested whether SARS-CoV-2 can utilize alternative translation initiation, which is

287

increasingly recognized as a key post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism (Kwan and

288

Thompson, 2019, James and Smyth, 2018). To do so, ribo-seq experiments were

289

performed as in Fig. 2 but in the presence of harringtonine, which results in the

290

accumulation of ribosomes at translation initiation sites. In addition to accumulation of

291

ribosomes at the canonical start codons, harringtonine treatment resulted in accumulation

292

of ribosomes at alternative translation initiation sites during the course of infection, albeit

293

at generally lower frequencies. For example, at 6 hpi, an internal noncanonical start codon

294

‘UUG’ within M ORF was utilized at ~30% of the time, predicted to result in an out-of-frame

295

peptide of 53 amino acids long (Table S7). An alternative translation initiation codon ‘AGG’

296

at 21868 nt appeared to be utilized within S at 6, 12 and 24 hpi, which would result in a

297

short 18 amino acid peptide (Table S7). Finally alternative translation initiation sites were

298

observed within M, resulting in an out-of-frame peptide and a truncated version of M

299

(Table S7). Together, these results provide the high resolution map of ribosomes on viral

300

mRNAs during different stages of infection and reveal key sequence and structural

301

elements that may influence SARS-CoV-2 translational program.

302
303

Ribo-seq in primary HBECs reveal a similar SARS-CoV-2 translational program

304

To corroborate these findings in a more relevant cell culture system, we performed ribo-

305

seq studies in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) grown at air-liquid

306

interface. Cells inoculated at an MOI of 0.5 were processed for RNA-seq and ribo-seq at

307

6, 24, 48 and 72 hpi. A parallel set of experiments were done at MOI of 1 and followed

308

during a shorter time course. In contrast to Vero cells, the progression of infection in

309

HBECs was relatively slow and a small percentage of the cells were infected by 24 hpi

310

(not shown). Despite some donor-to-donor variation (as expected from primary cell culture

311

models), SARS-CoV-2 spread was visible by 72 hpi as evident in the presence of

312

numerous infection foci (Fig. S17A). By 96 hpi, a large fraction of ciliated cells expressing

313

ACE2 were infected (Fig. S17B, S17C). These findings were largely corroborated upon

314

infection of HBECs with a NeonGreen reporter virus (Xie et al., 2020) (Fig. S17D). In line

315

with this, the amount of newly synthesized viral RNAs was low at 6 hpi, although by 24 hpi

316

numerous virally derived sequences (as assessed by RNA-seq) were present (Table S8

317

and S9). Similar to experiments done in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1 and 2), the majority of these

318

sequences were derived from subgenomic viral mRNAs coding for N and to a lesser extent

319

upstream ORFs including M, ORF6, ORF7 and ORF8 (Fig. 3A). As with previous

320

experiments, length distribution of ribo-seq reads mapping to cellular and viral mRNAs

321

matched the size expected from ribosome-protected fragments (Fig. S18A), most ribo-

322

seq reads mapped to CDSs and 5’ UTRs but not 3’ UTRs (Fig. S18B) and were enriched

323

in fragments that align to the translated frame (Fig. S19), highlighting the high quality of

324

ribo-seq libraries. The lower permissiveness of these cells to infection resulted in few viral

325

RNAs bound to ribosomes at 6 hpi (Table S8). Ribosomes bound by viral RNAs were

326

readily detected at 24, 48, and 72 hpi, with N and M ORFs being the most frequently

327

translated (Fig. 3B-D). We found distinct accumulation of ribosomes within N, M and

328

ORF1a translation start sites as well as 5’ end of ORF1a (Fig. 3B-D). Overall, these results

329

suggest the presence of a similar gene expression cascade in the primary HBECs in

330

comparison to Vero E6 cells.

332

Inflammatory and innate immune mRNAs are inefficiently translated in SARS-CoV-

2 infected cells

334

Several studies have focused on the transcriptional landscape of innate responses to

335

SARS-CoV-2 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020, Butler et al., 2020, Menachery et al., 2014,

336

Mitchell et al., 2013, Wilk et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020). However, currently there is little

337

evidence as to whether transcriptionally induced mRNAs are actually translated in the

338

setting of a virus that can in principle induce translational arrest (Nakagawa et al., 2016)

339

and ISGs (e.g. IFIT1 and PKR) that can inhibit mRNA translation (Li et al., 2015). Using

340

ribo-seq, we next assessed how cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection at a translational

341

level.

342
343

Paired RNA-seq and ribo-seq data (for high MOI infections of Vero E6 cells) obtained from

344

independent and reproducible experiments (Fig. S20) were analyzed for differential gene

345

expression patterns. As early as 2 hpi, we found transcriptional upregulation of several

346

chemokine ligands (i.e.CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8) and transcription factors involved in cell

347

cycle regulation and induction of inflammation (i.e.NR4A3 and EGR3) (Fig. 4A, S21A,

348

S22A). In contrast, we noted a general trend in RNA downregulation (Fig. 4A), which

349

persisted throughout the infection (Fig. 4B-C, and S23). 6 hpi timepoint was also marked

350

by upregulation of chemokine ligands (CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL11) (Fig. 4B, S21A,

351

S22A) and by 12 hpi numerous ISGs (e.g. IFIT family members, MX1, IFI44), IL1A and

352

IFN-λ were also upregulated (Fig. 4C, S21A, S22A). Remarkably, the majority of these

353

transcript level changes were not apparent in Ribo-seq data (Fig. 4D-F and S21A, S22A),

354

suggesting that mRNAs encoding genes in the host defense responses may not be

355

efficiently translated. Of note, this pattern was not global. For example, EGR1, EGR3 and

356

IFIH1, were induced at equivalent levels both in RNA-seq and ribo-seq experiments (Fig.

357

S24). This pattern grossly continued at 24 and 48 hpi, though by 48 hpi upregulated genes

358

were primarily associated with cell death, likely reflecting viral and immune-mediated

359

cytotoxicity (Fig. S21, S22, S25).

360
361

Time-course gene set enrichment analysis corroborated the differences between

362

transcriptional and translational responses in infected Vero cells. For example, numerous

363

sets of genes involved in chemokine, cytokine and interferon signaling were upregulated

14

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.367516; this version posted November 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

364

at 2 hpi in the RNA-seq data set (Fig. 5A), but these changes were not evident in the ribo-

365

seq data set (Fig. 5B). Although at later time points both RNA-seq and ribo-seq data sets

366

were enriched in gene sets related to interferon responses, inflammatory responses, IL2

367

and IL6 signaling, these responses appeared to be lower in magnitude for ribo-seq data,

368

with fewer genes enriched in each family and a significant delay in kinetics (Fig. 5A-B).

369

Together, these findings suggest that immune response genes are translationally

370

repressed and their expression significantly delayed in infected cells.

371
372

Many of these findings held consistent for the low MOI infections. Analysis of independent

373

and reproducible RNA-seq (Fig. S26A) and Ribo-seq (Fig. S26B) experiments revealed

374

that transcription factors ATF3 and EGR1, key regulators of inflammatory responses, were

375

upregulated at 24 hpi alongside with numerous chemokine ligands (i.e. CXCL1, CXCL8,

376

CXCL10) and interleukin 6 (Fig. 6A). Of note, despite the fact that Vero cells are known

377

to be deficient in type-I IFN production, we noted the upregulation of numerous ISGs (i.e.

378

IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) as well as IFN-lambda at 24 hpi (Fig. 6A). The 48 hpi timepoint was

379

marked by upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (i.e. FOS,

380

NR4A3), as well as inflammatory cytokines such as IL-31 and ISGs including OASL (Fig.

381

6B). In line with our above observations, the great majority of the transcriptionally

382

upregulated genes were not translationally upregulated at 24 hpi (Fig. 6C) and 48 hpi

383

(Fig.6D). Interleukins IL11 and IL1A stood out as immune-related genes that were

384

translationally upregulated at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively (Fig. 6C, D)

385
386

Although a small percentage of cells in the primary airway culture system described above

387

were infected, analysis of differentially expressed transcripts revealed significant and

388

consistent trends in gene expression profiles upon infection. For example, we found that

389

gene sets involved in inflammatory response, interferon alpha, interferon gamma, IL2 and

15

390

IL6 signaling were upregulated as early as 6 hpi by RNA-seq, despite the lack of

391

observable virus replication (Fig. S27A). At 48 hpi, the transcriptional landscape was

392

marked by the upregulation of other sets of genes involved in IL2 and IL6 signaling,

393

inflammation, complement and hypoxia, amongst others (Fig. S27A). Many of these

394

responses were tuned down or non-existent in the ribo-seq data set (Fig. S27B),

395

suggesting that mRNA translation may similarly be repressed in this more relevant cell

396

culture system.

397
398

Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and host mRNA translation efficiencies

399

We next assessed the translational efficiency of cellular host response genes in infected

400

cells and how this compared to viral mRNA translation. In mock-infected cells, most

401

cellular mRNAs were translated at levels proportional to their mRNA abundance (Fig. 7A).

402

Notable outliers included mRNAs encoding for ribosomal subunits, which were translated

403

less efficiently as observed before (Riba et al., 2019), and DDX25 RNA helicase, which

404

constituted one of the most efficiently translated mRNAs (Fig. 7A). The translational

405

efficiency of viral mRNAs was not substantially different than the majority of cellular

406

mRNAs with ORF1AB, S and E mRNAs translated at a modestly higher efficiency and the

407

remainder of viral mRNAs at a lower efficiency than average, a pattern that did not vary

408

with progression of infection (Fig. 7B-F). Thus, the high abundance of viral mRNAs, as

409

opposed to a specific regulated mechanism, likely ensures the abundance of viral proteins.

410

Consistent with our earlier observations, we found that the differentially expressed

411

chemokine ligands and ISGs generally were translated less efficiently (Fig. 7C-D and

412

S14). Of note numerous cellular genes with unknown functions were translationally

413

upregulated in infected cells (Fig. 7B-F).

416

Here we utilized ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) coupled with RNA-seq to study the

417

translational events that regulate viral gene expression and host responses over the

418

course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 replicates rapidly, with viral RNAs

419

constituting the great majority of the total mRNA pool soon after infection. Our data show

420

that viral mRNA abundance is the main determinant of viral protein expression and SARS-

421

CoV-2 mRNAs sequester ribosomes from the translating pool by competition, simply

422

outnumbering the host counterparts. Notwithstanding certain viral mRNAs (i.e. those

423

encoding S, E and ORF1ab) were translated modestly more efficiently translated than

424

others. While the overall conclusions are similar, another study found that ORF1ab was

425

less efficiently translated compared with other viral mRNAs (Finkel et al., 2020), which we

426

ascribe to possible differences in read depth (with our study having substantially higher

427

read depth within ORF1ab), RNA-seq approaches and infection conditions (5-7 hpi in

428

(Finkel et al., 2020) vs. a more extensive time course analysis done in our study). In

429

addition, we show that ribosome occupancy on viral RNAs is uneven, changes during the

430

course of infection, and alternative translation initiation sites and RNA structural elements

431

may be utilized. Analysis of mRNA translation in infected cells uncovered that

432

inflammatory and innate responses can be dampened by inefficient mRNA translation in

433

SARS-CoV-2 –infected cells. Together, our study provides an in-depth picture of

434

translationally regulated events in SARS-CoV-2 replication and reveal that impairment of

435

host mRNA translation may allow SARS-CoV-2 to evade host immunity.

436
437

We observed that, in contrast to HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2 RNA employs a highly efficient

438

frameshifting strategy to facilitate virus replication. Ribosomal frameshifting requires a

439

heptanucleotide slippery sequence and a RNA pseudoknot, generally a H-type, positioned

440

six to eight nucleotides downstream (Giedroc and Cornish, 2009). Multiple models for

441

ribosomal frameshifting posit that the ribosome pauses at the slippery sequence upon

17

442

encountering the pseudoknot, which is resistant to unwinding (Farabaugh, 1996, Dinman,

443

2012). While paused, ribosomes either stay in-frame or slip -1 nt before resuming

444

translation. A corollary of this notion is that the stimulatory structure, in turn, enhances

445

frameshifting efficiency by promoting ribosomal pausing. In line with this, we observed low

446

ribosome occupancy in the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting site (Fig. 1G and S14). Notably,

447

ribosome pausing extended 100 nucleotides upstream of the frameshifting site,

448

suggesting an alternative frameshifting structure that includes upstream sequences or

449

steric hindrance imposed by the pseudoknot structure. Ribosome density downstream of

450

the frameshifting site within the ORF1b was remarkably high, suggesting high efficiency

451

of frameshifting in spite of ribosomal pausing.

452

The behavior of ribosomes was drastically different between the SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1

453

frameshifting sites. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, ribosomes accumulated within the HIV-1

454

frameshifting element and only a small fraction of them continued into the Pol ORF,

455

suggesting a significantly lower efficiency of frameshifting. We hypothesize that both

456

sequence-specific and structural features contribute to SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting

457

efficiency. It is thought that HIV-1 has a particularly slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) as

458

compared to SARS-CoV-2 (UUUAAAC), which may underlie this difference (Giedroc and

459

Cornish, 2009). In addition, structures downstream of the slippery sequence may have an

460

impact (Plant and Dinman, 2008). For example, the HIV-1 frameshifting element is

461

predicted to have a simpler pseudoknot (Chang et al., 1999, Parkin et al., 1992, Brierley

462

and Dos Ramos, 2006, Huang et al., 2014) or hairpin loop structure (Mouzakis et al., 2013,

463

Staple and Butcher, 2005). In particular, previous studies suggest that frameshifting

464

efficiency positively correlates with the mechanical stability and thermodynamic stability

465

of the pseudoknot and stem loop, respectively (Hansen et al., 2007, Chen et al., 2009,

466

Bidou et al., 1997). In addition, host proteins can also affect frameshifting. Of note, an

18

467

interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) product, known as C19orf66 (Shiftless), has recently

468

been demonstrated to impair HIV-1 replication through inhibition of HIV-1 programmed

469

frameshifting (Wang et al., 2019). Altogether, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-

470

1 frameshifting occurs through distinct mechanisms. It remains to be determined how

471

distinct elements within the frameshifting site affect and whether other viral or cellular

472

proteins are involved in modulating the frameshifting efficiencies of these viruses.

473

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation may be regulated by other structural elements. For

474

example, we observed a high ribosome occupancy site that is present throughout the

475

course of infection and located between ORF6 and ORF7 (Fig. 2C, S13). This site is

476

computationally predicted to form a structured hairpin loop that may trigger ribosomal

477

pausing during translation of subgenomic viral RNA and thus lead to the observed high

478

ribosome occupancy (Fig. S8). Of note, ribosome occupancy within this region fell after

479

harringtonine treatment, suggesting that it may serve a function other than translation

480

initiation (not shown). While the biological role of this RNA structure is not apparent, it may

481

play a role in regulating the relative expression of ORF6 and ORF7 likely within the context

482

of viral subgenomic mRNAs. Other potential functions of this element include co-

483

translational protein folding, protein targeting, or co-translational degradation of both

484

mRNA and nascent peptide following pausing.

485
486

In addition, our study demonstrates that alternative, non-canonical translational start sites

487

internal to several viral genes such as S, E and M, can result in truncated isoforms or short

488

peptides (Table S7). While their presence still needs to be validated, this raises the

489

question of whether viral protein isoforms may play important biological role during

490

infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection also induced significant increase in utilization of canonical

491

as well as non-canonical translation initiation sites from numerous cellular mRNAs (Table

492

S10), including members of the S100 family with known roles in inflammation (Bettum et

493

al., 2014, Li et al., 2020) and virus replication (Bharadwaj et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2015,

494

Taylor et al., 2018). These findings together emphasize the potential role of translationally

495

regulated events that may help shape viral replication and host responses to pathogens,

496

which may be overlooked in transcriptomics approaches.

497
498

Our study provides the first in depth picture of how host cell responses to SARS-CoV-2

499

are regulated at a post-transcriptional level. This is of utmost importance given that several

500

SARS-CoV proteins have been reported to suppress host translation and that numerous

501

genes involved in innate immunity act to block mRNA translation. Such regulatory events

502

would be completely neglected in transcriptomic screens. In fact, we observed

503

upregulation of proinflammatory chemokines as early as 2 hpi followed by a more delayed

504

induction of ISGs, a finding in line with previous observations in immortalized lung cell

505

lines (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). However, the increase in transcript abundance did not

506

correlate with higher levels of translation and majority of them appeared to be translated

507

at a low efficiency (Fig. 7).

508
509

The apparent low translation efficiency of host response mRNAs may be mediated by the

510

SARS-CoV-2 protein nsp1, which was recently reported to associate tightly with the 40S

511

ribosomal subunit as well as non-translating 80S ribosomes to prevent binding of capped

512

mRNA and thus inhibit the formation of the translation initiation complex (Schubert et al.,

513

2020), much like its SARS-CoV counterpart (Narayanan et al., 2015). In addition, there is

514

increasing evidence that ectopic expression of Nsp1 can alter host mRNA translation (Rao

515

et al., 2020). Our study complements these studies and provides the first published

516

evidence on the potential inhibitory effects of Nsp1 on host mRNA translation at

517

biologically relevant infection settings. We cannot rule out that the observed translational

518

suppression may also be contributed by the host’s attempt to curb viral replication,

519

including members of the IFIT family with known functions in translation inhibition (Hyde

520

and Diamond, 2015, Fensterl and Sen, 2015, Reynaud et al., 2015, Daffis et al., 2010,

521

Diamond and Farzan, 2013). A further alternative is that the translation of these mRNAs

522

is inherently inefficient due to presence of unique 5’ UTR structures. Finally, it is plausible

523

that the relatively lower read depths obtained from ribo-seq libraries may have precluded

524

accurate assessment of differential gene expression changes. However, we think that this

525

is unlikely given the high level of mRNA expression for numerous innate immune genes

526

(based on RNA-seq) and the statistical models utilized herein to assess translational

527

suppression. Notwithstanding, future studies are warranted to empirically test these

528

possibilities and define the mechanism of apparent innate immune suppression.

529
530

While COVID-19 pathogenesis is in part due to virus-induced destruction of infected cells,

531

elevated production of inflammatory mediators and the virus-induced immunopathology

532

are thought to play a big role in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury (Channappanavar and

533

Perlman, 2017, Perlman and Dandekar, 2005). Our findings suggest that immune

534

responses in actively infected cells may be dampened or delayed for SARS-CoV-2 to

535

efficiently replicate and release viral progeny. As such, it is possible that the elevated

536

levels of inflammatory mediators in vivo is due to infection of immune cell subsets, such

537

as monocytes and macrophages, that are less permissive to SARS-CoV-2 but can sense

538

and respond to infection by secretion of immune modulatory molecules (Jafarzadeh et al.,

539

2020).

540
541

Taken together, we provide novel insight into and a rich resource on how translational

542

regulation shapes SARS-CoV-2 replication and host responses. Our finding that induction

543

of inflammatory and innate immune responses can be limited at the level of mRNA

544

translation provides a paradigm shifting mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 can encounter

545

immune responses. Modulation of viral RNA structures and proteins that regulate mRNA

546

translation will undoubtedly provide a unique avenue for therapeutic development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

623

Chemicals and reagents. Standard laboratory chemicals were obtained from reputable

624

suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich. Cycloheximide (CHX) was obtained from Sigma,

625

dissolved in ethanol and stored at -20°C. Harringtonine (HT) was purchased from LKT

626

Laboratories, Inc., resuspended in DMSO and stored in aliquots of 2 mg/mL at -20°C.

627
628

Plasmids and viruses. A proviral plasmid encoding the full length HIV-1 genome was

629

obtained from NIH AIDS Reagents. HIV-1 stocks were generated by transfection of

630

Human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293T, with proviral plasmids and collection of cell

631

culture supernatants two days after. Viruses were treated by DNase to avoid plasmid

632

carryover and concentrated by Lenti-X concentrator. HIV-1 stocks were titered on TZM-bl

633

cells by conventional methods. CD4+ T-cells activated for 4-5 days were used for HIV-1

634

infections. SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 was obtained from Natalie

635

Thornburg at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), propagated in Vero

636

CCL-81 cells and titrated on Vero E6 cells by plaque-forming assays.

674

15 min. Cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and stored

675

at 4 °C. Prior to probing for vRNA, membranes containing cells were cut from plastic

676

supports, divided into 4 pieces, and placed in a fresh 48-well plate. RNA detection was

677

performed using the manufacturer protocol for RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization

678

(RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v2 Assay kit, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, cells

679

on membranes were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature,

680

washed with distilled water, then treated with protease III solution, diluted 1:15 in PBS, for

681

10 min in a humidified hybridization oven at 40 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS

682

and incubated for 2 hr at 40 °C with manufacturer designed anti-sense probes specific for

683

SARS-CoV-2 positive strand S gene encoding the spike protein (RNAscope Probe-V-

684

685

sense-C2 cat # 854851-C2). The probes were visualized according to the manufacturers’

686

instructions by incubation with RNAscope amplifiers, horseradish peroxidase, and

687

fluorescent label (Opal fluorophores, Perkin-Elmer). Membranes were mounted on glass

688

slides using anti-fade medium containing DAPI (Fluoroshield, Sigma-Aldrich). Images

with the following modifications (Ingolia et al., 2009, Ingolia et al., 2012). Mock- and HIV-

694

1- or SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were treated with complete cell culture media

695

supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL CHX for 1 min at room temperature followed by one round

696

699

cells were then triturated by repeated pipetting and incubated with lysis buffer for at least

700

20 min to ensure virus inactivation. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at ≥20,000 g at

701

4°C for clarification. The supernatants were split into multiple aliquots, with SDS added to

702

one aliquot to a final concentration of 1% for downstream RNA-seq sample preparation,

703

and flash frozen in a 70% ethanol/dry ice bath or directly placed at -80°C. Lysates were

704

treated with RNase I (5U/OD260) and ribosome-protected fragments were isolated via

705

centrifugation through Microspin S-400 HR columns (GE Healthcare) and purified using

706

the RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research). Recovered ribosome-bound

707

fragments (RBFs) are then subjected to rRNA depletion using RiboZero beads from the

708

TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit (Illumina) and purified using Zymo RNA

709

Clean and Concentrator kit. Fragments were then end-labeled with γ-32P-ATP using T4

710

polynucleotide kinase (NEB), separated on 15% TBE-Urea gels and visualized by

711

autoradiography. RNA fragments of ~30 nt were excised from the gels and purified as

712

detailed before in 400 μL of 0.4 M NaCl supplemented with 4 μL SUPERaseIN. 3’ and 5’

713

adapters were sequentially ligated as in a previously described protocol (Kutluay et al.,

714

2014, Kutluay and Bieniasz, 2016), reverse transcribed and PCR amplified. Libraries were

Data analysis. All of the data analysis pipelines used in this study are deposited to GitHub

727

under kutluaylab. Below we detail the salient steps of data analyses:

728
729

Mapping. Generated RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data were analyzed by publicly available

730

software and custom scripts. In brief, for Ribo-seq, reads were separated based on

731

barcodes and the adapters trimmed using BBDuk (http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-

732

tools/bb-tools/) and FastX Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/).

733

resulting reads were mapped to the viral genome/transcriptome using the Bowtie aligner

734

(Langmead et al., 2009) (mapping criteria -v 1, -m 10), and to the African green monkey

735

(AGM) genome (Chlorocebus sabaeus) in STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) (mapping criteria

736

FilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04). For AGM alignments, reads were first mapped to rRNA

737

to remove any rRNA-derived reads not completely removed by depletion kits and to the

738

SARS-CoV-2 genome to remove virally derived reads. The remaining reads were then

739

mapped to the AGM genome. RNA-seq reads were similarly mapped to the viral and AGM

740

genomes using STAR, although the rRNA alignment step was omitted. For AGM

741

alignments, mapped reads were annotated using the featureCounts package and GTF

742

files freely available from NCBI and Ensembl.

The

743
744

Statistical Analysis: Differential gene expression analysis was carried out using the

745

featureCounts output files via the edgeR package (Robinson et al., 2010), available from

746

Bioconductor. Considering that virally derived sequences quickly dominated the host

747

mRNA pool, for differential gene expression of host mRNAs, library sizes were normalized

748

relative to reads that map only to host mRNAs. Efforts in this area focused on determining

749

upregulated genes using individual Ribo-seq and RNA-seq experiments, as well as the

analysis of log2-fold change differences between Ribo-seq and RNA-seq to discover

751

translationally regulated genes.

752

generate quality control plots and graphics highlighting differentially expressed genes.

753

The calculation of translational efficiency involved normalizing counts to account for library

754

size in edgeR to generate log2 counts-per-million (log2CPM) estimates for each gene in

755

Ribo-seq and RNA-seq, and subtracting log2CPM RNA-seq from log2CPM Ribo-seq to

756

provide an estimate of the difference in expression level between Ribo-seq and RNA-seq

757

for a given gene.

These same files and packages were also used to

758
759

Additionally, the R package TcGSA was used to determine individual host genes and gene

760

sets differentially regulated over time (Hejblum et al., 2015). The normalized gene counts

761

at each time-point were provided as input, along with the ‘hallmark’ Gene Matrix file

762

containing annotated sets of processes and associated genes, downloaded from GSEA

763

(Subramanian et al., 2005, Mootha et al., 2003). As output, TcGSA provides clusters of

764

genes within each gene set, which follow particular trends. From these clusters, individual

765

genes differentially regulated over time were extracted and plotted as heatmaps in R.

766
767

Downstream analysis of sets of differential genes involved the use of goseq (Young et al.,

768

2010) and KEGGREST R packages (Tenenbaum, 2020). Annotations of 5’UTRs, CDSs

769

and 3’UTRs were retrieved and repetitive low-complexity elements were removed. The R

770

package riboWaltz (Lauria et al., 2018) was utilized to determine the location of ribosomal

771

P-sites with respect to the 5’ and 3’ end of reads, as well as illustrating triplet periodicity

772

and determining the percentage of reads within each frame in CDS and UTR . Finally, the

773

metagene R package (Beauparlant, 2020) was applied to generate an aggregate analysis

774

of ribosomal density downstream of start codons and upstream of stop codons in the

775

corresponding genome.

776
777

Alternative TIS sites in both host and viral reads were found using the Ribo-TISH package

778

(Zhang et al., 2017). For viral TIS, analysis was carried out in the ‘predict’ mode comparing

779

samples mock-treated or treated with harringtonine at each timepoint (with replicates).

780

This was replicated for host analysis, although with the additional step of analysis in the

781

‘diff’ mode to predict TIS differentially regulated between infected and uninfected cells.

782
783

Viral Counts: Viral read density plots were generated using the SAM file from viral

784

genome alignment. The SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) package was used to create an mpileup

785

file containing information about the read density, strandedness, mapping quality, and

786

nucleotide identity at each position.

787

kutluaylab) then were utilized to create files providing only the nucleotide identity and

788

number of counts at each position for both sense and antisense reads. These were then

visualized by scripts written in R.

791

As SARS-CoV-2 generates chimeric subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) in addition to its

792

genomic RNA (gRNA), featureCounts could not be used to accurately estimate viral gene

793

counts from RNASeq due to the presence of nested 3’ sequences. Therefore, in order to

794

visualize and enumerate such chimeric sequences the BWA aligner (Li and Durbin, 2009)

795

was used in ‘mem’ mode on viral RNASeq reads. After generating this alignment using

796

the default parameters and same reference SARS-CoV-2 FASTA file as above, chimeric

797

reads were isolated by searching for all reads containing the ‘SA’ tag and the SARS TRS

798

sequence, ‘AAACGAAC’. SARS-CoV-2 gRNAs were extracted by searching for all reads

799

containing the first 15-20 bases of the ORF1A coding sequence (CDS), as these

800

sequences would only be present in full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes. This provided the

801

sequences and alignment locations of the chimeric and genomic reads, which were then

visualized using R. For sgRNAs, the viral gene corresponding to each transcript was

803

determined by locating the CDS with the nearest downstream start site. This data,

804

together with the number of gRNAs was used to calculate relative percentages of viral

805

transcripts and, together with the total number of mapped viral reads, allowed for the

806

tabulation of viral gene counts at each time point.

807

featureCounts was used to enumerate the number of viral reads, as ribosomes only

translate the first gene on each transcript and so footprints from nested 3’ gene were low

enough to be negligible.
