Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of
infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural
proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds
to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation
inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome,
viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral
evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is
maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by
the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be
transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is
only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the
ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and
SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the
ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host
translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the
SL1 5’UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic
RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic
strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of
infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine ‘Achille heel’ of the virus.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2, of the beta-coronavirus family, recently emerged as responsible
for the Covid-19 world pandemic (Andersen et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Its
genome is a positive single strand RNA molecule containing 29903 nucleotides
entirely sequenced at the end of 2019 (Chan et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020). The viral
genomic RNA is capped at its 5’ end and polyadenylated at its 3’ end (Nakagawa et
al., 2016). After entry in the infected cell, the viral genome hi-jacks the host
translation machinery in order to produce the viral proteins required for the viral
infectious program and the production of novel viral particles (Hartenian et al., 2020).
Like many viruses, SARS-CoV-2 orchestrates viral translation concomitantly with the
specific shut down of cellular mRNA translation. The goal of this silencing is dual.
First, general cellular translation inhibition generates the large pool of ribosomes
necessary to ensure efficient and massive synthesis of viral proteins. Interestingly,
the cellular mRNAs coding for protein components of the translational machinery
such as ribosomal proteins and translation factors are preserved from the overall
translation inhibition presumably in order to maintain a functional translational
machinery during viral translation (Rao et al., 2020). Secondly, the cellular translation
silencing inhibits more specifically mRNA subsets that are involved in cellular
immune responses to viral infection.
Viral translation begins with the expression from ORF1a that is translated into a
polyprotein that is further processed by proteolytic cleavages to produce nonstructural proteins (NSP) involved in the multiple steps of the general viral infectious
program (Masters, 2006). The N-terminal proximal protein NSP1 is one of the first
viral protein that is produced at the onset of the infectious program. NSP1 is required
for efficient host cellular translation inhibition. First, NSP1 recruits a yet unidentified
cellular endonuclease that promotes specific mRNA degradation on translated
mRNAs (Kamitani et al., 2006, 2009). These cleavages occur on the ribosome during
translation elongation. Importantly, viral mRNA transcripts are resistant to NSP1mediated cleavages (Huang et al., 2011a). Secondly, NSP1 prevents translation
initiation by interfering with the pre-initiation complex formation at multiple steps
(Lokugamage et al., 2012a). NSP1 is thus directly responsible of general translation
inhibition (Huang et al., 2011b; Lei et al., 2013; Narayanan et al., 2008; Tohya et al.,
2009). However, its impact on translation is stronger on specific mRNAs. Among the
targets of NSP1, mRNA subsets involved in specific cellular immune responses are
primarily shut off. Thus, NSP1 suppresses type I interferon responses (Lei et al.,
2020; Narayanan et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2020). The viral protein NSP1 binds to the
host 40S ribosomal subunit with high affinity and a Kd in the nano-molar range
(Lapointe et al., 2020). Its N-terminal domain was determined by NMR (Almeida et
al., 2007), while the C-terminal domain of NSP1 contains an intrinsically disordered
domain from residues 130 to 180 (Kumar et al., 2020). However, when bound to the
ribosome, the NSP1 C-terminal domain is folded and binds tightly to the mRNA entry
channel (Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020). NSP1 C-terminal residues from

148 to 180 interact with ribosomal proteins uS3 and uS5 and with helix h18 from the
18S rRNA (Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020). Interestingly, the NSP1
binding site overlaps with the binding sites of the initiation factors eIF1 and eIF3j
(Lapointe et al., 2020) and, thus, the binding of NSP1 to the 40S prevents the
formation of the 48S pre-initiation complex necessary for efficient translation (Brito
Querido et al., 2020). NSP1 is also competing with the mRNA in the mRNA channel
(Lapointe et al., 2020).
Recently, it has been shown that the N-terminal domain of NSP1 is required for viral
translation by NSP1-bound ribosomes (Shi et al., 2020). The linker length between
the N- and C-terminal domains is critical for viral translation (Shi et al., 2020). Beside
the positive single strand genomic RNA, nine subgenomic RNAs (S, 3a, E, M, 6, 7a,
7b, 8, and N) are produced during the late phase of the infection by SARS-CoV-2
(Kim et al., 2020). All the viral transcripts are capped at their 5’ end with the first two
nucleotides being ribose methylated and polyadenylated at their 3’ end (Lai and
Stohlman, 1981; Yogo et al., 1977). The median length of the polyA tail on viral
transcripts is 47 A residues (Kim et al., 2020). In coronaviruses, all viral transcripts
contain the common so-called 5’ leader sequence (nucleotides 1 to 75) that forms the
hairpins SL1, SL2, and SL3 (Kim et al., 2020; Miao et al., 2020; Sola et al., 2015).
Here we show that viral translation is evading NSP1-mediated inhibition because the
viral transcripts, genomic and subgenomic RNAs, all contain a specific region of the
leader sequence. More specifically, the sole hairpin SL1 is promoting NSP1 evasion
by acting on NSP1 C-terminal domain in order to enable viral RNAs accommodation
in the ribosome for their translation. The interaction between the SL1 RNA hairpin
and the NSP1 C-terminal domain occurs while NSP1 remains bound on the
ribosome. Therefore NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper to impair cellular
translation and specifically promote viral translation.

Results
The evasion from NSP1 inhibition is due to cis-acting elements located in the
SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR
To measure the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR on viral translation, we inserted in
a reporter construct the 5’UTR upstream of the Renilla luciferase coding sequence.
As a control, a similar reporter containing the EMCV IRES was used. Using rabbit
reticulocyte lysates (RRL), we measured translation efficiency of Renilla luciferase in
absence and in presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant NSP1 (Figure
1). Translation efficiency of both constructs is reduced by NSP1. However,
translation is significantly less affected with the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR construct,
indicating that the SARS-CoV2 5’UTR allows evasion from NSP1-mediated inhibition.
This is in good agreement with previous studies that showed that NSP1 is indeed
inhibiting EMCV-driven translation but not SARS-CoV-2 translation (Lokugamage et
al., 2012b). To investigate further the evasion of SARS-CoV-2 viral translation from
NSP1 inhibition, we analysed the formation of the ribosomal pre-initiation complex by
fractionation on sucrose gradients. The RNA transcripts were radiolabelled at their 5’
ends and incubated in RRL. We used a minimal RNA containing the whole SARSCoV-2 5’UTR and the first 12 codons of NSP1 coding sequence (nts 1-300) fused to
a minimal portion of luciferase coding sequence (Figure 2). The formed pre-initiation
complexes are then fractionated on sucrose gradient and collected in separate
fractions. The presence of the radioactive RNAs in the collected fractions was then
monitored by Cerenkov counting. With this experimental set-up, we detected the
formation of 48S, 80S and disomes for EMCV and SARS-CoV-2 constructs (Figure
2A). In the presence of 0.8 µM NSP1, the formation of these complexes is drastically
reduced with the EMCV transcript. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR transcript
allows for the formation of 80S complexes to the same extent and with only a slight
reduction of disomes. This experiment confirmed that the evasion from NSP1
inhibition is due to cis-acting elements located in the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR.
The apical part of SL1 is absolutely required for NSP1 evasion
In order to identify precisely the cis-acting elements, we repeated the experiments
with truncated SARS-CoV-2 5’UTRs. With the 5’ proximal 40 nucleotides (Δ40)
deleted, the protection towards NSP1-mediated inhibition is totally abrogated, which
indicates that this part of the 5’UTR contains essential cis-acting elements (Figure
2B, Supplemental Figure 1). This region of the 5’UTR contains the predicted hairpin
SL1 (Rangan et al., 2020) that was confirmed by probing experiments (Miao et al.,
2020). Next, we introduced four mutations in the upper part of SL1. These mutations
prevent the formation of the apical stem-loop of SL1 (called SL1 mut) (Figure 2C).
We have verified that the introduced mutations do induce the opening of SL1
(Supplemental Figure 2). Again, the formation of pre-initiation complexes is totally

prevented with SL1 mut, indicating that evasion to NSP1-mediated inhibition is
abrogated. Thus, the apical part of SL1 is absolutely required for NSP1 evasion.
A fully functional NSP1 is necessary for translation inhibition
Mutations of residues K164 and H165 of NSP1 into alanines totally abolish the
binding to the 40S subunit (Kamitani et al., 2009). Likewise, the mutations R124A
and K125A inhibit NSP1 ability to promote translation inhibition (Lokugamage et al.,
2012a). We tested the effect of these mutations in NSP1 on the pre-initiation complex
formation with the SARS-CoV-2 containing a mutated SL1. As expected, the wildtype NSP1 severely reduces the formation of the pre-initiation complexes when SL1
is mutated. In contrast, none of the two NSP1 mutants affect the translation indicating
that NSP1 has to be bound to the ribosome to efficiently inhibit translation
(Supplemental Figure 3). Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that the
presence of the cis-acting element SL1 and a NSP1 protein able to bind ribosomes
are necessary to promote a viral translation resistant to NSP1-mediated inhibition.
The apical part of the SL1 RNA hairpin is solely responsible for NSP1
resistance
Next, we tested if SL1 is solely responsible for NSP1-resistance. For that purpose,
we measured the impact of NSP1 on translation of another reporter construct
containing the β-globin 5’UTR upstream of the renilla coding sequence. Translation is
significantly inhibited in the presence of increasing concentrations of NSP1,
confirming the general inhibitory effect of NSP1 bound on the ribosome (Figure 3A).
We then transplanted the 5’ proximal 40 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR,
which contain the SL1 hairpin, upstream of the β-globin 5’UTR upstream. The sole
presence of SL1 allowed a significant protection against NSP1 inhibition. In contrast,
when SL1 mut is transplanted, no protection is observed. Since the sub-genomic
RNAs contain the so-called leader sequence that encompasses SL1, SL2 and SL2 in
their 5’UTR, we checked whether SL2 and SL3 are also required for NSP1 evasion.
Indeed, addition of SL2 and SL3 only slightly improves the translation efficiency in
the presence of NSP1 (Figure 3B). This experiment indicates that sub-genomic
RNAs can also evade to NSP1-mediated inhibition because they harbour SL1 in their
5’UTR. These data confirm that the apical part of SL1 is essential for NSP1 evasion.
Altogether, these results indicate that the evasion of the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs to NSP1
inhibition is due solely to the presence of SL1 in the 5’UTR leader sequence.
Free NSP1 has no affinity for RNA
A putative mechanism would be that SL1 directly interacts with NSP1 and thereby
removes NSP1 from the ribosome to allow access to the mRNA channel of the
ribosome during the initiation process of mRNA accommodation. To evaluate such a
mechanism, we tested the RNA binding ability of NSP1 (Figure 4A). We used

radiolabelled RNAs from SARS-CoV-5’UTR with EMVC and HCV IRES as negative
controls. None of the RNAs tested are bound by NSP1 even when 20 µM of NSP1
was used for Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). We concluded from these
experiments that free NSP1 has no affinity for RNA even when it contains SL1 like
the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR.
The SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR does not bind to any component of the ribosome on its
own
However, NSP1 has a strong affinity for the 40S ribosomal subunit and its C-terminal
domain binds into the mRNA channel with a Kd in the nanomolar range (Lapointe et
al., 2020). We therefore tested whether a SARS-CoV-2 transcript is able to bind to
pure ribosomal subunits by EMSA. To validate our assay, we used the HCV IRES as
a positive control, since it was shown earlier that it interacts specifically with the 40S
ribosomal subunit (Filbin et al., 2013; Fuchs et al., 2015; Quade et al., 2015;
Yamamoto et al., 2015) and even with full 80S (Yokoyama et al., 2019). As expected,
the HCV IRES interacts with purified human 40S ribosomal subunit and with the 40S
subunit from the complete 80S ribosome. In contrast to the HCV IRES, the SARSCoV-2 5’UTR is not able to bind the 40S, as well as the 60S or the 80S particles
(Figure 4B). In summary, NSP1 has a strong affinity for ribosomal 40S subunit but
the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR cannot bind to any component of the ribosome on its own.
The SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR promotes the assembly of pre-initiation complexes in
presence of NSP1: the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA
accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome
But our results also indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR promotes the assembly of
pre-initiation complexes in the presence of NSP1. In order to determine whether
NSP1 is removed from the assembled pre-initiation complexes, we used a previously
established protocol that yields purified pre-initiation complexes programmed with
SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR (Chicher et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2016; Prongidi-Fix et al.,
2013). The principle is to use a chimeric molecule composed on one hand by the
RNA region encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR followed by a small coding
sequence and a DNA oligonucleotide coupled to Biotin at its 3’ end (Figure 5A). The
hybrid molecules are then immobilised on magnetic streptavidin beads and incubated
in RRL in the presence of cycloheximide to allow the formation of pre-initiation
complexes. The complexes are then eluted by DNase digestion that removes the
Biotin and the DNA linker. The composition of the eluted ribosomal complexes is
determined by mass spectrometry analysis. We performed in parallel two
experiments with the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR in the presence or in the absence of
NSP1. Each experiment was repeated three times (Figure 5B). In both experiments,
pre-initiation complexes were efficiently purified as attested by the presence of 40S
and 60S ribosomal proteins and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF) (Figure 5C). We
found the full set of ribosomal proteins from the 60S and the 40S ribosomal subunits

(50 proteins and 36 proteins respectively) (supplementary table 2). Interestingly, we
found that NSP1 is still present in the pre-initiation complexes formed in the presence
of NSP1. This indicates that the purified pre-initiation complexes contain NSP1 still
bound on the ribosome. Thus, these experiments imply that the mRNA channel is
accessible to the mRNA and that NSP1 C-terminal domain must have been
remodelled in order to allow mRNA accommodation. Since NSP1 is present in these
pre-initiation complexes, this suggests that NSP1 remains attached to the ribosomal
subunit with its N-terminal domain (according to data from (Shi et al., 2020)).
Discussion
Altogether, our data enable us to propose the following model (Figure 6). During the
early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infectious program, ORF1a is translated by
canonical cap-dependent translation. The corresponding protein is then processed
into NSP proteins. Among these, NSP1 binds to the ribosome with a high affinity. Its
C-terminal domain interacts with the mRNA channel entry site and thereby blocks the
access to mRNAs. Cellular translation is consequently drastically shut down.
However, viral translation escapes this blockage and still goes on. We have
confirmed that viral translation is proceeding further in the presence of NSP1 in a socalled viral evasion. We demonstrated here that SL1 is required for this viral evasion.
Deletion of SL1 abrogates NSP1 evasion which is in good agreement with a
previously published model in which viral translation is also inhibited by NSP1
(Schubert et al., 2020). Indeed, according to the primers described in this publication,
the reporter used in the later study did not contain SL1, which in fact confirms our
results obtained with Δ40, Δ60, Δ80 and Δ150 (supplemental Figure 1) that showed
that viral evasion is abrogated when SL1 is deleted.
In the model deduced from the available and the present data (Figure 6), the SARSCoV-2 5’UTR contains a cis-acting element, the SL1 hairpin, that induces during
translation initiation a structural rearrangement of NSP1, especially of its C-terminal
domain. This frees the access to the mRNA channel and allows viral translation to
proceed further. This model is in good agreement with two models recently proposed
by others (Banerjee et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). They found that the N-terminal part
of NSP1 is required for evasion from NSP1 inhibition, that the length of the linker
between the N- and C-terminal domains is critical and that the 5’UTR is required for
viral evasion. In addition, they proposed that NSP1 is removed from the ribosome
and retained by an interaction between the N-terminal domain of NSP1 and the
5’UTR (Banerjee et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Although we cannot rule out that this
possibility, the fact that we have not been able to detect any RNA binding ability with
free NSP1 is a strong argument against this suggestion. Moreover, if NSP1 is
released from the ribosome, this will lead to free ribosomes that can start again to
translate cellular mRNAs. To ensure efficient shut down of host translation, it is more
efficient for the virus to maintain NSP1 on the ribosome. Therefore, we rather
suggest that NSP1 stays bound on the ribosome. Within this model, at the end of

translation, the C-terminal domain of NSP1 folds back into the mRNA channel and
prevents any de novo cellular translation. In the late phase of infection, nine subgenomic RNAs are produced. Interestingly, all these viral transcripts contain the socalled leader body junction that contains SL1, SL2 and SL3 (Kim et al., 2020). The
presence of SL1 in all the SARS-CoV-2 transcripts probably ensures efficient NSP1
evasion while still allowing efficient translation. This is especially important for the
translation of sub-genomic RNAs that is required in the late phases of the infectious
process when the concentration of NSP1 is high and when most if not all the
ribosomes are blocked by NSP1. In the model presented in Figure 6, NSP1 acts as a
gatekeeper to control selectively the access to the mRNA channel, preventing
cellular translation and restricting translation to the sole viral transcripts. The release
of the NSP1 gatekeeper is controlled by SL1 from viral transcripts. In conclusion, the
sole presence of SL1 all the SARS-CoV-2 transcripts is a pre-requisite to complete
the viral infectious program. Therefore, targeting SL1 for therapeutic purposes would
be an elegant approach to impair viral translation, in the early phase but also in the
late phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Targeting NSP1 for the development of novel therapeutic strategies has been
proposed earlier (Huang et al., 2011a; Jauregui et al., 2013; Jimenez-Guardeño et
al., 2015; Kamitani et al., 2006, 2009; Lokugamage et al., 2012a; Narayanan et al.,
2008; Tanaka et al., 2012; Tohya et al., 2009; Wathelet et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2020;
Züst et al., 2007). Another attractive alternative would be to target SL1. Indeed, SL1
being present in all the viral transcripts, drug-design against SL1 would allow to
target viral translation in the early phase of infection by impairing genomic RNA
translation and in the late phase of infection by blocking translation of sub-genomic
RNAs. Altogether, SL1 might be seen as genuine ‘Achille heel’ of SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and methods
In vitro transcription
The different variants of reporter constructs were transcribed by run-off in vitro
transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. Uncapped RNAs were separated on
denaturing PAGE (4%) and RNA were recovered from the gel slices by
electroelution. The resulting pure RNA transcripts were capped at their 5′ end with
the ScriptCap m7G Capping System (Epicenter Biotechnologies).
In vitro translation
In vitro translation with cell-free translation extracts were performed using self-made
rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) as previously described (Martin et al., 2011). Briefly,
reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and included 200 nM of each transcript
and 10.8 µCi [35S]Met. Aliquots of translation reactions were analyzed for Renilla
luciferase activity on a luminometer.
Sucrose gradient analysis
For sucrose-gradient analysis, 5′-32P-labeled mRNA were incubated in self-made
RRL, in the presence of recombinant NSP1. NSP1 was incubated with RRL 5 min at
30°C prior to addition of radiolabeled mRNAs. The translation initiation complexes
were separated on a 10–30% linear sucrose gradient in buffer (25mM Tris–HCl [pH
7.4], 50mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). The reactions were loaded on the
gradients and spun (23,411xg for 2.5h at 4 °C) in a SW41 rotor. mRNA
sedimentation on sucrose gradients was monitored by Cerenkov counting after
fractionation.
Primers used
The primers used in this work are listed in table 1.
Mass spectrometry analysis and data processing.
Proteins were digested with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) and analyzed by
nano LCMS/MS as previously described (Chicher et al., 2015). Digested proteins
were then analyzed on a QExactive + mass spectrometer coupled to an EASYnanoLC-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS data were searched against the Rabbit
UniProtKB sub-database (release 2020_05, taxon 9986, 43454 sequences) with a
decoy strategy. Peptides were identified with Mascot algorithm (version 2.5, Matrix
Science) and data were imported into Proline 1.4 software (Bouyssié et al., 2020).
Proteins were validated on Mascot pretty rank equal to 1, Mascot score above
25 and 1% FDR on both peptide spectrum matches (PSM score) and protein sets
(Protein Set score). The total number of MS/MS fragmentation spectra was used to
quantify each protein in each condition performed in three replicates. The statistical
analysis based on spectral counts was performed using a homemade R package that
calculates fold change and p-values using the quasi-likelihood negative binomial

(Lokugamage et al., 2012a); K164A+H165A—biologically inactive– (Narayanan et al.,
2008) were cloned in plasmid pET-His-GST-TEV-LIC-(2GT). This vector
overexpresses fusion proteins carrying a 6 His-tag on the N-terminal GST domain
followed by TEV protease cleavable site and by the NSP1 native protein or mutants.
The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells. Cells
were grown at 37°C to a cell density of OD600 = 0.6. Temperature was decreased to
20°C and cells were induced by addition of 0.1 mM IPTG. Twelve hours after
induction, pelleted cells were resuspended in EQ/W buffer (40 mM Na phosphate pH
7.2, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100,
cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Merck) and incubated on ice for 30 min with 1
mg/mL lysozyme. After lysis by sonification, the cell lysate was centrifuged at
105,000xg for 1h30 and the supernatant was applied to Ni-NTA Superflow resin
(QIAGEN) equilibrated in buffer EQ/W. After column washing, NSP1 proteins were
eluted from the resin by buffer EQ/W containing 250 mM imidazole. The NSP1
fraction was dialyzed against buffer EQ/W without imidazole overnight. NSP1 fraction
was loaded on Glutathione HiCap resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with the dialysis buffer
and proteins were eluted by the same buffer supplemented with 50 mM glutathione.
The purified 6-His-GST-TEV-NSP1 fusion proteins were subjected to TEV protease
cleavage overnight at 4°C (50/1 fusion/TEV molar ratios). NSP1 proteins were
separated from the 6 His-GST domain using a last purification step on Ni-NTA resin
that retained His-tagged GST and TEV proteins. The pure NSP1 proteins were
concentrated, and stored in buffer that contains 50% glycerol at −20°C.

Electro Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)
To detect RNA-protein interactions by EMSA, recombinant NSP1 or pure human
40S, 60S and 80S ribosomal fractions were incubated with 50 fmol of 5’ 32P-labelled
RNA transcripts. Briefly, proteins and RNA were mixed with 20 µg of yeast total tRNA
and incubated for 20 min in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 10%
glycerol in 20 µl at 0°C. The RNA-protein complexes were analysed by
electrophoresis on native 5% polyacrylamide gels using Tris–50 mM glycine as buffer
system and visualized by phosphor imaging.

Figure 6: Model for NSP1 acting as a gate-keeper to ensure NSP1 evasion by
SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR
In the early phase of infection, NSP1 protein is produced and binds with high affinity
to the 40S ribosomal subunit. The cartoons of the 40S subunits are shown from the
solvent side. NSP1 binds on the beak of the 40S by interacting with the N-terminal
part of NSP1, this interaction places the C-terminal part of NSP1 in the mRNA
channel entry site and thereby prevents any mRNA accommodation. The viral mRNA
transcripts contain in their 5’UTR SL1 that by interacting with the 40S-NSP1 complex,
enables mRNA accommodation and the formation of translation initiation complexes
(the mRNA is accommodated in the decoding site on the 40S intersubunit side and is
shown with dashed line). This required the removal of the C-terminal domain of
NSP1 to open the access to the mRNA channel. Then, translation initiation,
elongation and termination can proceed further. After termination, the mRNA is
released, NSP1 C-terminal can refold in front of the mRNA channel and prevents any
de novo cellular mRNA translation. Only viral mRNA transcripts can access to the
mRNA channel, thanks to SL1 that is present in the 5’UTR of genomic and subgenomic RNAs.
