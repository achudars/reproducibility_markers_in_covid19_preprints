Abstract

24

The emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans is highly infectious and

25

leads to the potentially fatal disease COVID-19, has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and

26

huge global disruption. The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest

27

living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which are endangered and often reduced to

28

small populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2

29

(ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of

30

ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these

31

critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection

32

studies are emerging and have shown that some primates, such as rhesus macaques and vervet

33

monkeys, develop COVID-19-like symptoms when exposed to the virus, the susceptibility of many

34

other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees,

35

bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the

36

same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and

37

some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling

38

predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus,

39

hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to

40

catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys,

41

as well as some lemurs are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a

42

critical threat to their survival. Urgent actions have been undertaken to limit the exposure of Great

43

Apes to humans, and similar efforts may be necessary for many other primate species.

Introduction

47

In late 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China. In humans, this virus can lead

48

to the respiratory disease COVID-19, which can be fatal1,2. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has spread

49

around the world, causing widespread mortality, and with major impacts on societies and

50

economies. While the virus and its resulting disease represent a major humanitarian disaster,

51

they also represent a potential existential risk to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman

52

primates. Transmission incidences of bacteria and viruses - including another coronavirus (H-

53

CoV-OC43) - from humans to wild populations of nonhuman primates have previously caused

54

outbreaks of Ebola, yellow fever, and fatal respiratory diseases, leading in some cases to mass

55

mortality3–9. Such past events raise considerable concerns among the global conservation

56

community with respect to the impact of the current pandemic10.

57

Infection studies of rhesus monkeys, longtailed macaques, and vervets as biomedical

58

models have made it clear that at least some nonhuman primate species are permissive to SARS-

59

CoV-2 infection and develop symptoms in response to infection that resemble those of humans

60

following the development of COVID-19, including similar age-related effects11–16. Recognizing

61

the potential danger of COVID-19 to nonhuman primates, the International Union for the

62

Conservation of Nature (IUCN), together with the Great Apes section of the Primate Specialist

63

Group, released a joint statement on precautions that should be taken for researchers and

64

caretakers when interacting with great apes17. However, the risk for many primate taxa remains

65

unknown. Here we begin to assess the potential likelihood that our closest living relatives are

66

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

67

While the biology underlying susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be fully

68

elucidated, the viral target is well established. The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the cellular receptor

69

protein angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is expressed on the extracellular surface

70

of endothelial cells of diverse bodily tissues, including the lungs, kidneys, small intestine and renal

71

tubes18. ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase whose activities include regulation of blood pressure and

72

inflammatory response through its role in cleaving the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to produce

73

angiotensin 1-7 and triggering varied downstream responses19–22. ACE2 is made up of a signal

74

sequence at the N-terminus (residues 1-17), a transmembrane sequence at the C-terminus

75

(residues 741-762), and an extracellular region, which contains a zinc metallopeptidase domain

76

(residues 19–611) and a collectrin homolog (residues 612-740)23,24.

77

Characterizations of the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated that the

78

binding affinity for the human ACE2 receptor is high, which is a key factor in determining the

79

susceptibility and transmission dynamics. When compared to SARS-CoV, which caused a serious

80

global outbreak of disease in 2002-200325,26, the binding affinity between SARS-CoV2 and ACE2

81

is estimated to be between 4-fold27–30 and 10- to 20-fold greater31. Recent reports describing

82

structural characterization of ACE2 in complex with the SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor

83

binding domain (RBD)27–30 allow identification of the key binding residues that enable the host-

84

pathogen protein-protein recognition. Following initial binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor,

85

humans experience a great deal of variation in response to infection, with some individuals

86

experiencing relatively mild symptoms, while others experience major breathing problems and

87

organ failures, which can lead to death. Some of this response is known to be linked to variation

88

in how the immune system responds to infection, with some individuals experiencing a

89

hyperinflammatory ‘cytokine storm’, which in turn aggravates respiratory failures and increases

90

mortality risk32,33. There may also be some variation among humans in initial susceptibility to

91

infection, such that approaches examining variation in ACE2 tissue expression and gene

92

sequences can offer insight into variation in human susceptibility to COVID-1934–37. Similarly, we

93

can use such an approach to compare sequence variation across species, and hence try to predict

94

the likely interspecific variation in susceptibility to initial infection. Previous analysis of comparative

95

variation at these sites enabled estimates of the affinity of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV in

96

nonhuman species (bats)38.

97

Here, we undertake such an analysis for SARS-CoV-2 across the primate radiation. Our

98

aim is to investigate the likelihood of initial susceptibility to infection for different major radiations

99

and species, while recognizing that down-stream processes such as immune responses are likely

100

to determine the extent to which species and individuals develop symptoms and pathologies in

101

response to infection. We compiled ACE2 gene sequence data from 29 primate species for which

102

genomes are publicly available, covering primate taxonomic breadth. For comparison, we

assessed 4 species of other mammals that have been tested directly for SARS-CoV2

sequence variation at these sites for horseshoe bats, thought to be the original vector of the virus,

106

and pangolins, a potential intermediate host, where viral recombination may have led to the novel

107

viral form SARS-CoV-240. We assessed the variation at amino acid residues identified as critical

108

for ACE2 recognition by CoV RBD, and undertook analysis of positive selection and protein

109

modeling to gauge the potential for adaptive differences and the likely effects of protein variation.

Variation in ACE2 sequences

116

We compiled ACE2 gene sequences for 16 catarrhine primates: 4 species from all 3 genera of

117

great ape (Gorilla, Pan, Pongo), 2 genera of gibbons (Hylobates, Nomascus), and 10 species of

118

African and Asian monkeys in 7 genera (Cercocebus, Chlorocebus, Macaca, Mandrillus, Papio,

119

Rhinopithecus, Piliocolobus, Theropithecus); 6 genera of platyrrhines (monkeys from the

120

Americas: Alouatta, Aotus, Callithrix, Cebus, Saimiri, Sapajus); 1 species of tarsier (Carlito

121

syrichta); and 5 genera of strepsirrhines (lemurs and lorisoids: Eulemur, Daubentonia,

122

Microcebus, Propithecus, Otolemur) (Suppl. Table S1). We also included 4 species of mammals

123

that have been tested clinically for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection39, including the

124

domestic cat (Felis catus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris), pig (Sus scrofa), and ferret (Mustela

125

putorius furo). Finally, we included the pangolin (Manis javanica) and several bat species,

126

including horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp., Hipposideros pratti, Myotis daubentonii). Sequences

127

were retrieved from NCBI, either from annotations of published genomes or from GenBank

128

entries38. We manually checked annotations by performing tblastn searches of the human ACE2

129

protein sequence against each genome. We identified one misannotation for exon 15 in

130

Microcebus murinus, which we manually corrected. The ACE2 nucleotide sequence for Alouatta

131

palliata was obtained from an unpublished draft genome, via tblastn searches using the Cebus

132

capucinus ACE2 protein sequence as a query and default search settings. Accession numbers

133

for sequences retrieved from NCBI and GenBank are provided in Supplemental Table S1 and the

134

Alouatta palliata sequence is available in the supplemental materials.

135

Coding sequences were translated using Geneious Version 9.1.8 and we aligned both

136

nucleotide and amino acid sequences with MAFFT41. Amino acids were aligned with the

138

gap open penalty and an offset value of 0.123 were used for both. We manually inspected and

139

corrected any misalignments, and verified the absence of indels and premature stop codons.

140

To visualize patterns of gene conservation across taxa and identify the congruence of the

141

ACE2 gene tree with currently accepted phylogenetic relationships among species, we

142

reconstructed trees using both Bayesian (MrBayes 3.2.642) and Maximum Likelihood (RAxML

143

8.2.1143) methods with 200,000 MCMC cycles and 1,000 bootstrap replicates, respectively (code

144

available on GitHub44). Gene trees were compared to a current species phylogeny assembled

145

using TimeTree45, which is also used to illustrate the evolutionary relationships between study

146

species in Figure 1. Parsimony-informative sites along the ACE2 sequence were identified with

147

the pis function in the R package ips v. 0.0.1146,47.

Identification of critical binding residues and species-specific ACE2–RBD interactions

150

Critical ACE2 protein contact sites for the viral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) have

151

been identified using cryo EM and X-ray crystallography structural analysis methods27–30. The

152

ACE2-RBD complex is characteristic of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that feature extended

153

interfaces spanning a multitude of binding residues. Experimental and computational analyses of

154

PPIs have shown that a handful of contact residues can dominate the binding energy landscape48.

155

Alanine scanning mutagenesis provides an assessment of the contribution of each residue to

156

complex formation49–51. Critical binding residues can be computationally identified by assessing

157

the change in binding free energy of complex formation upon mutation of the particular residue to

158

alanine, which is the smallest residue that may be incorporated without significantly impacting the

159

protein backbone conformation52. Our computational modeling utilizes the human SARS

160

RBD/ACE2 high resolution structures, and we make the implicit assumption that the overall

161

conformation of ACE2 is conserved among different species. This assumption, which is rooted in

162

the high sequence similarity between ACE2 sequences, allows us to use the structure of the

163

complex to predict the impact of mutations at the protein-protein interface.

164

We defined critical residues as those that upon mutation to alanine decrease the binding

165

energy by a threshold value ΔΔGbind ≥1.0 kcal/mol. Nine of the 21 residues identified by alanine

166

scanning as involved in the ACE2-RBD complex met this criterion (Suppl. Table S2). There was

167

large congruence in the sites identified with those highlighted by other methods. Each of the eight

168

sites implicated by cryo EM27, were also detected by alanine modelling; five residues were ≥1.0

169

kcal/mol threshold and 3 were below this threshold. To be cautious, in addition to the the 9 critical

170

ACE2 sites we identified through alanine scanning, we also examined residue variation at the 3

171

sites that fell below the ≥1.0 kcal/mol threshold but that were identified as important by structural

172

analyses27–30 for a total of 12 critical sites. All computational alanine scanning mutagenesis

173

analyses were performed using Rosetta software52. The alanine mutagenesis approach has been

174

extensively evaluated and used to analyze PPIs and design their inhibitors, including by members

175

of the present authorship53,54.

176

We utilized the SSIPe program55 to predict how ACE2 amino acid differences in each

177

species would affect the relative binding energy of the ACE2/SARS-Cov-2 interaction. Using

178

human ACE2 bound to the SARS-Cov-2 RBD as a benchmark (PDB 6M0J), the program mutates

179

selected residues and compares the binding energy to that of the original. Using this algorithm,

180

we studied interactions of all primates across the full suite of amino acid changes occurring at

181

critical binding sites for each species. To more thoroughly assess the impact of each amino acid

182

substitution, we also examined the predicted effect of individual amino acid changes (in isolation)

183

on protein-binding affinity.

184
185

Adaptive evolution of ACE2 sequences

186

We further investigated ACE2 and how selective pressures in different clades might be shaping

187

variation at the binding sites, using codeml clade C and branch-site models in PAML56. We first

188

tested if selection acting on ACE2 is divergent between the major clades in our sample

189

(platyrrhine, catarrhine, and strepsirrhine primates, non-primate mammals) with the codeml clade

190

model C, which was compared to the null model (M2a_rel) with a likelihood ratio test57. This test

191

shows whether there is divergent selection (dN/dS ratio = 𝜔) across all clades, but not which

192

clades are experiencing positive selection. We, therefore, followed the clade model with a series

193

of branch-site models, which allow one clade at a time to be designated as a set of “foreground”

194

branches and test whether this clade has experienced episodes of positive selection compared

195

to the remaining sets of “background” branches (𝜔foreground > 𝜔background). Branch-site models are

196

compared to a null model that fixes 𝜔 at 1 with a likelihood ratio test. In the case of the alternative

197

model having a significantly better fit than the null model, indicating positive selection, potential

198

sites under positive selection are identified with a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach58. We

199

completed branch-site models for each primate clade (platyrrhine, strepsirrhine, and catarrhine),

200

as well as bats, because previous research has identified ACE2 to be under positive selection in

201

this clade, potentially in response to coronaviruses59. We had to exclude Hipposideros pratti and

202

Myotis daubentonii from PAML analyses, because only a partial ACE2 sequence was available

Variation in ACE2 sequences

208

The ACE2 gene (2418 bp) and translated protein (805 amino acids) sequences are strongly

209

conserved across primates. The average pairwise identity across 29 primate species is 93.6% for

210

the ACE2 nucleotide sequence and 90.8% for the protein sequence, with a pairwise similarity

211

(BLOSUM62 ≥ 1) of 95.3% (Suppl. Tables S3-5). Out of 2418 bp, 1631 bp (67.5%) are identical,

212

while 401 bp (16.58%) are phylogenetically informative sites for primates, and gene trees we

213

generated (Suppl. Fig. S1a,b) closely recapitulate the currently accepted phylogeny of primates

214

(Figure 1). In particular, the twelve sites in the ACE2 protein that are critical for binding of the

215

SARS-CoV-2 virus are invariant across the Catarrhini, which includes great apes, gibbons, and

216

monkeys of Africa and Asia (Figure 1). Furthermore, catarrhines do not vary at any of the 21 sites

217

identified by alanine scanning (Suppl. Table S2, Suppl. Fig. S2). The other major radiation of

218

monkeys, those found in the Americas (Platyrrhini), have ACE2 sequences that are less similar

219

to humans across the length of the protein (91.68-92.55% identical to H. sapiens, Suppl. Table

220

S4) but conserved within their clade (average pairwise identity 97.2%, Suppl. Table S4). They

221

share nine of twelve critical amino acid residues with catarrhine primates; the three sites that vary

222

from catarrhines, H41, E42 and T82, are conserved within the platyrrhines. Strepsirrhine primates

223

and tarsiers, were more variable in the binding sites and less similar to the human protein across

224

the length of the sequence (81.86-86.93% pairwise identity, Suppl. Table S4). Like platyrrhines,

225

the tarsier (Carlito syrichta), mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), and galago (Otolemur garnettii)

226

have an H41 residue, while the sifaka (Propithecus coquereli), aye-aye (Daubentonia

227

madagascariensis), and the blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons) have the same allele as

228

humans and other catarrhines, Y41.

229

In non-primate mammals, a higher number of amino acid substitutions are evident (77.37-

230

85.22% pairwise identity to H. sapiens, Suppl. Table S4), including at critical binding sites. All

231

species possess a different residue to primates at site 24. Bats are exceptionally variable within

232

the binding sites, with the genus Rhinolophus alone encompassing all of the variation seen in the

233

rest of the non-primate mammals. Where primates have glutamine (Q24), bats have glutamate

234

(E24), lysine (K24), leucine (L24), or arginine (R24) (Figure 1). All fasta alignments of ACE2 gene

238

Analysis of species-specific residues on ACE2–RBD interactions

239

The ACE2 receptors of all catarrhines have identical residues to humans at the RBD/ACE2

240

binding interface across all 12 critical sites and are predicted to have similar binding affinity for

241

SARS-CoV-2. Platyrrhines diverge from catarrhines at three of the twelve critical amino acid

242

residues. Compared to catarrhine ACE2, the platyrrhines’ ACE2 is predicted to bind SARS-CoV2

243

RBD with roughly 400-fold reduced affinity (ΔΔGbind=3.5 kcal/mol) (Table 1a). In particular, the

244

change at site 41 from Y to H found in monkeys in the Americas has the largest impact of any

245

residue change examined (Table 1b), which alone is predicted to lead to a 25-fold decrease in

246

the binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2). This single mutation combined with additional

247

substitutions, especially Q42E, found in platyrrhines is predicted to significantly reduce the

248

likelihood of successful viral binding (Table 1b). Of the other primates modeled, two of the three

249

strepsirhines, and tarsiers, also have the H41 residue and furthermore have additional protein

250

sequence differences leading to further decreases in predicted binding affinity. The predicted

251

binding affinity of tarsier ACE2 is the most dissimilar to humans and this primate might be the

252

least susceptible of the species we examine. In contrast, Coquerel’s sifaka (Propithecus

253

coquereli), the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), and blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur

254

flavifrons) share the same residue as humans and other catarrhines at site 41 and have projected

255

affinities that are near to humans (Table 1b). Other mammals included in our study - ferrets, cats,

256

dogs, pigs, pangolin and two of the seven bat species (R. pusillus and R. macrotis) - show the

257

same residue as humans (Y) at site 41, with accompanying strong affinities for SARS-CoV-2. The

258

remaining five sister species of bats possess H41 and lower binding affinities (Table 1b).

259
260

Adaptive evolution of ACE2 sequences

261

We find evidence that the selective pressures acting on ACE2 are not equivalent across the major

262

clades in our analysis. The codeml clade model C provided a better fit than the null model (LRT

263

= 26.726, p < 0.001; Table 2, Suppl. Table S6). Branch-site models indicate that the catarrhine

264

primate clade (LRT = 14.546, p < 0.001) and bat clade (LRT = 42.649, p < 0.001) are both under

265

positive selection, while platyrrhines (LRT = 0.633, p = 0.427) and strepsirrhines (LRT = 0.833, p

266

= 0.361) are not. The six positively selected sites in the bat clade include the binding site 24 and

267

two others adjacent to known binding sites (Table 2). In catarrhines, the three positively selected

Discussion

272

Our results strongly suggest that catarrhines - all apes, and all monkeys of Africa and Asia, are

273

likely to be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. There is high conservancy in the protein

sequence of the target receptor, ACE2, including uniformity at all identified and tested major

275

binding sites. Indeed, even among the 21 residues identified in our full list of potential binding

276

points, catarrhines are invariant (Suppl. Table 2, Suppl. Fig. S2). Consistent with our results,

277

infection studies show that rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), longtailed macaques (M.

278

fascicularis) and vervets (Chlorocebus sabaeus) are permissive to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and

279

go on to develop COVID-19 like symptoms11–14,16. Our results based on protein modeling offer

280

potentially better news for monkeys in the Americas (platyrrhines). There are three differences in

281

amino acid residues between platyrrhines and catarrhines, and two of these, H41Y and E42Q

282

show strong evidence of being impactful changes. These amino acid changes are modeled to

283

reduce the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 by ca. 400-fold. Recent clinical

284

analysis of viral shedding, viremia, and histopathology in catarrhine (macaque) versus platyrrhine

285

(marmoset, Callithrix jacchus) responses to inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, show much more

286

severe presentation of disease symptoms in the former, strongly supporting our results13. Similar

287

reduced susceptibility is predicted for tarsiers, and two of the five lemurs and lorisoids

288

(strepsirrhines). What is concerning is three of the analyzed lemurs spanning divergent lineages

289

- the Coquerel’s sifaka, the aye-aye, and the blue-eyed black lemur - are more similar to

290

catarrhines at important binding sites, including possessing the high risk residue variant at site

291

41, and as such are also predicted to be susceptible. Nonetheless, these are only predicted

292

results based on amino acid residues, and protein-protein interaction models. We urge extreme

293

caution in using our analyses as the basis for relaxing policies regarding the protection of

294

platyrrhines, tarsiers or any strepsirrhines. Experimental assessment of synthetic protein

295

interactions can now occur in the laboratory e.g.60, and confirmation of our model predictions

296

should be sought before any firm conclusions are reached.

297

Emerging evidence in experimental mammalian models appears to support our results;

298

dogs, ferrets, pigs, and cats have all shown some susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 but have

299

demonstrated variation in disease severity and presentation, including across studies39,61.

300

Substitutions at binding sites might be at least partially protective against COVID-19 in these

301

mammals. For example, the limited experimental evidence to date suggests that while cats -

302

which have the same residue as humans at site 34 - are not strongly symptomatic, they present

303

lung lesions, while dogs - which have a substitution at this site - do not39. The amino acid residue

304

at site 24 differs from primates in all other mammalian species examined. However, our models

305

suggest that the variant residues may confer relatively minor reductions in binding affinity. Other

306

sources of variation may affect ACE2 protein stability35. Our results are also consistent with

307

previous reports that ACE2 genetic diversity is greater among bats than that observed among

308

mammals susceptible to SARS-CoV-type viruses. This variation has been suggested to indicate

309

that bat species may act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV viruses or their progenitors38. Intriguingly,

310

all but 2 bat species we examined have the putatively protective variant, H41. Additionally, results

311

of our codeml branch-site analysis support previous findings of ACE2 in bats being under positive

312

selection, including sites within the binding domain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-259, which may

313

be evidence of host-virus coevolution. Sites showing evidence of positive selection within

314

catarrhine ACE2 sequences were not in or near known CoV binding sites (Table 2, Figure 1). Two

315

(residues 653, 658) fall within the cleavage site (residues 652-659) utilized by the sheddase

316

ADAM17, known to interact with ACE262. However, neither of the residues under selection are

317

the amino acids targeted by ADAM1763 leaving the functional significance of evolution at these

318

sites uncertain. Further clinical and laboratory study is needed to fully understand infection

319

dynamics.

320

There are a number of important caveats to our study. Firstly, all of our predictions are

321

based on interpretations of gene and resultant amino acid sequences, rather than based on direct

322

assessment of individual responses to induced infection. Nonetheless, the overall pattern of our

323

results is being borne out by infection studies on a few species that are used as biomedical

324

models. So far, all catarrhine species tested by infection studies, including rhesus macaques,

325

longtailed macaques, and vervet monkeys13,14,64 have exhibited COVID-19-like symptoms in

326

response to infection, including large lung and other organ lesions13 and cytokine storms14. In

327

contrast, marmosets did not exhibit major symptoms in response to infection13. While these results

328

support and validate our findings based on ACE2 sequence interpretation, the number of primate

329

species that can and will be tested directly by infection studies will be restricted to just a handful.

330

Our study enhances this picture, by allowing inferences to be made across the primate radiation,

331

backed up by the published infection studies on a few target model species.

332

Some of our results, such as the uniform conservation of ACE2 among catarrhines,

333

backed up by the demonstrated high susceptibility of humans and other catarrhines to SARS-

334

CoV-2, should give a good degree of confidence of high levels of risk.

336

Given the identical residues of humans to other apes and monkeys in Asia and Africa at

337

the target site, it seems unlikely that the ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 proteins would not

338

readily bind. Our results for other taxa are dependent on modeling, hence should be treated more

339

cautiously. This includes all interpretations of the susceptibility of platyrrhines and strepsirrhines,

340

where the effects of residue differences on binding affinities have been estimated based on

341

protein-protein interaction modeling. Another caveat is that we have modeled only interactions at

342

binding sites, and not predictions based on full residue sequence variation. Residues that are not

343

in direct contact may still affect binding allosterically. Other factors, including proteases necessary

344

for viral entry, and other viral targets, may also impact disease susceptibility and responses35.

345

More generally, if adhering to the precautionary principle, then our results highlighting higher risks

346

to some species should be taken with greater gravity than our results that predict potential lower

347

risks to others. Another limitation of our study is that we have looked at only 29 primate species,

348

albeit with broad taxonomic scope. Analysis of additional species is important, especially among

349

strepsirrhine species, where our coverage is relatively scant. In particular, the residue overlap at

350

important binding sites in the sequences of Coquerel’s sifaka, the aye-aye, and blue-eyed black

351

lemur with those of catarrhines suggests many lemurs may be highly

352

underscore the need to assess a wider diversity of lemur species. Furthermore, we examine only

353

one individual per species, and intraspecific variation across populations should be considered;

354

however, studies on intraspecific ACE2 variation with humans and vervet monkeys suggest ACE2

355

variants are low in frequency65–67. Finally, it is also important to remember that our study assesses

356

only the potential for initial binding of the virus to the target site. Downstream consequences of

357

infection may differ drastically based on species-specific proteases, genomic variants,

358

metabolism, and immune system responses68,69. In humans, the development of COVID-19 can

359

lead to a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm of hyperinflammation, which may lead to some of the

360

more severe impacts of infection32,70. Nonetheless, it is evidence from the hundreds of thousands

361

of deaths and global lockdown that humans are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and

362

our results suggest that all apes and monkeys in Africa and Asia are similarly susceptible.

363

Many endangered primate species are now only found in very small population sizes71.

364

For example, there are believed to be only around 1000 mountain gorillas left in their entire

365

range72. With such small populations, the introduction of a new highly infectious disease is a

366

potential extinction-level event. Re-opening access to habituated great ape groups for tourism

367

purposes, which may be critical to local economies73, may be fraught with issues. IUCN best

368

practices recommend that tourists stay at least 7 metres away from great apes74, but in practice,

369

almost all tourists get far closer than this - for example, the average distance that tourists get from

370

mountain gorillas at the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda is just 2.76 metres75.

371

Concerted effort may be required by all stakeholders to try to avoid the introduction of SARS-

372

CoV-2 into wild primate populations10. Recent measures suggested by the IUCN for researchers

373

and caretakers of great ape populations include: ensuring that all individuals wear clean clothing

374

and disinfected footwear; providing hand-washing facilities; requiring that a surgical face mask be

375

worn by anyone coming within 10 meters of great apes; ensuring that individuals needing to cough

376

or sneeze ideally leave the area, or at least cough/sneeze into the crux of their elbows; imposing

377

a 14-day quarantine for all people arriving into great ape areas who will come into frequent close

378

proximity with them17. The IUCN’s ‘Best Practice Guidelines for Health Monitoring and Disease

379

Control in Great Ape Populations’ should also be followed76.

380

Our results suggest that dozens of nonhuman primate species, including all of our closest

381

relatives, are likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vulnerable to its effects.

382

Major actions may be needed to limit the exposure of many wild primate populations to humans.

383

This is likely to require coordinated input from all stakeholders, including local communities,

384

international and national governmental agencies, nongovernmental conservation and

385

development organizations, and academics and researchers. While the focus of many at this time

386

is rightly on mitigating the humanitarian devastation of COVID-19, we also have a duty to ensure

387

that our closest living relatives do not suffer extinctions, or massive population declines, in

388

response to yet another human-induced catastrophe.

Figure 1. ACE2 protein sequence alignment and evolutionary relationships of study species. Branch lengths represent evolutionary distance
(time, in millions of years) estimated from TimeTree45. We outline amino acid residues at critical binding sites for the SARS-CoV-2 spike
receptor binding domain. Solid outlines highlight sites predicted to have the most substantial impact on viral binding affinity. Notably, protein
sequences of catarrhine primates are highly conserved, including uniformity among amino acids at all binding sites. Primate species that are
able to be successfully infected with COVID-19 are indicated in red. Predicted susceptibility to COVID-19 for other primates is additionally
coded by terminal branch colors.

Figure 2. Model of human ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Key ACE2 interfacial
residues are highlighted. (A). Interactions at critical binding sites 41 and 42 are shown for the
residues found in all catarrhines (apes and monkeys in Africa and Asia); (B), and for the
residues found in all platyrrhines (monkeys in the Americas) (C). The dashed lines indicate
predicted hydrogen bonding interactions. Y41 participates in extensive van der Waals and
hydrogen bonding interactions with RBD; these interactions are abrogated with histidine. Q42
side chain amide serves as a hydrogen acceptor and donor to contact RBD; change to glutamic
acid diminishes the hydrogen bonding interactions.
