ABSTRACT: The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-

CoV-2, has a large RNA genome that encodes numerous
proteins that might be targets for antiviral drugs. Some
of these proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved
between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus, but
several others are not. This study examines one of the
proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 that is most different,
a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2
macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the
protein retains the ability to bind ADP-ribose, which is
an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and
potential therapeutic target.

The development of antivirals targeting Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
the causative agent of the present COVID-19 pandemic,1
will most likely focus on viral proteins and enzymes
needed for replication.2 Like other coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV-2 has a large positive sense (+)RNA genome
over 30,000 nucleotides long with several open reading
frames. Most of the proteins that form the viral replicase
are encoded by the “rep 1ab” reading frame, which
codes for a 7,096 amino acid-long polyprotein that is
ultimately processed into at least 15 functional peptides,
five of which are only produced by a translational
frameshift event occurring after nsp10 (Fig. 1). Parts of
the SARS-CoV-2 rep 1ab polyprotein are very similar to
the rep 1ab protein of the coronavirus that caused the
SARS epidemic in 2003 (which will be referred to here
as SARS-CoV-1), suggesting the that drugs targeting the
SARS-CoV-1 nsp5-14 might be effective against SARSCoV-2. However, some portions of the SARS rep 1ab
polyproteins are quite different.
In contrast to the well-conserved SARS nsp5 protease,
nsp12 polymerase and nsp13 helicase enzymes, significantly more differences exist between the nsp3 proteins
encoded by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The most
variation occurs in a domain of Nsp3 domain suspected

to bind ADP-ribose, that will be referred to here as the
“macro X” domain, to differentiate it from the two
downstream “SARS unique macrodomains (SUDs),”
which do not bind ADP-ribose.3 The macro X domain of
SARS-CoV-1 is also able to catalyze the hydrolysis of
ADP-ribose 1’’ phosphate, albeit at a slow rate.4
All the above differences preclude the use of the
SARS-CoV-1 macro X domain structures as scaffolds to
design compounds that might target this nsp3 region in
SARS-CoV-2, especially in light of the observation that
the same nsp3 domain from gamma coronaviruses does
not bind ADP-ribose in vitro.5 Because ADP-ribose
binding is a property that could be used to identify possible antiviral agents, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2
macro X domain to bind ADP-ribose was examined using a recombinant purified protein and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We also determined the structure
of the SARS-CoV-2 macro X domain in order to examine the biochemical context of ADP-ribose binding and
to provide data for rational inhibitor design or in silico
screening.

MATERIAL & METHODS
Gene Synthesis— To facilitate comparison between
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, a protein expression
vector was generated similar to the one used by Eglott et
al.6 To this end, a codon optimized open reading frame
was synthesized by GenSript (Piscataway, NJ) that encodes the Macro X domain with an N-terminal TEVcleavage site flanked by NheI and BamH1 restriction
sites. This open reading frame was cloned into pET21b
to give plasmid pET21-COVID-MacroX. The pET11COVID-MacroX plasmid was used to transform
BL21(DE3) cells.
Protein Purification— Colonies of BL21(DE3) cells
harboring the pET21-COVID-MacroX plasmid were
used to inoculate 3 ml of LB medium containing 100
mg/ml ampicillin. The starter culture was incubated at
37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm. After the cells grew to
an OD600 of 1.0, they were transferred to 1 liter of fresh
medium containing ampicillin. After the cells reached an
OD600 of 1.0 again, protein production was induced with

1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside. After growing 16
h at 23 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at
4,000 rpm, 4°C. The resulting cell pellet was suspended
in 25 mL of IMAC buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 0.5 M
NaCl), sonicated on ice for five 1 min bursts, with 2 min
rests between, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000g
for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5 ml NiNTA column and the fractions were eluted with a step
gradient from 5 to 500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the macro X domain protein (5 ml total) were
loaded on a 250 ml Sephacryl S300 gel filtration column
and eluted with 10 mM MOPS, 150 mM NaCl. Concentration of the purified protein was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm using a molar extinction
coefficient of 10,555 M-1 cm-1, which was calculated
with
the
ProtParam
tool
(https://web.expasy.org/protparam/).
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)— Binding of
ADP-ribose to the SARS-CoV-2 macro X domain was
measured using a Nano ITC (TA Instruments). Before
starting the measurement, samples of both ligand and
protein were diluted in 10 mM MOPS, 150 mM NaCl
(pH 7) and were degassed at 400 mmHg for 30 minutes.
Measurements were taken at 20 °C by injecting 2.0 µ l
aliquots of 500 µM ADP-Ribose (Sigma) to 50 µM protein (175 µl initial volume) with 250 rpm stirring rate.
Using NanoAnalyze Software (v. 3.11.0), data were fitted by non-linear regression to an independent binding
model. Briefly, after baseline correction, background
heats from ligand-to-buffer titrations were subtracted,
and the corrected heats from the binding reaction were
used to find best fit parameters for the stoichiometry of
the binding (n), free energy of binding (ΔG), apparent
enthalpy of binding (ΔH), and entropy change (ΔS). Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from the ΔG.
Crystallization and Structure Determination— In
preparation for crystallization experiments, the purified
SARS-CoV-2 macro X domain protein was cleaved with
tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease to remove the Nterminal His6-tag and passed back through the Ni-NTA
column. The flow-through fractions were desalted into
10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 using a 2x5ml HiTrap desalting
column (GE Life Sciences) and concentrated to 10
mg/mL in a centrifugal concentrator. This preparation of
the protein was mixed 1 μL:1 μL with the Morpheus HT
screen reagents (Molecular Dimensions) in a 96-well
SwissSci MRC UV-transmissible sitting drop plate.
Large, diffraction-quality crystals grew directly from a
number of the screen conditions. The crystal ultimately
used for structure determination grew from condition
D9: 0.12 M alcohols [0.02 M each 1,6-hexanediol, 1butanol, 1,2-propanediol, 2-propanol, 1,4-butanediol,
and 1,3-propanediol], 0.1 M buffer system 3, pH 8.5
[0.05 M each TRIS and bicine], and 30% precipitant mix
1
[20%
poly(ethylene
glycol)
(PEG)
500
monomethylether, 10% PEG 20,000]. Large, thick plates

grew within 1 week at 22 °C. Owing to the high concentration of PEG 500 MME, the crystal did not require
additional cryo-protection and was flash-cooled by looping it directly from the sitting drop and plunging it into
liquid nitrogen.
Diffraction data were collected on Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) beamline 21-ID-F at
the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory. The wavelength at this station is fixed at
0.9787 Å; the detector is a MarMosaic M300 chargecoupled device. The data were collected with an oscillation width of 0.5° per image for a total oscillation of
180°. The data were indexed and integrated with DIALS
7, 8
as implemented in version 7.2 of the CCP4 software
suite.9, 10 Data scaling and reduction was performed using AIMLESS.11–13 Data collection statistics are provided in Table 1.
The structure was determined by molecular replacement in PHASER14 using the model of the SARS-CoV-1
macro X domain as the search model (PDB ID 2FAV6).
The model underwent iterative rounds of (re)building in
COOT15 and refinement in PHENIX.refine.16, 17 The
very high resolution of the data justified a full anisotropic treatment of the protein and solvent temperature
factors. Model refinement and validation statistics are
provided in Table 1. The coordinates were deposited in
the Protein Data Bank with accession code 6WEY.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Hypervariability in the nsp3 Macro X domain— The
structures of most of the soluble portions of the SARSCoV-1 nsp proteins have been examined at atomic resolution to help understand coronavirus replication and
facilitate antiviral drug discovery. The amino acid sequences of each of these proteins were compared with
the homologous regions of the rep 1ab protein encoded
by SARS-CoV-2 (GenPept Accession YP_009724389).
The most similar proteins were the RNA helicases
(nsp13) which are identical in all but one of their 603
amino acids: a conservative Val to Ile substitution near
their C-termini). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
(nsp12) are also well-conserved, sharing all but 34 of
955 amino acids. The primary protease that cleaves the
polyprotein (nsp5) is also similar in SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2, with only 13 amino acids that differ
among 306 (4.2% different) (Fig. 1).
At the other end of the spectrum are the nsp3 proteins,
which are notably more different in the two SARS viruses. Nsp3 is a large multidomain membrane-bound
protein,18 and its clearest role in viral replication is
cleaving the rep polyprotein. Over 17% of the amino
acids in the nsp3 protease domain differ between SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Other parts of nsp3 are even
more variable, like the macrodomains that lie N-terminal
to the nsp3 protease domain. Macrodomains consist of
four helices that surround a mixed beta sheet. A ligand-

binding pocket that typically binds ADP-ribose or related compounds lies between the helices and the sheet.19
SARS-CoV-1 has three macrodomains in tandem, but
only the first binds ADP ribose. The amino acid sequences of this macro X domain differ by 26% between
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1).
Many of the 47 variant residues in the 180 amino acid
long SARS macro X domain are clustered near its Nterminus in a region that is particularly variable in the
three Coronaviridae genera (Fig. 2). Macro X domains
from coronaviruses that cause the common cold (alpha
coronaviruses)5 and the beta coronaviruses like SARSCoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)20 all bind ADP ribose. However, the
same domain in gamma coronaviruses does not bind
ADP-ribose.5
Expression and Purification of the SARS-CoV-2 Macro X domain— An E. coli expression vector for the macro X domain was built to express and N-terminally Histagged protein similar to a SARS-CoV-1 protein studied
by Egloff et al.6 Upon induction, a one liter culture of
BL21(DE3) cells harboring the vector expresses 50-100
mg of the macro X domain protein that can be purified
in one step to apparent homogeneity using immobilized
metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 3A). The protein
was polished further with gel filtration chromatography
and concentrated before analysis and crystallization.
Nucleotide Binding by the SARS-CoV-2 Macro X domain— Repeated ITC experiments revealed that the purified recombinant protein bound ADP-ribose (Fig. 3C)
with a dissociation constant of 10 ± 4 µM (uncertainty is
the standard deviation of Kd’s from independent titrations). To examine binding specificity, similar titrations
were repeated with related nucleotides. The SARS-CoV2 protein bound ADP, cAMP, ATP and ADP-glucose
(Fig. 3D). All nucleotides lacking the ribose moiety
bound with similar high affinities, but none bound with
an enthalpy change like that seen with ADP-ribose, suggesting specific contacts form between ADP ribose the
SARS-CoV-2 protein. Based on what is seen in the
SARS-CoV-2 structures below, these contacts likely occur with the conserved D226 and N244 (positions 30
and 43 in the numbering above the alignment in Fig. 2).
None of the other nucleotides bind with an entropic penalty as seen with ADP-ribose, either, suggesting that the
ribose moiety becomes structured when bound to the
macrodomain.
The energetics of ADP-ribose binding to the SARSCoV protein are similar to those seen with the same protein from SARS-CoV-1,6 MERS-CoV.20 Enthalpy and
entropy of binding were also very similar for all three
protein (Fig. 3D). Unlike what is seen with the macro X
protein from an alpha coronavirus,5 enthalpy appears to
drive ADP-ribose binding to the macro X domains of the
three beta coronaviruses.

Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Macro X Domain— The
SARS-CoV-2 macro X domain (NSP3 residues 207 to
277) crystallized in space group P212121 with 1 molecule
per asymmetric unit. These crystals had a solvent content of 43% and diffracted extremely well. The final resolution limit of the data was set at 0.95 Å (Table 1). The
quality of the electron density maps is correspondingly
excellent (Fig. 4A). The section of the structure depicted
in this image is located on the surface of the protein and
the B-factors of these residues are close to the average
B-factor of the protein (7.2 vs 10.2 Å2), indicating that
this sample accurately represents the overall quality of
the maps. The final model contains the entire sequence
from V207 to S377 of nsp3, an N-terminal glycine residue that was left from the TEV-protease cleavage, and
374 solvent molecules. The Rcryst and Rfree values of the
final model were 0.119 and 0.137, respectively (Table
1).
The tertiary structure, as expected, ranges from nearly
identical to very similar to those of other coronavirus
macro domains, including: SARS CoV-1 (2FAV6; 74.7%
sequence identity) with a root mean square deviation
(RMSD) value for 162 of 172 Cα atoms of 0.6 Å; MERS
CoV (5DUS20; 42.2% identical) with a 1.2 Å RMSD for
161 of 172 Cα atoms; human alpha coronavirus 229E
(3EWR21; 32.5% identical) with a 1.5 Å RMSD for 154
of 172 Cα atoms; feline coronavirus (FCoV; 3JZT22
26.8% identical) with a 1.5 Å RMSD for 153 of 172 Cα
atoms; and the gamma CoV infectious bronchitis virus
(IBV; 3EWP21 26.7% identical) with a 2.1 Å RMSD for
150 of 172 Cα atoms. The regions of high sequence conservation are not clustered in any particular region(s) of
the molecule (Fig. 4B). This makes sense in light of the
fact that the protein atoms involved in hydrogen bonding
interactions with the ligands in these structures are more
often part of the main chain; there are relatively few interactions of side chains with the ligands.
At the time of writing, we discovered that Michalska
et al. of the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious
Diseases (CSGID) deposited coordinates for a very similar construct of the SARS-CoV-2 macro X domain including from E206 to E275 of the nsp3 protein, plus an
additional 4 residues at the N-terminus (6VSX; unpublished). Their crystals also allowed binding of ADPribose (6W02) and AMP (6W6Y), while ours seemed to
be packed too tightly to permit ligands to access the
binding site (data not shown). We compared our ultrahigh-resolution model of the unliganded protein to the
ADP-ribose-bound form. The RMSD values for the fitting, done by secondary structure matching (SSM)23 as
implemented in COOT, is 0.59 Å for 165 of 172 Cα atoms. This is very similar to the RMSD values of the free
protein (6VXS; 0.66 Å) and the AMP-bound form
(6W6Y; 0.50 Å), indicating that there are no large conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding. In
fact, the only notable conformational changes occur in
three surface-exposed loops in or near the ligand-

binding pocket (Fig. 4C). These loops connect strand β2
with helix α2 (the β2-α2 loop), strand β4 with helix α4
(β4-α4 loop), and strand β5 with helix α5 (β5-α5 loop).
The subtle change in conformation of the β4-α4 loop
(purple in Fig. 4C) appears to be the result of crystal
contacts and not the direct influence of ADP-ribose
binding. The other two loops are more intimately involved in ligand binding. The main chain of the α2-β2
loop rotates 180° in order to allow the amide N atom of
G252 to participate in a hydrogen bonding interaction
with the 1’-hydroxyl of the ribose moiety of ADPribose. This loop also carries N244, which directly interacts with the ribose. The phenyl ring of F336 in the β5α5 loop occupies the portion of the binding pocket in the
unliganded structure that is occupied by the β-phosphate
of ADP-ribose. Thus, without a rearrangement of the β5α5 loop, ADP-ribose would not be able to bind.
Conclusion— The significance of the study stems
mainly from the demonstration that the SARS-CoV-2
macro X domain binds ADP ribose. This is the first step
needed to justify screens for potential antivirals that bind
in place of ADP ribose. More work needs to be done,
however, to understand the antiviral potential of such
compounds because the biological role for ADP-ribose
binding is still not fully understood. Some work with
alpha coronaviruses suggest that ADP-ribose binding by
the macro X domain is not needed for viral replication.24
However, studies with other (+)RNA viruses suggest
that macrodomains are essential for virulence.25 This
work is also noteworthy because the synthetic codonoptimized plasmid reported here produces up to 100 mg
of soluble macro X domain protein per liter of E. coli
culture, and this protein retains a high affinity for ADP
ribose. The protein could be used for structural studies
and screening campaigns. Screening assays with the
SARS-CoV-2 protein might actually be more efficient,
since the SARS-CoV-2 protein binds ADP-ribose somewhat more tightly (Kd = 10 µM) than the SARS-CoV-1
protein (Kd = 24 µM). The recombinant protein reported
here, together with the detailed structural information,
might also be useful to others developing SARS-CoV-2
diagnostics and/or therapeutics.

The SARS-CoV-2
macro X domain structure.
FIGURE 4.

(A) The electron den-

sity is shown for a representative portion of the
structure (residues 359361) on the surface of the

o

protein. The 2mF -DF

c map

is contoured at 1.5σ and is
shown as a magenta mesh.

o

The mF -DF

c (difference)

maps are shown at + and –
3.0σ as green and red mesh,
respectively. (B) Ribbon
diagram of the SARS-CoV-2
macro X domain structure
colored according to the
sequence conservation plot
in Fig. 2 as a gradient from
red (low conservation;
<10%) to blue (highly conserved; 100%) through
magenta. As can be seen in
the sequence alignment, the
N- and C-termini are particularly poorly conserved.
(C) Overlay of the structure
of the SARS-CoV-2 macro X
domain bound to ADPribose determined by
Michalska

et al. of the

CGSID (PDB ID 6W02) with
the ultra-high-resolution
structure of the unliganded
protein determined here.
ADP-ribose is shown in
ball-and-stick with the carbon atoms colored gold.
The backbone trace of the
unliganded structure is colored cyan, and that of the
ADP-ribose-bound model is
colored grey. There are three loops with significantly different conformations in the two structures. In the unliganded
structure, the β2-α2 loop is colored bright red, the β4-α4 loop is colored purple, and the β5-α5 loop is colored bright
green.

The same regions of the ADP-ribose-bound structure are colored pale red, pale purple, and pale green, respec-

tively. The transparent blue and yellow spheres represent water molecules bound to the unliganded (transparent
blue) and ADP-ribose-bound (transparent yellow) forms of the protein. Interestingly, several of the water molecules
interacting with ADP-ribose in 6W02 can also be found in the unliganded structure of the protein. The inset shows a
close-up of the boxed region colored according to the same scheme. The β2-α2 and β5-α5 loops, which contact ADPribose, are shown in ball-and-stick. Note that the β2-α2 loop rotates ~180° to allow it to make a hydrogen-bonding
interaction with the 1’-hydroxyl of the ribose moiety. Also, the phenylalanine residue in the β5-α5 loop (F336) would
clash with the β-phosphate and ribose of ADP-ribose if the β5-α5 loop did not adopt a different conformation.
