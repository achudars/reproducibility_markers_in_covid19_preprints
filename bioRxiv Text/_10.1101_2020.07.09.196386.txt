SUMMARY

24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of

25

human infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Accordingly, an effective vaccine is of

26

critical importance in mitigating coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) and curtailing

27

the pandemic. We developed a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based

28

vaccine by introducing a modified form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene in place of the native

29

glycoprotein gene (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2). Immunization of mice with VSV-eGFP-SARS-

30

CoV-2 elicits high titers of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the

31

receptor binding domain that engages human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Upon

32

challenge with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing human ACE2 and immunized

33

with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in the

34

lung indicating protection against pneumonia. Finally, passive transfer of sera from VSV-eGFP-

35

SARS-CoV-2-immunized animals protects naïve mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These data

36

support development of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 as an attenuated, replication-competent

37

vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION

40

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense,

41

single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus, is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019

42

(COVID-19). Since its outbreak in Wuhan, China in December, 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has infected

43

millions of individuals and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Because of its

44

capacity for human-to-human transmission, including from asymptomatic individuals, SARS-

45

CoV-2 has caused a pandemic, leading to significant political, economic, and social disruption

46

(Bai et al., 2020). Currently, social quarantine, physical distancing, and vigilant hand hygiene

47

are the only effective preventative measures against SARS-CoV-2 infections. Thus, effective

48

countermeasures, particularly vaccines, are urgently needed to curtail the virus spread, limit

49

morbidity and mortality, and end the COVID-19 pandemic.

50

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates the receptor-binding and membrane fusion

51

steps of viral entry. The S protein also is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies (Baum et

52

al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020) and can elicit CD4+ and CD8+

53

T cell responses (Grifoni et al., 2020). Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms based on the S

54

protein are being developed, including adenovirus-based vectors, inactivated virus formulations,

55

recombinant subunit vaccines, and DNA- and mRNA-based strategies (Amanat and Krammer,

56

2020; Lurie et al., 2020). While several of these vaccines have entered human clinical trials,

57

efficacy data in animals has been published for only a subset of these candidates (Gao et al.,

58

2020; Yu et al., 2020).

59

We recently reported the generation and characterization of a replication-competent,

60

VSV (designated VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) that expresses a modified form of the SARS-CoV-2

61

spike (Case et al., 2020). We demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies, human sera, and

62

soluble ACE2-Fc potently inhibit VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 infection in a manner nearly identical

63

to a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that chimeric VSV displays the S protein in

64

an antigenic form that resembles native infectious SARS-CoV-2. Because of this data, we

65

hypothesized that a replicating VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 might serve as an alternative platform

66

for vaccine development. Indeed, an analogous replication-competent recombinant VSV

67

vaccine expressing the Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein protects against lethal EBOV challenge

68

in several animal models (Garbutt et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2005), is safe in

69

immunocompromised nonhuman primates (Geisbert et al., 2008), and was approved for clinical

70

use in humans after successful clinical trials (Henao-Restrepo et al., 2017; Henao-Restrepo et

71

al., 2015). Other live-attenuated recombinant VSV-based vaccines are in pre-clinical

72

development for HIV-1, hantaviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses, and influenza viruses (Brown et

73

al., 2011; Furuyama et al., 2020; Garbutt et al., 2004; Geisbert et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005).

74

Here, we determined the immunogenicity and in vivo efficacy of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-

75

2 as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. We demonstrate that

76

a single dose of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 generates a robust neutralizing antibody response

77

that targets both the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) subunit.

78

Upon challenge with infectious SARS-CoV-2, mice immunized with one or two doses of VSV-

79

eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 showed significant decreases in lung and peripheral organ viral loads, pro-

80

inflammatory cytokine responses, and consequent lung disease. VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-

81

mediated protection likely is due in part to antibodies, as passive transfer of immune sera to

82

naïve mice limits infection after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. This study paves the way for further

83

development of a VSV-vectored SARS CoV-2 vaccine.

RESULTS

86

Generation of a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine platform. We previously

87

reported a chimeric, replication-competent VSV expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as

88

an effective platform for measuring neutralizing antibodies (Case et al., 2020). As replication-

89

competent VSVs are in clinical use as vaccines for emerging RNA viruses or in pre-clinical

90

development (Fathi et al., 2019), we tested whether VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 could protect

91

mice against SARS-CoV-2.

92

To examine the immune response to VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2, we immunized four-

93

week-old BALB/c mice with 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 or a

94

control, VSV-eGFP (Fig 1A). As murine ACE2 does not serve as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2,

95

we spiked our preparation of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 with trace amounts of VSV G to permit a

96

single round of infection, an approach used previously for SARS-CoV (Kapadia et al., 2008). At

97

28 days post-priming, one cohort of animals was boosted with the homologous vaccine. Serum

98

was isolated from all animals at three weeks post priming or boosting, and IgG titers against

99

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein or the RBD were determined by ELISA (Fig 1B-C).

100

Immunization with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 induced high levels of anti-S and anti-RBD-specific

101

IgG compared to control VSV-eGFP with reciprocal median serum endpoint titers of 3.2 x 105

102

and 2.7 x 106 (anti-S) and 1.1 x 104 and 1.4 x 104 (anti-RBD) for one and two doses of vaccine,

103

respectively.

104

We measured neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 after priming or boosting

105

using a focus-reduction neutralization test (Case et al., 2020). Immunization with a single or

106

two-dose regimen of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 induced neutralizing antibodies (median titers of

107

1/59 and 1/5206, respectively) whereas the control VSV-eGFP vaccine did not (Fig 1D).

108

Boosting was effective and resulted in a 90-fold increase in neutralizing activity after the second

109

dose of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, these data suggest that VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-

2 is immunogenic and elicits high titers of antibodies that neutralize infection and target the RBD

111

of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

112

VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 protects mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four weeks

113

after priming or priming and boosting, mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019 n-

114

CoV/USA_WA1/2020) after delivery of a replication-defective adenovirus expressing human

115

ACE2 (AdV-hACE2) that enables receptor expression in the lungs (Hassan et al., 2020).

116

Immunized mice were administered 2 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb one day prior to intranasal delivery

117

of AdV-hACE2. We administer anti-Ifnar1 antibody to augment virus infection and create a

118

stringent disease model for vaccine protection. Five days later, mice were inoculated with 3 x

119

105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 via the intranasal route (Fig 1A) and subsequently, we measured viral

120

yield by plaque and RT-qPCR assays. At day 4 post-infection (dpi) infectious virus was not

121

recovered from lungs of mice vaccinated either with one or two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-

122

CoV-2 (Fig 2A). For mice receiving only one dose of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we

123

observed a trend towards decreased levels of viral RNA in the lung, spleen, and heart at 4 dpi

124

and in the lung and spleen at 8 dpi compared to the control VSV-eGFP vaccinated mice (Fig

125

2B-E). Mice that received two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 had significantly lower levels

126

of viral RNA in most tissues examined compared to control VSV-eGFP vaccinated mice (Fig

127

2B-E). Consistent with our viral RNA measurements, we observed less SARS-CoV-2 RNA by in

128

situ hybridization in lung tissues of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 immunized mice at 4 dpi (Fig 2F).

129

Collectively, these data support that immunization with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 protects

130

against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice.

131

VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 limits SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation. Both

132

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 typically cause severe lung infection and injury that is associated

133

with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell infiltrates (Gu and Korteweg,

134

2007; Huang et al., 2020). The AdV-hACE2 transduced mouse model of SARS-CoV-2

135

pathogenesis recapitulates several aspects of lung inflammation and coronavirus disease

136

(Hassan et al., 2020). To assess whether VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 limits virus-induced

137

inflammation, we measured pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNA in lung

138

homogenates from vaccinated animals at 4 dpi by RT-qPCR assays (Fig 3A). Animals

139

immunized with one or two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 had significantly lower levels of

140

pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNA compared to VSV-eGFP vaccinated mice.

141

Specifically, type I and III interferons (IFN-β and IFN-λ) were decreased early during infection in

142

both one-dose and two-dose groups of mice immunized with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2. While

143

there were no detectable differences in IFN-γ or TNF-α levels between groups, IL-6 and IL-1β

144

were lower at 4 dpi after VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Similarly, levels of mRNAs

145

encoding chemokines CXCL1, CXCL10, and CXCL11, which recruit immune cells to the lung,

146

were decreased at 4 dpi in VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 compared to VSV-eGFP immunized mice.

147

To determine the extent of lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2 challenged mice, at 8 dpi, we

148

stained lung sections with hematoxylin and eosin (Fig 3B). Lung sections from VSV-eGFP-

149

immunized mice showed immune cell (including neutrophil) infiltration into perivascular,

150

peribronchial, and alveolar locations consistent with viral pneumonia. Lung sections from mice

151

immunized with one dose of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 also showed some signs of inflammation.

152

However, mice immunized with two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially

153

less accumulation of inflammatory cells at the same time point after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

154

These data suggest that immunization with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 generates a protective

155

immune response, which limits SARS-CoV-2-induced lung disease in mice. In this model, two

156

sequential immunizations show greater efficacy than a single one.

157

Vaccine-induced sera limits SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate the contribution of

158

antibodies in vaccine-mediated protection, we performed passive transfer studies. Serum was

159

collected from VSV-eGFP and VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated mice after one or two

160

immunizations. Ten-week-old female BALB/c mice were administered anti-Ifnar1 mAb and AdV-

161

hACE2 as described above to render animals susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Five days later, 100

162

μL of pooled immune or control sera was administered by intraperitoneal injection. One day

163

later, mice were inoculated with 3 x 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 via the intranasal route (Fig 4A).

164

Passive transfer of sera from animals vaccinated with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 protected

165

against SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to sera from the VSV-eGFP-immunized mice. At 4 dpi,

166

lungs from animals treated with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 immune sera from prime-only and

167

boosted animals showed substantially reduced infectious virus burden (Fig 4B). Although not as

168

striking, significant decreases in viral RNA levels also were observed in the lung and spleen of

169

animals receiving VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 boosted sera compared to the VSV-eGFP sera (Fig

170

4C-D). Possibly, some of the viral RNA in lung tissue homogenates after passive transfer may

171

represent neutralized virus within cells that has not yet been cleared. Viral RNA levels in the

172

heart of animals given sera from VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 boosted mice trended toward, but did

173

not reach, statistical significance (Fig 4E). No effect was observed in the nasal washes of any

174

treated group (Fig 4F), consistent with the results from our vaccinated and challenged animals

175

(Fig 2E).

176

To determine the effect of the passive transfer of sera on SARS-CoV-2-mediated

177

inflammation, we assessed the induction of several cytokines in the lung at 4 dpi (Fig 4G).

178

Treatment with sera from animals immunized with two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 limited

179

induction of some (IFN-β, IFN-λ, and IL-1β) pro-inflammatory cytokines after SARS-CoV-2

180

challenge. Together, these data suggest that antibodies are a major correlate of VSV-eGFP-

181

SARS-CoV-2-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.

DISCUSSION

184

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population has caused a global

185

pandemic, resulting in millions of infected individuals and hundreds of thousands of deaths.

186

Despite initial indications that the pandemic had peaked, reopening of countries and renewed

187

human-to-human contact has resulted in a recent surge in case numbers, suggesting that

188

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be critical for curtailing the pandemic and resuming normal social

189

interactions. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a replication-competent VSV-eGFP-SARS-

190

CoV-2 vaccine. A single dose of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 was sufficient to induce antibodies

191

that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the RBD and S protein, and a second dose

192

substantially boosted this response. We then challenged mice with SARS-CoV-2 via the

193

intranasal route and observed a complete loss of recovery of infectious virus in the lung in

194

animals immunized with either one or two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2. Compared to a

195

single dose, administration of two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 elicited greater protection

196

with further diminished viral loads. Immunization with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 decreased the

197

induction of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines and protected mice from alveolar

198

inflammation, lung consolidation, and viral pneumonia. We also established an important role for

199

protective antibodies, as passive transfer of immune sera from VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2

200

immunized animals decreased viral burden and inflammation in the lung.

201

Recombinant VSV-based vaccines that encode viral glycoproteins have several

202

advantages as a platform. Whereas DNA plasmid and mRNA-based vaccines have not yet been

203

approved in the United States or elsewhere, Merck’s ERVEBO®, a replication-competent VSV

204

expressing the EBOV glycoprotein, is currently in use in humans (Huttner et al., 2015). As a

205

replicating RNA virus, VSV-based vaccines often can be used as single-dose administration and

206

effectively stimulate both humoral and cellular immunity. Recombinant VSV grows efficiently in

207

mammalian cell culture, enabling simple, large-scale production. Advantages of VSV as a

208

vaccine vector also include the lack of homologous recombination and its non-segmented

209

genome structure, which precludes genetic reassortment and enhances its safety profile (Lichty

210

et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 1999). Unlike other virus-based vaccine vectors (Barouch et al.,

211

2004; Casimiro et al., 2003; Santra et al., 2007), there is little preexisting human immunity to

212

VSV as human infections are rare (Roberts et al., 1999) with the exception of some regions of

213

Central America (Cline, 1976) or a limited number of at-risk laboratory workers (Johnson et al.,

214

1966).

215

Several vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 have been tested for immunogenicity. Our

216

VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited high levels of inhibitory antibodies with median and

217

mean serum neutralizing titers of greater than 1/5,000. Two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2

218

induced higher neutralizing titers with more rapid onset than similar dosing of an inactivated

219

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the same strain of mice (Gao et al., 2020). Consistent with these

220

results, serum anti-S endpoint titers were higher from mice immunized with two doses of VSV-

221

eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 (1/2,700,000) than the highest two-dose regimen of the inactivated virion

222

vaccine (1/820,000). Two doses of DNA plasmid vaccines encoding variants of the SARS-CoV-

223

2 S protein induced relatively modest neutralizing antibody responses (serum titer of 1/170) in

224

rhesus macaques. Related to this, anti-S titers were approximately 1,000-fold lower after two

225

doses of the optimal DNA vaccine (Yu et al., 2020) when compared to two doses of VSV-eGFP-

226

SARS-CoV-2. In a pre-print study, a single-dose of a chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine

227

encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, also produced relatively low levels of

228

serum neutralizing antibodies in mice and NHPs (1/40 to 1/80 in BALB/c and CD1 mice and <

229

1/20 in rhesus macaques). This data corresponded with anti-S1 and anti-S2 mean serum titers

230

of between 1/100 and 1/1,000 in BALB/c mice and anti-S titers of < 1/1,000 in NHPs (DOI:

231

10.1101/2020.05.13.093195). Two doses of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored SARS-

232

CoV-2 vaccine in humans also produced relatively low RBD-binding (1/1,445 at day 28 post-

233

boost) and neutralizing antibody (1/34 at day 28 post-boost) (Zhu et al., 2020). Finally, based on

234

pre-print data (DOI: 10.1101/2020.06.11.145920), BALB/c mice immunized with two 1 µg doses

235

of an mRNA vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, elicited serum anti-S endpoint titers of 1/100,000.

236

These mice produced mean neutralizing antibodies titers of approximately 1/1,000 and did not

237

show evidence of infectious virus in the lung or nares after SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

238

Even though VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 is replication-competent and capable of spread, it

239

likely did not do so efficiently in our BALB/c mice because the SARS-CoV-2 spike cannot

240

efficiently utilize murine ACE2 for viral entry (Letko et al., 2020). This likely explains our need for

241

boosting, as the response we observed likely was enabled by the residual small amount of

242

trans-complementing VSV G to pseudotype the virions expressing the S protein in a manner

243

similar to VSV-SARS (Kapadia et al., 2008), which effectively limited vaccine virus replication to

244

a single cycle. We anticipate that in animals expressing ACE2 receptors competent for S

245

binding, a single dose of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 will be associated with greater

246

immunogenicity, and not require a second immunization for protection. To test this hypothesis,

247

immunization and challenge studies are planned in hACE2 transgenic mice (Bao et al., 2020;

248

Jiang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) as they become widely available, and in hamsters and

249

NHPs.

250

Vaccine safety is a key requirement of any platform. Pathogenicity and immunogenicity

251

of VSV is associated with its native glycoprotein G, which, in turn, determines its pan-tropism

252

(Martinez et al., 2003). Replacing the glycoprotein of VSV with a foreign glycoprotein often

253

results in virus attenuation in vivo. Indeed, the vast majority of cases where VSV recombinants

254

express a heterologous viral glycoprotein (e.g., chikungunya virus, H5N1 influenza virus, Lassa

255

virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, or Ebola virus) and were injected via intracranial route

256

into mice or NHPs, no disease was observed (Mire et al., 2012; Muik et al., 2014; van den Pol et

257

al., 2017; Wollmann et al., 2015). One exception is when VSV expressing the glycoproteins of

258

the highly neurotropic Nipah virus was injected via an intracranial route into adult mice (van den

259

Pol et al., 2017). Should substantial reactogenicity or neuronal infection be observed with VSV-

260

eGFP-SARS-CoV-2, the vaccine could be attenuated further by introducing mutations into the

261

matrix protein (Rabinowitz et al., 1981) or methyltransferase (Li et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2014),

262

rearranging the order of genes (Ball et al., 1999; Wertz et al., 1998), or recoding of the L gene

263

(Wang et al., 2015). The presence of the additional eGFP gene inserted between the leader and

264

N genes also attenuates virus replication in cell culture (Whelan et al., 2000). Further

265

development of a VSV vectored vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 likely will require deletion of eGFP

266

from the genome, which may necessitate additional strategies of attenuation.

267

Future studies are planned to evaluate the durability of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 and a

268

variant lacking eGFP in inducing immunity. Other replication-competent VSV-based vaccines

269

such as the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP have been shown to generate long-lasting immune responses

270

and protection (Kennedy et al., 2017). In addition, we plan to investigate in greater detail the

271

contributions of additional arms of immunity in mediating protection. The robust induction of

272

neutralizing antibodies elicited by one and two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 was a

273

correlate of protection, as passive transfer of immune sera reduced viral infection and

274

inflammation in the lung upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Nonetheless, it will be important to

275

determine if additional immune responses, particularly CD8+ T cells, have an important

276

protective role. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were shown to be

277

present in 100% and 70% of COVID-19 convalescent patients, respectively, with many of the T

278

cells recognizing peptides derived from the S protein (Grifoni et al., 2020). Moreover, additional

279

experiments are planned in aged animals (hACE2-expressing mice, hamsters, and NHPs) to

280

address immunogenicity and protection in this key target population at greater risk for severe

281

COVID-19. Overall, our data show that VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 can protect against severe

282

SARS-CoV-2 infection and lung disease, supporting its further development as a vaccine.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

371

Cells. BSRT7/5, Vero CCL81, Vero E6, Vero E6-TMPRSS2 (Case et al., 2020), and

372

Vero-furin (Mukherjee et al., 2016) cells were maintained in humidified incubators at 34 or 37°C

373

and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with glucose, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate,

374

and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

375

Plasmids. The S gene of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank MN908947.3)

376

was cloned into the backbone of the infectious molecular clone of VSV containing eGFP (pVSV-

377

eGFP) as described (Case et al., 2020). pVSV-eGFP was used as previously described, but

378

contains a mutation K535R, the phenotype of which will be described elsewhere. Expression

379

plasmids of VSV N, P, L, and G were previously described (Stanifer et al., 2011; Whelan et al.,

380

1995).

381

Recombinant VSV. VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-eGFP were generated and

382

rescued as described previously (Case et al., 2020; Whelan et al., 1995). Briefly, BSRT7/5 cells

383

(Buchholz et al., 1999) were infected with vaccinia virus encoding the bacteriophage T7 RNA

VSV N, P, L, G, and an antigenome copy of the viral genome under control of the T7 promoter.

386

Rescue supernatants were collected 56 to 72 h post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation (5

387

min at 1,000 x g), and filtered through a 0.22

388

Vero CCL81 cells containing 25 μg/ml of cytosine arabinoside (Sigma-Aldrich) in the agarose

393

Mouse experiments. Animal studies were carried out in accordance with the

394

recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National

395

Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

396

Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (assurance number A3381–01).

397

Virus inoculations were performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with

398

ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

399

At four weeks of age, female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, 000651) were

400

immunized with 106 PFU of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 or VSV-eGFP via the intraperitoneal route.

401

Where indicated, mice were boosted with homologous virus at 4 weeks post-priming. Three

402

weeks post-priming or boosting mice were administered 2 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb (MAR1-5A3

403

(Sheehan et al., 2006), Leinco) via intraperitoneal injection. One day later, mice were

404

administered 2.5 x 108 PFU of mouse codon-optimized AdV-hACE2 (Hassan et al., 2020) via

405

intranasal administration. Five days later, vaccinated mice were challenged with 3 x 105 PFU of

406

SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal administration. Passive transfer experiments were conducted as

407

described above but using ten-week-old female BALB/c mice. Pooled immune sera were

408

administered 24 h prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge. For each immunization (prime or boost),

409

serum from individual mice was collected twice (at days 14 and 22) and pooled.

METHOD DETAILS

412

Gradient purification of recombinant viruses. To generate high titer stocks of VSV-

413

eGFP and VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2, viruses were grown on BSRT7/5 cells at an MOI of 3 or 1,

414

respectively. To generate VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2, BSRT7/5 cells were transfected with

415

pCAGGS-VSV-G in Opt-MEM (Gibco) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and subsequently

416

infected 8 to 12 h later with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 in DMEM containing 2%

417

FBS and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.7. This VSV G decorated VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 was titrated

418

by plaque assay and used for a larger scale infection as described above. Cell supernatants

419

were collected after 48 h and clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 7.5 min. Supernatants

420

were concentrated using a Beckman Optima L-100 XP ultracentrifuge (22,800 RPM x 90 min in

421

a 70Ti fixed-angle rotor). Pellets were resuspended in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM

422

EDTA (NTE) at 4°C overnight, and virus banded on a 15-45% sucrose-NTE gradient (35,000

423

rpm x 3 h in a SW-41Ti swinging-bucket rotor). Virus was extracted by side puncture of tubes,

424

recovered by ultracentrifugation (22,800 RPM x 90 min in a 70Ti fixed-angle rotor) and

425

resuspended in NTE at 4°C overnight. The VSV-eGFP was purified similarly.

426

Measurement of viral burden. Mouse tissues were weighed and homogenized with

427

sterile zirconia beads in a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 1 mL of DMEM

428

media supplemented to contain 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Tissue homogenates were clarified by

429

centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and stored at -80°C. RNA was extracted using MagMax

430

mirVana Total RNA isolation kit (Thermo Scientific) and a Kingfisher Flex extraction machine

431

(Thermo Scientific). Infectious viral titers in lung homogenates were determined by plaque

432

assays on Vero-furin cells. Viral RNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR as described

433

(Hassan et al., 2020) and normalized to tissue weight.

434

Cytokine analysis. Total RNA was isolated from lung homogenates as described above

435

and DNAase treated. cDNA was generated using the HighCapacity cDNA Reverse

IFN-β (Mm.PT.58.30132453.g), and IFNλ-2/3 (Thermo Scientific Mm04204156_gH). All results

443

were normalized to GAPDH (Mm.PT.39a.1) levels and the fold-change for each was determined

444

using the 2-ΔΔCt method comparing SARS-CoV-2 infected mice to naïve controls.

445

Histology and in situ hybridization. Mice were euthanized, and tissues were

446

harvested prior to lung inflation and fixation. The right lung was inflated with approximately 1.2

447

mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin using a 3-mL syringe and catheter inserted into the

448

trachea. To ensure fixation of virus, inflated lungs were kept in a 40-mL suspension of neutral

449

buffered formalin for 7 days before further processing. Tissues were paraffin-embedded and

450

sections were subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RNA in situ hybridization was

451

performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Assay (Brown Kit) according to the manufacturer’s

452

instructions (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and treated with

453

H2O2 and Protease Plus prior to RNA probe hybridization. Probes specifically targeting SARS-

454

CoV-2 S sequence (cat no 848561) were hybridized followed by signal amplification and

455

detection with 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine. Tissues were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin and

456

an uninfected mouse was stained in parallel and used as a negative control. The lung pathology

457

was evaluated, and representative photomicrographs were taken of stained slides under

458

investigator-blinded conditions. Tissue sections were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse

459

microscope equipped with an Olympus DP71 color camera or a Leica DM6B microscope

460

equipped with a Leica DFC7000T camera.

464

were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Plates were

1% BSA + 0.02% sodium azide for 2 h at room temperature (RT). Serum samples were serially

476

diluted (1:3) starting at either 1:100 dilution (day 22 samples) or 1:30 dilution (day 8 post-

477

infection samples) in blocking buffer. Diluted samples were then added to washed plates

478

(50μL/well) and incubated for 1 h at RT. Bound IgG was detected using HRP-conjugated goat

479

anti-mouse IgG (at 1:2000) or bound IgM was detected using biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgM

480

(at 1:10000), followed by streptavidin-HRP (at 1:5000). Following a 1 h incubation, washed

481

plates were developed with 50 µL of 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA, quenched with 2 M sulfuric acid,

482

and the absorbance was read at 450nm.
