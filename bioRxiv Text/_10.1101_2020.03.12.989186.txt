Summary
SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency.1 Based on
our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of
viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA
(Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, using model
polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is
incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and
blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not
incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected
two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as
inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3’fluoro-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3’-azido-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate
forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further
polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we
expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer
guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anticoronavirus agents.

The recent appearance of a new coronaviral infection, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, and its worldwide
spread, has made international headlines. Already more than 3,000 deaths have been ascribed to this virus,
and COVID-19 has reached near pandemic status. The virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory
tracts of patients with pneumonia, sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy.1 The virus, designated
SARS-CoV-2, is a new member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, but is
distinct from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.1 The coronaviruses are single strand RNA viruses, sharing
properties with other single-stranded RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus,
Marburg virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses. In particular, coronaviruses and HCV
are both positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses,3,4 and thus have a similar replication mechanism requiring
a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
The coronavirus life cycle has been described.3 Briefly, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis, is uncoated,
and ORF1a and ORF1b of the positive strand RNA is translated to produce nonstructural protein precursors,
including a cysteine protease and a serine protease; these further cleave the precursors to form mature,
functional helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A replication-transcription complex is then

formed, which is responsible for making more copies of the RNA genome via a negative-sense RNA
intermediate, as well as the structural and other proteins encoded by the viral genome. The viral RNA is
packaged into viral coats in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex, after which exocytosis
results in release of viral particles for subsequent infectious cycles. Potential inhibitors have been designed to
target nearly every stage of this process.3 However, despite decades of research, no effective drug is currently
approved to treat serious coronavirus infections such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
One of the most important druggable targets for coronaviruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp). This polymerase is highly conserved at the protein level among different positive sense RNA
viruses, to which coronaviruses and HCV belong, and shares common structural features in these viruses.5
Like RdRps in other viruses, the coronavirus enzyme is highly error-prone,6 which might increase its ability
to accept modified nucleotide analogues. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogues that inhibit polymerases are
an important group of anti-viral agents.7-10
Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and
activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA
(Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Sofosbuvir is a pyrimidine
nucleotide analogue prodrug with a hydrophobic masked phosphate group enabling it to enter infected
eukaryotic cells, and then converted into its active triphosphate form by cellular enzymes (Fig. 1). In this
activated form, it inhibits the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B.11,12 The activated drug (2’F,Me-UTP) binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporated into RNA, and due to fluoro and
methyl modifications at the 2’ position, inhibits further RNA chain extension, thereby halting RNA
replication and stopping viral growth. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with natural
ribonucleotides. Velpatasvir inhibits NS5A, a key protein required for HCV replication. NS5A enhances the
function of RNA polymerase NS5B during viral RNA synthesis.13,14

There are many other RNA polymerase inhibitors that have been evaluated as antiviral drugs. A related
purine nucleotide prodrug, Remdesivir (Fig. 2b), was developed by Gilead to treat Ebola virus infections,
though not successfully, and is currently in clinical trials for treating COVID-19.15,16 In contrast to Sofosbuvir
(Fig. 2a), both the 2’- and 3’-OH groups in Remdesivir (Fig. 2b) are unmodified, but a cyano group at the 1’
position serves to inhibit the RdRp in the active triphosphate form. In addition to the use of hydrophobic
groups to mask the phosphate in the Protide-based prodrug strategy,17 as with Sofosbuvir and Remdesivir,
there are other classes of nucleoside prodrugs including those based on ester derivatives of the ribose
hydroxyl groups to enhance cellular delivery.18,19

Fig. 2 | Comparison of structures of prodrug viral inhibitors. Top: Prodrug (phosphoramidate) form;
Bottom: Active triphosphorylated form.
The replication cycle of HCV4 is very similar to that of the coronaviruses.3 Analyzing the structure of the
active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (Fig. 2a) compared to that of Remdesivir (Fig. 2b), both of which
have already been shown to inhibit the replication of specific RNA viruses (Sofosbuvir for HCV, Remdesivir
for SARS-CoV-2), we noted in particular that the 2’-modifications in Sofosbuvir (a fluoro and a methyl
group) are substantially smaller than the 1’-cyano group and the 2’-OH group in Remdesivir. The bulky
cyano group in close proximity to the 2’-OH may lead to steric hindrance that will impact the incorporation
efficiency of the activated form of Remdesivir. Interestingly, it was recently reported that, using the MERSCoV polymerase, the triphosphate of Remdesivir was preferentially incorporated relative to ATP in solution
assays.20 Nevertheless, it has been shown that the active triphosphate form of Remdesivir does not cause
complete polymerase reaction termination and actually delays polymerase termination in Ebola virus and
respiratory syncytial virus, likely due to its 1’-cyano group and the free 2’-OH and 3’-OH groups.20,21
Compared to the active form of Sofosbuvir (2’-fluoro-2’-methyl-UTP), two other nucleotide inhibitors with
related structures were reviewed: 2’-fluoro-UTP is incorporated by polymerase, but RNA synthesis may
continue past the incorporated nucleotide analogue;22 2’-C-methyl-UTP has been shown to terminate the
reaction catalyzed by HCV RdRp,22 but proofreading mechanisms can revert this inhibition in mitochondrial
DNA-dependent RNA polymerases.23 Additionally, HCV develops resistance to 2’-C-methyl-UTP due to
mutations of the RdRp.24 A computational study published in 201725 considered the ability of various antiHCV drugs to dock in the active site of SARS and MERS coronavirus RdRps as potential inhibitors.
Recently, Elfiky used a computational approach to predict that Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and
Remidisvir might be potent drugs against COVID-19.26

Thus, based on our analysis of the biological pathways of hepatitis C and coronaviruses, the molecular
structures and activities of viral inhibitors, model polymerase and SARS-CoV RdRp extension experiments
described below, and the efficacy of Sofosbuvir in inhibiting the HCV RdRp, we expect that Sofosbuvir or
its modified forms should also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.2
The active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (2’-F,Me-UTP) was shown to be incorporated by HCV RdRp and
prevent any further incorporation by this polymerase.22,27 Other viral polymerases have also been shown to
incorporate active forms of various anti-viral prodrugs to inhibit replication.28 Since, at the time of the
preparation of this manuscript, we did not have access to the RdRp from SARS-CoV-2, we first selected two
groups of polymerases to test the termination efficiency of the active form of Sofosbuvir, one group with
high fidelity behavior with regard to incorporation of modified nucleotide analogues, which one would
expect for host cell polymerases, the other group with low fidelity mimicking viral polymerases, as well as
the RdRp from SARS-CoV, the virus causing the 2003 and subsequent outbreaks of SARS. Our rationale is
that the low fidelity viral-like enzymes would incorporate 2’-F,Me-UTP and stop further replication, while
the high fidelity polymerases, typical of host cell polymerases, would not. Experimental proof for
termination of the SARS-CoV polymerase catalyzed RNA replication would provide further support for this
rationale, indicating that Sofosbuvir or its modified forms will inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
We first carried out DNA polymerase extension reactions with the active form of Sofosbuvir (2’-F,Me-UTP)
using Thermo Sequenase as an example of high fidelity, host-like polymerases, and two mutated DNA
polymerases which are known to be more promiscuous in their ability to incorporate modified nucleotides,
Therminator II and Therminator IX, as examples of viral-like low fidelity enzymes. A DNA template-primer
complex, in which the next two available bases were A (Fig. 3), was incubated with either 2’-F,Me-UTP
(structure shown in Fig. 2a), or dTTP as a positive control, in the appropriate polymerase buffer. If the 2’F,Me-UTP is incorporated and inhibits further incorporation, a single-base primer extension product will be
produced. By contrast, dTTP incorporation will result in primer extension by 2 bases. After performing the
reactions, we determined the molecular weight of the extension products using MALDI-TOF-mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).
As seen in Figs. 3a and 3b, when the primer-template complex (sequences shown at top of Fig. 3) and 2’F,Me-UTP were incubated with the low fidelity 9oN polymerase mutants,29-31 Therminator II (T2) and
Therminator IX (T9), we observed single product peaks with molecular weights of 5492 Da and 5488 Da,
indicating single base extension in the polymerase reaction. Thus 2’-F,Me-UTP was able to be incorporated
and block further nucleotide incorporation. In contrast, when the extension reactions were carried out with
high-fidelity Thermo Sequenase DNA polymerase (TS),32 there was no incorporation, as evidenced by a
single primer peak at 5172 Da (Fig. 3c). This supports our rationale that Thermo Sequenase, a high fidelity
enzyme originally designed for accurate Sanger sequencing, will not incorporate 2’-F,Me-UTP, while a lowfidelity polymerase, such as T2 and T9, will incorporate 2’-F,Me-UTP and stop further nucleotide
incorporation. When dTTP was used as a positive control with these three enzymes, incorporation continued
past the first A in the template, resulting in a higher molecular weight peak.

Fig. 3 | Incorporation of 2’-F,Me-UTP by two low-fidelity polymerases as terminators but not by a
high-fidelity polymerase. The sequence of the primer and template used for these extension reactions is
shown at the top of the figure. Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating the primer and
template with 2’-F,Me-UTP and the appropriate reaction buffer for the specific enzyme, followed by
detection of the reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectra for Therminator II (T2) in (a) and
for Therminator IX (T9) in (b) indicates single-base incorporation and termination, while the MS spectrum
for Thermo Sequenase (TS) in (c) indicates no incorporation, showing only a primer peak. The accuracy for
m/z determination is ± 10 Da.
These results demonstrate that lower fidelity polymerases will have a high likelihood of incorporating 2’F,Me-UTP and inhibit viral RNA replication, whereas high fidelity enzymes, more typical of the host DNA
and RNA polymerases, will have a low likelihood of being inhibited by 2’-F,Me-UTP. Anti-viral drug design
based on this principle may lead to potent viral polymerase inhibitors with fewer side effects. To provide
further proof that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp might be inhibited by 2’-F,Me-UTP, we next tested the ability of this
molecule to be incorporated into an RNA primer to terminate the reaction catalyzed by the RdRp from
SARS-CoV, using an RNA template. As shown in Fig. 4a, the active triphosphate form of the drug not only
was incorporated by the RdRp, but prevented further incorporation, behaving as a terminator in the
polymerase reaction.
Based on our similar insight related to their molecular structures and previous antiviral activity studies, in
comparison with Sofosbuvir, we selected the triphosphate forms of Alovudine (3’-deoxy-3’-fluorothymidine)
and azidothymidine (AZT, the first FDA approved drug for HIV/AIDS) for evaluation as inhibitors of the
SARS-CoV RdRp. These two molecules share a similar backbone structure (base and ribose) to Sofosbuvir,
but have fewer modification sites and less steric hindrance. Furthermore, because these modifications on
Alovudine and AZT are on the 3’ carbon in place of the OH group, they directly prevent further
incorporation of nucleotides leading to permanent termination of RNA synthesis and replication of the virus.

Alovudine is one of the most potent inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and HIV-1 replication. This
promising drug was discontinued after a Phase II trial due to its hematological toxicity.33 However,
subsequent in vitro studies showed Alovudine was very effective at suppressing several
nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant HIV-1 mutants.34 New clinical studies
were then carried out in which low doses of Alovudine were given as supplements to patients showing
evidence of infection by NRTI resistant HIV strains and not responding well to their current drug regimen. A
4-week course of 2 mg/day Alovudine reduced viral load significantly, and was relatively well tolerated with
no unexpected adverse events.35
AZT is another antiretroviral medication which has long been used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS.36-38 Upon
entry into the infected cells, similar to Alovudine, cellular enzymes convert AZT into the effective 5'triphosphate form (3’-N3-dTTP, structure shown in Fig. 2d), which competes with dTTP for incorporation
into DNA by HIV-reverse transcriptase resulting in termination of HIV's DNA synthesis.39 Since the side
effects and toxicity of AZT are well understood, novel methodologies have been directed at enhancing AZT
plasma levels and its bioavailability in all human organs in order to improve its therapeutic efficacy. Among
these possibilities, an AZT prodrug strategy was proposed.40
We thus assessed the ability of 3’-N3-dTTP and 3’-F-dTTP, the active triphosphate forms of AZT and
Alovudine, along with 2’-F,Me-UTP, to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp into an RNA primer and
terminate the polymerase reaction.
The RdRp of SARS-CoV, referred to as nsp12, and its two protein cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8, shown to be
required for the processive polymerase activity of nsp12, were cloned and purified as described.41,42 These
three viral gene products have high homology (e.g., 96% identity and 98% similarity for nsp12, with similar
homology levels at the amino acid level for nsp7 and nsp8) to the equivalent gene products from SARSCoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. A detailed description of the homologies of nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12
is included in Extended Data Fig. 1 which highlights key functional motifs in nsp12 described by
Kirchdoerfer and Ward.42 Of these, Motifs A, B, E, F and G are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at
the amino acid level, and Motifs C and D display only conservative substitutions.
We performed polymerase extension assays with 2’-F,Me-UTP, 3’-F-dTTP, 3’-N3-dTTP or UTP following
the addition of an pre-annealed RNA template and primer to a pre-assembled mixture of the RdRp (nsp12)
and two cofactor proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). The extended primer products from the reaction were subjected to
MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. The RNA template and primer, corresponding to the N1 epitope region of the N
protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, were used for the polymerase assay, and their sequences are indicated at
the top of Fig. 4. Because there are two As in a row in the next available positions of the template for RNA
polymerase extension downstream of the priming site, if the 2’-F,Me-UTP, 3’-F-dTTP or 3’-N3-dTTP are
incorporated by the viral RdRp, a single nucleotide analogue will be added to the 3’-end of the primer strand.
If they are indeed inhibitors of the polymerase, the extension should stop after this incorporation; further 3’extension should be prevented. In the case of the UTP control reaction, two UTP’s should be incorporated.
As shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2, this is exactly what we observed. In the MALDI-TOF MS
trace in Fig. 4a, a peak indicative of the molecular weight of a one-base 2’-F,Me-UTP analogue primer
extension product was obtained (7217 Da observed, 7214 Da expected). Similarly, in the trace in Fig. 4b, a
single extension peak indicative of a single-base extension by 3’-F-dTTP is revealed (7203 Da observed,
7198 Da expected), with no further incorporation. And in the trace in Fig. 4c, a single extension peak
indicative of a single-base extension by 3’-N3-dTTP is seen (7227 Da observed, 7218 Da expected), with no

evidence of further incorporation. As a positive control, extension by 2 UTPs occurred (7506 Da observed,
7504 Da expected) in the MALDI-TOF MS trace in Extended Data Fig. 2.
In summary, these results demonstrate that the nucleotide analogues 2’-F,Me-UTP, 3’-F-dTTP and 3’-N3dTTP, are permanent terminators for the SARS-CoV RdRp. Their prodrug versions (Sofosbuvir, 3’-F-5’-Ophosphoramidate dT nucleoside and 3’-N3-5’-O-phosphoramidate dT nucleoside) can be readily synthesized
using the ProTide prodrug approach, as shown in Fig. 2a, c and d, and can be developed as therapeutics for
both SARS and COVID-19.

Fig. 4 | Incorporation of 2’-F,Me-UTP, 3’-F-dTTP and 3’-N3-dTTP by SARS-CoV RdRp to terminate
the polymerase reaction. The sequence of the primer and template used for these extension reactions, which
are within the N1 coding sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, is shown at the top of the figure.
Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating (a) 2’-F,Me-UTP, (b) 3’-F-dTTP, and (c) 3’N3-dTTP with pre-assembled SARS-CoV polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template
and primer, and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF
MS. The detailed procedure is shown in the Methods section. For comparison, data for extension with UTP
are presented in Extended Data Fig. 2. The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.
One factor that has confounded the development of RdRp inhibitors in coronaviruses is the presence of a 3’exonuclease-based proofreading activity such as that associated with nsp14, a key component of the
replication-transcription complex in SARS-CoV,43,44 and also encoded in SARS-CoV-2. This exonuclease
activity can be overcome with the use of 2’-O-methylated nucleotides.43 Importantly, since both Sofosbuvir

and AZT are FDA approved drugs, where toxicity tests have already been performed, they can be evaluated
quickly in laboratory and clinical settings.
We have recently described2 a strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining
the ProTide Prodrug approach17 used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3’-blocking groups
that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as terminators for DNA sequencing by
synthesis.29,30,45 We reasoned that (i) the hydrophobic phosphate masking groups will allow entry of the
compounds into the virus-infected cells, (ii) the 3’-blocking group on the 3’-OH with either free 2’-OH or
modifications at the 2’ position will encourage incorporation of the activated triphosphate analogue by viral
polymerases but not host cell polymerases, thus reducing any side effects, and (iii) once incorporated, further
extension will be prevented by virtue of the 3’-blocking group, thereby completely inhibiting viral replication
and potentially overcoming the development of resistance due to the accumulation of new mutations in the
RdRp.46
Our design criterion is to identify groups for attachment to the 3’-OH with appropriate structural and
chemical properties (e.g., size, shape, rigidity, flexibility, polarity, reactivity [e.g., stability to cellular
enzymes]),47,48 along with appropriate 2’-substitutions, so that they will be incorporated by the viral RdRp,
while minimizing incorporation by the host polymerases. We previously used this chemical and structural
principle to select a variety of chemical moieties that block the 3’-OH of the nucleotide analogues as
polymerase terminators.31,49,50
In conclusion, we demonstrated the capability of more tolerant DNA polymerases, as well as SARS CoV
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is nearly identical to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp responsible for
COVID-19, to incorporate 2’-F,Me-UTP, the active form of Sofosbuvir, where it serves to terminate the
polymerase reaction. We also showed two other nucleotide triphosphates, 3’-F-dTTP, the active form of
Alovudine, and 3’-N3-dTTP, the active form of AZT, can also be incorporated and terminate further
nucleotide extension by the RdRp in the polymerase reaction, potentially preventing further replication of the
virus. Prodrug versions of these compounds and their derivatives therefore can be developed as potent broadspectrum therapeutics for coronavirus infectious diseases, including SARS, MERS and COVID-19.

EXTENDED DATA
Methods:
Extension reactions with DNA polymerases: Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA
Technologies (IDT Inc.). The 20 µl extension reactions consisted of 3 µM DNA template and 5 µM DNA
primer (sequences shown in Fig. 3), 10 µM 2’-F,Me-UTP (Sierra Bioresearch) or 10 µM dTTP, 1X Thermo
Sequenase buffer or 1x ThermoPol buffer (for Therminator enzymes), and either 10 U Thermo Sequenase (GE
Healthcare), 4 U Therminator II or 10 U Therminator IX (New England Biolabs). The 1x Thermo Sequenase
buffer consists of 26 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5 and 6.5 mM MgCl2. The 1x ThermoPol buffer contains 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Incubations were
performed in a thermal cycler using 15 cycles of 30 sec each at 65oC, 45oC and 65oC. Following desalting using
an Oligo Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research), the samples were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker
ultrafleXtreme) analysis, following a previously described method.29
Extension reactions with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: Oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT, Inc.
Following a published strategy,41,42 the primer and template (sequences shown in Fig. 4) were annealed by
heating to 70°C for 10 min and cooling to room temperature in 1x reaction buffer. The RNA polymerase
mixture consisting of 2 µM nsp12 and 6 µM each of cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 was incubated for 15 min at room
temperature in a 1:3:3 ratio in 1x reaction buffer. Then 5 µl of the annealed template primer solution containing
2 µM template and 1.7 µM primer in 1x reaction buffer was added to 10 µl of the RNA polymerase mixture
and incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Finally 5 µl of a solution containing either 2 mM
2’-F,Me-UTP, 2 mM 3’-F-dTTP or 2 mM UTP in 1x reaction buffer was added, and incubation was carried
out for 2 hr at 30°C. The final concentrations of reagents in the 20 µl extension reactions were 1 µM nsp12, 3
µM nsp7, 3 µM nsp8, 425 nM RNA primer, 500 nM RNA template, either 500 µM 2’-F,Me-UTP (Sierra
Bioresearch), 500 µM 3’-F-dTTP (Amersham Life Sciences), or 500 µM 3’-N3-dTTP (Amersham Life
Sciences), and 1x reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM βmercaptoethanol). [In the experiment with UTP shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, the final concentrations were
500 nM nsp12, 1.5 µM nsp7, 1.5 µM nsp8, 425 nM RNA primer, 250 nM RNA template and 500 µM UTP
(Fisher) and the reaction time was 1 h at 30°C.] Following desalting using an Oligo Clean & Concentrator
(Zymo Research), the samples were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker ultrafleXtreme) analysis.

Extended Data Fig. 1 | Protein sequence alignments for nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12: SARS-CoV vs SARSCoV-2. Protein sequences are from NCBI Protein Database, accession ID’s as indicated. Sequences were
aligned with blastp.51 Consensus is shown in blue between the query and subject sequences; positions of amino
acid substitutions are in red; + indicates conservative amino acid substitutions involving amino acids with close
physico-chemical properties. (A) nsp7; (B) nsp8; (C) nsp12: functional motifs42 are shown as colored bars
underneath the aligned sequences. Comparison of the polymerase complex components (nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12
proteins) shows that these proteins are very similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. There are no indels in
any of the three protein pairs. There is only one amino acid substitution in nsp7 (99% sequence identity); nsp8
has 5 amino acid changes (97% sequence identity), out of which 3 are between amino acids with similar
properties. Alignment of the nsp12 pair shows that 898 out of 932 amino acids (96%) are identical between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the substitutions are between amino acids with similar physicochemical properties, therefore the level of similarity is higher, at 98%. Most of the amino acid substitutions
(24 out of 34) are located within the N-terminal portion of the nsp12 protein. This region corresponds to the
NiRAN domain (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase; approximately amino acids 1 through 250)

through 400), the first 15 amino acid positions have multiple substitutions, but the rest of the interface domain
is quite conservative. The region beyond the interface domain, corresponding to the nsp12 C-terminus, contains
polymerase functional domains. These domains constitute the canonical fingers, palm, and thumb of the
polymerase enzyme and contain several motifs that are conservative among coronaviruses (Motifs A through
F). Out of the 34 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, only three
substitutions are located within these motifs, and all three are between similar amino acids.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Incorporation of UTP by SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The
sequence of the primer and template used for this extension reaction is shown at the top of the figure.
Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating UTP with pre-assembled SARS-CoV
polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer, and the appropriate reaction
buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The detailed procedure is shown in
the methods. The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.
