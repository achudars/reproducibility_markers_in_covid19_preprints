Abstract

18

Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated poxvirus vector that is widely used to

19

develop vaccines for infectious diseases and cancer. We developed a novel vaccine platform

20

based on a unique three-plasmid system to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors from

21

chemically synthesized DNA. In response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS

22

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used this novel vaccine platform to rapidly produce fully

23

synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens,

24

two immunodominant antigens implicated in protective immunity. Mice immunized with these

25

sMVA vectors developed robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune

26

responses, including potent neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential of a

27

novel vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors

28

and to rapidly develop a multi-antigenic poxvirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.

Introduction

30

Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated poxvirus vector that is widely used to

31

develop vaccine approaches for infectious diseases and cancer (1-3). As a result of the

32

attenuation process through 570 virus passages on chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF), MVA has

33

acquired multiple major and minor genome alterations (4, 5), leading to severely restricted host

34

cell tropism (6). MVA can efficiently propagate on CEF and a baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell

35

line, while in most mammalian cells, including human cells, MVA replication is limited due to a

36

late block in virus assembly (3, 6). Its excellent safety and immunogenicity profile in addition to

37

its versatile expression system and large capacity to incorporate heterologous DNA make MVA

38

an ideal vector for recombinant vaccine development (1, 7). We developed MVA vaccines for

39

animal models of cytomegalovirus-associated disease in pregnant women while demonstrating

40

vaccine efficacy in several clinical trials in solid tumor and stem cell transplant patients (8-13).

41

Since the outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-

42

2) in December 2019 (14, 15), the virus has spread to more than 200 countries worldwide,

43

causing a pandemic of global magnitude with over 400,000 deaths. Many vaccine candidates

44

are currently under rapid development to control this global pandemic (16-18), some of which

45

have entered into clinical trials with unprecedented pace (17, 19). Most of these approaches

46

employ antigenic forms of the Spike (S) protein as it is considered the primary target of

47

protective immunity (16, 20-22). The S protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into a host cell

48

through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE) and is the major target of

49

neutralizing antibodies (NAb) (23-25). Studies in rhesus macaques show that vaccine strategies

50

based on the S antigen can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in this relevant animal

51

model (18), indicating that the S antigen may be sufficient as a vaccine immunogen to elicit

52

SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity. However, a recent study demonstrated that even patients

53

without measurable NAb can recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that protection

54

against SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by both humoral and cellular immunity to multiple

55

immunodominant antigens, including S and nucleocapsid (N) antigens (20, 26).

56

We developed a novel vaccine platform based on a uniquely designed three-plasmid system to

57

efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors from chemically synthesized DNA. In response to

58

the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, we used this novel vaccine platform to

59

rapidly produce synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing full-length S and N antigens. We

60

demonstrate that these sMVA vectors stimulate robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral

61

and cellular immunity in mice, including potent NAb. These results emphasize the value of a

62

novel vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA to efficiently produce recombinant poxvirus

63

vectors and warrant further pre-clinical and clinical testing of a multi-antigenic sMVA vaccine

64

candidate to control the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its devastating consequences.

Results

67

Construction of sMVA

68

To develop the three-plasmid system of the sMVA vaccine platform, we designed three unique

69

synthetic sub-genomic MVA fragments (sMVA F1-F3) based on the MVA genome sequence

70

published by Antoine et al. (4), which is ~178 kbp in length and contains ~9.6 kbp inverted

71

terminal repeats (ITRs) (Figure 1A). The three fragments were designed as follows: sMVA F1

72

comprises ~60 kbp of the left part of the MVA genome, including the left ITR sequences; sMVA

73

F2 contains ~60 kbp of the central part of the MVA genome; and sMVA F3 contains ~60 kbp of

74

the right part of the MVA genome, including the right ITR sequences (Figure 1B). sMVA F1 and

75

F2 as well as sMVA F2 and F3 were designed to share ~3kb overlapping homologous

76

sequences to promote recombination of the three sMVA fragments (Figure 1B). In addition, a

77

duplex copy of the 165-nucleotide long MVA terminal hairpin loop (HL) flanked by concatemeric

78

resolution (CR) sequences was added to both ends of each of the three sMVA fragments

79

(Figure 1C). Such CR/HL/CR sequence arrangements are formed at the genomic junctions in

80

poxvirus DNA replication intermediates and are essential for genome resolution and packaging

81

(27-31). When circular DNA plasmids containing these CR/HL/CR sequence arrangements are

82

transfected

83

minichromosomes with intact terminal HL sequences (28, 29, 32). Based on these findings, we

84

hypothesized that the three sMVA fragments designed as shown in Figure 1B-C, when co-

85

transfected as circular DNA plasmids into helper virus-infected cells, resolve into linear

86

minichromosomes, recombine with each other via the shared homologous sequences, and are

87

ultimately packaged as full-length genomes into sMVA virus particles. All three sMVA fragments

88

were cloned in E. coli as bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones.

89

Using a previously employed procedure to rescue MVA from a BAC (8, 9, 33), sMVA virus was

90

reconstituted with Fowl pox (FPV) as a helper virus upon co-transfection of the three DNA

91

plasmids into BHK cells (Figure 1D), which are non-permissive for FPV(34). Two different FPV

92

strains (HP1.441 and TROVAC) (35, 36) were used to promote sMVA virus reconstitution

93

(Figure 2A). Ultra-purified sMVA virus was produced following virus propagation in CEF, which

94

are commonly used for MVA vaccine production. The virus titers achieved with reconstituted

95

sMVA virus were similar to virus titers achieved with “wild-type” MVA (wtMVA) (Table S1).

96

In vitro characterization of sMVA

97

To characterize the viral DNA of sMVA, DNA extracts from sMVA and wtMVA-infected CEF

98

were compared for several MVA genome positions by PCR. Similar PCR results were obtained

99

with sMVA and wtMVA for all evaluated genome positions (Figure 1E), including the F1/F2 and

100

F2/F3 recombination sites, indicating efficient recombination of the three sMVA fragments.

101

Additional PCR analysis indicated the absence of any BAC vector sequences in sMVA viral

102

DNA (Figure 1E), suggesting spontaneous and efficient removal of bacterial vector elements

103

upon sMVA virus reconstitution. Comparison of viral DNA from ultra-purified sMVA and wtMVA

104

virus by restriction enzyme digestion revealed similar genome pattern between sMVA and

105

wtMVA (Figure 1F). Sequencing analysis of the sMVA viral DNA confirmed the MVA genome

106

sequence at several positions, including the F1/F2 and F2/F3 recombination sites. Furthermore,

107

whole genome sequencing analysis of one of the sMVA virus isolates reconstituted with FPV

108

TROVAC confirmed the assembly of the reference MVA genome sequence and absence of

109

vector-specific sequences in viral DNA originating from reconstituted sMVA virus.

110

To characterize the replication properties of sMVA, growth kinetics of sMVA and wtMVA were

111

compared on BHK and CEF cells, two cell types known to support productive MVA replication

112

(6). This analysis revealed similar growth kinetics of sMVA and wtMVA on both BHK and CEF

113

cells (Figure 2B). In addition, similar areas of viral foci were determined in BHK and CEF cell

114

monolayers infected with sMVA or wtMVA (Figure 2C), suggesting similar capacity of sMVA and

115

wtMVA to spread in MVA permissive cells. Compared to the productive replication of sMVA and

116

wtMVA in BHK and CEF cells (6), only limited virus production was observed with sMVA or

117

wtMVA following infection of various human cell lines (Figure 2D). These results are consistent

118

with the severely restricted replication properties of MVA and show that the sMVA virus can

119

efficiently propagate in BHK and CEF cells, while it is unable to propagate in human cells.

120

In vivo immunogenicity of sMVA

121

To characterize sMVA in vivo, the immunogenicity of sMVA and wtMVA was compared in

122

C57BL/6 mice following two immunizations at high or low dose. MVA-specific binding antibodies

123

stimulated by sMVA and wtMVA after the first and second immunization were comparable

124

(Figures 3A, S1A). While the antibody levels in the high dose vaccine groups exceeded those of

125

the low dose vaccine groups after the first immunization, similar antibody levels in the high and

126

low dose vaccine groups were observed after the second immunization. In addition, no

127

significant differences were detected in the levels of MVA-specific NAb responses induced by

128

sMVA and wtMVA after the second immunization (Figures 3B, S1B). MVA-specific T cell

129

responses determined after the booster immunization by ex vivo antigen stimulation using

130

immunodominant peptides (37) revealed similar MVA-specific T cell levels in mice receiving

131

sMVA or wtMVA (Figures 3C-D and S1C-D). These results indicate that the sMVA virus has a

132

similar capacity to wtMVA in inducing MVA-specific humoral and cellular immunity in mice.

133

Construction of sMVA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine vectors

134

Using highly efficient BAC recombination techniques in E. coli, full-length SARS-CoV-2 S and N

135

antigen sequences were inserted into commonly used MVA insertions sites located at different

136

positions within the three sMVA fragments. Combinations of modified and unmodified sMVA

137

fragments were subsequently co-transfected into FPV-infected BHK cells to reconstitute sMVA

138

SARS-CoV-2 (sMVA-CoV2) vectors expressing the S and N antigen sequences alone or

139

combined (Figure 4A and 4B). In the single recombinant vectors encoding S or N alone, termed

140

sMVA-S and sMVA-N, the antigen sequences were inserted into the Deletion (Del3) site

141

(Figures 1B and 4B) (5). In the double recombinant vectors encoding both S and N, termed

142

sMVA-N/S and sMVA-S/N, the antigen sequences were inserted into Del3 and the Deletion 2

143

(Del2) site (sMVA-N/S), or they were inserted into Del3 and the intergenic region between 069R

144

and 070L (IGR69/70) (sMVA-S/N) (Figures 1B and 4B) (5, 38). All antigen sequences were

145

inserted into sMVA together with mH5 promoter to promote antigen expression during early and

146

late phase of MVA replication (39, 40). sMVA-CoV-2 vaccine vectors were reconstituted with

147

FPV HP1.441 or TROVAC. Ultra-purified virus of the sMVA-CoV2 vectors produced using CEF

148

reached titers that were similar to those achieved with sMVA or wtMVA (Table S1).

149

In vitro characterization of sMVA-CoV2 vaccine vectors

150

To characterize S and N antigen expression by the sMVA-CoV2 vectors, BHK cells infected with

151

the sMVA-CoV2 vectors were evaluated by Immunoblot using S and N-specific antibodies. This

152

analysis confirmed the expression of the S or N antigen alone by the single recombinant

153

vaccine vectors sMVA-S and sMVA-N, while the expression of both the S and the N antigen

154

was confirmed for the double recombinant vectors sMVA-N/S and sMVA-S/N (Figure 4C).

155

Further characterization of the antigen expression by the sMVA-CoV2 vectors in HeLa cells

156

using cell surface and intracellular flow cytometry (FC) staining confirmed single and dual S and

157

N antigen expression by the single and double recombinant vaccine vectors. Staining with S-

158

specific antibodies revealed abundant cell surface and intracellular antigen expression by all

159

vectors encoding the S antigen (sMVA-S, sMVA-N/S, sMVA-S/N) (Figure 4D). In contrast,

160

staining with anti-N antibody revealed predominantly intracellular antigen expression by all

161

vectors encoding the N antigen (sMVA-N, sMVA-N/S, sMVA-S/N) (Figure 4D), although cell

162

surface staining was observed to a minor extent. S and N antigen expression by the sMVA-

163

CoV2 vectors was also investigated by immunofluorescence. This analysis confirmed co-

164

expression of the S and N antigens by the double recombinant vaccine vectors and indicated

165

efficient cell surface and intracellular expression of the S antigen, whereas the expression of the

166

N antigen was predominantly observed intracellular (Figure S2A-C). These results demonstrate

167

efficient antigen expression by the single and double recombinant sMVA-CoV2 vectors.

168

In vivo immunogenicity of sMVA-CoV2 vectors

169

To determine the immunogenicity of the sMVA-vectored S and N antigens alone or combined,

170

SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in Balb/c mice by

171

two immunizations with the single or double recombinant vaccine vectors. High-titer antigen-

172

specific binding antibodies were detected in all vaccine groups after the first immunization, and

173

an increase in these responses was observed after the booster immunization (Figure 5A-B and

174

S3A-B). While the single recombinant vectors induced binding antibodies only against the S or

175

N antigen, the double recombinant vectors induced binding antibodies against both the S and N

176

antigens. In addition, all sMVA-CoV2 vectors encoding the S antigen (sMVA-S, sMVA-S/N,

177

sMVA-N/S) stimulated high-titer binding antibodies against the S receptor binding domain

178

(RBD), which is considered the primary target of NAb(22, 24). Antigen-specific binding antibody

179

titers between the single and double recombinant vaccine groups were comparable. Notably,

180

SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific binding antibody responses stimulated by the sMVA-CoV2

181

vaccine vectors in mice exceeded SARS-CoV-2 S-, RBD-, and N-specific binding antibody

182

responses measured in human convalescent immune sera (Figures 5A-B, and Figure S4).

183

Similar binding antibody responses to those induced by sMVA-CoV2 vectors in Balb/c mice

184

were elicited by the vaccine vectors in C57BL/6 mice (Figure S5). Analysis of the IgG2a/IgG1

185

isotype ratio of the binding antibodies revealed Th-1-biased immune responses skewed toward

186

IgG2a independently of the investigated vaccine group or antigen (Figure 5C and S3C).

187

Potent SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb responses as assayed using pseudovirus were detected after

188

the first immunization in all vaccine groups receiving the vectors encoding the S antigen (sMVA-

189

S, sMVA-S/N, sMVA-N/S), and these NAb responses increased after the booster immunization

190

(Figure 5D-E and S3D-E). Similar potent NAb responses as measured using pseudovirus were

191

also observed in the vaccine groups using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figure 5F-G and S3F-

192

G). We also evaluated the immune sera for potential antibody-dependent enhancement of

193

infection (ADE) using THP-1 monocytes. These cells do not express the ACE2 receptor, but

194

express Fcγ receptor II, which is considered the predominant mediator of ADE in SARS-CoV

195

infection (41). THP-1 monocyte infection by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was not promoted by the

196

immune sera of any of the vaccine groups even at sub-neutralizing antibody concentrations

197

(Figure S6), suggesting absence of Fc-mediated ADE by the vaccine-antibodies responses.

198

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells evaluated after the second immunization by ex vivo antigen

199

stimulation revealed both S- and N-specific T cell responses in the vaccine groups receiving the

200

double recombinant vectors sMVA-S/N and sMVA-N/S. In contrast, mice receiving the single

201

recombinant vectors sMVA-N or sMVA-S developed T cell responses only against either the N

202

or S antigen (Figure 6A-D, Figures S7-8). High levels of cytokine-secreting (IFNγ, TNFα and IL-

203

4) S-specific CD8+ T cells were measured in all vaccine groups immunized with the S-encoding

204

sMVA-CoV2 vectors (Figure 6A). S-specific CD4+ T-cells mostly produced Th1 cytokines (IFNγ

205

and TNFα), while production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) did not increase following antigen

206

stimulation (Figure 6C, S8), indicating a Th1-biased response. While activated N-specific CD8+

207

T cells were not detected at significant frequency (Figure 6B), N-specific IFNγ and to some

208

degree TNFα-secreting CD4+ T cells were measured in all animals vaccinated with the single

209

and double recombinant vectors encoding N (Figure 6D and S8). No significant differences were

210

observed in the T cell levels of the single and double recombinant vaccine groups.

211

Stimulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses by both the S and N antigen was also

212

evaluated in mice by co-immunization using the single recombinant vectors sMVA-S and sMVA-

213

N at different doses. This study revealed similar SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and

214

cellular immune responses in vaccine groups receiving sMVA-S and sMVA-N alone or in

215

combination (Figure S9-10). Altogether these results indicate that the sMVA-vectored S and N

216

antigens when expressed alone or combined using a single vector or two separate vectors can

217

stimulate potent SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.

Discussion

220

We developed a novel vaccine platform based on a fully synthetic form of the highly attenuated

221

and widely used MVA vector. In response to the ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we

222

used this novel vaccine platform to rapidly produce sMVA vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 S

223

and N antigens and show that these vectors can induce potent SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific

224

humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, including potent NAb. These results highlight

225

the feasibility to efficiently produce recombinant MVA vectors from chemically synthesized DNA

226

and to rapidly develop a synthetic poxvirus-based vaccine candidate to prevent SARS-CoV-2

227

infection. We envision that this novel vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA will facilitate the

228

development and clinical use of poxvirus vaccine vectors for infectious diseases and cancer.

229

Our strategy to produce a synthetic form of MVA using chemically synthesized DNA differs from

230

the recently described approach to produce a synthetic horsepox virus vaccine vector (42).

231

While our strategy to generate sMVA involves the use of three large circular DNA fragments

232

(~60 kbp) with intrinsic HL and CR sequences (Figure 1), the approach by Noyce et al. to

233

produce a synthetic horsepox vaccine involves the use of multiple smaller linear DNA fragments

234

(~10-30 kbp) and the addition of terminal HL sequences (42). Because the three sMVA

235

fragments can be used in a circular form for the sMVA reconstitution process they are easily

236

maintained in E. coli as BACs and transferred to BHK cells for sMVA virus reconstitution without

237

the need for additional purification steps or modifications. This feature greatly facilitates the

238

insertion of heterologous antigen sequences into the sMVA DNA by highly efficient bacterial

239

recombination techniques and to produce recombinant sMVA vaccine vectors. Additionally, the

240

three-plasmid system provides the flexibility for rapid production of recombinant MVA harboring

241

multiple antigens inserted into different MVA insertion sites, which can be particularly laborious

242

when generating recombinant MVA by the conventional transfection/infection procedure (3, 43).

243

Although the precise mechanism and order of events of the sMVA virus reconstitution using

245

recombine with one another and produce a synthetic form of MVA that is virtually identical to

wtMVA in genome content, replication properties, host cell range, and immunogenicity.

247

In contrast to most other currently employed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approaches that solely rely

248

on the S antigen, our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approach using sMVA employs immune stimulation

249

by S and N antigens, which both are implicated in protective immunity (20, 26). The observation

250

that the sMVA-CoV2 vectors co-expressing S and N antigens can stimulate potent NAb against

251

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and infectious virions suggests that they can elicit antibodies that are

252

considered effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease (16, 18, 20, 21). We show

253

that the vaccine vectors stimulate a Th1-biased antibody and cellular immune response, which

254

is considered the preferred antiviral adaptive immune response to avoid vaccine-associated

255

enhanced respiratory disease (44, 45). We did not find any evidence for Fc-mediated ADE

256

promoted by the vaccine-induced immune sera, suggesting that antibody responses induced by

257

the vaccine vectors bear minimal risk for ADE-mediated immunopathology, a general concern in

258

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development (44, 45). In addition, based on findings with other viruses

259

associated with ADE, the stimulation of Th1 immunity with a strong T cell response component

260

appears to be the way forward to develop an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (46).

261

Other immune responses besides NAb targeting the S antigen may contribute to protection

262

against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is highlighted by the finding that even patients without

263

measurable NAb can recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection (20). While antibodies could be

264

particular important to prevent initial SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, T cell responses may impose an

265

additional countermeasure to control sporadic virus spread at local sites of viral infection,

266

thereby limiting virus transmission. Our dual recombinant vaccine approach based on sMVA to

267

induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses to S and N antigens may provide

268

protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond other vaccine approaches that solely employ

recommendations. CEF were purchased from Charles River (10100795) and grown in minimum

277

essential medium (MEM) with 10% FBS (MEM10). HEK293T/ACE2 were a kind gift of Pamela

278

J. Bjorkman (47). We acknowledge Bernard Moss (LVD, NIAID, NIH) for the gift of wtMVA (NIH

279

Clone 1) that was used solely as a reference standard. To produce sMVA and wtMVA virus

280

stocks, CEF were seeded in 30x150mm tissue culture dishes, grown to ~70-90% confluency,

281

infected at 0.02 multiplicity of infection (MOI) with sMVA or wtMVA. Two days post infection,

282

ultra-purified virus was prepared by 36% sucrose density ultracentrifugation and virus

283

resuspension in 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9) (48). Virus stocks were stored at -80ºC. Virus titers were

284

determined on CEF by immunostaining of viral plaques at 16-24 h post infection using

285

polyclonal Vaccinia antibody. FPV stocks were produced following propagation on CEF using

286

FPV strain TROVAC (ATCC VR-2553) (35) or HP1.441 (36), kindly provided by Bernard Moss.

Construction of sMVA fragments

289

The three ~60 kbp sMVA fragments (F1-F3; Figure 1) comprising the complete MVA genome

290

sequence reported by Antoine et al. (NCBI Accession# U94848) (4) were constructed as

291

follows: sMVA F1 contained base pairs 191-59743 of the MVA genome sequence; sMVA F2

292

comprised base pairs 56744-119298 of the MVA sequence; and sMVA F3 included base pairs

wherein the italicized letters indicate the duplex copy of the MVA terminal HL sequence and the

301

at the ITRs of sMVA F1 and F3 were added in identical arrangement as the CR/HL/CR

302

sequences occur at the ITRs at the genomic junctions of putative MVA replication intermediates

303

(4). The sMVA fragments were produced and assembled by Genscript using chemical

304

synthesis, combined with a yeast recombination system. All sMVA fragments were cloned into a

305

yeast shuttle vector, termed pCCI-Brick, which contains a mini-F replicon for stable propagation

306

of large DNA fragments as low copy BACs in E. coli. sMVA F1 and F3 were cloned and

307

maintained in EPI300 E. coli (Epicentre), while sMVA F1 was cloned and maintained in DH10B

308

E. coli (Invitrogen).

309

Antigen insertion

310

SARS-CoV-2 S and N antigen sequences were inserted into the sMVA fragments by En

311

passant mutagenesis in GS1783 E. coli cells (49, 50). Briefly, transfer constructs were

312

generated that consisted of the S or N antigen sequence with upstream mH5 promoter

313

sequence and downstream Vaccinia transcription termination signal (TTTTTAT), and a

314

kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by a 50 bp gene duplication was introduced into the

315

antigen sequences. The transfer constructs were amplified by PCR with primers providing ~50

316

bp extensions for homologous recombination and the resulting PCR products were used to

317

insert the transfer constructs into the sMVA DNA by a first Red-recombination reaction (49, 50).

sMVA virus reconstitution

335

sMVA virus reconstitution from the three sMVA DNA plasmids in BHK cells using FPV as a

336

helper virus was performed as follows (8-10). The three sMVA DNA plasmids were isolated from

337

E. coli by alkaline lysis (51) and co-transfected into 60-70% confluent BHK cells grown in 6-well

338

plate tissue culture plates using Fugene HD transfection reagent (Roche) according to the

339

manufacturer’s instructions. At 4 hours post transfection, the cells were infected with

340

approximately

341

transfected/infected BHK cells were grown for 2 days and then every other day transferred, re-

342

seeded, and grown for additional two days in larger tissue culture formats over a period of 8-12

343

days until most or all of the cells showed signs of sMVA virus infection. Using this procedure,

345

reconstitution was usually detected at 4-8 days post transfection/infection. Fully infected BHK

346

cell monolayers were usually visible at 8-12 days post transfection/infection. sMVA virus from

347

infected BHK cell monolayers was prepared by conventional freeze/thaw method and passaged

348

once on BHK cells before producing ultra-purified virus stocks on CEF. sMVA or recombinant

349

sMVA-CoV-2 vectors were reconstituted either with FPV HP1.441 (sMVA hp, sMVA-N/S, sMVA-

350

S/N hp) or TROVAC (sMVA tv1 and tv2, sMVA-S tv, sMVA-N tv, sMVA-N/S tv, sMVA-S/N tv).

351

Host cell range

352

sMVA and wtMVA host cell range using various human cell lines (HeLa, 293T, MRC-5, A549,

353

and 143B) BHK cells, and CEF was determined as follows. The cells were seeded in 6-well

354

plate tissue culture format and at 70-90% confluency infected in duplicates with 0.01 MOI of

355

sMVA or wtMVA using MEM2. At 2 hours post infection, the cells were washed twice with PBS

356

and incubated for two days in normal growth medium (as described under cells and viruses).

357

After the incubation period, virus was prepared by conventional freeze/thaw method and the

358

virus titers of each duplicate infection was determined in duplicate on CEF.

359

Replication kinetics

360

To compare the replication kinetics of sMVA and wtMVA, CEF or BHK cells were seeded in 6

361

well-plate tissue culture format and at 70-90% confluency infected in triplicates at 0.02 MOI with

362

sMVA or wtMVA using MEM2. After 2 hours of incubation, the cells were grown in MEM10. At

363

24 and 48 hours post infection, virus was prepared by freeze/thaw method and the virus titers of

364

each triplicate infection and the inoculum was determined in duplicate on CEF.

365

Plaque size analysis

366

To compare the plaque size of sMVA virus and wtMVA, CEF or BHK cells were seeded in 6-well

368

wtMVA using MEM2. After 2 hours of incubation, MEM10 was added and the cells were grown

369

for 16-24 hours. The cell monolayers were stained with Vaccinia virus polyclonal antibody and

370

viral plaques were imaged using Leica DMi8 inverted microscope and measured using LAS X

371

software. The size of 25 viral plaques per sMVA or wtMVA was calculated using the formula

372

𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎= 𝜋×𝑎×𝑏, where a and b are the major and minor radius of the ellipse, respectively.

373

PCR analysis

374

To characterize the viral DNA of the sMVA vectors by PCR, CEF were seeded in 6-well plate

375

tissue culture format and at 70-90% confluency infected at 5 MOI with sMVA or wtMVA. DNA

376

was extracted at 16-24 hours post infection by the DNA Easy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen)

BHK cells were seeded in 20x150 mm tissue culture dishes, grown to ~70-90% confluency, and

398

infected at 0.01 MOI with wtMVA, sMVA tv1, or sMVA tv2. Ultra-purified virus was prepared two

399

days post-infection as previously described (48). Viral DNA (vDNA) was phenol/chloroform

400

extracted, followed by ethanol precipitation as previously described(52). DNA concentration

401

and A260/A280 ratios were determined using NanoVue (GE Healthcare Bio-sciences Corp). 10 μg

402

of vDNA were digested with 3 units of either KpnI or XhoI, followed by visualization on 0.5%

403

EtBr-stained agarose gel that was run at 2.4v/cm, overnight.

405

PacBio Long Read Sequencing analysis confirmed the integrity of the sMVA fragments and

406

sMVA genome, including a single point mutation in a non-coding determining region at 3 base

407

pairs downstream of 021L (4) that was found both in sMVA F1 and in reconstituted sMVA.

408

Briefly, 5 ug of fragmented DNAs were converted to SMRTbell libraries using the SMRTbell

409

Template Prep Kit 1.0 (PacBio). The libraries were size-selected (7-kb size cutoff) with

410

BluePippin (Sage Science). The size-selected libraries were loaded to SMRT cells using

411

MagBeads loading and sequenced on a PacBio RSII with 10 hour movie. Read demultiplexing,

412

mapping to the reference sequence (Vaccinia virus strain Ankara U94848.1), and variants

413

calling were performed using the SMRT Link (v6.0.0.47841). The identified variants were

414

visually inspected in SMRT view Genome Browser for confirmation. De novo assembly was

415

done using either canu v1.7.1 or wtdbg2 v2.5. The 5’ start position of the assembled contig was

BHK cells infected at 5 MOI were harvested 24-post infection. Proteins were solubilized in PBS

419

with 0.1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitor, then reduced and denatured in

420

Laemmli buffer containing DTT and boiled at 95°C for ~10 minutes. Proteins were resolved on

475

IgG secondary antibody (W402B, Promega) was added and incubated for one additional hour.

476

Plates were developed using 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (34028, Thermo Fisher) for one to two

477

minutes after which the reaction was stopped with 1M H2SO4. Plates were read at 450

478

nanometers wave length using FilterMax F3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Binding

479

antibodies endpoint titers were calculated as the latest serum dilution to have an absorbance

480

higher than 0.1 absorbance units (OD) or higher than the average OD in mock immunized mice

481

plus 5 times the standard deviation of the OD in the same group at the same dilution. For

482

evaluation of the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, mouse sera were diluted 1:10,000 in PBS. The assay was

483

performed as described above except for the secondary antibodies (1:2,000. goat Anti-Mouse

484

IgG2a cross absorbed HRP antibody, Southern biotech, 1083-05; Goat anti-Mouse IgG1 cross

489

ARPE-19 cells were seeded in 96 well plates (1.5x104 cells/well). The following day, serial

490

dilutions of mouse sera were incubated for 2 hours with MVA expressing the fluorescent marker

491

Venus (9) (1.5x104 PFU/well). The serum-virus mixture was added to the cells in duplicate wells

492

and incubated for 24 hours. After the 24 hours incubation period, the cells were imaged using

493

Leica DMi8 inverted microscope. Pictures from each well were processed using Image-Pro

494

Premier (Media Cybernetics) and the fluorescent area corresponding to the area covered by

495

MVA-Venus infected cells was calculated.

496

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production

497

The day before transfection, HEK293T/17 were seeded in a 15 cm dish at a density of 5x106

498

cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, non-essential amino acids,

499

HEPES, and glutamine (53). Next day, cells were transfected with a mix of packaging vector

500

(pALDI-Lenti System, Aldevron), luciferase reporter vector and a plasmid encoding for the wild

501

type SARS-CoV2 Spike protein (Sino Biological) or vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G,

502

Aldevron), using FuGENE6 (Roche) as a transfection reagent : DNA ratio of 3:1, according to

503

manufacturer’s protocol. Sixteen hours post-transfection, the media was replaced and cells

504

were incubated for an additional 24-72 hours. Supernatants were harvested at 24-, 48- and 72

505

hours, clarified by centrifugation at 1,500 RPM for 5 minutes and filtered using a sterile 0.22 µm

506

pore size filter. Clarified lentiviral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 20,000

507

RPM for 2 hours at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 2% heat inactivated-

508

FBS and stored overnight at 4°C to allow the pellet to completely dissolve. Next day, samples

509

were aliquoted, snap frozen and stored at -80°C for downstream assays.

510

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization and ADE assay

511

Levels of p24 antigen in the purified SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype solution was measured by ELISA

512

(Takara). Mouse sera were heat inactivated, pooled and diluted at a linear range of 1:100 to

513

1:50,000 in complete DMEM. For the neutralization assay, diluted serum samples were pre-

514

incubated overnight at 4°C with SARS-CoV-2-Spike pseudotyped luciferase lentiviral vector,

515

normalized to 100 ng/mL of p24 antigen. HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE-2 receptor were

516

seeded the day before transduction at a density of 2x105 cells per well in a 96-well plate in

517

complete DMEM (47). Before infection, 5 µg/mL of polybrene was added to each well.

518

Neutralized serum samples were then added to the wells and the cells were incubated for an

519

additional 48 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Following incubation, cells were lysed

520

using 40 µL of Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis 5x Reagent per well (Promega). Luciferase activity

521

was quantified using 100 µL of Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) as a substrate. Relative

522

luciferase units (RLU) were measured using a microplate reader (SpectraMax L, Molecular

523

Devices) at a 570 nm wave length. The percent neutralization titer for each dilution was

524

calculated as follows: NT = [1-(mean luminescence with immune sera/mean luminescence

525

without immune sera)] x 100. The titers that gave 90% neutralization (NT90) were calculated by

526

determining the linear slope of the graph plotting NT versus serum dilution by using the next

527

higher and lower NT. In all the experiments RLU of uninfected cells was measured and was

528

always between 50 and 90.

529

For the ADE assay, THP1 cells were seeded at a confluency of 2x106 cells/mL in a 96 well plate

530

and co-incubated for 48 hours with serum samples diluted at 1:5,000 or 1:50,000 in the

531

presence of SARS-CoV-2-Spike pseudotyped or VSV-G luciferase lentiviral vector, normalized

532

to 100 ng/mL of p24 antigen. Following incubation, cells were lysed using 100 µL of ONE-Glo

533

Luciferase Assay System per well (Promega). RLU were measured as above.

534

SARS-CoV-2 focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT)

535

FRNT assay was performed as described recently (54). Briefly, HeLa-ACE2 cells were seeded

536

in 12 μL complete DMEM at a density of 2x103 cells per well. In a dilution plate, pooled mouse

537

serum was diluted in series with a final volume of 12.5 μL. Then 12.5 μL of SARS-CoV-2 was

538

added to the dilution plate at a concentration of 1.2x104 pfu/mL.

539

After 1 h incubation, the media remaining on the 384-well plate was removed and 25 μL of the

540

virus/serum mixture was added to the 384-well plate. The plate was incubated for 20 h after

541

which the plate was fixed for 1h. Each well was then washed three times with 100 μL of 1xPBS

542

0.05% tween. 12.5 μL of human polyclonal sera diluted 1:500 in Perm/Wash buffer (BD

543

Biosciences 554723) were added to each well in the plate and incubated at RT for 2 h. Each

544

well was further washed three times and peroxidase goat anti-human Fab (Jackson Scientific)

545

was diluted 1:200 in Perm/Wash buffer, then added to the plate and incubated at RT for 2 h.

546

The plate was then washed three times and 12.5 μL of Perm/Wash buffer was added to the

547

plate then incubated at RT for 5 min. The Perm/Wash buffer was removed and TrueBlue

548

peroxidase substrate was immediately added (Sera Care 5510-0030). Sera were tested in

549

triplicate wells. Normal human plasma was used as negative controls for serum screening.

550

SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma samples

551

IBC Protocol 20004 approved the use of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma. Anonymized

552

plasma samples of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals (N=19) were obtained from UCSD.

553

Individuals were confirmed to be infected in the previous three to ten weeks by PCR and lateral

554

flow assay. All individuals were symptomatic with mild to moderate-severe symptoms. Serum

555

samples (DS-626-G and DS-626-N, Seracare) purchased before SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were

556

used as a negative control. SARS-CoV-2-specific binding antibodies in plasma samples were

557

measured as described above. Cross-adsorbed goat anti-human IgG (H+L) secondary antibody

558

(A18811, Invitrogen) was used at a dilution of 1:3,000.

Statistics

588

Statistical evaluation was pursued using GraphPad Prism (v8.3.0). For evaluation of differences

589

in sMVA and wtMVA plaque area in BHK-21 and CEF cells and differences in sMVA and wtMVA

590

host cell range, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s and Dunnet’s multiple comparison tests

591

were used, respectively. For sMVA and wtMVA growth kinetic analysis, mixed-effects model

592

with the Geisser-Greenhouse correction, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test were

593

applied. For ELISAs, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were used to

594

calculate differences in endpoint titers and group means between groups. For IgG2a/IgG1 ratio

595

analysis, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to compare the

596

IgG2a/IgG1 ratio measured in each group to a ratio of 1. Pearson correlation analysis was

597

performed to calculate the correlation coefficient r and its significance. For T cell responses

598

analysis, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test with a single pooled

599

variance was used to compare the mean of each group.

Figure 1. sMVA construction and characterization. A) Schematic of MVA genome. The MVA genome is ~178 kbp in length and
contains ~9.6 kbp inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences. B) sMVA fragments. The three sub-genomic sMVA fragments (F1-F3)
comprise ~60 kbp of the left, central, and right part of the MVA genome as indicated. sMVA F1/F2 and F2/F3 share ~3 kbp
overlapping homologous sequences for recombination (red dotted crossed lines). Approximate genome positions of commonly used
MVA insertion (Del2, IGR69/70, Del3) are indicated C) Terminal CR/HL/CR sequences. Each of the sMVA fragments contains at
both ends a sequence composition comprising a duplex copy of the MVA terminal hairpin loop (HL) flanked by concatemeric
resolution (CR) sequences. BAC = bacterial artificial chromosome vector. D) sMVA reconstitution. The sMVA fragments are isolated
from the E. coli and co-transfected into BHK cells, which are subsequently infected with FPV as a helper virus to initiate sMVA virus
reconstitution. E) PCR analysis. CEF infected with sMVA, derived with FPV HP1.441 (sMVA hp) or TROVAC from two independent
virus reconstitutions (sMVA tv1 and sMVA tv2), were investigated by PCR for several MVA genome positions (ITR sequences,
transition left or right ITR into internal unique region (left ITR/UR; UR/right ITR), Del2, IGR69/70 and Del3 insertion sites, and F1/F2
and F2/F3 recombination sites) and absence of BAC vector sequences. PCR reactions with wtMVA-infected and uninfected cells,
without sample (mock), or with MVA BAC were performed as controls. F) Restriction fragment length analysis. Viral DNA isolated
from ultra-purified sMVA (sMVA tv1 and sMVA tv2) or wtMVA virus was compared by KpnI and XhoI restriction enzyme digestion.

Figure 2. sMVA replication properties. The replication properties of sMVA derived with FPV HP1.441 (sMVA hp) or TROVAC
from two independent sMVA virus reconstitution (sMVA tv1 and sMVA tv2) were compared with wtMVA. A) Viral foci. CEF infected
at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) with the reconstituted sMVA virus or wtMVA were immunostained using anti-Vaccinia polyclonal
antibody (αVAC). B) Replication kinetics. BHK or CEF cells were infected at 0.02 MOI with sMVA or wtMVA and viral titers of the
inoculum and infected cells at 24 and 48 hours post infection were determined on CEF. Mixed-effects model with the GeisserGreenhouse correction was applied; at 24 and 48 hours post-infection differences between groups were not significant. C) Viral foci
size analysis. BHK or CEF cell monolayers were infected at 0.002 MOI with sMVA or wtMVA and areas of viral foci were determined
at 24 hours post infection following immunostaining with αVAC antibody. D) Host cell range analysis. Various human cell lines
(HEK293, A549, 143b, and HeLa), CEF or BHK cells were infected at 0.01 MOI with sMVA or wtMVA and virus titers were
determined at 48 hours post infection on CEF. Dotted lines indicate the calculated virus titer of the inoculum based on 0.01 MOI.
Differences between groups in C-D were calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s (C) or Dunnett’s (D) multiple
comparison tests. ns = not significant.

Figure 3. sMVA in vivo immunogenicity. sMVA derived either with FPV HP1.441 (sMVA hp) or TROVAC from two independent
virus reconstitution (sMVA tv1 and sMVA tv2) was compared by in vitro analysis with wtMVA. C57BL/6 mice were immunized twice
at three week interval with low (1x107 PFU) or high (5x107 PFU) dose of sMVA or wtMVA. Mock-immunized mice were used as
controls A) Binding antibodies. MVA-specific binding antibodies (IgG titer) stimulated by sMVA or wtMVA were measured after the
first and second immunization by ELISA. B) NAb responses. MVA-specific NAb titers induced by sMVA or wtMVA were measured
after the booster immunization against recombinant wtMVA expressing a GFP marker. C-D) T cell responses. MVA-specific IFNγ,
TNFα, IL-4, and IL-10-secreting CD8+ (C) and CD4+ (D) T cell responses induced by sMVA or wtMVA after two immunizations were
measured by flow cytometry following ex vivo antigen stimulation using B8R immunodominant peptides. Differences between
groups were evaluated using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. ns = not significant.

Figure 4. Construction and characterization of sMVA-CoV2 vectors. A) Schematic representation of vector construction. S and
N antigen sequences (red spheres and green triangles) were inserted into sMVA fragments F2 and F3 by bacterial recombination
methods in E. coli. The modified sMVA fragments of F1 and F2 with inserted antigen sequences and the unmodified sMVA fragment
F1 were isolated from E. coli and co-transfected into FPV-infected BHK cells to initiate virus reconstitution. B) Schematics of single
(sMVA-S, sMVA-N) and double (sMVA-N/S, sMVA-S/N) recombinant sMVA-CoV2 vectors with S and N antigen sequences inserted
into commonly used MVA insertion sites (Del2, IGR69/70, Del3). All antigens were expressed via the Vaccinia mH5 promoter. C)
Western Blot. BHK cells infected with the single and double recombinant sMVA-CoV2 vectors derived with FPV HP1.441 (sMVAS/N hp, sMVA-N/S hp) or TROVAC (sMVA-S/N tv, sMVA-N/S tv, sMVA-S tv, sMVA-N tv) were evaluated for antigen expression by
Western Blot using anti-S1 and N antibodies (αS1 and αN Ab). Vaccinia B5R protein was verified as infection control. Higher and
lower molecular weight bands may represent mature and immature protein species. D) Flow cytometry staining. HeLa cells infected
with the vaccine vectors were evaluated by cell surface and intracellular flow staining using anti-S1, S2, and N antibodies (αS1, αS2,
and αN Ab). Live cells were used to evaluate cell surface antigen expression. Fixed and permeabilized cells were used to evaluate
intracellular antigen expression. Anti-Vaccinia virus antibody (αVAC) was used as staining control to verify MVA protein expression.
Cells infected with sMVA or wtMVA or uninfected cells were used as controls for experiments in C and D as indicated.

Figure 5. Humoral immune responses stimulated by sMVA-CoV2 vectors. Balb/c mice immunized twice in a three week interval
with 5x107 PFU of the single and double recombinant sMVA-CoV2 vectors derived with FPV HP1.441 (sMVA-S/N hp and sMVA-N/S
hp) or TROVAC (sMVA-S/N tv, sMVA-N/S tv, sMVA-S tv, sMVA-N tv) were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune
responses A-B) Binding antibodies. S, RBD, and N-specific binding antibodies induced by the vaccine vectors were evaluated after
the first (A) and second (B) immunization by ELISA. Dashed lines in A and B indicate median binding antibody endpoint titers
measured in convalescent human sera (Figure S4). One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used to evaluate
differences between binding antibody end-point titers. C) IgG2a/IgG1 isotype ratio. S-, RBD-, and N-specific binding antibodies of
the IgG2a and IgG1 isotype were measured after the second immunization using 1:10,000 serum dilution, and absorbance reading
was used to calculate IgG2a/IgG1 antibody ratio. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to compare
each group mean IgG2a/IgG1 ratio to a ratio of 1 (balanced Th1/Th2 response). D-G) NAb responses. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb
(NT90 titer) induced by the vaccine vectors were measured after the first (D, F) and second (E, G) immunization against SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus (pv) (D-E) or infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus (F-G) in pooled sera of immunized mice. Shown is the average NT90
measured in duplicate (D-E) or triplicate (F-G) infection. N/A=failed quality control of the samples. Dotted lines indicate lowest
antibody dilution included in the analysis. H) SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV-2pv correlation analysis. Correlation analysis of NT90
measured in mouse sera after one and two immunizations using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus and SARS-CoV-2pv. Pearson
correlation coefficient (r) was calculated in H. *p<0.05. ns= not significant.

Figure 6. Cellular immune responses stimulated by sMVA-CoV2 vectors. Balb/c mice immunized twice in a three week interval
with 5x107 PFU of the single or double recombinant sMVA-CoV2 vectors derived with FPV HP1.441 (sMVA-S/N hp and sMVA-N/S
hp) or TROVAC (sMVA-S/N tv, sMVA-N/S tv, sMVA-S tv, sMVA-N tv) were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immune
responses. Antigen-specific CD8+ (A and B) and CD4+ (C and D) T cell responses induced by the vaccine vectors after two
immunizations were evaluated by flow cytometry for IFNγ, TNFα, IL-4 and IL-10 secretion following ex vivo antigen stimulation using
SARS-CoV-2 S and N-specific peptide libraries. Due to technical issues, 1-3 animals/group were not included in the CD4/TNFα
analysis in C and D. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used to compare differences in % of cytokinespecific T-cells between groups. *p<0.05. ns=not significant.
