Abstract
The focused drug repurposing of known approved drugs (such as lopinavir/ritonavir)
has been reported failed for curing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. It is urgent to
generate new chemical entities against this virus. As a key enzyme in the life-cycle of
coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CLpro or Mpro) is the most attractive for
antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we
developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug
design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV2 3CLpro. We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our
structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from
our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular
library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. These compounds can be used as
potential candidates for researchers in their development of drugs against SARS-CoV2.

Introduction
The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak of coronavirus

disease (COVID-19) worldwide.1 As of March 2, 2020, more than 90,000 people have
been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 3000 people have been reported dead
according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus map tracker.2 The numbers of infection and
death are still increasing. To face the considerable threat of SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent
to develop new inhibitors or drugs against this deadly virus. Unfortunately, since the
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) eighteen years ago, there has
been no approved treatment against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV),3 which is
similar to SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing potential drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir
also failed to SARS-CoV-2 injected patients.4 Structure-based antiviral drug design
with a new artificial intelligence algorithm may represent a more helpful approach to
get the SARS-CoV-2 targeted inhibitors or drugs. Thanks to the prompt efforts of many
researchers, we have several pieces of important information about this vital virus
genome and protein structures. We now know that the non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5)
is the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and it is a cysteine protease, which also
been called "3C-like protease" (3CLpro). Moreover, we know that the 3D structure of
3CLpro is very similar to SARS-CoV with a sequence identity of >96% and 3D structure
superposition RMSDCα of 0.44 Å as shown in Figures S1 and S2.

3CLpro has been reported as an attractive target for developing anti-coronaviral drugs:
1) this protease is highly conserved in both sequences and 3D structures;5 2) 3CLpro is
a key enzyme for related virus (including SARS and SARS-CoV-2) replication; 3) it
only exists in the virus, not in humans. Developing specific antiviral drugs targeting
3CLpro of the specific virus has shown significant success; for example, both approved
drugs lopinavir and ritonavir can completely occupy the substrate-binding site of 3CLpro
to break down the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, due
to the large difference between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, lopinavir and ritonavir
were validated ineffective for inhibiting SARS-Cov-2.4 On the other hand, the
substrate-binding site of 3CLpro is almost the same between the SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS as Figure S3 presents. The developed potential inhibitors and drug-design
experience targeting SARS-3CLpro may also be applicable to SARS-CoV-2. For

example, the recently solved structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7)
indicates that the developed inhibitor N3,6 which is a covalent inhibitor derived from
non-covalent inhibitors against SARS can also bind SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with a similar
binding conformation (Figure S4).

All the above available information paved a way to design new targeted covalent
inhibitors (TCI)7 against SARS-CoV-2. A successful TCI against 3CLpro must first be
able to fit in the binding site of 3CLpro with an appropriate pose that keeps its reactive
groups close enough to the Cys145, which then undergoes a chemical step (nucleophilic
attack by Cys145) leading to the formation of a stable covalent bond as presented in the
scheme below:

TCIs usually have a longer target residence time than the relative non-covalent
inhibitors in theory given the following: 1) For the inhibition, k1 must be larger than k2,
and thus the non-covalent binding is determined by the equilibrium constant k1/k2; 2)
TCIs have the chemical reaction step with the target, where usually k3 >> k4; and 3) for
TCIs, the binding process is controlled by k1 k3/(k2 k4), which is bigger than k1/k2 in
non-covalent inhibitors. In some extreme cases k4 = 0, and hence, these irreversible
inhibitors covalently bind the target until the target disappears.7, 8

Considering the inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro may be also bio-active to SARS-CoV-2, we
have created a molecular library including all the reported SARS-3CLpro inhibitors (284
molecules)9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and we will also add new
validated molecular structures into this library with our research progresses. To date,
there are no clinically approved vaccines or drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, with the hope to discover novel candidate drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, we
combine artificial intelligence (AI) with the structure-based drug design (SBDD) to
accelerate generating potential lead compounds and design TCIs.

Figure 1. Flowchart for our SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro lead compounds development.

AI, especially deep learning, has been applied in predicting molecular properties30, 31,
32, 33

and designing novel molecules34. Unlike earlier deep-learning molecular design

by adding single atom one at a time34, 35, our approach explores new molecules by
adding a meaningful molecular fragment one by one, which is not only computationally
more efficient but also chemically more reasonable. To make our AI model work well,
the first step is to prepare the molecular fragment library as shown in Figure 1. We used
our collected SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors (284 molecules) as the initial molecule
database targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Then, we split this set of molecules into
fragments with a molecule weight no more than 200 daltons. Both of the collected
inhibitors and the fragments are supplied in https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov.
Then we applied an advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug
design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds. Noted, if researchers
have enough experience and internal lead compounds or biased fragments, they can
inject all such information into ADQN-FBDD by manually adding the lead compounds
and biased fragments to the corresponding files. By using the same fragments directly
from existing bioactivate molecules, our ADQN-FBDD agent can easily access the
potential chemical space focused on 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2.

After ADQN-FBDD automatically generated novel compounds targeting this new virus
3CLpro, we obtained a covalent lead compound library with 4,922 unique valid
structures. In total, 47 of these compounds were selected with high scores from our AImodel’s reward function. Then these molecules were further evaluated by docking and
covalent docking studies. The lead compound #46 with a high covalent docking score
attracts our attention, which also has a low difference between non-covalent and
covalent docking pose among the 47 lead compounds. After carefully checking the lead
#46’s interaction mode with 3CLpro, we believe there is still much space to optimize
lead it. Then we designed a series of derivatives from compound #46 based on our
chemical biology knowledge and the structure-based optimization policy. All the

https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. We encourage researchers who are interested
in finding a potential treatment for this viral infection to synthesize and evaluate some
of these molecules for treating COVID-19.

of our other actions does, resulting in updates as suggested by the purple curved arrow in which estimated
values are moved up the tree from later nodes to earlier ones.

Integrating the double dueling deep Q learning with fixed q-targets and prioritized
experience replay enables our agent ADQN stable and efficient during learning from
the chemical environment. Combining the state-of-the-art AI algorithm with the idea of
FBDD as presented in Figure 2, ADQN-FBDD is flexible and efficient to access the
focused chemical space targeting the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Based on the configurations
targeting the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, ADQN-FBDD generated a potential lead library

https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov). To narrow our focus to a smaller set of
molecules for analysis, we elaborately defined filter rules (QED>0.1 and DRLreward>=0.6) and the detailed information of the rules can be found in the Methods
section. And then 47 unique molecules (Table S1) were kept for the next non-covalent
docking and covalent-docking evaluation. These 47 virtual leads display suitable 3Dcomplexity with common characteristics of peptidomimetics and protein-protein
interaction (PPI) inhibitors. They are mainly ranked by covalent-docking scores,
considering covalent-docking also contains the scores of non-covalent docking.36 And
we also paid attention on the RMSD difference between the covalent binding and noncovalent binding poses based on all heavy atoms. Finally, we selected the lead molecule
#46 as displayed in Figure 3 with both a good covalent docking score and a small
RMSD value (Table S1). We further optimized it and get a series of derivatives based
on the SBDD approach.

Molecule #46 was ranked number 1 based on the covalent docking score and its
interaction model with the binding site was carefully checked as shown in Figure 3.
Although compound #46 has the best covalent docking score, it has the alerting group
aldehyde. Considering there is still much space for compound #46 to fill in the S1'
subsite and α-ketoamides may be good to fit the oxyanion hole (Figure 4A) of 3CLpro,3

we replaced the aldehyde by formamide and also replaced the 1,4 Michael acceptors by
alpha-ketoamides. Thus, we optimized compound #46 to compound 46-14-1 (Figure 4
A and B).

interaction between compound #46 and protease under covalent docking. The triazole ring forms an
H-bond with His163; the fragment of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde forms a covalent bond with Cys145,
i.e., the key residue in the catalytic center of the protease, resulting in covalent inhibition; aldehyde
carbonyl forms an H-bond with His41; and besides, the hydroxyl of chromone at position 7 forms
an H-bond with Thr190.

The non-bonding interaction between compound 46-14-1 and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is
mainly hydrogen bond. The carbonyl group of covalent scaffold α-ketoamide forms Hbonds with Leu141 and Gly143 as a hydrogen acceptor or a hydrogen donor. The
hydrogen on the nitrogen atom of the triazole ring forms an H-bond with Glu166, while
Glu166 also forms an H-bond with the carbonyl group on the main chain. The oxygen
in the β-lactam ring forms an H-bond with His41. In order to enhance the polarity of
the compounds, sulfonic groups were introduced to replace the ketone carbonyl groups
on the main chain and sulfonamides 46-14-2 were obtained. The covalent docking
model of compound 46-14-2 with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is shown in Figure 4 C and D.

In order to make the compound 46-14-2 fit the active pocket with a higher affinity, we
added a carbon atom to the sulfonic acid group of the original molecule, extending the
carbon chain to increase the flexibility of the molecule, and obtained another optimized
compound 46-14-3. The mode of covalent docking with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is shown
in Figure 5. Due to the introduction of carbon atoms and the enhancement of molecular
flexibility, the β-lactam ring can be inserted deeper into the S2 pocket and the other
fragments of the compound can better adapt to the S1, S1' and S3 subsites. The αcarbonyl carbon on the α-ketoamide of compound 46-14-3 forms a covalent bond with
the key residue Cys145 on the protease, but the main non-bond interaction is still
hydrogen bond (indicated by a yellow dash). The triazole ring mainly forms H-bonds
with Phe140 and Glu166 residues in the S1 pocket; α-ketoamide covalent binding
fragment mainly forms H-bonds with key amino acid residues Cys145, Gly143 and
Ser144 in the S1' subsite, which forms an oxyanion hole in the red circle in Figure 9;
the β-lactam side chain mainly forms H-bonds with residues Tyr54 and AsS187 in the

S2 pocket; the chromone scaffold mainly forms H-bonds with key residues Thr190 and
Gln192 in the S3 pocket. In addition, the oxygen on the sulfonyl group of the main
chain forms an H-bond with Glu166 in the S1 pocket.

The representatives were selected (46-14-1, 46-14-2 and 46-14-3 as Figure 6 displays),
which may be further evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation to get the binding
free energy and by quantum chemical calculation to get the reaction energy barrier.
Meanwhile, 46-14-1, 46-14-2 and 46-14-3 are chosen as our candidates for chemical
synthesis and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity testing, which is ongoing.

Discussions
Computational approaches are particularly important for emerging diseases given the
urgent need to provide timely solutions. In this work, our robust and efficient
computational method and pipeline for designing compounds can provide useful drug
candidates for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. For more information about our AI
model generated leads and SBDD optimized derivatives, please go to the library
https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. These candidates or their variants have a good
chance to produce valid leads of anti-COVID-19 drugs. It is understood that the
computational design requires experimental validations. While we are exploring
experimental validations ourselves, we like to release these candidates promptly for
other researchers to accelerate the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs given the
emergency of seeking treatments for the disease.

Comparing with other deep RL methods, ADQN-FBDD has several highlights: 1) It
directly modifies and generate molecular structures without format conversion
problems while some other tools such as Insilico Medicine’s GENTRL
(https://insilico.com) may generate invalid SMILES output. 2) Most of the generative
models require pre-training on a specific dataset and then produce the molecules with
high similarities to a given training set. For example, the best molecule from Insilico
Medicine for their target DDR1 was actually very similar to the kinase inhibitor Iclusig
(ponatinib) on the market.37 ADQN-FBDD does not need pre-training at all and has a
capacity to generate novel molecules. 3) The process of generating molecules is very

efficient and effective as ADQN-FBBD is molecular fragment-based growing with the
knowledge of chemical reactions, while other models are all atom-based with no rules
of chemical reactions at all34, 38, 39. 4) ADQN-FBDD is highly flexible and user-friendly
for the medicinal chemists, who can easily inject their drug discovery experience into
the reward function to guide the novel molecule generation. Our ADQN-FBDD and
related pipeline can be used not only for designing anti-COVID-19 drugs but also other
structure-based drug discoveries, especially for emerging infetious diseases that require
treatments timely.

Methods
Markov Decision Process for Molecule Generation
Intuitively, the problem of chemical structure graph generation is formulated as learning
a reinforced agent, which performs discrete actions of chemical reaction-based
fragment addition or removal in a chemistry-aware Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Formally, the components of MDP) include M = {S, A, P, R, γ}, where each term is
defined as follows:

𝑆 = {𝑆' } denotes the state space containing all possible intermediate and final
generated molecular graphs. Each 𝑠' is a tuple of (s, t). s stands for a valid molecule
structure and t is the time step. For the initial state 𝑠) , the structure can be represented
as a specific core as Figure 2C indicates or randomly chosen from the prepared
fragment library at time t = 0. We also limit the maximum number of time steps T in
our molecule fragment based MDP, which defines the set of terminal states as {𝑠' |t=T}
containing all the states with the number of steps reaching the maximum allowed value
T.

Ac={At} denotes a set of actions that describe the modification made on the current
molecule structure at each time step t. Here, each action can be classified into three

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.972133; this version posted March 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

categories: fragment addition, fragment deletion, and no modification.

P =p(st+1 |st … s0) =p(st+1|st, at) is the basic assumption in MDP. The state transition
probability, which specifies the next possible state given the current state and action at
time step t. Here, we define the state transition to be deterministic. For example, as
Figure 2C indicates S0 to S1, by adding a 1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl fragment on S0, the next
state S1 will be the new structure of added 1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl with a probability of 1.

R is the reward function that specifies the reward after reaching state 𝑆', 𝛾𝜖(0,1] is the
discount factor and typically γ = 0.9 in our study. In our framework, the state always
has a valid and complete chemical structure at each step as Figure 2C indicates. A
reward is given not just at the terminal states, but at each step. Both intermediate
rewards and final rewards are used to guide the behavior of the reinforcement learning
(RL) agent. So, there is no delayed or sparse reward issue as many other reinforced
frameworks suffered.40, 41 Furthermore, to ensure that the last state is rewarded the most,
we use γT–t to discount the value of the rewards at state 𝑠' . In addition, our reward
function can directly integrate the experience of medicinal chemists. For example,
given a core of interest, medicinal chemists may add biased fragments of their interests
and their input can be used to design a reward function that gives high reward signal
values to biased fragments so that ADQN-FBDD may have a better chance to generate
the desired structures.

Chemical Environment Design
In our RL framework, the chemical environment receives action at from the agent and
emits scalar reward rt and state s'3 to the agent as Figure 2A shows. Note that the
definition of the environment state is different from the general approach that the
environment state is only the environment’s private representation invisible to the agent.
We define the state of the chemical environment s'3 as the intermediate generated
molecule structure at time step t, which is fully observable by the RL agent. Simply,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.972133; this version posted March 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the environment’s state s'3 is the agent’s state 𝑠'45 .

For the task of molecule

generation, the environment incorporates rules of chemistry. In our study, chemistry
rules are not only the basic chemical valency, but also the rules about adding and
removing the fragments derived from known inhibitors based on chemical reactions.
The detail information of 45 defined chemical reaction rules is presented in Table S2.

Agent Design
As indicated in Figure 2A, the basic model of our ADQN-FBDD is an advanced Qnetwork. The goal of molecule generation is equally to fit a Q function Q(st, at) to make
the agent choose the action at at state st that maximizes the future expected γ-discounted
cumulative rewards with policy π. Mathematically, given the agent’s policy π, the value
of the state-action pair Qπ(st , at) and the value of state Vπ(st ) are defined as, respectively:
C

𝑄8 (𝑠' , 𝑎'

) = 𝐸 <=~8(?=) @A γCDE · R(𝑠E , 𝑎E )I
EH'

= 𝐸 <=~8(?=) JR(𝑠' , 𝑎' ) + γ · 𝐸 <=LM~8(?=LM) (𝑄8 (𝑠'45 , 𝑎'45 )N
𝑉 8 (𝑠' ) = 𝐸<=~8(?=) [𝑄8 (𝑠' , 𝑎' )]

(1)
(2)

where 𝐸 <= ~8(?= ) is the expectation within policy π on state st taken at and R(𝑠E , 𝑎E )
denotes the reward at step n. Value function Qπ(st , at) measures the value of taking
action at on state st. Vπ(st ) is the value of being at state st means how good to be in this
state. Obviously, Vπ(st ) can be seen as a part of Qπ(st , at). Then, the rest part from Qπ(st ,
at) can be defined as the so-called advantage function Aπ(st , at)42 as:
A8 (𝑠' , 𝑎' ) = 𝑄8 (𝑠' , 𝑎' ) − 𝑉 8 (𝑠' )

(3)

Intuitively, the advantage value shows how advantageous selecting the action is relative
to the others at the same given state. Then Eqn. (2) can be rewritten according to Eqn.
(4):

𝑉 8 (𝑠' ) = 𝐸<=~8(?= )[𝑉 8 (𝑠' ) + A8 (𝑠' , 𝑎' )] = 𝑉 8 (𝑠' ) + 𝐸<=~8(?=) [ A8 (𝑠' , 𝑎' )]

(4)

Obviously, 𝐸<= ~8(?= ) [ A8 (𝑠' , 𝑎' )] = 0. To avoid the issue of identifiability, we deduct
the mean value from the prediction and the Q-function of dueling DQN can be defined
as:
5

𝑄8 (𝑠' , 𝑎' ; 𝛩, 𝛼, 𝛽 )=𝑉 8 (𝑠' ; 𝛩, 𝛽) + (A8 (𝑠' , 𝑎' ; 𝛩, 𝛼 ) − |Z[| ∑<=] A8 (𝑠' , 𝑎'3 ; 𝛩, 𝛼 ))

dueling DQN as Figure 7 displays, we can train our RL agent by minimizing the loss
function:

where E is the expectation. As the L2 loss has a disadvantage of the tendency to be
dominated by outliers, we use the Huber loss as the loss function 𝑓o :

Prioritized Experience Replay
Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)45 is a technique to enable reinforcement learning
agents remember and reuse experience from the past, and to replay important transitions
more frequently. PER is very useful for replaying some less frequent experiences. Here,
we use the same code of “Prioritized Replay Buffer” from open AI’s gym with version
0.15.4.46 Finally, our RL agent is the double dueling deep Q learning with fixed qtargets and prioritized experience replay.

Fragment Library Design
The fragment-based approach to drug discovery (FBDD) has been established as an
efficient tool in the search for new drugs.47 The idea of FBDD is that proper
optimization of each unique interaction in the binding site and subsequent incorporation
into a single molecular entity should produce a compound with a binding affinity that
is the sum of the individual interactions. However, the widely used fragment libraries
only consider the diversity of fragments, such as the ZINC fragment database. They
have a very low probability to exhibit the desired bioactivity for a given protein.

To combine the idea of FBDD with our RL framework, we first collected and built a
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor dataset containing 284 reported molecules. Then using
the improved BRICS algorithm48 to split those molecules to get the fragment library
target on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as the flowchart displayed in Figure 1’s yellow box. An
elaborate filtering cascade accompanied by manual inspection and the rules can be
changed based on the needs in different studies. Our fragment library contains 316
fragments with molecular weight <200 daltons, the minimum number non-hydrogen
atom >1 and the maximum ≤ 25. The fragments directly from the existing inhibitors
based on the chemical retrosynthetic rules are always true substructures and may have
a high quality of bioactivity targeting 3CLpro. It is worth noting that the quality of the
designed fragment library directly affects the behavior of the chemical environment of
ADQN-FBDD.

Figure 8. Structures of the chosen cores

Core Selection
Studies have identified various scaffolds or core structures that have privileged
characteristics in terms of the activity of a certain target.49, 50, 51 Core structure selection
is the starting point in a scaffold-based drug discovery. Choosing or designing a proper

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.972133; this version posted March 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

initial scaffold is never trivial, and medicinal chemists may need enough experience to
get such a skill. Luckily, there are serval reported privileged core structures targeting
SARS Mpro.3, 52 Here, we chose 4-aminopent-2-enal and 3-amino-2-oxobutanal as the
starting cores as Figure 8 displays, because both cores have been validated to generate
covalent bonds with the Cys145 of SARS or SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

Reward Design
Most reported RL methods using the complete structure information of a positive drug
or inhibitor as the template,38, 39 and they design a reward function for the RL agent to
learn to regenerate the template structure or generate highly similar structures to the
template. This way may be useful in testing the performance of RL methods but not
suitable in a real-world drug design because no one knows the complete structural
information of the novel molecule. A more practical approach is to learn the structure
features of existing drugs or inhibitors to local, focused chemical space for a specific
protein target. Instead of simply putting attention on the diversity of molecule structure,
we explore the possibility of generating novel molecules based on the existing
knowledge. Here, we designed a deep reinforcement learning reward (DRL-reward)
function that consists of the final property score, containing specific fragments (CSF)
score and pharmacophore score as:
𝑅(𝑠) = 𝑤yez · 𝑓yez (𝑠)+ 𝑤{zE · 𝑓{zE (𝑠)+ 𝑤y|< · 𝑓y|< (𝑠)
1 𝑖𝑓 𝑄𝐸𝐷(𝑆) > 0.1
𝑓yez (𝑠) = }
0 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒

(9)

(10)

where 𝑤yez represents weight for the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED)
property and its default value is 0.1. 𝑓yez stands for the QED. QED values can range
from 0 (all properties are unfavourable) to 1 (all properties are favourable), which are
calculated by eight molecular properties.53 The score function 𝑓{?€ of containing
specific fragments (csf) is:

Figure 9. Binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. A: The subsites that complement the substrate-binding
pocket are shown as surface, which are assigned as S1 (green), S1' (red), S2 (magenta), and S3(cyan). B:
The key residues of the binding site are displayed by green, red, magenta and cyan lines (S1, S1', S2 and
S3). The pictures of the binding site are generated using PyMol ((http://www.pymol.org/).

The binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Figure 9) is commonly divided into the
catalytic activity center (His41 and Cys145, specified as S1') and several subsites,
defined as S1 (His163, Glu166, Phe140, Leu141 and Asn142), S1' (His41, Cys145,
Gly143 and Ser144), S2 (Tyr54, Asp187, His41, Arg188, His164 and Met49), and S3
(Thr190, Gln192, Glu166, Met165, Leu167 and Gln189). Each subsite may have its
own favorable binding fragment. When generated structures (including the
intermediates) containing those favorable fragments, 𝑓{?€ is equivalent to give an
additional reward to our RL agent. 𝑤{zE controls the contribution of the biased
fragment to the reward signal and the default value is 0.6. 𝑛Ž<'{| stands for how many
biased fragments have been matched in one generated structure. 𝑁'z'<o is the number
of biased fragments defined based on our knowledge learned from related work. 𝑓y|<

represents the score function of pharmacophores, which mainly depends on the ligandprotein interaction mode from the crystal structure (PDB ID: 6LU7):

(13)

The pharmacophores plot was added in Figure S5. 𝑤y|< controls the contribution of
the pharmacophore score to the reward and the default value is 0.4.

Molecular Generation and Selection
As discussed in the above reward design part, our reward function considers the
molecular descriptor thresholds (QED>0.1), the defined pharmacophores and biased
fragments. In total, 4,922 unique valid structures were automatically generated and all
matched the defined rules by using ADQN-FBDD without any pre-training as many
other methods need.35, 40, 41, 54, 55 Next, All the molecules with high deep reinforcement
learning scores (DRL score: R(S)>0.6) were kept (47 molecules). Then, these 47 unique
molecules were prepared to generate at least 1 conformation with the local energy
minimization using the OPLS-2005 force field by the “ligand prepare” module of
Schrödinger 2015 software. The 47 unique molecules generated a total of 163 3D
conformations before docking into the substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
Considering the balance between precision and calculation time, the stand-precision
(SP) Glide56 was firstly used to predict the possible non-covalent binding poses in this
binding site and the binding site grid centered on the original ligand N357 with 20 Å
buffer dimensions. Following this non-covalent docking, we also calculated the
covalent docking poses and scores for those 47 molecules. We reordered the docking
results mainly based on the covalent docking score and the RMSD value from covalent
docking pose to non-covalent (Table S1).
