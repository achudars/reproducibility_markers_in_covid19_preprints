ABSTRACT
Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) are significant threats to global health, as exemplified by the
recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Host
immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons.
However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2.
Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently
restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E
inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion.
Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV
infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of
hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly,
we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV
infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls
CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated
control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection
by emerging CoV.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped RNA viruses with broad host tropism and documented
capability to cross the species barrier to infect humans3. The mammalian innate immune response
controls CoV infection partly through the action of interferons (IFNs)2,4,5. IFNs inhibit viral infection
by inducing hundreds of genes, many of which encode antiviral effectors6. The interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs) that inhibit CoV infection are not well defined2. To address this knowledge gap, we
screened our published library of >350 human ISG cDNAs7,8 in human hepatoma cells for antiviral
activity against the endemic human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) (Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data
Table 2). The ISG lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) strikingly inhibited HCoV-229E
infection (Fig. 1a-b, Extended Data Fig. 1a). This was unexpected since we and others previously
reported that LY6E enhances cellular infection by influenza A virus, flaviviruses, and HIV-19-11, with
HIV-1 being an exception as opposing roles of LY6E have been described12. To verify this result, we
generated stable cell lines ectopically expressing LY6E and infected cells with diverse CoVs. In addition
to HCoV-229E (Fig. 1c), LY6E significantly inhibited infection by HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, SARSCoV, and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1d-g). The antiviral effect of LY6E extended beyond
human CoVs and blocked infection by the murine CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (Fig. 1h). Given
the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both suspected to originate from bats, we next tested
the antiviral potential of select LY6E orthologues. An alignment of LY6E orthologues of human, rhesus
macaque, mouse, bat, and camel origin revealed strong conservation across species (Extended Data
Fig. 1b-c). All LY6E orthologues inhibited HCoV-229E (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Recent surveillance
of Kenyan camels, the main viral reservoir for MERS-CoV, indicates active circulation of the zoonotic
CoV13. Human and camel LY6E restricted MERS-CoV infection (Extended Data Fig. 1e). To test the
role of endogenous LY6E in controlling CoV infections, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to ablate
LY6E expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. 1i). This cell line was selected as human
hepatoma cells do not express LY6E irrespective of IFN treatment9. LY6E knockout (KO) cells were
more susceptible to HCoV-229E (Fig. 1j). Reconstitution with a CRISPR-resistant LY6E variant (CR
LY6E) restored antiviral activity in KO cells (Fig. 1k-l). Strikingly, the LY6E-mediated restriction in

hepatoma cells was largely specific to CoV. Among 10 genetically divergent viruses tested, only
hepatitis C virus was also restricted (Extended Data Fig. 1f).
LY6E is a member of the LY6/uPAR family of GPI-anchored proteins, and is implicated in diverse
cellular processes14. To evaluate the specificity of LY6E for inhibiting CoV, we ectopically expressed
select LY6/uPAR proteins9 and infected with HCoV-229E. Only LY6E inhibited CoV infection
(Extended Data Fig. 1g). We previously showed that a conserved residue (L36) is required for LY6Emediated enhancement of influenza A virus9. L36 was also required to restrict HCoV-229E infection
(Extended Data Fig. 1h). These data suggest a conserved functional domain that is responsible for both
the virus-enhancing and -restricting phenotypes.
Next, we investigated the effect of LY6E on specific steps of the virus replication cycle. First, we
tested whether LY6E restricts HCoV-229E attachment to the cell surface and observed no effect
(Extended Data Fig. 2a). In accordance, LY6E had no effect on surface expression of CD13, the
specific receptor for HCoV-229E (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To test whether LY6E restricts viral entry,
we used a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoparticle (pp) system bearing CoV spike (S) proteins.
Strikingly, LY6E significantly inhibited VSVpp entry mediated by S proteins from HCoV-229E (Fig.
2a), MERS-CoV (Fig. 2b), SARS-CoV (Fig. 2c), and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2d). Entry mediated by VSV
glycoprotein G was only marginally impacted by LY6E (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d). To test whether
LY6E interferes with the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, we performed a syncytia formation
assay using propagation competent VSV pseudoviruses co-expressing CoV S protein and a GFP reporter
(VSV*ΔG(CoV S)) (Extended Data Fig. 3a). LY6E potently inhibited CoV S protein-mediated
syncytia formation (Fig. 2e-f). To determine whether LY6E impairs S protein expression or maturation,
we also performed a heterologous syncytia formation assay. CoV-resistant hamster cells infected with
trans-complemented GFP reporter VSV*ΔG(CoV) were co-cultured with susceptible target cells that
ectopically expressed LY6E. LY6E again significantly blocked syncytia formation, demonstrating that
LY6E inhibits S protein-mediated fusion and not S protein expression or maturation (Extended Data
Fig. 3b-c). As membrane fusion can occur without syncytia formation, we also performed a quantitative
fusion assay in which mixing of cell contents results in complementation of split luciferase (Fig. 2g).

Cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding CoV S proteins and split luciferase 1-7 were mixed with
susceptible target cells co-expressing LY6E or vector control and split luciferase 8-11. LY6E reduced
CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion, indicating that LY6E blocks fusion of viral and cellular membranes
(Fig. 2h). Time-course experiments revealed that LY6E had no effect on HCoV-229E translation,
replication, assembly, or release (Extended Data Fig. 2e-i). Collectively, our results demonstrate that
LY6E specifically inhibits CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion, which is required for viral entry.
We next addressed whether LY6E modulates proteolytic activation of the S protein. Upon S proteinmediated binding to the respective receptor, host proteases cleave the S protein and make it fusion
competent for “early entry” at the cell surface or “late entry” in endosomes15,16. Pharmacological
inhibition of cell surface and endosomal proteases had no effect on LY6E-mediated restriction of CoV
infection (Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). Next, we addressed whether LY6E directly interferes with the
proteolytic activation of S protein. Mutation of S1/S2 and S2′ in the S protein prevents activation
(Extended Data Fig. 4d)16,17. Ectopic LY6E expression had no effect on MERS-CoV S cleavage or
infection by cleavage-resistant MERS-CoV pp (Extended Data Fig. 4e-g). Collectively, our data
indicate that restriction of viral fusion is independent of S protein activation.
Next, we aimed to evaluate LY6E-mediated CoV restriction in vivo. Systemic genetic ablation of
Ly6e in mice is embryonic lethal18. Therefore, we generated transgenic Ly6efl/fl mice, which are
functionally 'wild-type (WT)' for Ly6e expression, and crossed them with Vav1-iCre mice to ablate Ly6e
in cells that originate from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) progenitor (Extended Data Fig. 5a-b). This
genetic model was chosen since immune cells are critical for protection from CoV in vivo5,19-23. Bonemarrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from Ly6eΔHSC mice had reduced Ly6e mRNA levels (Extended
Data Fig. 5c). The natural mouse pathogen MHV is a well-studied model CoV that causes hepatitis and
encephalomyelitis in mice24. Ly6eΔHSC BMDM were more susceptible to MHV infection than Ly6efl/fl
BMDM, demonstrating that murine Ly6e is a restriction factor for murine CoV (Extended Data Fig.
5d).
To determine whether Ly6e is important for controlling CoV infection in vivo, Ly6efl/fl and Ly6eΔHSC
mice were infected with a high dose (5 x 104 PFU) of MHV that causes sub-lethal hepatitis in WT

C57BL/6J mice25. Since MHV pathogenesis is influenced by sex26, we performed independent
experiments in male and female mice. Ly6eΔHSC mice of both sexes rapidly succumbed to MHV infection
by day 6 (Fig. 3a-b, Extended Data Fig. 6a-b). To examine viral pathogenesis and immunopathology
in infected mice, Ly6efl/fl and Ly6eΔHSC mice were infected with the same high dose of MHV and
euthanized 3- or 5-days post-infection. At both time points, female Ly6eΔHSC mice exhibited significantly
higher levels of liver damage as measured by serum ALT while no difference was observed in male
mice (Fig. 3c,i, Extended Data Fig. 6c,i). However, hepatic viral burden did not differ in either sex
(Fig. 3d,j, Extended Data Fig. 6d,j), possibly due to tissue saturation at this high dose. Indeed, female
but not male Ly6eΔHSC mice exhibited increased liver damage and viral burden at a low dose (5 PFU) of
MHV (Extended Data Fig. 7a-b, f-g). Spleen viral burden was elevated in female and male Ly6eΔHSC
mice at both time points and doses of MHV (Fig. 3e,k, Extended Data Fig. 6e,k, Extended Data Fig.
7c,h). At 3 days post-infection, there was no difference in liver necrosis, but inflammation was
moderately reduced in female but not male Ly6eΔHSC mice (Fig. 3f-h, Extended Data Fig. 6f-h). By 5
days post-infection and at both low and high doses of MHV, female Ly6eΔHSC mice had significantly
higher levels of liver necrosis and a reduced presence of mononuclear immune cells (Fig. 3l-n,
Extended Data Fig. 7d-e), whereas no difference was observed in male mice (Extended Data Fig. 6ln, Extended Data Fig. 7i-j). Liver damage in Ly6eΔHSC mice was further corroborated at an intermediate
viral dose (5 x 103 PFU), which resulted in visibly apparent brittleness, pallor, and necrotic foci
(Extended Data Fig. 7k-n). These data demonstrate that Ly6e in hematopoietic cells is important for
controlling murine CoV infection.
We next used a transcriptomic approach to evaluate the effect of Ly6e ablation on global gene
expression in liver and spleen of female Ly6efl/fl and Ly6eΔHSC mice injected with PBS or the high dose
of MHV at 3- and 5- days post-infection. In infected tissues, loss of Ly6e in hematopoietic cells
correlated with differential gene expression in pathways associated with tissue damage, such as liverspecific metabolic genes, angiogenesis, wound healing, and immune response to viruses (Fig. 4a-c). We
also observed a striking loss of genes associated with the type I IFN response, inflammation, antigen
presentation, and B cells in infected Ly6eΔHSC mice (Fig. 4d-e, Extended Data Fig. 8).

The histopathology (Fig. 3h,n) and transcriptome data (Fig 4a-e, Extended Data Fig. 8) prompted
us to determine how loss of Ly6e affects immune cell numbers during infection. Absolute numbers of
different immune cell subsets were quantified from Ly6eΔHSC and Ly6efl/fl mice 5 days after injection
with PBS or the intermediate dose of MHV (Extended Data Fig. 7k-n, Extended Data Fig. 9). Multiple
cell types were depleted in livers and spleens of infected Ly6eΔHSC mice, irrespective of sex (Figure 4fg, Extended Data Fig. 10a-b). B cells were dramatically reduced in livers from infected Ly6eΔHSC mice.
Hepatic CD4+ T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, and neutrophils were also depleted
in infected Ly6eΔHSC mice, whereas CD8+ T cells were unchanged (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 10a).
Infected Ly6eΔHSC mice had a reduction in all splenic immune cell subsets except for CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 10b). Depletion of immune cell populations in Ly6eΔHSC organs was
MHV-dependent, as cell numbers were not altered in PBS-injected mice.
To determine whether loss of immune cells in MHV-infected Ly6eΔHSC mice correlates with increased
permissiveness to infection, we assessed MHV infection in splenocytes cultured from Ly6eΔHSC, Ly6efl/fl,
and Ifnar-/- mice. In Ly6efl/fl splenocyte cultures, MHV infected macrophages, neutrophils, DC, and B
cells, but not CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, as previously published (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 10c)23.
Strikingly, B cells from both male and female Ly6eΔHSC mice were highly susceptible to MHV infection
when compared to B cells from Ly6e fl/fl or Ifnar-/- mice. DC from female Ly6eΔHSC mice were also more
susceptible to MHV infection. Surprisingly, no other cell type demonstrated a strong Ly6e-dependent
susceptibility to MHV infection.
Together, our data demonstrate an important role for Ly6e in immune cell-mediated control of CoV
infection. Higher viral burden and lower liver inflammation suggests that liver damage in MHV-infected
female Ly6eΔHSC mice may be due to viral pathogenesis that exceeds the ability of the immune system
to control the infection. Notably, we observed MHV-induced loss of three classes of cells: 1) cells that
are not permissive to the virus (CD4+ T cells), 2) cells that are permissive to MHV but do not
demonstrate Ly6e KO-dependent infection (NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils), and 3) cells that
are permissive to MHV in a Ly6e KO-dependent manner (B cells and DC). This latter group is capable
of antigen-presentation to CD4+ T cells27,28. Thus, in the absence of Ly6e, unrestricted MHV infection

of B cells or DC may impair T cell priming, thereby negatively impacting recruitment and activation of
NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils that contribute to control of viral disease.
In conclusion, we identified LY6E as a pan CoV restriction factor that limits CoV entry and protects
the host from severe viral disease. Our findings are striking given that LY6E has been primarily
associated with an enhancing phenotype in which LY6E promotes entry of multiple viruses29. However,
our data clearly expand the role of LY6E during coronaviral infection and establishes a novel function
in protecting the host immune cell compartment. Determining the precise molecular mechanism
underlying how LY6E inhibits CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion will advance our
understanding of cellular antiviral defenses against these important human pathogens. Antiviral
membrane fusion inhibitors have been successfully implemented for treatment of HIV-1 infection30. A
therapeutic approach mimicking the mechanism of action of LY6E could provide a first line of defense
against novel emerging CoV infections. Furthermore, delineating which Ly6e-expressing immune cells
protect mice from MHV will provide new insight into how individual antiviral effectors in distinct
cellular compartments modulate viral pathogenesis.

supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x penicillin/streptomycin (p-s), was added. Cells were incubated for
3 days at 33°C before medium was removed, cells were washed, and stained with crystal violet (SigmaAldrich). Plaque forming units (PFU) were calculated.
HCoV-OC43: 5.0 x 104 stable LY6E expressing or control cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and
infected at 33°C for 1 hour with HCoV-OC43 (MOI=1). Virus was aspirated and 10% FBS/1x NEAA/1x
p-s/RPMI (cRPMI) was added back to cells. 24 hours post-infection, cells were dissociated using
Accumax (Sigma-Aldrich), fixed in 1% PFA, permeabilized per manufacturer’s protocol (BD
Cytofix/Cytoperm), and stained for nucleoprotein (1:500) and a goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor488conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000). Infection was analyzed by flow cytometry.
MERS-CoV/ SARS-CoV/ SARS-CoV-2: 1 x 104 stable LY6E expressing or control cells were seeded
in a 96-well plate and infected at 37°C in a serial dilution assay. 3-4 days post-infection supernatant was
removed, and cells were stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich). Cytopathic effect (CPE) was
determined upon visual inspection and TCID50/ml calculated according to the Reed and Muench
method. MHV-Gluc: 1 x 105 stable LY6E expressing or control cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and
infected with MHV-Gluc (MOI=0.1) at 37°C. After 2 hours, virus inoculum was removed, cells were
washed with PBS, and cRPMI added back. 24 hours post-infection, cell culture supernatant was
harvested, and Gluc activity was measured using Pierce Gaussia Luciferase Glow Assay Kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific) and a plate luminometer (EnSpire 2300 Multilabel reader by Perkin Elmer).
For testing the virus panel against LY6E, 1 x 104 stable LY6E expressing or control Huh7.5 cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate. Cells were infected with the following viruses and harvested after the indicated
time: HCoV-229E (MOI=0.001, 72 hours), HCV-Ypet (MOI=1, 72 hours), CHIKV-GFP (MOI=0.005,

anti-mouse secondary antibody. Images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope and analyzed
using ImageXpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

HCoV-229E-Rluc infection assay of KO cells
For infection assays, 1 x 105 target cells were seeded in a 24-well plate one day prior infection. Cells
were infected with HCoV-229E-Rluc (MOI 0.1) in OptiMEM (Gibco) for 2 hours at 33°C. Cells were
washed 1x with PBS and 10% FBS/1x NEAA/1x p-s/DMEM (cDMEM) was added back. Cells were
incubated at 33°C for 24 hours, then washed with PBS and lysed using the Renilla Luciferase Assay
System kit (Promega). Rluc activity was measured using a plate luminometer (EnSpire 2300 Multilabel
reader by Perkin Elmer). For the reconstitution with CRISPR resistant LY6E (CR LY6E), 2.5 x 104 cells
were seeded in a 24-well plate. One day post-seeding, cells were either left untransduced or transduced
with a lentiviral vector encoding for CR LY6E or the empty control. 48 hours post-transduction, cell
lysates were either infected with HCoV-229E-Rluc (MOI=0.1) for 24 hours as described above or
harvested for Western blot.

VSV pseudoparticles
Pseudotyping of VSV*ΔG(Fluc) was performed as previously described50. Briefly, 6 x 105 293LTV
cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) which was
complexed with DNA plasmids driving the expression of either VSV G protein (positive control), the
respective CoV S proteins, or the fluorophore mCherry (negative control). Expression vectors for
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, serotype Indiana) glycoprotein (VSV-G, Genbank accession number:
NC_001560), HCoV-229E S (pCAGGS-229E S, Genbank accession number: X16816), MERS-CoV S
(pCAGGS-MERS S, Genbank accession number: JX869059 with silent point mutation (C4035A,
removing internal XhoI), SARS-CoV S (pCAGGS-SARS S, Genbank accession number: AY291315.1
with two silent mutation (T2568G, T3327C)), have been described previously51-53. The expression
plasmid for SARS-CoV-2 was generated as follows: the coding sequence of a synthetic, codonoptimized (for human cells) SARS-CoV-2 DNA (GeneArt Gene Synthesis, Thermo Fisher Scientific)

based on the publicly available protein sequence in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
database (NCBI Reference Sequence: YP_009724390.1) was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pCG1
expression vector between BamHI and XbaI restriction sites. The MERS-CoV S cleavage mutants have
been described before17. pCAGGS_mCherry was generated upon cloning of the mCherry reporter gene
into the pCAGGS expression vector (primer sequences and cloning procedure are available upon
request). At 20 hours post-transfection, cells were infected with VSV-G-trans-complemented
VSV*ΔG(FLuc) (MOI=5) for 30 minutes at 37°C, washed with PBS, and further incubated for 1 hour
in cDMEM that was supplemented with Mab I1 (ATCC), a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed
to the VSV G protein. Cells were then washed and cDMEM was added back. Viral supernatant was
harvested at 16 – 24 hours post-infection. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (3,000 × g for
10 minutes) and used to inoculate 2 x 104 target cells in a 96-well plate (6 technical replicates). Cells
were incubated for 16–18 hours at 37°C before Fluc activity in cell lysates was detected using a plate
luminometer (EnSpire 2300 Multilabel reader by Perkin Elmer) and the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assays
System (Promega). Experiments with pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were performed as
previously described17.

Split luciferase fusion assay
The split luciferase fusion assay has been described before, with slight modifications54. Briefly, 6 x 105
293LTV cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CoV S proteins (pCAGGS-HCoV-229E,
pCAGGS-MERS-CoV) together with a split-luciferase construct (Rluc8155-156 DSP1-7). The empty
expression plasmid (pCAGGS-mCherry) as well as a construct encoding for VSV G served as negative
and positive control, respectively. 2 x 105 stable LY6E expressing or empty control Huh7 cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a plasmid encoding the second
half of the split-luciferase protein (Rluc8155-156 DSP8-11). Approximately 30 hours post-transfection,
both cell populations were dissociated (TryPLE Express, Gibco), counted, and equal cell numbers
(2x104 cells each) were co-cultured for 16 – 20 hours at 37°C. Supernatant was harvested and cells lysed
using ice-cold passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cells were immediately transferred to -80°C for at least

1 hour, before Rluc activity was determined using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Cells
were kept on ice during all times post-cell lysis to eliminate DSP post-lysis complementation.

Generation of recombinant VSV vector driving CoV S protein expression (VSV*∆G(CoV))
Following extraction of total RNA from MERS-CoV (strain EMC) infected VeroE6 cells, the cDNA
encoding the MERS-CoV S protein was generated by reverse transcription (RevertAid Premium
Reverse Transkriptase, ThermoScientific). Three overlapping cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR
(Phusion Hot Start II High Fidelity Polymerase, Thermo Scientific) and subsequently assembled by
overlapping PCR. The cDNAs encoding the S proteins of either MERS-CoV (strain EMC) or HCoV229E (truncated variant lacking the 10 amino acids at the C terminus, original plasmid pCAGGS-229E
S) were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pVSV* plasmid55 between MluI and BstEII restriction
sites. The resulting plasmids were used to generate the recombinant viruses VSV*ΔG(MERS S) and
VSV*ΔG(229E S) according to a published procedure56. All viruses were propagated on BHK-G43
cells57, resulting in viruses predominantly containing the homotypic VSV glycoprotein G in the
envelope.

Syncytia formation assay
Cells expressing LY6E or empty control were infected with VSV*ΔG(MERS S) or VSV*ΔG(229E S)
at a MOI of 0.01. At 20 hours post-infection, the cells were fixed with 3% PFA/PBS and the nuclei
stained with 4',6-diamidine-2'-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). An inverted fluorescence microscope
(Zeiss) was used to determine area percentage area covered by syncytia.
For heterologous cell-cell fusion assay, BHK-21 cells were infected with VSV*ΔG(CoV S) at a MOI of
1. After 2 hours, the cells were treated with trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland) and
resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS (2x104 cells/mL). The infected BHK-21 cell
suspension (500 µL) was seeded into 24-well cell culture plates along with LY6E- or empty controlexpressing Huh7 (1 x 104 cells). Cell co-cultures were incubated for 7 hours at 37°C, fixed with 3.6%

percentage area covered by syncytia was calculated as above.

Mice
Ly6etm1a ES cells were obtained from the EUCOMM consortium58 and microinjected into C57BL/6J
blastocysts by the UTSW Transgenic Technology Center. Chimeric mice with germline transmission
were bred to obtain Ly6etm1a/+ offspring. Ly6etm1a/+ mice were crossed with FLPe-expressing mice
(B6N.129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(FLP1)Dyn/J, #16226, Jackson Laboratories) to obtain Ly6efl/+ offspring,
which were bred to homozygosity. Conditional Ly6efl/fl mice were bred to Vav1-iCre transgenic mice
(B6.Cg-Commd10Tg(Vav1-icre)A2Kio/J, #008610, Jackson Laboratories) to obtain Ly6eΔHSC/+ (Ly6efl/+;
Vav1-iCre) offspring. Ly6eΔHSC/+ mice were bred to obtain Ly6eΔHSC (Ly6efl/fl; Vav1-iCre) offspring,
which harbor a deletion of exon 3 and 4 in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Experimental animals were
obtained by crossing Ly6eΔHSC and Ly6efl/fl mice. Genotype was confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA inhouse or outsourced to Transnetyx. Ablation of Ly6e was confirmed by qPCR in immune cells from
spleen, liver, or bone marrow. Animal studies were carried out in specific-pathogen-free barrier facilities
managed and maintained by the UTSW Animal Resource Center. All procedures used in this study
complied with federal and institutional guidelines enforced by the UTSW Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC).

In vivo infection, viral titers, liver ALT, and liver histology
Six to twelve-week-old female and male mice were injected intraperitoneally with MHV-A59 diluted in
PBS to the indicated titers or PBS for a mock infection control. All infected mice were monitored daily
for weight and mortality. Animals that lost more than 20% of their original body weight were euthanized
per IACUC guidelines.
Viral titers in liver and spleen were determined from frozen organs after weighing, homogenization, and
plaque assay on L929 cells. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured in fresh, unfrozen serum
using VITROS MicroSlide Technology by the UTSW Mouse Metabolic Core. Livers were fixed in 10%

eosin (H&E). Slides were analyzed by an independent pathologist (UTSW Animal Resource Center)
who was blinded to experimental conditions. A numerical score was assigned for degree of inflammation
and degree of necrosis for each liver. Inflammatory cell infiltration was scored using the following
criteria: 0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = marked. The necrosis score was defined
by the percent necrosis. 0 = none, 1 = <2%, 2 = 2-20%, 3 = 21-40%, and 4 = >40%.

Primary cell preparation for flow cytometry
All primary cells were maintained in 10% FBS/10 mM HEPES/1 mM sodium pyruvate/2 mM Lglutamine/1x p-s/RPMI (cRPMI2) unless otherwise indicated.
Primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were prepared as described previously60. Viable
cells were quantified using trypan blue exclusion. BMDM were plated at 2.5 x 104 cells per well in nontreated 24-well tissue culture plates. Cells were infected the next day with 0.1 MOI MHV-A59-GFP and
isolated 6 hours post-infection for analysis by flow cytometry.
Splenocytes were prepared by mashing whole spleens against a 70 µM cell strainer. Red blood cells
were removed by using RBC lysis buffer (Tonbo Biosciences). Viable cells were quantified using trypan
blue exclusion. For in vitro infection, splenocytes were plated at 1x106 cells per well in non-treated 6well tissue culture plates. Cells were infected the next day with 1 MOI MHV-A59-GFP and isolated 6
hours post-infection. Infected cells were stained with a fluorescent viability dye (Ghostdye Violet 450,
Tonbo Biosciences) and fixed in 1% PFA/PBS. The next day, fixed cells were treated with antiCD16/CD32 (Tonbo Biosciences) and then stained with antibodies that recognize surface lineage
markers and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Livers were perfused by PBS injection into the inferior vena cava and out of the portal vein. Blanched
livers were minced with sterile scissors and mashed against a 70 µM cell strainer. Hepatocytes and large
debris were pelleted at 60 x g for 1 minute, 22°C, with no brake. Intrahepatic immune cell (IHIC) and
residual hepatocyte containing supernatants were pelleted at 480 x g for 8 minutes, 22°C, with max
brake and resuspended in 37.5% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich)/cRPMI2. Remaining hepatocytes were

separated from IHIC by centrifugation at 850 x g for 30 minutes, 22°C, with no brake. Red blood cells
were removed from the resulting pellet with RBC lysis buffer (Tonbo Biosciences). Viable cells were
quantified using trypan blue exclusion. IHIC and splenocytes (4 x 105) from infected or mock-infected
mice were stained with a fluorescent viability dye (Ghostdye Violet 450, Tonbo Biosciences), treated
with anti-CD16/CD32 (Tonbo Biosciences), stained with antibodies that recognize surface lineage
markers, and then fixed in 1% PFA/PBS. Fixed volumes of cell suspensions were analyzed by flow
cytometry the next day. Absolute cell counts were determined by multiplying final number of lineage
marker-positive cells by dilution factor used to normalize cell counts for antibody staining.
All primary cell samples were resuspended in 3% FBS/PBS and analyzed using a S1000 Flow Cytometer
with a A600 96-well plate high throughput extension and compensated using CellCapture software
(Stratedigm). Data was analyzed with FlowJo Software (Treestar). The flow gating strategy for liver
and spleen immune cells is included in Extended Data Figure 9.

(VSV*∆G(CoV)) and heterologous cell-cell fusion assay.
a, Schematic depiction of the generation of recombinant VSV*∆G(CoV S) expressing both CoV S
protein and GFP reporter protein. The respective CoV S genes were inserted into the genomic VSV*∆G
cDNA and recombinant virus was generated in BHK-G43 cells expressing the VSV G protein. The
recombinant virus produced in this way harbored the VSV G protein in the envelope allowing CoV S
protein-independent infection of cells. Infection of cells with VSV*∆G(CoV S) led to the expression of
CoV S protein and consequent syncytia formation. b, Heterologous syncytia formation assay. BHK-21
cells were infected with VSV G protein trans-complemented VSV*∆G(CoV S) viruses or were mockinfected, followed by co-culture with LY6E or empty control Huh7 cells. Syncytia formation was

293LTV (Cell Biolabs), and A549 cells (ATCC cat# CCL-185) were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium-GlutaMAX (Gibco) supplemented with, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 100 IU/ml
penicillin (Gibco) and 1% (w/v) non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco) (cDMEM) BHK-21 (ATCC
cat# CCL-10) were maintained in Glasgow’s minimal essential medium (MEM) with 5% FBS and 1%
tryptose. BHK-G4357 were cultured in Glasgow’s minimal essential medium with 5% FBS. 17Cl1
fibroblasts (gift from S.G. Sawicki) were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat
inactivated FBS, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 100 IU/ml penicillin. Cells were either newly purchased
or cell line identities (human cells only) verified by a Multiplex human cell line authentication test.
Huh7 cells expressing TMPRSS2 were generated as follows. In order to generate TMPRSS2-encoding
retroviral vectors, the open reading frame of human TMPRRS2 was first PCR amplified with primers
adding an N-terminal cMYC epitope to the TMPRSS2 coding sequence. The resulting sequence was
inserted into a modified version of the pQCXIP plasmid that contains a blasticidin resistance cassette
instead of the usual puromycin resistance cassette17. Huh7 cells stably expressing human TMPRSS2
were generated by retroviral transduction and selection with the antibiotic blasticidin (50 µg/ml).
Following selection, cells were maintained in culture medium (cDMEM) supplemented with 10 µg/ml
blasticidin. To generate STAT1-/-_CEACAM1 cells, human STAT1−/− fibroblasts were transduced with
lentiviruses encoding for the murine CoV receptor CEACAM1 (kind gift from David Wentworth, CDC,
Atlanta, USA59 and subsequently selected with 1 µg/mL puromycin. Stable LY6E expressing cell lines
were generated upon lentiviral transduction with SCRPSY LY6E or as control SCRPSY Empty in
DMEM containing 4 µg/ml polybrene (Millipore) and 20 mM HEPES buffer solution (Gibco). Cells

were selected using 2-4 µg/mL puromycin and were passaged until all cells in control wells without
lentivirus were killed. The puromycin selected cells were further passaged and frozen down for
subsequent experiments. The stable cell lines harboring LY6E orthologues have been described before,
with the exception of C. dromedarius9. For this, a gBlock was ordered (XM_031439745.1) and Gateway
cloning performed as described previously to generate pENTR and pSCRPSY plasmids9. Constructs
encoding for Ly6/uPAR family members and LY6E ASM mutants have been described before9.

To generate clonal LY6E KO cells and CRISPR-resistant LY6E, A549 cells were transduced with
lentivirus containing a LY6E-specific sgRNA and Cas9 as described previously9. To generate a clonal
cell line, the bulk transduced population was plated at single cell dilutions. Candidate clones were
screened by Western blot for LY6E expression and Sanger sequencing. Silent mutations in the region
targeted by the LY6E-specific sgRNA were introduced into HA-tagged LY6E to generate CRISPRresistant LY6E (CR LY6E). LY6E KO A549 cells were reconstituted with CR-LY6E by lentiviral
transduction and expression confirmed by Western blot.

All cell lines were regularly tested to check they were free of mycoplasma contamination using a
commercially available system (PCR Mycoplasma test kit I/RT Variant C, PromKine).

ISG screen.
The ISG screen was performed as described previously with slight modifications7,8. Briefly, 5 x 103
Huh7 cells were seeded, transduced with individual lentiviruses, and 48 hours post-transduction infected
with HCoV-229E at 33°C. Infection was stopped 24 hours (MOI=0.1) or 48 hours (MOI=0.01) postinfection and plates were immuno-stained as described previously61 with an anti-HCoV-229E N protein
antibody and a AlexaFluor488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Extended methods;
Antibodies for immunofluorescence and flow cytometry). For high-content high-throughput imaging
analysis ImageXpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used as previously
described8. Hits were normalized to cells expressing the empty vector. Depicted are genes that were

expressed in two independent screens with a transduction efficiency of at least 1 % (cut off). ISGs which
were cytotoxic for the cells were excluded from the analysis. Normalized data can be found in Extended
Data Table 1 and Extended Data Table 2.

Western blotting.
For SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, lysates from cultured cells were prepared using the M-PER
Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete
Mini, Roche). Proteins were separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), and
electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes (in a Mini Trans-Blot cell (eBlot L1 GenScript). Membranes
were incubated in PBS 0.1% Tween (Merck Millipore) 5% milk (Dietisa, Biosuisse), probed with the
respective primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies. LY6E was detected using anti-LY6E rabbit monoclonal antibody GEN-93-8-1
(Genentech) at a dilution of 1:5,000 and secondary Peroxidase-AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG
(Jackson Immunoresearch, 711-035-152) at a dilution of 1:10,000. MERS-CoV spike was detected
using the monoclonal anti-human 1.6c7 ab (0.12 mg/ml)62 (kindly provided by B.J. Bosch) at a dilution
of 1:1,000 and a secondary Peroxidase-AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch,
709-035-098) at a dilution of 1:10,000. β-actin was detected using Monoclonal Anti-β-Actin-Peroxidase
clone AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, A3854) at a dilution of 1:25,000. Proteins were visualized using
WesternBright enhanced chemiluminescence horseradish peroxidase substrate (Advansta) and
quantified in a Fusion FX7 Spectra (Vilber-Lourmat). Bands were quantified using the respective
software (FusionCapt Software Version 18.05).

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
Viral RNA was extracted from cell lysates (NucleoMag-96RNA kit, Macherey Nagel) or supernatant
(NucleoMag-Vet kit, Macherey Nagel) using the KingFisher Flex robot according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. The commercially available TaqManTM Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) was used for RT-qPCR with 2 µl of RNA input added to 8 µl of prepared mastermix per

for HCoV-229E (contains the M gene of HCoV-229E63). Intracellular viral RNA was normalized to
total RNA (determined via the housekeeping gene Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M)). Cellular RNA was
extracted from cell lysates of Huh7 cells using the Nucleospin RNA kit (Machery Nagel) according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations, quantified via NanoDrop, and used to generate a standard curve.
PCR conditions are available upon request.

Cellular CD13 expression
LY6E expressing or control cells were dissociated (TryPLE Express, Gibco) and enumerated. 3 x 105
cells were stained in duplicate using Zombie Aqua™ Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were resuspended in 0.1% FBS/PBS and stained for CD13
expression (See ‘Antibodies for immunofluorescence and flow cytometry’). Cells were washed with
0.1% FBS/PBS and resuspend in equal volumes. Cell suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry
using a FACS Canto (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo Software (Treestar).

Binding experiment
Stable LY6E expressing or control Huh7 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate (4 x 104 cells) and mock
infected or inoculated with HCoV-229E (MOI=5) in OptiMEM (Gibco) on ice for 1 hour. Cells were
washed at least 3x with PBS and harvested immediately (t=0 h) or incubated at 33°C for 24 hours (t=24
h), before cell lysis and extraction of viral RNA as described above. Viral RNA was detected via RTqPCR normalized to the housekeeping gene B2M as described above.

Time course experiment

Nagel), followed by RT-qPCR as described before, or cells were lysed using the Renilla Luciferase
Assay System kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and Rluc activity
determined. To determine extracellular viral replication, viral supernatant was harvested, and viral RNA
extracted (NucleoMag-Vet kit, Macherey Nagel), followed by RT-qPCR as described before. To
determine intracellular infectivity, cells were subjected to 3 rounds of freeze/thaw cycles, centrifuged to
remove debris (4,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant titrated on naïve Huh7 cells. To determine
extracellular infectivity, supernatant was harvested at the indicated time points and titrated on naïve
Huh7 cells. For titration, 1 x 104 Huh7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and infected with 22 µl of
virus containing supernatant and incubated at 33°C. Cells were lysed 24 hours post-infection and
infectivity determined using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.

Protease inhibitor treatment
To test various protease inhibitors, 2 x 104 naïve or TMPRSS2-expressing, control or LY6E cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate. One day post seeding, cells were pre-treated with the following compounds
for 1 hour in OptiMEM, at 37°C: DMSO (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich), E64 D (10 µM, Sigma-Aldrich),
and/or Camostat (100 µM, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were mock infected or infected with HCoV-229ERluc (MOI 0.1) in the presence of the inhibitors for 2 hours at 33°C. Medium was changed to DMEM
and cells incubated for 24 hours at 33°C. Cells were lysed and Rluc activity detected using the Renilla
Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Spike cleavage assays.
LY6E expressing or control Huh7 (2 x 105 cells) were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates. Cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with an expression plasmid encoding for MERSCoV S (pCAGGS-MERS S). Cell lysates were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and subjected to
Western blot analysis as described.

RNA isolation from primary tissues
Sections of liver and spleen were preserved in RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and frozen. Thawed samples were transferred to PBS and homogenized. One-eighth of the
homogenate was mixed with TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). BMDM were directly lysed in
TRIzol Reagent and frozen. Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Liver
and spleen RNA were subject to DNase treatment (TURBO DNA-Free kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
per the manufacturer’s protocol prior to RNA-Seq analysis. BMDM RNA was analyzed by one-step
qRT-PCR using QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) using Applied Biosciences 7500 Fast
Real-Time PCR System.

RNA library construction and sequencing
The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA was assessed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific qubit 2.0
fluorometer with the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q10211) and an Advanced
Analytical Fragment Analyzer System using a Fragment Analyzer RNA Kit (Agilent, DNF-471),
respectively. Sequencing libraries were prepared using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library
Prep Gold kit (Illumina, 20020599) in combination with TruSeq RNA UD Indexes (Illumina, 20022371)
according to the Illumina guidelines. Sequencing libraries were sequenced paired-end (2 x 50 bp) using
an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (100 cycles; Illumina, 20012865) on an Illumina NovaSeq
6000 sequencer. The quality control assessments, generation of libraries and sequencing run were all
performed at the Next Generation Sequencing Platform, University of Bern, Switzerland.

Data generated from individual samples (>30 million read per sample, single read 50-mers) were
mapped separately against the GRCm38 murine reference genome. Gene expression was calculated for
individual transcripts as reads per kilobase per million bases mapped (RPKM). All transcriptomic
analyses were performed using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (Qiagen, Aarhaus).
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by calculating fold changes in expression, pvalues were corrected by taking false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple comparison into account.
Mus Musculus EBI Gene Ontology Annotation Database was used to execute Gene ontology (GO)
Enrichment Analyses for biological processes. Gene identifiers for DEGs absolute FC > 5, RPKM > 2)
were used as input and identification of significantly enriched GO categories. P-values for specific GO
categories were generated after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Z-scores, used as indicator
for activation of biological processes (positive value) or inactivation (negative value), were calculated
based on the expression fold change as follows:
