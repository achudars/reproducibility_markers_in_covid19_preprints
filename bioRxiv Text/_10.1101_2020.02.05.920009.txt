Abstract

The recent outbreak of a new zoonotic origin Coronavirus has ring the bell for the
potential spread of epidemic Coronavirus crossing the species. With the urgent
needs to assist the control of the Coronavirus spread and to provide valuable
scientific information, we developed a coronavirus database (CoVdb), an online
genomics and proteomics analysis platform. Based on public available coronavirus
genomic information, the database annotates the genome of every strain and
identifies 780 possible ORFs of all strains available in Genebank. In addition, the
comprehensive evaluation of all the published genomes of Coronavirus strains,
including population genetics analysis, functional analysis and structural analysis on a
historical and global scale were presented in the CoVdb. In the database, the
researcher can easily obtain the basic information of a Coronavirus gene with the
distribution of the gene among strains, conserved or high mutation regions, possible
subcellular location and topology of the gene. Moreover, sliding windows for
population genetics analysis results is provided, thereby facilitating genetics and
evolutional analysis at the genomic level. CoVdb can be accessed freely at
http://covdb.popgenetics.net.

Introduction

Coronavidae is a group of positive-sense, single-strand RNA viruses with a likely
ancient origin, and human Coronavirus repeatedly emerged during the past handred
years1. Coronaviruses are classified into four distinct genera: alpha and beta
Coronavirus mainly infect mammals, whereas gamma and delta Coronavirus more
2

circulate in avian hosts . As a potential dangerous zoonotic disease, the previous
outbreaks of respiratory syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have plagued the general
public and researchers in the past years 3. Recently, a new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),
which may originated from wild animals, first identified in Wuhan city, China. Till now
it has been resulted in more than fourteen thousand confirmed infections in China

4, 5

with the cases number is still increasing. Although we have knowledge and
experience in the virology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and other aspects
related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there are many unanswered questions about the
new emerging 2019-nCoV. The new Coronavirus outbreak in China strongly reminds
the continued threat of zoonotic diseases caused by Coronavirus to global health
security. Sharing experience and knowledge from across disciplines in the historical
and global scale should provide valuable scientific knowledge to fight against the
threat of Coronavirus.
The aim of the construction of CoVdb is to provide Coronavirus knowledge, to
contribute to global Coronavirus research, especially for the investigation of the
emerging 2019-nCoV. For previous works, ViPR6 and ViralZone7 are general data
resources and is lack of analysis tools in population genomics and evolution. In
contrast, CoVdb is specially designed for Coronavirus. It combines, compares, and
annotates all the published Coronavirus genomes up to date8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19

. The new developed database provides the convenience for the identification of

gene function and identity among the Coronaviridae genomes. CoVdb provides
information on subcellular location, functions, proteins topology, as well as
population level thorough analysis results. We will be dedicated to keep updating all

Result and discussions

Data and information
CoVdb extensively collects published Coronavirus genome data (Table S1), including
104 strains are of 780 possible ORFs. In average, there are 5-14 possible protein
coding genes in each strain. Although the structure of Coronavirus (Figure 1) is not
complex, we still performed a subcellular localization analysis of the Coronavirus
genes to predict their roles in the infection process with addition to the previous
research. Base on prediction only, 27% of the proteins are predicted to be located in
the host nucleus or host cytoplasm (Figure S1). 32% of the Coronavirus genes are
predict to be membrane proteins. In gene ontology, Coronavirus genes enrich in
association to the membrane (Figure S2). Moreover, based on the population
genetics test analysis, we found that 2242 regions are of a significantly low Tajima’s
D20 and significantly high composite likelihood ratio, CLR21,

22

(Rank Test,

P-value<0.05), indicating that these genes were recently possibly under positive
selection (Table S2). These regions deposited in 400 genes, and most of the regions
are located at ORF1 of the virus genome. Among all these 2242 regions, 98 are
located in the noncoding region and 30 are located in the coding regions of
non-structural proteins. We also found that most high CLR regions (1452, 64.8%) are
at the protein ORF1ab (Table S3). These positive selection regions may involve in the
adaptive mutations related to the virus replication and infection. The results are
informative for future Coronavirus research and epidemiological survey.
We identified 322 Coronavirus gene clusters from the genomes of 104 strains (for
details, see Materials and Methods). Using the genomes documented in CoVdb, we
generated the phylogenetic tree of Coronavirus (Figure 2). The tree indicates that
2019-nCoV is of close relationship with SARS-CoV and may arrive from bat.
Coronavirus strains extracted from human are always surrounded by strains
extracted from bats, indicating bats may be the main source leading to the infection
of Coronavirus in human world (Figure S3).

Interface and main functions
The genome browser page follows a style with analysis tracks (Pi, Theta23, Tajima’s
20

D , and CLR

21, 22

) listed following gene segments (Figure S4). CoVdb are equipped

with other general genome browser tools like UCSC genome browser24. In addition to
basic information, CoVdb show gene information mainly in cell, protein structure and
evolutionary signatures.
The search engine in CoVdb is powerful and supports fuzzy search, BLAT and Blast.
CoVdb also allows to search by cell location, function, evolutionary test parameters
and protein structure parameters (Figure 3). To facilitate personalized gene list
analysis, CoVdb provides gene links through inputting a range of genomic locations or
a list of genes’ accession numbers.

Conclusion

Dedicated to assist the researcher to combat the pandemic of 2019-nCoV, and to
provide a more specialized platform for Coronavirus, we comprehensively gathered
data and systematically constructed the Coronavirus Database, CoVdb. With the help
of this database, we have successfully developed a novel tool (unpublished) to detect
2019-nCoV and the program is in the process to be put into production. Researchers
can conveniently retrieve Coronavirus genomic and gene information from CoVdb.
Hopefully, this database will play more important roles in fighting against the
infection of Coronavirus.

Materials and methods

Gene Information, subcellular localization and topology prediction
Coronavirus sequences and annotations are downloaded from the NCBI genome
database. For strains without ORF annotations, we reannotated the genomes
through mapping known Coronavirus genes to the genome, requiring identity > 50%
and coverage > 80%. Then, we verified the quality of these proteins by known
proteins. We kept predicted proteins with both identity and coverage higher than 0.5.
According to previous homologous gene identification methods

25, 26

, we also we

performed pairwise alignments for all protein sequence, using CD-HIT27 with the
parameters of identity > 90% and coverage > 70%. In this way Coronavirus proteins
are clustered into 322 unified gene clusters.
We wrote PERL scripts to automatically
against the UniProt protein database

28

BLAST Coronavirus protein sequence

and took the hits with the highest scores as

the best matches requiring E-value <0.05. Using the accession number of matched
UniProt proteins, we retrieved detailed proteomics information from UniProt. In the
same way, we also acquired protein 3D structure information from PDB database29,
30

.

We did the subcellular localization prediction of all Coronavirus genes using an online
tool MSLVP31 We used TMHMM 2.032 to predict the transmembrane helixes within
protein sequences, and converted output images into PNG format by Magick
(www.imagemagick.org).

Evolutionary analysis
We utilized CUDA clustalW

33

to perform a whole genome alignment of all

Coronavirus genomes. The results are used to built a phylogenetic tree by FastTree
2.134. We did genomic level alignment by LASTZ35 , did sequence level alignment by
MUSCLE36, 37 and made phylogenetic trees by FastTree 2.134.

To detect selection signals, we did sliding widow analysis for each genome
(window=200 bp, step=50 bp) and did post analysis by VariScan 2.038, 39 as well as
SweepFineder240. For each gene, we used the median of population genetics test
statistics as the corresponding value.

The building of CoVdb
The web interface of CoVdb is on the basis of SWAV41. CoVdb also incorporates
MSAViewer42 to display multiple alignments and phylotree.js43 to show the
phylogenetic trees. To fit the requirement to display virus data, we made changes in
these two softwares, such as changing parameters to fit virus’s dense gene
arrangements and adding links within diagrams. The search engine is written by PHP
integrated with SQL, BLAT44 and NCBI BLAST45.
