Abstract:
A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was recently identified in patients with an acute respiratory
syndrome, COVID-19. To compare its pathogenesis with that of previously emerging
coronaviruses, we inoculated cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV and
compared with historical SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was
excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II
pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity. In SARSCoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV
infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes. These data show that SARSCoV-2 can cause a COVID-19-like disease, and suggest that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection
is intermediate between that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Following the first reports of an outbreak of an acute respiratory syndrome (2019 coronavirus
disease, or COVID-19) in China in December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was
identified (1, 2). As of March 14, 2020, over 140,000 cases were reported worldwide with over
5,400 deaths, surpassing the combined number of cases and deaths of two previously emerging
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (3). COVID-19 is characterized by a range of
symptoms, including fever, cough, dyspnoea and myalgia in most cases (2). In severe cases,
bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity is the most common chest CT finding (4).
Similar to the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS, severity of COVID-19 disease is associated with
increased age and/or a comorbidity, although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups (5).
However, despite the large number of cases and deaths, limited information is available on the
pathogenesis of this virus infection. Two reports on the histological examination of the lungs of
three patients showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), pulmonary oedema and hyaline
membrane formation, indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as
characteristic syncytial cells in the alveolar lumen (6, 7), similar to findings during the 2002/2003
outbreak of SARS-CoV (8). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection was previously studied in
a non-human primate model where aged animals were more likely to develop disease (9-13). In
the current study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was characterized in the same animal model, using
cynomolgus macaques, and compared with infection with MERS-CoV and historical data on
SARS-CoV (9, 10, 12).
First, two groups of four cynomolgus macaques (both young adult, 4-5 years of age; and aged, 1520 years of age) were inoculated via a combined intratracheal (IT) and intranasal (IN) route with
a SARS-CoV-2 strain from a German traveller returning from China. No overt clinical signs were
observed in any of the infected animals, with the exception of a serous nasal discharge in one aged
animal on day 14 post inoculation (p.i.). No significant weight loss was observed in any of the
animals during the study. By day 14 p.i. all remaining animals seroconverted as revealed by the

As a measure of virus shedding, nasal, throat and rectal swabs were assayed for virus by RT-qPCR
and virus culture. In nasal swabs, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA peaked by day 2 p.i. in young
adult animals and day 4 p.i. in aged animals and was detected up to at least day 8 p.i. in two out of
four animals and up to day 21 p.i. in one out of four animals (Fig. 1A). Overall, higher levels of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in nasal swabs of aged animals compared to young adult
animals. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat swabs peaked at day 1 p.i. in young adult and day
4 p.i. in aged animals and decreased more rapidly over time, compared to nasal swabs, but could
still be detected intermittently up to day 10 p.i. (Fig. 1B). Low levels of infectious virus could be
cultured from nasal and throat swabs up to day 4 and 2 respectively (Table S1). SARS-CoV-2
RNA could only be detected in a rectal swab from 1 animal on day 14 p.i. and no viral RNA could
be detected in whole blood at any time point throughout the study.
Upon autopsy of four macaques on day 4 p.i., two had foci of pulmonary consolidation in the lungs
(Fig. 2A). One animal (aged: 17 years) in the right middle lobe, representing less than 5% of the
lung tissue. A second animal (young adult: 5 years) had two foci in the left lower lobe, representing
about 10% of the lung tissue (Fig. 2A). The consolidated lung tissue was well-circumscribed, redpurple, level, and less buoyant than normal. The other organs in these two macaques, as well as
the respiratory tract and other organs of the other two animals were normal.
Virus replication was assessed by RT-qPCR on day 4 p.i. in tissues from the respiratory, digestive
urinary, and cardiovascular tracts, from endocrine and central nervous systems, as well as from
various lymphoid tissues. Virus replication was primarily restricted to the respiratory tract (nasal
cavity, trachea, bronchi and lung lobes) with highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lungs (Fig.
1C). Interestingly, in three out of four animals, SARS-CoV- RNA was also detected in ileum and
tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes (Fig. 1C).
The main histological lesion in the consolidated pulmonary tissue involved the alveoli and
bronchioles, and consisted of areas with acute or more advanced DAD (Fig. 2B). In these areas,
the lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with protein-rich oedema fluid, fibrin,
and cellular debris, a moderate number of alveolar macrophages, and fewer neutrophils and
lymphocytes (Fig. 2C-E). There was epithelial necrosis with extensive loss of epithelium from
alveolar and bronchiolar walls. Hyaline membranes were present in a few damaged alveoli. In
areas with more advanced lesions, the alveolar walls were moderately thickened and lined by
cuboidal epithelial cells (type II pneumocyte hyperplasia), and the alveolar lumina were empty.
Alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened by oedema fluid, mononuclear cells, and
neutrophils. There were aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels. Moderate
numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of
the bronchial walls, and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium. Regeneration of epithelium
was seen in some bronchioles, visible as an irregular layer of squamous to high cuboidal epithelial
cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. There were occasional multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) free
in the lumina of bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 2F), and, based on positive pan-keratin staining and
negative CD68 staining, originated from epithelial cells (Fig. 2F, inset).

SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression was detected in moderate numbers of type I pneumocytes and a
few type II pneumocytes in foci of DAD (Fig. 2G, fig. S2). The pattern of staining was similar to
that in lung tissue from SARS-CoV-infected macaques (positive control). SARS-CoV-2 antigen
expression was not observed in any of the syncytia. In the upper respiratory tract, there was focal
or locally extensive SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in epithelial cells of mucous glands in the
nasal cavity (septum or concha) of all four macaques, without any associated histological lesions
(fig. 2I).
In order to assess the severity of infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared to that with the previously
emerged MERS-CoV, young adult cynomolgus macaques (3-5 years of age) were inoculated with
MERS-CoV via the IN and IT route. All animals remained free of clinical signs. At day 21 p.i., all
remaining animals (n=2) seroconverted as revealed by the presence of MERS-CoV specific
antibodies in their sera by ELISA.
MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal (Fig. 3A) and throat swabs (Fig. 3B) from days 1 to 11
p.i., with peaks on days 1 and 2 p.i., respectively. Low levels of MERS-CoV RNA were detected
in rectal swabs on days 2 and 3 p.i. (data not shown).
Upon autopsy of four macaques at day 4 p.i., three out of four macaques had foci of pulmonary
consolidation, characterized by slightly depressed areas in the lungs, representing less than 5 % of
the lung tissue (Table 1). Similar to SARS-CoV-2, on day 4 p.i., MERS-CoV RNA was primarily
detected in the respiratory tract of inoculated animals (Fig. 3C). Infectious virus titres were
comparable to SARS-CoV-2, but lower compared to SARS-CoV infection of young adult
macaques (Table 1). In addition, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in the spleen (Table 1).
Consistent with the presence of virus in the lower respiratory tract at day 4 p.i., histopathological
changes characteristic for DAD were observed in the lungs of inoculated animals (Fig. 3D). The
alveolar septa were thickened due to infiltration of few neutrophils and macrophages, and
moderate type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy. In the alveolar lumina, there were
increased numbers of alveolar macrophages and occasionally small amounts of oedema fluid with
fibrin and few neutrophils (Fig. 3D). Few syncytial cells were seen in the alveolar lumina.
Interestingly, MERS-CoV antigen was not detected in tissues on day 4 p.i. in any part of the
respiratory tract. Therefore, four young adult macaques were included at an earlier time point, day
1 p.i. On day 1 p.i. there was multifocal expression of viral antigen predominantly in type II
pneumocytes and occasionally in type I pneumocytes, bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells
and few macrophages (Fig 3D).
In summary, we inoculated young adult and aged cynomolgus macaques with a low passage
clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2, which resulted in productive infection in the absence of overt
clinical signs. Increased age did not affect disease outcome, but there was prolonged viral shedding
in the upper respiratory tract of aged animals. Prolonged shedding has been observed in both
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV patients (14, 15). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 in our model, peaked
early in the course of infection, similar to what is seen in patients (14). This earlier peak in virus
shedding for SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to influenza virus shedding (16) than SARS-CoV,
where shedding peaked around day 10 post onset of symptoms (15), and may explain why case
detection and isolation may not be as effective for SARS-CoV-2 as it was for the control of SARSCoV (17). Also, all four macaques expressed SARS-CoV-2 antigen in mucous glands of the nasal

cavity at day 4 p.i., which was not seen for SARS-CoV (9-11) or MERS-CoV infections (this
manuscript) in this animal model. Viral tropism for the nasal mucosa fits with efficient respiratory
transmission, as has been seen for influenza A virus (18). SARS-CoV-2 was primarily detected in
tissues of the respiratory tract, however SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detectable in other tissues
such as intestines, in line with a recent report (19).
Two out of four animals had foci of DAD on day 4 p.i. The colocalisation of SARS-CoV-2-antigen
expression and DAD provides strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused this lesion. The
histological character of the DAD, including alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, alveolar
oedema, hyaline membrane formation, and accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages and
lymphocytes, corresponds with the limited pathological analyses of human COVID-19 cases (6,
7). In particular, the presence of syncytia in the lung lesions is characteristic of respiratory
coronavirus infections. Whereas MERS-CoV primarily infects type II pneumocytes in cynomolgus
macaques, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 also infect type I pneumocytes. Injury to type I
pneumocytes can result in pulmonary oedema, and formation of hyaline membranes (20), which
may explain why hyaline membrane formation is a hallmark for SARS and COVID-19 (7, 10), but
not frequently reported for MERS (21, 22).
These data show that cynomolgus macaques are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, shed virus
for a prolonged period of time and display COVID-19-like disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused
histopathological changes in the lungs that appeared to be intermediate in severity between those
from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections established by similar inoculation doses and routes.
An in-depth comparison of infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in this
model may identify key pathways in the pathogenesis of these emerging viruses. This study
provides a novel infection model which will be critical in the evaluation and licensure of preventive
and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection for use in humans, as well as evaluating
the efficacy of repurposing species specific existing treatments, such as pegylated interferon (12).
