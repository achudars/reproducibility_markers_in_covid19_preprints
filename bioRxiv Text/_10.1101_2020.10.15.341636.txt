Abstract

44

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes

45

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic. Antibodies are powerful

46

biotherapeutics to fight viral infections; however, discovery of the most potent and broadly acting

47

clones can be lengthy. Here, we used the human apoferritin protomer as a modular subunit to drive

48

oligomerization of antibody fragments and transform antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into

49

exceptionally potent neutralizers. Using this platform, half-maximal inhibitory concentration

50

(IC50) values as low as 9 ´ 10-14 M were achieved as a result of up to 10,000-fold potency

51

enhancements. Combination of three different antibody specificities and the fragment

52

crystallizable (Fc) domain on a single multivalent molecule conferred the ability to overcome viral

53

sequence variability together with outstanding potency and Ig-like in vivo bioavailability. This

54

MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody; or MB) platform contributes a new class

55

of medical countermeasures against COVID-19 and an efficient approach to rapidly deploy potent

56

and broadly-acting therapeutics against infectious diseases of global health importance.

Introduction

65

The continuous threat to public health from respiratory viruses such as the novel SARS-CoV-2

66

underscores the urgent need to rapidly develop and deploy prophylactic and therapeutic

67

interventions to combat pandemics. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used effectively for

68

the treatment of infectious diseases as exemplified by palivizumab for the prevention of respiratory

69

syncytial virus in high-risk infants1 or Zmapp, mAb114 and REGN-EB3 for the treatment of

70

Ebola2. Consequently, mAbs targeting the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been a focus

71

for the development of medical countermeasures against COVID-19. To date, several antibodies

72

targeting the S protein have been identified3–19 and several are under clinical evaluation20,21.

73

Receptor binding domain (RBD)-directed mAbs that interfere with binding to angiotensin

74

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for cell entry22, are usually associated with high

75

neutralization potencies11,12,14.

76

mAbs can be isolated by B-cell sorting from infected donors, immunized animals or by identifying

77

binders in pre-assembled libraries. Despite these methodologies being robust and reliable for the

78

discovery of virus-specific mAbs, identification of the best antibody clone can be a lengthy

79

process. For example, RNA viruses have a high mutation rate. Indeed, 198 naturally occurring

80

mutations in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been already registered in the GISAID database23.

81

Identification of broadly neutralizing mAbs (bnAbs) that target the most conserved epitopes to

82

overcome viral escape mutations is therefore critical. This approach has been employed to discover

83

bnAbs against human immune deficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)24, Influenza25, and Ebola26. However,

84

their identification required extensive sampling and high-throughput sequencing and consequently

85

several years of research. Hence, there is an unmet need for the development of a platform that

4

86

bridges antibody discovery and the rapid identification and deployment of highly potent and

87

broadly neutralizing mAbs.

88

The potency of an antibody is greatly affected by its ability to simultaneously interact multiple

89

times with its epitope27–29. This enhanced apparent affinity, known as avidity, has been previously

90

reported to increase the neutralization potency of nanobodies30,31 and IgGs over Fabs9,16,18 against

91

SARS-CoV-2. In order to rapidly propel mAbs that emerge during initial screening efforts into

92

potent neutralizers against SARS-CoV-2, we have developed an antibody-scaffold technology,

93

using the human apoferritin protomer as a modular subunit, to multimerize antibody fragments.

94

We demonstrate the ability of this technology to combine one to three different Fab specificities

95

together with Fc on the same molecule. The resulting MB molecules can increase mAb potency

96

by up to four orders of magnitude and resist sequence variability in the spike protein. Therefore,

97

the MB offers a versatile “plug-and-play” platform to enhance anti-viral characteristics of

98

prophylactic/therapeutic molecules in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and to be

99

quickly deployed in the setting of emerging pandemics.

Avidity enhances neutralization potency

103

We used the self-assembly of the light chain of human apoferritin to multimerize antigen binding

104

moieties targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. Apoferritin protomers self-assemble into an

105

octahedrally symmetric structure with an ~6 nm hydrodynamic radius (Rh) composed of 24

106

identical polypeptides32. The N terminus of each apoferritin subunit points outwards of the

107

spherical nanocage and is therefore accessible for the genetic fusion of proteins of interest. Upon

108

folding, apoferritin protomers act as building blocks that drive the multimerization of the 24

109

proteins fused to their N termini (Fig. 1a).

110

First, we investigated the impact of multivalency on the ability of the single chain variable domain

111

VHH-72 to block viral infection. VHH-72 has been previously described to neutralize SARS-CoV-

112

2 when fused to a Fc domain, but not in its monovalent format30. The light chain of human

113

apoferritin displaying 24 copies of VHH-72 assembled into monodisperse, well-formed spherical

114

particles (Fig. 1b-c) and showed an enhanced binding avidity to the S protein (Fig. 1d) in

115

comparison to bivalent VHH-72-Fc. Strikingly, display of VHH-72 on the light chain of human

116

apoferritin achieved a 1000-fold increase in neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2

117

pseudovirus (PsV) compared to the conventional Fc fusion (Fig. 1e).

118
119

Multabodies have IgG-like properties

120

The Fc confers in vivo half-life and effector functions to IgGs through interaction with neonatal

121

Fc receptor (FcRn) and Fc gamma receptors (FcγR), respectively. To confer these IgG-like

122

properties to the MB, we next sought to incorporate both Fabs and Fc domains. Because a Fab is

123

a hetero-dimer consisting of a light and a heavy chain, and the Fc is a homodimer, we created

124

single-chain Fab (scFab) and Fc (scFc) polypeptide constructs to allow for their direct fusion to

125

the N terminus of the apoferritin protomer. As a first step, we generated a species-matched

126

surrogate molecule that consists of mouse light chain apoferritin fusions to a mouse scFab and a

127

mouse scFc (IgG2a subtype), or a modified mouse scFc (LALAP mutation) to assess their,

128

biodistribution, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics in vivo (Fig. S1). As expected, binding

129

affinity of the WT MB to mouse Fc receptors was enhanced in comparison to the parental IgG and

6

130

the LALAP mutation reduced binding affinity to FcγR1 (Fig. S1a) Subcutaneous administration

131

of these MBs in C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice was well tolerated with no decrease in body weight or

132

visible adverse events. In vivo bioavailability and biodistribution of the MB were similar to the

133

parental IgG (Fig. S1b and c). Confirming the role of the Fc in mediating in vivo bioavailability,

134

serum half-life could be extended by mutations in the Fc (Fig. S1b). Presumably because all

135

sequences derived from the host, the MB did not induce an anti-drug antibody response in mice

136

(Fig. S1d).

137

In view of these results, we aimed to generate MBs derived from the previously reported IgG

138

BD235 and 4A86 that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD),

139

respectively. Addition of scFcs into the MB reduces the number of scFabs that can be

140

multimerized. In order to endow the MB platform with Fc without compromising Fab avidity and

141

hence neutralization potency, we engineered the apoferritin protomer to accommodate more than

142

24 components per particle. Based on its four-helical bundle fold, the human apoferritin protomer

143

was split into two halves: the two N-terminal a helices (N-Ferritin) and the two C-terminal a

144

helices (C-Ferritin). In this configuration, the scFc fragment of human IgG1 and the scFab of anti-

145

SARS-CoV-2 IgGs were genetically fused at the N terminus of each apoferritin half, respectively.

146

Split apoferritin complementation led to hetero-dimerization of the two halves and in turn, full

147

apoferritin self-assembly displaying more than 24 copies of scFc and scFab on the nanocage

148

periphery (Fig. 2a). Conveniently, this design allows for the straightforward purification of the

149

MB using Protein A akin to IgG purification.

150

This split MB design forms 16 nm hydrodynamic radius (Rh) spherical particles with an

151

uninterrupted ring of density and regularly spaced protruding scFabs and scFc (Fig. 2b and 2c).

152

Hence, the MB is on the lower size range of natural IgMs33 but packs more weight on a similar
7

153

size to achieve multi-valency and multi-specificity. Binding kinetics experiments demonstrated

154

that avidity of the MB for the Spike was preserved upon addition of Fc fragments (Fig. 2d).

155

Binding to human FcγRI and FcRn at endosomal pH confirmed that scFc was properly folded in

156

the split MB design and that LALAP and I253A mutations lowered binding affinities to FcγRI and

157

FcRn, respectively (Fig. 2e). SARS-CoV-2 PsV neutralization assays with the split design MBs

158

showed that enhanced binding affinity for the S protein translates into an improved neutralization

159

potency in comparison to their IgG counterparts, with a ~1600-fold and ~2500-fold increase for

160

BD23 and A48, respectively (Fig. 2f). Combined, this data supported the further exploration of

161

the MB as an IgG-like platform that confers extraordinary multivalency.

162
163

From antibody discovery to ultrapotent neutralizers

164

We next assessed the ability of the MB platform to transform mAb binders identified from initial

165

phage display screens into potent neutralizers against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3a). Following standard

166

biopanning protocols, 20 human mAb binders with moderate affinities that range from 10-6 to 10-

167

8

168

full-length IgGs and MBs and their capacity to block viral infection was compared in a

169

neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2 PsV (Fig. 3b and Fig. S2a). Notably, MBs preserved

170

the thermostability of their parental IgGs (Fig. S2b-c) and significantly enhanced the potency of

171

18 out of 20 (90%) IgGs by up to four orders of magnitude. The largest increment was observed

172

for mAb 298 which went from an IC50 of ~30 µg/mL as an IgG to 0.0001 µg/mL as a MB.

173

Strikingly, 11 mAbs were converted from non-neutralizing IgGs to neutralizing MBs in the tested

174

concentration ranges. Seven MBs displayed exceptional potency with IC50 values between 0.2-2

175

ng/mL against SARS-CoV-2 PsV using two different target cells (293T-ACE2 and HeLa-ACE2

M against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were selected (Table S1). These mAbs were produced as

176

cells) (Fig. 3b and Fig. S3a). The enhanced neutralization potency of the MB was further

177

confirmed with authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus for the mAbs with the highest potency (Fig. 3c and

178

Fig. S3b). Retrospectively, all IgGs and MBs were tested for their ability to bind to the S protein

179

and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S4). Increased avidity resulted in higher apparent binding

180

affinities with no detectable off-rates against the S protein, most likely due to inter-spike

181

crosslinking that translates into high neutralization potency (Fig. 3b-d and Fig. S4). Overall, the

182

data shows that the MB platform is compatible with rapid delivery of ultrapotent IgG-like

183

molecules.

184
185

Epitope mapping

186

Based on their neutralization potency, seven mAbs were selected for further characterization: 298

187

(IGHV1-46/IGKV4-1), 82 (IGHV1-46/IGKV1-39), 46 (IGHV3-23/IGKV1-39), 324 (IGHV1-

188

69/IGKV1-39), 236 (IGHV1-69/IGKV2-28), 52 (IGHV1-69/IGKV1-39) and 80 (IGHV1-

189

69/IGKV4-1) (Fig. 3b and Table S1). Epitope binning experiments showed that these mAbs target

190

two main sites on the RBD, with one of these bins overlapping with the ACE2 binding site (Fig.

191

4a and Fig. S5). Cryo-EM structures of Fab-SARS-CoV-2 S complexes at a global resolution of

192

~6-7 Å confirmed that mAbs 324, 298, 80 bind overlapping epitopes (Fig. 4b, Fig. S6a-c and

193

Table S2). To gain insight into the binding of mAbs targeting the second bin, we obtained the

194

cryo-EM structure of Fab 46 in complex with the RBD at a global resolution of 4.0 Å (Fig. 4c,

195

Fig. S6d and Table S2), and the crystal structure of Fabs 298 and 52 as a ternary complex with

196

the RBD at 2.95 Å resolution (Fig. 4d, Fig. S7 and Table S3).

197

The crystal structure shows that mAb 298 binds almost exclusively to the ACE2 receptor binding

198

motif (RBM) of the RBD (residues 438-506). In fact, out of 16 RBD residues involved in binding

9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.341636; this version posted October 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

199

mAb 298, 12 are also involved in ACE2-RBD binding (Fig. S7a-c and Table S4 and S5). The

200

RBM is stabilized by 11 hydrogen bonds from heavy and light chain residues of mAb 298. In

201

addition, RBM Phe486 is contacted by 11 mAb 298 residues burying approximately 170 Å2 (24%

202

of the total buried surface area on RBD) and hence is central to the antibody-antigen interaction

203

(Fig. S7a and Table S5).

204

Detailed analysis of the RBD-52 Fab interface reveals that the epitope of mAb 52 is shifted towards

205

the core of the RBD encompassing 20 residues of the RBM and 7 residues in the core domain (Fig.

206

4c, Fig. S7b and Table S6 and S7). In agreement with the competition data, antibody 52 and

207

antibody 46 share a similar binding site, although they approach the RBD with slightly different

208

angles (Fig. 4c-d and Fig. S7d). Inspection of previously reported structures of RBD-antibody

209

complexes reveal that antibodies 46 and 52 target a site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 spike

210

that has not been described previously (Fig. 4e). The epitope targeted by these antibodies is

211

partially occluded by the NTD in the S “closed” conformation, suggesting that the mechanism of

212

action for this new class of antibodies could involve Spike destabilization. Together, these data

213

demonstrate that the enhanced potency observed for the MB platform is associated with mAbs that

214

target both overlapping and distinct epitope bins.

215
216

Multabodies overcome Spike sequence variability

217

To explore whether MBs could resist viral escape, we tested the effect of four naturally occurring

218

RBD mutations (L452R, A475V, N439K and V483A)34 (Fig. 5a) on the binding and neutralization

219

of the seven human mAbs of highest potency (Fig. 5b-c). In addition, the impact of mutating

220

Asn234, a glycosylation site, to Gln was also assessed because the absence of glycosylation at this

10

221

site has been previously reported to decrease sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies targeting the

222

RBD34. The more infectious PsV variant D614G35 was also included in the panel. Mutation L452R

223

significantly decreased binding and potency of antibodies 52 and 46, while antibody 298 was

224

sensitive to mutation A475V (Fig. 5b-c). Deletion of the N-linked glycan at position Asn234

225

increased viral resistance to the majority of the antibodies, especially mAbs 46, 80 and 324,

226

emphasizing the important role of glycans in viral antigenicity (Fig. 5c). Strikingly, the following

227

mAbs were minimally impacted in their exceptional neutralization potency by any S mutation

228

when present in the MB format: 298, 80, 324, and 236 (Fig. 5d). Mutation L452R decreased the

229

sensitivity of the 46-MB and 52-MB but in contrast to their parental IgGs, they remained

230

neutralizing against this PsV variant (Fig. 5d). The more infectious SARS-CoV-2 PsV variant

231

D614G was neutralized with similar potency as the WT PsV for both IgGs and MBs (Fig. 5c and

232

Fig. S8a).

233

MB cocktails consisting of three monospecific MB resulted in pan-neutralization across all PsV

234

variants without a significant loss in potency and hence achieved a 100-1000-fold higher potency

235

compared to the corresponding IgG cocktails (Fig. 5e and Fig. S8c-d). In order to achieve breadth

236

within a single molecule, we next generated tri-specific MBs by combining multimerization

237

subunits displaying three different Fabs in the same MB assembly (Fig. S8b). Notably, the

238

resulting tri-specific MBs exhibited pan-neutralization while preserving the exceptional

239

neutralization potency of the monospecific versions (Fig. 5e and Fig. S8c-d). The most notable

240

increase in potency was for the 298-324-46 combination, where the IgG cocktail neutralized WT

241

SARS-CoV-2 PsV with an ~0.5 µg/mL (3.3 ´ 10-9 M) IC50, while the tri-specific MB achieved

242

broad neutralization with an exceptional IC50 of ~0.0005 µg/mL (2.2 ´ 10-13 M). The potency

243

enhancement of MB cocktails and tri-specific MBs in comparison to their corresponding IgG tri-

244

specific cocktails was also observed with live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. S8e).

245
246

Discussion

247

We have developed an antibody-multimerization platform to increase avidity of mAbs targeting

248

SARS-CoV-2. The seven most potent MBs have IC50 values of 0.2 to 2 ng/mL (9 ´ 10-14 to 9 ´ 10-

249

13

250

antibody-like molecules reported to date against SARS-CoV-2.

251

The MB platform was designed to include key favorable attributes from a developability

252

perspective. First, the ability to augment antibody potency is independent of antibody sequence,

253

format or epitope targeted. The modularity and flexibility of the platform was exemplified by

254

enhancing the potency of a VHH and multiple Fabs that target non-overlapping regions on two

255

SARS-CoV-2 S sub-domains (RBD and NTD). Second, in contrast to other approaches to enhance

256

avidity such as tandem fusions of single chain variable fragments36,37, which suffer from low

257

stability, MBs self-assemble into highly stable particles with aggregation temperatures values

258

similar to those of their parental IgGs. Third, alternative multimerization strategies like

259

streptavidin38, verotoxin B subunit scaffolds39 or viral-like nanoparticles40 face immunogenicity

260

challenges and/or poor bioavailability because of the absence of an Fc fragment and therefore the

261

inability to undergo FcRn–mediated recycling. The light chain of apoferritin is fully human,

262

biologically inactive, has been engineered to include Fc domains, and despite multimerization of

263

>24 Fab/Fc fragments, has a hydrodynamic radius similar to an IgM. As such, a surrogate mouse

264

MB did not elicit anti-drug antibodies in mice, was detectable in the sera for over a week, and has

265

similar biodistribution as its parental IgG.

266

Different increases in neutralization potency were observed for different mAb sequences tested on

267

the MB against SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that the ability of the MB to enhance potency may

268

depend on epitope location on the Spike or the geometry of how the Fabs engage the antigen to

269

achieve neutralization. The fact that 2 out of 20 SARS-CoV-2 RBD binders were not rescued by

270

the MB platform also suggests limitations based on mAb sequences and binding properties.

271

Nevertheless, the capacity of the MB to transform avidity into neutralization potency across a

272

range of epitope specificities on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike highlights the potential for using this

273

technology broadly. It will be interesting to explore the potency-enhancement capacity of the MB

274

platform against viruses with low surface spike density like HIV41, or against other targets like the

275

tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, where bivalency of conventional antibodies limits their

276

efficient activation42.

277

Virus escape can arise in response to selective pressure from treatments or during natural selection.

278

A conventional approach to combat escape mutants is the use of antibody cocktails targeting

279

different epitopes. MBs showed a lower susceptibility to S mutations in comparison to their

280

parental IgGs, presumably because the loss in affinity was compensated by enhanced binding

281

avidity. Hence, when used in cocktails, the MB overcame viral sequence variability with

282

exceptional potency. In addition, the split MB design allows combination of multiple antibody

283

specificities within a single multimerized molecule resulting in similar potency and breadth as the

284

MB cocktails. To our knowledge, these MBs represent the first tri-specifics described against

285

SARS-CoV-2. Multi-specificity within the same particle could offer additional advantages such as

286

intra-S avidity and synergy for the right combination of mAbs, setting the stage for further

287

investigation of different combinations of mAb specificities on the MB.

288

Overall, the MB platform provides a tool to surpass antibody affinity limits and generate broad

289

and potent neutralizing molecules without the need for extensive antibody discovery or

290

engineering efforts. This platform will accelerate the timeline from discovery to development of

291

antibodies as medical countermeasures against COVID-19 and in future pandemics.

Materials and Methods

Protein expression and purification
Genes encoding VHH-human apoferritin fusion, Fc fusions, Fabs, IgG, and RBD mutants were
synthesized and cloned by GeneArt (Life Technologies) into the pcDNA3.4 expression vector. All
constructs were expressed transiently in HEK293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a density of
0.8 ´ 106 cells/mL with 50 μg of DNA per 200 mL of cells using FectoPRO (Polyplus
Transfections) in a 1:1 ratio unless specified otherwise. After 6-7 days of incubation at 125 rpm
oscillation at 37º C, 8% CO2, and 70% humidity in a Multitron Pro shaker (Infors HT), cell
suspensions were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 15 min and supernatants were filtered
through a 0.22 μm Steritop filter (EMD Millipore). Fabs and IgGs were transiently expressed by
co-transfecting 90 μg of the LC and the HC in a 1:2 ratio and purified using KappaSelect affinity
column (GE Healthcare) and HiTrap Protein A HP column (GE Healthcare), respectively with 100
mM glycine pH 2.2 as the elution buffer. Eluted fractions were immediately neutralized with 1 M
Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 and further purified using a Superdex 200 Increase size exclusion column (GE
Healthcare). Fc fusions of ACE2 and VHH-72 were purified the same way as IgGs. The VHH-72
apoferritin fusion was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a HiTrap Phenyl
HP column and the eluted fraction was loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL size exclusion column
(GE Heathcare) in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. The prefusion S ectodomain
(BEI NR52394), wild type RBD (BEI NR52309) and mutant RBDs were purified using a HisTrap
Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare) followed by Superose 6 and Superdex 200 Increase size
exclusion columns (GE Heathcare), respectively in 20 mM phosphate pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl
buffer.

Design, expression and purification of split Multabodies
Genes encoding scFab and scFc fragments linked to half apoferritin were generated by deletion of
residues 1 to 95 (C-Ferritin) and 95 to 175 (N-Ferritin) of the light chain of human apoferritin
using the KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Transient transfection of the split
Multabodies in HEK 293F cells were obtained by mixing 66 μg of the plasmids scFab-human
apoferritin: scFc-human N-Ferritin: scFab-C-Ferritin in a 2:1:1 ratio. In the case of multispecific
Multabodies, a 4:2:1:1 ratio of scFab1-human apoferritin: scFc-human N-Ferritin: scFab2-CFerritin: scFab3-C-Ferritin was used. The DNA mixture was filtered and incubated at RT with 66
μl of FectoPRO before adding to the cell culture. Split Multabodies were purified by affinity
chromatography using a HiTrap Protein A HP column (GE Healthcare) with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0,
3 M MgCl2 and 10% glycerol elution buffer. Fractions containing the protein were concentrated
and further purified by gel filtration on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare).
Negative-stain electron microscopy
3 μL of Multabody at a concentration approximately of 0.02 mg/mL was placed on the surface of
a carbon-coated copper grid that had previously been glow-discharged in air for 15 sec, allowed
to adsorb for 30 s, and stained with 3 μL of 2% uranyl formate. Excess stain was removed
immediately from the grid using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and an additional 3 μL of 2% uranyl
formate was added for 20 s. Grids were imaged with a FEI Tecnai T20 electron microscope
operating at 200 kV and equipped with an Orius charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Gatan Inc).
Biolayer interferometry
Direct binding kinetics measurements were conducted using an Octet RED96 BLI system
(Sartorius ForteBio) in PBS pH 7.4, 0.01% BSA and 0.002% Tween at 25º C. His-tagged RBD or
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was loaded onto Ni-NTA (NTA) biosensors (Sartorius ForteBio) to
2

reach a BLI signal response of 0.8 nm. Association rates were measured by transferring the loaded
biosensors to wells containing a 2-fold dilution series from 250 to 16 nM (Fabs), 125 to 4 nM
(IgG), and 16 to 0.5 nM (MB). Dissociation rates were measured by dipping the biosensors into
buffer-containing wells. The duration of each of these two steps was 180 s. Fc characterization in
the split Multabody design was assessed by measuring binding to hFcγRI and hFcRn. To probe
the theoretical capacity of the Multabodies to undergo endosomal recycling, binding to the hFcRn
b2-microglobulin complex was measured at physiological (7.5) and endosomal (5.6) pH.
Competition assays were performed in a two-step binding process. Ni-NTA biosensors preloaded
with His-tagged RBD were first dipped into wells containing the primary antibody at 50 μg/mL
for 180 s. After a 30 s baseline period, the sensors were dipped into wells containing the second
antibody at 50 μg/ml for an additional 300 s.
Dynamic light scattering
The hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of the Multabody was determined by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) using a DynaPro Plate Reader III (Wyatt Technology). 20 μL of the Multabody at a
concentration of 1 mg/mL was added to a 384-well black, clear bottom plate (Corning) and
measured at a fixed temperature of 25º C with a duration of 5 s per read. Particle size determination
and polydispersity were obtained from the accumulation of 5 reads using the Dynamics software
(Wyatt Technology).
Aggregation temperature measurements
Aggregation temperature (Tagg) of the Multabodies and parental IgGs were determined using a
UNit instrument (Unchained Labs). Samples were concentrated to 1.0 mg/mL and subjected to a
thermal ramp from 25 to 95° C with 1° C increments. Tagg was determined as the temperature at
which 50% increase in the static light scattering at a 266 nm wavelength relative to baseline was
3

observed (i.e. the maximum value of the differential curve). The average and the standard error of
two independent measurements were calculated using the UNit analysis software.
Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity studies
A surrogate Multabody composed of the scFab and scFc fragments of mouse HD37 (anti-hCD19)
IgG2a fused to the N-terminus of the light chain of mouse apoferritin (mFerritin) was used for the
study. HD37 scFab-mFerritin: Fc-mFerritin: mFerritin in a 2:1:1 ratio was transfected and purified
following the procedure described above. L234A, L235A and P329G mutations were introduced
in the mouse IgG2a Fc-construct to silence effector functions of the Multabody43. In vivo studies
were performed using 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice purchased from Charles River (Strain
code: 027), housed in individually-vented cages. All procedures were approved by the Local
Animal Care Committee at the University of Toronto Scarborough. A single injection of
approximately 5 mg/kg of Multabodies or control samples (HD37 IgG -IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes)
and Helicobacter pylori ferritin (hpFerritin)-PfCSP malaria peptide in 200 µL of PBS (pH 7.5)
were subcutaneously injected. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points and serum
samples were assessed for levels of circulating antibodies and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) by
ELISA. Briefly, 96-well Pierce Nickel Coated Plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with 50 µL at
0.5 µg/ml of the His6x-tagged antigen hCD19 to determine circulating HD37-specific
concentrations using reagent-specific standard curves for IgGs and Multabodies. For ADA
determination, Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Biolegend) were coated with a 12-mer HD37 scFabmFerritin or with the hpFerritin-PfCSP malaria peptide. HRP-ProteinA (Invitrogen) was used as a
secondary molecule and the chemiluminescence signal was quantified using a Synergy Neo2
Multi-Mode Assay Microplate Reader (Biotek Instruments).
Biodistribution studies
4

8-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and housed in
individually-vented caging. All procedures were approved by the Local Animal Care Committee
at the University of Toronto. The HD37 IgG2a Multabody or HD37 IgG2a control were
fluorescently conjugated with Alexa-647 using an Alexa FluorTM 647 Antibody Labeling kit
(Invitrogen) as per manufacturer instructions. PerkinElmer IVIS Spectrum (PerkinElmer) was
used to conduct non-invasive biodistribution experiments. BALB/c mice were injected
subcutaneously into the loose skin over the shoulders with approximately 5 mg/kg of the MB or
control samples in 200 µL of PBS (pH 7.5) and imaged at time 0, 1h, 6h, 24h, 2d, 3d, 4d, 8d, 11d
following injection. Prior to imaging, mice were placed in an anesthesia induction chamber
containing a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen for 1 min. Anesthetized mice were then placed in
the prone position at the center of a built-in heated docking system within the IVIS imaging system
(maintained at 37°C and supplied with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen). For whole body 2D
imaging, mice were imaged for 1-2 s (excitation 640 nm, emission 680 nm) inside the imaging
system. Data were analyzed and reconstructed with the IVIS software (Living Image Software for
IVIS) using 640 nm/680 nm laser.
Panning of Phage libraries against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2
143 healthy human subjects were used for the assembly of a SuperHuman 2.0 library. CDR-H3
diversity was sourced by PCR from naive CD27-IgM+ B-cells while other CDR diversity was
sourced from CD27+IgG+ B cells from the therapeutic frameworks IGHV1-46, IGHV1-69,
IGHV3-15, IGHV3-23, IGKV1-39, IGKV2-28, IGKV3-15 and IGKV4-1 by using PCR overlap
extension. The light and heavy chains were transformed to exceed 1e8 and 7.6e10 transformants for
each chain framework, respectively. Illumina MiSeq replicate rarefaction analysis was used to
assure a recovery of over 98% unique clones. In addition, Protein L and Protein A were used (10
5

min incubation at 70º C) to select thermostable and well-expressing light chain diversity. The
EXPi-293 mammalian expression system was used for expression of the receptor Binding domain
(RBD)-Fc-Avi tag construct of the SARS-CoV-2. This protein was subsequently purified by
protein G Dynabeads, biotinylated and quality-controlled for biotinylation and binding to ACE2
recombinant protein (Sino Biologics Inc). The SuperHuman 2.0 Phage library (5x1012) was heated
for 10 min at 72º C and de-selected against Protein G DynabeadsTM (Invitrogen), M-280
Streptavidin DynabeadsTM (Invitrogen), Histone from Calf Thymus (Sigma), Human IgG (Sigma)
and ssDNA-Biotin NNK from Integrated DNA Technologies and DNA-Biotin NNK from
Integrated DNA Technologies. Next, the library was panned against the RBD-captured by M-280
Streptavidin DynabeadsTM using an automated protocol on Kingfisher FLEX (Thermofisher).
Selected phages were acid eluted from the beads and neutralized using Tris-HCl pH 7.9 (Teknova).
ER2738 cells were infected with the neutralized phage pools at OD600=0.5 at a 1:10 ratio and after
40 min incubation at 37º C and 100 rpm, the phage pools were centrifuged and incubated on agar
with antibiotic selection overnight at 30º C. The rescued phages were precipitated by PEG and
subjected to three additional rounds of soluble-phase automated panning. PBST/1% BSA buffer
and/or PBS/1% BSA was used in the de-selection, washes and selection rounds.
Screening of anti-SARS-CoV-2 scFvs in bacterial periplasmic extracts with SARS-CoV-2
RBD
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD scFvs selected from phage display were expressed and screened using
high-throughput surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on Carterra LSA Array SPR instrument
(Carterra) equipped with HC200M sensor chip (Carterra) at 25º C. A V5 epitope tag was added to
the scFv to enable capture via immobilized anti-V5 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) that was
pre-immobilized on the chip surface by standard amine-coupling. Briefly: the chip surface was
6

first activated by 10 min injection of a 1:1:1 (v/v/v) mixture of 0.4 M 1-Ethyl-3-(3Dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), 0.1 M N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
(sNHS) and 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH 5.5. Then, 50 μg/ml of antiV5 tag antibody prepared in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.3 was coupled for 14 min and the excess
reactive esters were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine HCl pH 8.5 during a 10 min injection. For
screening, a 384-ligand array comprising of crude bacterial periplasmic extracts (PPE) containing
the scFvs (1 spot per scFv) was prepared. Each extract was prepared at a 2-fold dilution in running
buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.01% (v/v) Tween-20 (HBSTE))
and printed on the anti-V5 surface for 15 min. SARS-CoV-2 RBD Avi Tev His tagged was then
prepared at 0, 3.7, 11.1, 33.3, 100, 37, and 300 nM in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
0.01% (v/v) Tween-20 (HBST) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml BSA and injected as analyte for 5
min with a 15 min dissociation time. Samples were injected in ascending concentration without
any regeneration step. Binding data from the local reference spots was used to subtracted signal
from the active spots and the nearest buffer blank analyte responses were subtracted to doublereference the data. The double-referenced data were fitted to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model
in Carterra’s Kinetic Inspection Tool (version Oct. 2019). 20 medium-affinity binders from phage
display screening were selected for the present study.
Virus production and pseudovirus neutralization assays
SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses (PsV) were generated using an HIV-based lentiviral system as
previously described44 with few modifications. Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with a
lentiviral backbone encoding the luciferase reporter gene (BEI NR52516), a plasmid expressing
the Spike (BEI NR52310) and plasmids encoding the HIV structural and regulatory proteins Tat
(BEI NR52518), Gag-pol (BEI NR52517) and Rev (BEI NR52519). 24 h post transfection at 37°
7

C, 5 mM sodium butyrate was added to the media and the cells were incubated for an additional
24-30 h at 30° C. SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutant D614G was kindly provided by D.R. Burton (The
Scripps Research Institute) and the rest of the PsV mutants were generated using the KOD-Plus
mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Neutralization was determined in a single-cycle
neutralization assay using 293T-ACE2 cells (BEI NR52511) and HeLa-ACE2 cells (kindly
provided by D.R. Burton; The Scripps Research Institute). PsV neutralization was monitored by
adding Britelite plus reagent (PerkinElmer) to the cells and measuring luminescence in relative
light units (RLUs) using a Synergy Neo2 Multi-Mode Assay Microplate Reader (Biotek
Instruments). IC50 fold increase was calculated as: IgGIC50 (µg/mL) / MBIC50 (µg/mL). Two to three
biological replicates with two technical replicates each were performed.
Authentic virus neutralization assays
VeroE6 cells were seeded in a 96F plate at a concentration of 30,000/well in DMEM supplemented
with 100U Penicillin, 100U Streptomycin and 10% FBS. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plate
and rest overnight. After 24 h, 5-fold serial dilutions of the IgG and MB samples were prepared in
DMEM supplemented with 100U Penicillin and 100U Streptomycin in a 96R plate in
quadruplicates (25 uL/well). 25 uL of SARS-CoV-2/SB2-P4-PB45 Clone 1 was added to each well
at 100TCID/well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking every 15 min. After co-culturing, the
media from the VeroE6 plate was removed, and 50 uL antibody-virus sample was used to inoculate
VeroE6 cells in quadruplicates for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, shaking every 15 min. After 1 h
inoculation, the inoculum was removed and 200 uL of fresh DMEM supplemented with 100U
Penicillin, 100U Streptomycin and 2% FBS was added to each well. The plates were further
incubated for 5 days. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored and PRISM was used to calculate
IC50 values. Three biological replicates with four technical replicates each were performed.

Cross-linking of Spike protein with Fabs 80, 298 and 324
100 µg of Spike trimer was mixed with 2x molar excess of Fab 80, 298 or 324 in 20 mM HEPES
pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl. Proteins were crosslinked by addition of 0.075% (v/v) glutaraldehyde
(Sigma Aldrich) and incubated at room temperature for 120 min. Complexes were purified via size
exclusion chromatography (Superose6 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare), concentrated to 0.5
mg/mL and directly used for cryo-EM grid preparation.
Cross-linking of Fab 46-RBD complex
100 µg of Fab 46 was mixed with 2x molar excess of RBD in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150 mM
NaCl. The complex was crosslinked by addition of 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma Aldrich)
and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The cross-linked complex was purified via size
exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare), concentrated to
2.0 mg/ml and directly used for cryo-EM grid preparation.
Cryo-EM data collection and image processing
3 µl of sample was deposited on holey gold grids prepared in-house51, which were glow-discharged
in air for 15 s with a PELCO easiGlow (Ted Pella) before use. Sample was blotted for 6 s with a
modified FEI Mark III Vitrobot (maintained at 4º C and 100% humidity) using an offset of -5, and
subsequently plunge-frozen in a mixture of liquid ethane and propane. Data was acquired at 300
kV with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan Krios G3 electron microscope and prototype Falcon 4
camera operating in electron counting mode at 250 frames/s. Movies were collected for 9.6 s with
29 exposure fractions, a camera exposure rate of ~5 e-/pix/s, and total specimen exposure of ~44
e-/Å2. No objective aperture was used. The pixel size was calibrated at 1.03 Å/pixel from a gold
diffraction standard. The microscope was automated with the EPU software package and data
collection was monitored with cryoSPARC Live52.

9

To overcome preferred orientation encountered with some of the samples, tilted data collection
was employed53. For the Spike-Fab 80 complex, 820 0˚ tilted movies and 2790 40˚ tilted movies
were collected. For the Spike-Fab 298 complex, 4259 0˚ tilted movies and 3513 40˚ tilted movies
were collected. For the Spike-Fab 324 complex, 1098 0˚ tilted movies and 3380 40˚ tilted movies
were collected. For the RBD-Fab 46 complex, 4722 0˚ tilted movies were collected. For 0˚ tilted
movies, cryoSPARC patch motion correction was performed. For 40˚ tilted movies, Relion
MotionCorr54,55 was used. Micrographs were then imported into cryoSPARC and patch CTF
estimation was performed. Templates generated from 2D classification during the cryoSPARC
Live session were used for template selection of particles. 2D classification was used to remove
junk particle images, resulting in a dataset of 80,951 particle images for the Spike-Fab 80 complex,
203,138 particle images for the Spike-Fab 298 complex, 64,365 particle images for the Spike-Fab
324 complex, and 2,143,629 particle images for the RBD-Fab 46 complex. Multiple rounds of
multi-class ab initio refinement were used to clean-up the particle image stacks, and homogeneous
refinement was used to obtain consensus structures. For tilted particles, particle polishing was done
within Relion at this stage and re-imported back into cryoSPARC. For the Spike-Fab complexes,
extensive flexibility was observed. 3D variability analysis was performed56 and together with
heterogeneous refinement used to classify out the different states present. Non-uniform refinement
was then performed on the final set of particle images57. For the RBD-Fab 46 complex, cryoSPARC
ab initio refinement with three classes was used iteratively to clean up the particle image stack.
Thereafter, the particle image stack with refined Euler angles was brought into cisTEM for
reconstruction58 to produce a 4.0 Å resolution map. Transfer of data between Relion and
cryoSPARC was done with pyem59.
Crystallization and structure determination

10

A ternary complex of 52 Fab-298 Fab-RBD was obtained by mixing 200 µg of RBD with 2X
molar excess of each Fab in 20 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and subsequently purified via
size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare). Fractions
containing the complex were concentrated to 7.3 mg/ml and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 20% (w/v)
2-propanol, 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6. Crystals appeared after ~1 day
and were cryoprotected in 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Data were collected on the 23-ID-D beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced
Photon Source. The dataset was processed using XDS and XPREP46. Phases were determined by
molecular replacement using Phaser47 with CNTO88 Fab as a model for 52 Fab (PDB ID: 4DN3),
20358 Fab as a model for 298 Fab (PDB ID: 5CZX), and PDB ID: 6XDG as a search model for
the RBD. Refinement of the structure was performed using phenix.refine48 and iterations of manual
building and refinement in Coot49. Access to all software was supported through SBGrid50.

Binding kinetics of WT and Fc-modified (LALAP mutation) MB to mouse FcγRI (left) and
mouse FcRn at endosomal (middle) and physiological (right) pH in comparison to the parental
IgG. 2-fold dilution series from 100 to 3 nM (IgG), and 10 to 0.3 nM (MB) were used. Black
lines represent raw data whereas red lines represent global fits. (B) Five male C57BL/6 mice per
group were used to assess the serum concentration of a surrogate mouse MB, a Fc-modified MB
(LALAP mutation) and parental mouse IgGs (IgG1 and IgG2a subtype) after subcutaneous
administration of 5 mg/kg. (C) MB and IgG2a samples were labeled with Alexa-647 for
visualization of their biodistribution post subcutaneous injection into three BALB/c mice/group
via live non-invasive 2D whole body imaging. (D) Five male C57BL/6 mice per group were used
to assess any anti-drug antibody response induced by the mouse surrogate Multabody in
comparison to parental IgG and a species-mismatched malaria PfCSP peptide fused to
Helicobacter pylori ferritin (HpFerr).

Neutralization profiles of selected IgGs and MBs in different assays. (A) Similar
neutralization profiles of IgGs (left) vs MBs (right) against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 PsV
targeting 293T-ACE2 (black) and HeLa-ACE2 (gray) target cells. The mean IC50 value and
individual IC50 values of three and two biological replicates are shown for 293T-ACE2 and
HeLa-ACE2 cells, respectively. (B) Neutralization titration curves of three biological replicates
(different shades of gray) against the authentic SARS-CoV-2/SB2-P4-PB strain45. The mean IC50
is indicated. The less sensitive neutralization phenotype observed against authentic virus in
comparison to PsV is in agreement with previous reports5,13,14,17. However, other studies have
observed similar values3,11,12,16 between the two assays. This discrepancy makes crosscomparison of antibody potencies against live replicating virus difficult and is likely due to
differences in the length of time of the neutralization experiment. Short incubation times will
minimize the number of replications that the virus can undergo, resembling the one replication
cycle of the PsV assays.

Binding interfaces of mAbs 52 and 298 and the RBD. Interaction of mAbs 298 (A) and 52 (B)
with RBD (light and dark green for the core and RBM regions, respectively) is mediated by
complementarity determining regions (CDR) heavy (H) 1 (yellow), H2 (orange), H3 (red), kappa
light (K) 1 (light blue) and K3 (purple) (left panels). Critical binding residues are shown in sticks
(right panels). H-bonds and salt bridges are depicted as black dashed lines. L and H chains of
Fabs are shown in tan and white, respectively. (C) Bottom and side views of ACE2 (left) and
Fab 298 (right) bound to RBD. RBD side-chains that are part of the binding interface of the
ACE2-RBD and Fab 298-RBD complexes are depicted in pink, while RBD side-chains unique to
a given interface are shown in yellow. Surfaces of ACE2, variable regions of Fab 298 HC and
Fab 298 KC are shown in white, grey and tan, respectively. The RBD is colored as in (a). (D)
Superposition of Fabs 46 (light pink) and 52 (dark pink) when bound to the RBD (green) reveals
a distinct angle of approach for the two mAbs.

The MB platform potently overcomes SARS-CoV-2 sequence variability. (A) Comparison of
the neutralization potency of selected IgGs and MBs against WT PsV (dark red) and the more
infectious D614G PsV (grey). (B) Schematic representation of a tri-specific MB generated by
combination of three Fab specificities and the Fc fragment using the MB split design. (C) Cocktails
and tri-specific MBs that combine the specificities of mAbs 298, 80 and 52, or 298, 324 and 46
were generated and tested against WT PsV. (D) Neutralization potency change of cocktails and
tri-specific MBs against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 variants in comparison to WT PsV. PsV
variants that were sensitive to individual antibodies within the cocktails were selected. The area
within the dotted lines represent a 3-fold change in IC50 value. This threshold was established as
the cutoff to establish increased sensitivity (up bars) and increased resistance (down bars). (E)
Neutralization titration curves showing three biological replicates of cocktails and tri-specific MBs
against the authentic SARS-CoV-2/SB2-P4-PB strain45. Mean IC50 values of three biological
replicates are shown.
