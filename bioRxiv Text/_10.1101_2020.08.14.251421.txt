ABSTRACT
The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus contains 29 proteins, of which 15 are nonstructural.
Nsp10 and Nsp16 form a complex responsible for the capping of mRNA at the 5′ terminus. In the
methylation reaction the S-adenosyl-L-methionine serves as the donor of the methyl group that is
transferred to Cap-0 at the first transcribed nucleotide to create Cap-1. The presence of Cap-1
makes viral RNAs mimic the host transcripts and prevents their degradation. To investigate the 2′O methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10/16, we applied fixed-target serial synchrotron
crystallography (SSX) which allows for physiological temperature data collection from thousands
of crystals, significantly reducing the x-ray dose while maintaining a biologically relevant
temperature. We determined crystal structures of Nsp10/16 that revealed the states before and after
the methylation reaction, for the first time illustrating coronavirus Nsp10/16 complexes with the
m7

GpppAm2′-O Cap-1, where 2′OH of ribose is methylated. We compare these structures with

structures of Nsp10/16 at 297 K and 100 K collected from a single crystal. This data provide
important mechanistic insight and can be used to design small molecules that inhibit viral RNA
maturation making SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to host innate response.

INTRODUCTION
Five coronaviruses can induce clusters of severe respiratory diseases in humans: 229E, OC43,
SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 1,2. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARSCoV) in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012, showed a high
fatality rate of 11% and 34%, respectively, but had limited geographical spread

3,4

. In contrast,

in the past 7 months SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world
and infected millions of people, killing over half a million. Though, it has a significantly lower
fatality rate (estimated at 0.5 – 2%) than MERS and SARS the amount of people infected is
hundreds of times higher, and it caused significant economic hardship and extraordinary social
restrictions. In many countries, after six months from the first reports of COVID-19, the number
of cases is still increasing 5. In the absence of herd immunity, vaccines, or drugs against the virus,
the situation is frightful. Since the beginning of the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19,
the scientific community has joined efforts to understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and to find
chemical compounds that either block virus replication or enhance human immunological
response. Initial focus on repurposing existing drugs that potentially could provide immediate
treatment has thus far resulted only in limited success. Finding inhibitors of a biological cycle of
SARS-CoV-2 or vaccines is, therefore, critical for global health, safety, and wellbeing.
SARS-CoV-2 β-coronavirus has a large (~ 30 kb) and complex (29 proteins) (+) sense singlestranded RNA genome 6. The RNA present in the mature virion resembles human mRNA: (i) it is
capped on its 5′-end, (ii) contains a 3′-poly-A tail, and (iii) after infection can be directly translated
to the two polyproteins Pp1a and Pp1ab using host machinery. These polyproteins are then matured
into 15 non-structural proteins (Nsp), that assemble into a large replication-transcription complex.
The RNA is also used as a template for biosynthesis of (-) sense RNA that serves to make
additional copies of (+) sense RNA and several sub-genomic RNAs for the translation of four
structural and 9-10 accessory proteins 6. For these RNAs to serve as mRNAs, they must undergo
post-transcription modifications to resemble human mRNA. The RNA maturation involves several
enzymatic steps performed by viral Nsps; Nsp13 is a bifunctional RNA/NTP triphosphatase
(TPase) and helicase; Nsp14 is a bifunctional 3′-5′ exonuclease and guanine N7 methyltransferase;
and Nsp16 is Mg2+ dependent ribose 2′-O methyltransferase and an elusive guanylyltransferase.

In eukaryotes, the attachment of the m7G Cap at the 5′-end of RNA protects the transcript from
mRNA turnover in the pathway dependent on 5′ → 3′ exoribonucleases activity, such as XRNs 7,
and is required for several cellular processes: maturation of mRNA, pre-mRNA nuclear export,
and protein synthesis 8. The Cap at the 5′ terminus of eukaryotic transcripts starts with 7methylguanosine at the reversed position and is connected through an uncommon 5′ to 5′
triphosphate bridge, which is attached to a nucleotide that undergoes methylation at 2′-O-ribose.
The canonical pathway of the mRNA capping mechanism requires the subsequent action
of multiple enzymes 8. At first, RNA 5′-triphosphatase (RTPase) cleaves the 5′-terminal γ-β
phosphoanhydride bond of the nascent mRNA and enables further modification of the newly
synthesized transcript at its 5′-terminus. Secondly, the diphosphate mRNA is capped using GMP
by guanylyltransferase (GTase). Next, the (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase adds the methyl group
to the 5′-terminal guanosine creating a precursor: Cap-0. Additionally, the 2′-O methyltransferase
transfers the methyl group to the 2′-O-ribose of the first transcribed nucleotide at mRNA, making
the

m7

GpppNm2′-O (Cap-1) structure 9. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is a donor of the methyl

group and is converted to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) during the reaction 10. In humans
and other higher eukaryotes, the second nucleotide of mRNA then undergoes methylation
to produce Cap-2 11.
The post-transcriptional modification of RNA is also essential for efficient translation of viral
transcript in a eukaryotic host

12

. Influenza, Ebola, measles, poxvirus, and coronaviruses attach

Cap to their genomic and sub-genomic RNA transcripts to mimic host molecules and escape from
the innate immunological response

13

. Studies done in the last decade show that the 2′-O

methylation of the Cap-0 facilitates this process by preventing activation of type I interferon that
is induced by the cytoplasmic RNA sensors, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5
(MDA5), and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-1)

14–16

. Mutations in 2′-O methyltransferase

render the viruses sensitive to the interferon-inducible immunological pathways 17.
Methyltransferases (MTases) are common in all metazoan and viral genomes 18. SARS-CoV2 possesses two MTases, Nsp14 and Nsp16, both of which form a heterodimer complex with
Nsp10 19,20, which is a critical protein for virus replication and fidelity 21. The sequence similarity
of viral 2′-O MTases is high, suggesting common origin. Sequence identity of Nsp16 between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 is 95%, while the identity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 to the MERS4

CoV enzyme is 66% 20. The active site of Nsp16 MTase is conserved in the Coronaviridae family;
they all utilize a Lys-Asp-Lys-Glu catalytic tetrad essential for the enzymatic activity 22,23.
It has been shown that the Nsp10/16 complex methylates the Cap-0 (m7GpppA2′-OH) to form
Cap-1 (m7GpppAm2′-O) by adding a methyl group to the ribose 2′-O of the first nucleotide (usually
adenosine, in CoVs) of the nascent mRNA using SAM as the methyl group donor 24. The Nsp16
activity is necessary for Nsps’ translation from new copies of viral (+) sense RNA as well as
structural and accessory proteins translation from sub-genomic RNA which are all transcribed
from the viral (-) sense RNA template. Vaccination with Nsp16 defective SARS-CoV or an
immunogenic disruption of the Nsp10/16 interface protects mice from a lethal SARS challenge 25.
Therefore, blocking Nsp16 activity should reduce viral proliferation, making the protein
an attractive drug target.
While several structures of Nsp10/16 in a complex with Cap-0 have been determined
by crystallography (PDB entries: 6WQ3, 6WRZ, 6WVN, 6WKS), none have captured the postmethylation state. We conducted serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) experiments at 297 K
to test whether low radiation dose could help uncover the structure of Nsp10/16 in a complex with
Cap-1. Previously, x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) serial crystallography (SFX) had established
methods to study molecular dynamics and chemical reactions in protein crystals occurring
at femtosecond to millisecond timescales

26–28

. The XFEL-based protocol enabled to analyze

protein structures with no radiation damage, in the so-called “diffraction before destruction” mode
29,30

. SFX has been successfully applied to determine the structure of the membrane protein

complex of photosystem I and of several other macromolecules using time-resolved approach 29.
The synchrotron equivalent, SSX, uses a similar approach to SFX but can access longer,
biologically relevant time scales. Moreover SSX is a much more accessible technique at a number
of light sources and less sample consuming than SFX

31

. Nonetheless, delivering hundreds of

thousands of batch-grown crystals to the x-ray beam still presents challenges. Two approaches are
common: the first uses a liquid injector of microcrystals 29,32,33, and the second uses a fixed-target
system where crystals are deposited on a chip and scanned through the x-ray beam 34,35. Here we
present three crystal structures of the Nsp10/16 complex determined by fixed-target SSX at 297 K:
in the presence of SAM, Cap-0/SAM, and with Cap-1/SAH generated by metal-dependent
conversion of Cap-0/SAM substrates. We compare these structures with structures of Nsp10/16 at

297 K and 100 K collected from a single crystal. We observe the state of the molecules in the
crystal before and after methylation. The uniqueness of the Cap-1 structure shows the advantages
of the SSX method in structural studies: allowing the use of larger crystals, reducing radiation
damage, and being closer to physiological temperatures.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Serial crystallography for the Nsp10/16 2′-O MTase from SARS-CoV-2
We collected SSX data for the Nsp10/16 crystals using the fixed-target SSX system (Advanced
Lightweight Encapsulation Crystallography (ALEX) mesh-holder) as depicted in Figure 1A and
Extended Data Fig. 1. A crystal slurry is deposited on a nylon mesh, which immobilizes the
crystals; they are then encapsulated between two polyester films 36. A representative diffraction
image recorded from a single Nsp10/16 crystal illustrates the quality of the obtained data
(Extended Data Fig. 2B). We collected data from seven chips with ~ 36,100 images per chip with
an exposure time of 50 ms at 100% x-ray transmission. Including overheads, motor acceleration,
deceleration, and settling time, each mesh was in the beam for approximately 90 minutes,
collecting images at a rate of 7 Hz. SSX experiments were conducted on three separate days: first
to collect data on Nsp10/16/SAM complex. Second for Nsp10/16/SAM crystals with SAM that
were soaked with Cap-0 in the presence of EDTA. Third to collect data for the Nsp10/16/Cap1/SAH complex, resulting from the in crystallo reaction converting Cap-0/SAM to Cap-1/SAH
(Fig. 1B). As discussed below, this process occurred in the crystals in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+
and the reaction is significantly slowed down by addition of EDTA.
For initial data processing, we used the Kanzus automated data pipeline. Kanzus integrates the
19-ID data collection system with the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), using the
Theta supercomputer for high-speed on-demand data analysis. Extended Figure 3A presents
an image with labeled indexed reflections and shows that most observed reflections of Nsp10/16
crystals were indexed. PRIME identified inadequate low-resolution statistics from the integration
files, thus we subjected them to outlier rejection. Integration files with resolution lower than 3.5 Å,
containing less than 90 reflections, or with a unit cell volume 4.5% different from the average were

removed from the scaling process (Extended Data Tab. 1, Fig. 2C, 2D). The total number of
integrated files that went into PRIME for Nsp10/16 bound with SAM, Cap-1/SAH, and Cap0/SAM were 7,951; 5,038 and 4,704 respectively. The overall hit-rate (images used for structure
divided by images taken) for the five meshes was 7%. Some positions on the mesh had multiple
crystals, 11% of ‘hits’ had two lattices, and fewer than 1% had three (Extended Data Tab. 1,
Fig. 3B). For structure determination we used all indexed lattices in each diffraction image.
Two structures from SSX were solved at 2.25 Å (Nsp10/16/SAM and Nsp10/16/Cap-1/SAH), and
a third at 2.18 Å (Nsp10/16/Cap-0/SAM) (Extended Data Tab. 1). The highest resolution shell in
PRIME analysis was specified using a CC1/2 cut-off below 0.40. Completeness for the SSX data
was close to 100% and Rwork was 20.65%, 22.31%, and 21.70% for Nsp10/16/SAM,
Nsp10/16/Cap-1/SAH, and Nsp10/16/Cap-0/SAM, respectively (Extended Data Tab. 2). For a
comparison to SSX data, we also collected data from a single crystal of the Nsp10/16 with Cap0/SAM and Cap-1/SAH in a capillary at 297 K. These data could only beprocessed to 2.65 Å with
reasonable statistics (Extended Data Tab. 1, 2). Using RADDOSE-3D

37

, we estimated the

accumulated dose of x-ray for Nsp10/16 from SSX to be 0.12 MGy, whereas the dose for the
capillary-mounted crystal was 4.97 MGy over 40 times higher.

297 K structure of the Nsp10/16 heterodimer from SARS-CoV-2
The Nsp10/16 complex is an a/b heterodimer (Fig. 2). The 139 amino acid long Nsp10 has
unique fold formed by 5 α-helices and a pair of antiparallel β-strands which are facing Nsp16 in
the complex. Nsp10 possesses two zinc ions coordinated by the CCHC and CCCC motifs that are
100% conserved in β-coronaviruses 20. Nsp10 is involved in forming the complexes with multiple
SARS-CoV-1 and -2 proteins. The best characterized is the complex with Nsp14 3′-5′
exoribonuclease (and guanine N7 methyltransferase) and Nsp16 that is 2′-O-ribose methylase.
Previous research showed that Nsp16 is only active in the presence of Nsp10 19. Interestingly, the
activity of 2′-O MTase of the Nsp10/16 complex was reduced by using a peptide compound based
on the Nsp10 sequence 38. Nsp10 is a molecular co-factor for various SARS-CoV-2 enzymes and
therefore a good candidate for design of molecules that will affect its structure or disrupt the
interaction with Nsp14 or Nsp16 2′-O MTases.

The structure of Nsp16 is characterized by a Rossmann fold, with a large β-sheet surrounded
by α-helices, β-strands and loops. Nsp16 contains 11 α-helices, 12 β-strands and 7 loops. Nsp16
has a centrally positioned β-sheet (β3↑,β2↑,β1↑,β4↑,β5↑,β7↓,β6↑) with only one antiparallel
strand β7. The SAM and the Cap binding sites are located at the surface of Nsp16. None of the
Nsp10 residues have a direct connection with the ligands’ binding sites (Fig. 2A, 2C), but Nsp10
is required for Nsp16 MTase activity 21. Additionally, we observed partial electron density for the
7-methyl-guanosite-5′-triphosphate (m7Gppp) of the Cap in the possible allosteric site of the
Nsp10/16 complex (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the surface electrostatic charges of the Nsp10/16
structure shows positively charged residues that form an elongated binding pocket for Cap, with
approximate length of 21 Å (Fig. 2C). In proximity of the Cap-0 methylation site there is an
elongated positively charged surface that can potentially bind longer RNA (Fig. 2C). Moreover,
there are reports that two zinc fingers of Nsp10 contribute to non-specific binding of nucleic
acids 24, which could further indicate that Nsp10/16 not only binds the Cap, but also interacts with
longer RNA fragments.
The SSX experiments on the Nsp10/16 crystals revealed three states: one with SAM bound,
second with SAM and Cap-0 in the active site prior reaction occurring, and the third state after
methyl transfer with Cap-1 and SAH. The electron density clearly showed the methyl group
present on the adenosine moiety at the 2′-O-ribose position of the Cap-0 and no methyl present on
SAH (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the 297 K single crystal structure has also clear electron density for the
methylation site of the Cap-0 2′-O-ribose, but with partial occupancy.
The structures determined at 100 K using single crystal and at 297 K using SSX obtained in
the same crystal forms are very similar, as illustrated by superpositions of our Nsp10/16/Cap1/SAH structure with the complex of Cap-0/SAH (PDB entry 6WQ3) (Extended Data Fig. 4).
For these structures, the overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) of Cα atoms is 0.43 Å.
We observed less than an 1.1 Å shift of the loops that form the binding sites for the Cap and zinc
ions. Comparison of the SSX structures of Nsp10/16 with Cap-0/SAM and Cap-1/SAH does not
reveal any significant changes in protein backbone (Cα RMSD: 0.52 Å) (Extended Data Fig. 4B).
On the other hand, the comparison of Nsp10/16/SAM and Nsp10/16/Cap-1/SAH complexes
determined using SSX indicate larger conformation changes in the Nsp16 that are induced by the
Cap-0 binding and Cap-1 formation. We observed movement of two loops (comprising 28-35 and

131-145 residues of Nsp16) which form the mRNA Cap binding groove; positions of some
residues are shifted as much as 3.0 Å, with an overall Cα RMSD of 0.40 Å (Fig. 2D, 2E; Extended
Data Fig. 4C). At the same time, the Cap binding did not significantly affect the structure of Nsp10.
We also compared the two structures of Nsp10/16/SAM determined at 297 K (this work PDB entry
7JIB) and 100 K (PDB entry 6W4H) (Cα RMSD: 0.35 Å) and observed significant differences:
one loop from the Cap binding pocket is shifted approximately 1.4 Å in 297 K structures, which
makes the Cap binding site more accessible (Extended Data Fig. 4D). Therefore, the 297 K
structures of Nsp10/16 in a complex with SAM, Cap-0/SAM, and Cap-1/SAH, as determined by
SSX, depict states important for molecular modeling studies and structure-based drug design.
To better understand Nsp16 activity from SARS-CoV-2, we compared it with NS5 2′-O MTase
from Dengue virus (PDB entry 5DTO) (Fig. 3). We aligned the structure of Nsp16 with the Nterminal domain of NS5 that spans 298 residues from N-terminus. Both Nsp16 and NS5 2′-O
MTases assume a Rossmann fold with a large β-sheet decorated with α-helices (Fig. 3B, D).
MTases contain a central β-sheet that is composed of six parallel and one antiparallel strands.
Despite low sequence identity (13.6%) the RMSD between the two MTases is reasonable (3.01 Å).
Both enzymes possess a canonical 2′-O MTase catalytic tetrad Lys-Asp-Lys-Glu with the aspartic
acid residue forming a hydrogen bond with a water molecule potentially relevant for catalysis
(Fig. 3A, C). The SAM binding sites share high similarity but there are major differences in the
mRNA Cap binding sites. The Mg2+ or Mn2+ ion is necessary for Nsp16 activity 39, however is not
localized near the active site in the currently available structures of Nsp10/16 from SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2. The Mg2+ ion in the N-terminal domain of NS5 2′-O MTase is coordinated by
the phosphate oxygens of the Cap 5′ to 5′ triphosphate linker and three water molecules that bridge
to three bases (A1-G2-U3) on the 5′-end.

2′-O methylation of the SARS-CoV-2 transcripts
The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10/16 2′-O MTase complex provides a molecular arrangement for
binding of the mRNA Cap-0 and subsequent methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide.
The catalytic core is in the center of the Rossmann fold and it binds the SAM molecule in the deep,
narrow grove that is buried inside the Nsp16 active site. We observed that Nsp16 had recruited
SAM during expression in E. coli (PDB entry 6W61) 20. However, addition of 2 mM SAM to the

crystallization solution improves crystallization efficiency, reduces crystallization time, and
increases the number of crystals - three highly desirable traits for SSX batch crystallization.
The SAM binding site is negatively charged and is formed by several Nsp16 residues: Asn43,
Tyr47, Gly71, Ala72, Gly73, Ser 74, Gly81, Thr82, Asp99, Leu100, Asn101, Asp114, Cys115,
Asp130, Met131, and Phe149 (Fig. 2, 4, Extended Data Fig. 5B). The SAM carboxylate moiety
binds to the positively charged N-terminus of the third a-helix spanning Pro80-Trp88. This
interaction provides additional electrostatic stabilization. Nsp16 directly interacts with Cap-1
through several residues that form a positively charged, elongated binding groove accommodating
the mRNA Cap-0 (Fig. 2, 4, Extended Data 5A). The N7-metyl guanosine binding pocket is
formed by Cys25, Asp26, Leu27, Tyr30, Thr172, Glu173, and Ser202. The 5′ to 5′ triphosphate
bridge of the Cap is stabilized through interaction with Tyr30, Lys137, Thr172, His174, Ser201,
Ser202, and Glu203. The first nucleotide of the mRNA Cap (adenosine in the presented structure)
is bound through Lys46, Asp130, Tyr132, Pro134, Lys170, Asn198, and Glu203.
SAM-dependent MTases share a conserved catalytic mechanism wherein the methyl group
is transferred to the acceptor substrate via an SN2 reaction 40, which requires a linear alignment of
the acceptor substrate (nucleophile), methyl group (electrophile), and the sulfur atom (leaving
group) of the SAH product 41. It was proposed that Nsp16 2′-O MTases follow the same general
mechanism 42. In these enzymes, the reaction is facilitated by the catalytic tetrad Lys-Asp-LysGlu, where Lys170 sandwiched between the two acidic residues (Asp130 and Glu203) serves as
a proton abstractor (Fig. 4A, B). It was shown previously in biochemical studies that substitution
to Ala of any residue of the 2′O-MTase catalytic tetrad results in an inactive enzyme 10,43. In SARSCoV-2 Nsp16 the catalytic tetrad Lys46-Asp130-Lys170-Glu203, is superposing well with Lys61D146-Lys180-Glu216 of the Dengue virus homolog (Fig. 3A, C). In the 3D context, Lys46 binds
to Glu203 which then binds to Lys170 interacting with Asp130, which further links to the amino
group of SAM. In this network, a proton can be transferred between multiple residues, occupying
different sites potentially depending on the reaction state (Fig. 4). Lys170 is well-positioned to act
as a general base deprotonating 2′-OH. Asp130 may serve multiple functions - as an acid
deprotonating Lys170 (alternating with Glu203), and an anchoring point for the cofactor via
interaction with its amino group, and as a stabilization for the sulfonium cation. However, the
reaction does not occur in a presence of EDTA, as demonstrated by the ability to capture the Cap0/SAM complex. It was reported previously using biochemical assays that the activity of Nsp10/16

2′-O MTase is magnesium dependent 39. Though, we did not observe any trace of metal near the
active site in the 297 K structures reported in this work, and any other CoV-2 Nsp10/16 structures
reported to date, despite the presence of magnesium in the crystallization buffer. We hypothesize
that the magnesium ion (or other metal ion) can transiently bind to the active site possibly replacing
one of the water molecules (for example water 38) and promoting formation of a reactive
conformation by changing electrostatics and geometry of the catalytic residues to stimulate
methylation reaction. Magnesium has a compact and tight coordination sphere with strict
octahedral geometry and a typically short Mg—O distance of 2.08 Å 44. By coordinating 2′ oxygen
and several water molecules magnesium could shortened the distance between 2′ oxygen and SAM
methyl moiety thus promoting formation of transition state and methyl transfer. During the
reaction a positively charged, sp2 planar transition state is formed and the methyl group inverts its
stereochemistry.
After the methyl-transfer reaction is completed the product is released from the active site.
This is consistent with the structure of Cap-1/SAH where several active site residues move, these
include Tyr132, the entire α-helix spanning Pro134-Lys137, and Tyr30 on the opposite site
(Fig. 4A, Extended Data Fig. 4C). All these residues are involved in interactions with Cap-0 and
observed changes perhaps allow Cap-1 to leave. Interestingly, the SAM/SAH binding site remains
virtually unchanged in all three structures (Extended Data Fig. 4), suggesting that the SAH
exchange with SAM may require dissociation of Nsp10 that controls conformation of important
loop Gly73-Gly77. Opening this loop may help SAH to leave and then a new SAM molecule can
bind.
The biochemical assays show that optimal pH for MERS-CoV Nsp10/16 activity is
approximately 8 - 8.5

39

. Additionally, the 2′-O MTase activity of Nsp10/16 from the MERS is

significantly reduced at pH below 7. Assuming that Nsp10/16 2′-O MTase efficiency is pH
dependent, we performed the 297 K SSX data collection using a buffer with pH 6.5 that could
potentially slow down the reaction. Comparison of the 100 K and the 297 K structures revealed
clear methylation only at 297 K, we hypothesize that Cap-1 could be sensitive to radiation damage
and thus can be only observed in low x-ray dose experiments. Interestingly, the 297 K structure of
Nsp10/16 obtained from a single crystal has a mixture of states with 30% of the Cap-1/SAH
products and 70% of the Cap-0/SAM substrates. It is well known that radiation damage can impact

redox systems. High x-ray dose could affect electron density around amino acid residues and lead
to photoreduction of metalloproteins 45,46,47. These free radical reactions can occur in crystals under
cryogenic conditions 48.

CONCLUSIONS
Enzymes that catalyze transmethylation reactions using SAM as the methyl group donor have
been described in many cellular processes involving nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids, and
small molecules

49

. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 methyltransferase is one representative of this large

family of proteins, which, together with Nsp10, participates in the post-transcriptional
modification of the viral RNA. This multi-step process is a prerequisite to yield fully functional
mRNA that (i) would not be recognized as foreign genetic element and, as such, be directed for
degradation 50 and (ii) could undergo translation in the human host 12,51. 2′-O Methylation of the
mRNA Cap facilitated by the Nsp10/16 is the last reaction in the mRNA assembly. Given the
indispensable role of the RNA modification for the survival of the virus, the disturbance of this
pathway, including the 2′-O methylation of Cap, is a field for development of inhibitors that affect
SARS-CoV-2 replication. To that end, understating structure-function relationship of the enzymes
catalyzing these process is critical.
Six months after the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak we reported here the first structure
for the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10/16 complex revealing the post-reaction state with 2′-O methylated
ribose of the Cap-1 bound to the protein. Despite several previous trials to visualize the product
binding by traditional crystallography, no such state could be captured. Here we applied SSX as
another attempt to fill the knowledge gaps in the 2′-O methylation process. The SSX experiments
on the Nsp10/16 crystals revealed three states: with SAM bound, with SAM and Cap-0 prior
reaction occurring, and, finally with Cap-1 and SAH after methyl transfer. These experiments were
done at 297 K under low x-ray radiation dose to the crystal. In comparison, the 297 K single crystal
structure shows methylation of the 2′-O-ribose of the Cap-0, but with partial occupancy.
Interestingly, the methylation was not observed previously in any of the Nsp10/16 structures
determined at 100 K

20,24,42,52,53

. Is this reaction sensitive to radiation damage or free radical

effects? It seems that the most elusive may be the formation of the metal-dependent state resulting
in establishing the electrostatic/geometric conditions prior activation or destabilization of

transition state as there is no depletion of the methyl group on SAM in any reported structures.
This clearly needs further investigation because SSX low radiation dose may be advantageous in
helping reveal subtle and diverse chemical transformations in enzymes that otherwise may be
degraded during x-ray or electron diffraction experiments. Therefore, the structure of Nsp10/16
with Cap-1 presented here provides unique information for understanding the mechanism that
allows SARS-CoV-2 to mimic mature eukaryotic mRNA and escape recognition by human innate
immune response.
The recent developments in micro focusing x-ray beams at synchrotron light sources and
improvement in sample delivery technology, data collection, detectors, and computing will allow
rapid determination of new structures using SSX and revealing significant biological information.
The further development of SSX and implementation of time-resolved SSX crystallography is an
approach that could visualize chemical processes and protein molecular dynamics - such as of the
transfer of the methyl group catalyzed by Nsp10/16 2′O-MTase from SARS-CoV-2. Thus far the
Cap-1 was only observed in the structure obtained using SSX. For diffraction experiments
conducted at 297 K, SSX provides significant advantages over data collected using a single crystal
as it considerably increases resolution, use less sample in comparison with a liquid jet delivery
system and reduces levels of x-ray dose. Studies of other enzymes can also significantly benefit
from using this approach.

METHODS
Crystallization of Nsp10/16 complex
The recombinant proteins Nsp10 and Nsp16 from SARS-CoV-2 were expressed in E. coli and
purified as described by Rosas-Lemus 20. The freshly purified Nsp10 and Nsp16 were mixed in
a 1:1 molar ratio to the final concentration of the complex as 2 mg/ml. Subsequently, the Nsp10/16
sample was dialyzed overnight at 297 K in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl,
2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 5% w/v glycerol. The Nsp10/16 heterodimer was supplemented with
2 mM SAM (Sigma Aldrich) and concentrated at 21°C to 4.0 mg/ml using a 30 kDa cut-off
centrifugal concentrator Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore). Two criteria for preliminary selection for
batch crystallization were getting crystals with the highest possible symmetry as well as having

one Nsp10/16 heterodimer in the asymmetric unit. Such conditions were met by crystals with
hexagonal space group P3121. The complex was initially crystallized in a buffer 0.1 M MES pH
6.5 and 0.6 M sodium fluoride from Anions Suite crystallization screen (Qiagen). After
optimization of crystallization conditions, we used 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 0.9 M NaF for batch
crystallizations. For each batch of crystals 100 µl of the Nsp10/16 complex was mixed with 100 µl
of the precipitant buffer and crystallization was performed in 500 µl Eppendorf polypropylene
tube. These volumes allowed us to get the number of crystals suitable for data collection from one
chip. We have prepared several batches using same conditions to get reproducible data collection
and have the ability to merge data from multiple chips. The crystals grew to optimum sizes in
10 days at 21°C before the SSX data collection. To obtain the structure of Nsp10/16/Cap-0/SAM,
the crystal batch was supplemented with 1 mM EDTA two days before data collection.
Preparation of the sample for data collection
The crystals from batch crystallization were centrifuged at 100 RCF for 2 minutes at 297 K.
The excess solution was removed with a pipette, until 15 µl was left. Crystals sedimented on the
walls of Eppendorf polypropylene tube were gently resuspended using 20 µl pipette tips with a cut
end to increase the diameter of the tip to minimize mechanical damage to crystals. Then 1.5 µl of
10 mM stock of the m7GpppA (S1405L, New England Biolabs) was added to crystal slurry and the
mix was loaded on a 60 µm grid made from nylon (NY6004700, Millipore) which was placed on
a 6 µm layer of mylar polyester film. The nylon mesh was covered on the top with a second layer
of 6 µm mylar and sealed with the ALEX magnetic holder, such that sample is hermetically sealed
from the outside environment. Data collection was started approximately 20 minutes after
assembly of the chip.
Serial crystallography data collection
We collected SSX data for the Nsp10/16 crystals at the 19-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon
Source using the fixed-target SSX (ALEX) mesh-holder developed at the Structural Biology Center
(SBC) as depicted in Figure 1A and Extended Data Fig. 1. A crystal slurry is deposited on a nylon
mesh, which immobilizes the crystals; they are then encapsulated between two polyester films 36.
The rod-shape crystals grew without seeding and the average crystal size was 120x25x25 µm
(Extended Data Fig. 2A). Serial data collection was collected using three SmarAct SLC-17 stages
configured in an XYZ geometry, with each having sufficient movement range to cover the sample

area of the specially designed ALEX holder (patent application serial #16/903,601). The beamline
was configured at an energy of 12,662 eV, with collimator slit sizes set to 75 x 75 µm, and step
size (distance between exposures) of 50 µm: overlapping exposed area to maximize crystal hits.
The five mesh-covered samples used a grid of 170 steps in the x-direction (columns) by 210 steps
in the y-direction (rows), covering a total area of approximately 8.5 x 10.5 mm. The number of
steps and the resulting area varied slightly per sample depending on the chip mount position or
possible false-starts. Extended Data Table 1 contains details of number of chips and detector
distances used for data collection for Nsp10/16 SSX structures.
Crispy, the data acquisition GUI for serial collection at sector 19, allows for quick alignment
and acts as a source of information for downstream processing. Metadata in the form of JSON files
and beamline/collection strategy parameters are input and passed into the system before collection.
These parameters include grid dimensions, detector distance/resolution, unit cell dimension,
protein PDB coordinates, and a handful of others.
Serial crystallography data processing
The Kanzus pipeline orchestrates SSX data acquisition, analysis, cataloging, and publishes
processing metrics. Kanzus uses a cloud-hosted research automation system called Globus
Automate to manage these multi-step data “flows” 54. The first phase of the pipeline is integrated
with the APS Data Management System at the beamline, which deposits each newly acquired
image into an Globus-accessible storage system at the APS. As new images are acquired, Globus
Automate “flows” are launched to process them as follow: 1) moves new files from APS to Theta
by using the Globus Transfer service 55; 2) performs DIALS stills_process
images by using funcX

56

on batches of 256

, a function-as-a-service computation system (funcX uses Parsl

58

to abstract and acquire nodes on Theta as needed, and dispatches tasks to available nodes); 3)
extracts metadata from files regarding identified diffractions, and generates visualizations (funcX)
showing the locations of positive hits on the mesh; and 4) publishes raw data, metadata, and
visualizations to a portal on the ALCF Petrel data system 59. The result of this automated process
is an indexed, searchable data collection that provides full traceability from data acquisition to
processed data, and that can be used to inspect and update the running experiment.
Images were collected at 7 Hz, meaning that a 256-image batch totaling 1.56 GB, was
generated every 35 seconds. The data transfers to ALCF ran at up to 700 MB/s via Globus, and 30

Theta nodes processed images by using DIALS stills_process at 22 images per second in steadystate. As experimental configuration values were refined, reprocessing tasks were submitted as
required. FuncX managed these tasks by expanding the number of Theta nodes being used to a
maximum of 250, which enabled a processing rate of greater than 200 images a second.
Successfully processed images with diffraction-produced integration files were returned to the
beamline computers and later refined and merged using PRIME 60.
Structure solution and refinement
The crystal structures of the Nsp10/16 complex were solved by molecular replacement using
MolRep 61 from the CCP4 package. The structures were refined by multiple cycles in REFMAC
v. 5.8.0258

followed by manual edition of the model using Coot

. Ligands: Cap-1, Cap-0,

Gppp, m7Gpp, SAM, SAH, and Zn2+ were manually placed in to electron density at the beginning

of the refinements. The stereochemistry of structures were analyzed using MolProbity and the
Ramachandran plot. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for Nsp10/16 structures
determined with SSX were deposited to PDB with assigned accession codes: 6XKM – SAM,
7JPE – Cap-0/SAM, 7JHE – Cap-1/SAH. Nsp10/16 complex with mixture of Cap-0/Cap-1 and
SAH/SAM determined from single crystal at 297 K has PDB entry 7JIB. Figures were prepared
with PyMol and UCSF Chimera 64.
