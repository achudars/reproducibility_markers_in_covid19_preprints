Abstract
Global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues
unabated. Binding of SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein to host angiotensin converting enzyme 2
triggers viral entry, but other proteins may participate, including neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1).
As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – a pro-nociceptive
and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling.
VEGF-A–triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor
EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of
spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons.
Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain
model. A ‘silencing’ of pain via subversion of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased
disease transmission in asymptomatic individuals.

1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of
COVID-19, a coronavirus disease that, as of August 24, has infected more than 23.5 million
people and caused nearly 810,000 deaths worldwide [15]. Most patients infected with SARSCoV-2 report mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms such as fever, cough and
shortness of breath [30]. On the other hand, a subset of patients who are diagnosed by a positive
nuclei acids test but are either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic [30]. Increasing
evidence shows that asymptomatic individuals can spread the virus efficiently, and the
emergence of these silent spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 has limited control of the pandemic [14;
41]. Pain is a rising concern in symptomatic patients, likely emanating from a direct attack of
SARS-CoV-2 on cells and the “cytokine storm” unleashed by affected cells [51; 68]. Whether
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals have reduced pain thresholds, or whether
their pain is silenced is unknown, but either could contribute to increased disease transmission
dynamics.
The surface expressed angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been lionized as the
main receptor for uptake of SARS-CoV-2 [22; 60; 64]. Emerging evidence points to a subset of
ACE2 expressing sensory neurons [48] that synapse with spinal and brainstem CNS neurons to
produce neurological effects, including headache and nerve pain [32; 34]. Curiously, ACE2 is
not present in most neurons [48], despite increasing reports of neurological symptoms being
common in COVID-19 patients [32]. Paradoxically, though the levels of ACE2 expression
decline in aging [49], increased COVID-19 severity was noted in older patient populations, such
as that of Italy’s [2], supporting the contention that ACE2 is not the sole gateway for entry of
SARS-CoV-2 [1].
Two recent reports demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein can bind to the
b1b2 domain of the neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). This interaction occurs through a polybasic
amino acid sequence (682RRAR685), not conserved in SARS and MERS, termed the ‘C-end rule’
(CendR) motif, which significantly potentiates its entry into cells [6; 11]. Importantly, ‘omic’
analyses revealed a significant upregulation of NRP-1 in biological samples from COVID-19
patients compared to healthy controls [6]. Using vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), a physiological ligand for the b1b2 pocket in NRP-1, we interrogated whether the Spike
protein, the major surface antigen of SARS-CoV-2, could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling to
affect pain behaviors. Given parallels between the pro-nociceptive effects of VEGF-A in rodents
[4; 58] and humans [23; 58] and clinical findings demonstrating increased VEGF-A levels in
bronchial alveolar lavage fluid from COVID-19 patients [47] coupled with substantially lower
levels in the sera of asymptomatic individuals compared to symptomatic patients [30], a
secondary question was to test whether Spike protein could confer analgesia. We found that
VEGF-A sensitizes nociceptor activity – a hallmark of neuropathic pain [59], which was blocked
by the Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229 [26]. Furthermore, we identify a novel
analgesic role for Spike protein, which is mirrored by NRP-1 inhibition.

Pathogen-free adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (225-250g; Envigo, Indianapolis, IN)
were housed in temperature-controlled (23±3 ˚C) and light-controlled (12-h light/12-h dark
cycle; lights on 07:00-19:00) rooms with standard rodent chow and water available ad libitum.
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the College of Medicine at the University
of Arizona approved all experiments. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health.
Animals were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups for the behavioral experiments.
Animals were initially housed 3 per cage but individually housed after the intrathecal
cannulation. All behavioral experiments were performed by experimenters who were blinded to
the experimental groups and treatments.
2.2. ELISAbased NRP1–Spike protein binding assay

Plates (96 well, Nunc Maxisorp; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were coated
with human Neuropilin-1-Fc (10 ng per well, Cat# 50-101-8343, Fisher, Hampton, NH) and
incubated at room temperature overnight. The following day, the plates were washed and
blocked with 3% BSA in PBS to minimize non specific adsorptive binding to the plates. SARSCoV-2 Spike protein (S1 domain aa16-685, Cat# Z03485, Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) was added
at concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 500 to nM. As a negative control, some wells received
PBS containing 3% BSA. The plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 3 h.
Next, the plates were washed with PBS to eliminate unbound protein. Bound SARS-CoV-2
Spike was detected by anti His probe HRP (Cat#15165; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Some wells
received no antibody (no antibody control). Tetramethylbenzidine (Cat#DY999, R&D Systems,
St. Louis, MO) was used as the colorimetric substrate. The optical density of each well was
determined immediately, using a microplate reader (Multiskan Ascent; Thermo Fisher Scientific)
set to 450 nm with a correction wavelength of 570 nm. Data were analyzed by non-linear
regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
2.3. Preparation of acutely dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons.
Dorsal root ganglia from all levels were acutely dissociated using methods as described
previously [18]. Rat DRG neurons were isolated from 100g female Sprague-Dawley rats using
previously developed procedures [36].
2.4. Culturing primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and micro-electrode array (MEA)
analysis.
Dissociated DRG neurons were maintained in media containing Neurobasal (Cat# 21103049,
Thermofisher), 2% B-27 (Cat# 17504044, Thermofisher), 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate
from 10,000 µg/ml stock, 30 ng/ml nerve growth factor, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone).
Collected cells were re-suspended in DRG media and seeded as a 10-µl drop on the poly-Dlysine coated electrodes of the micro-electrode array (MEA) (24-well plate, Cat# MED-Q2430L,
MED64, Japan). The cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min and then flooded with DRG media.
The next day, cells were analyzed on a MED64 presto where 24 wells, with each containing 16
electrodes, could be recorded simultaneously. Cells were treated with the indicated neuropilin 1
ligands Semaphorin 3A (3nM; Cat#5926-S3-025, R&D Systems), VEGF-A165 (1nM, Cat#P4853,
Abnova) or VEGF-B (1nM, Cat#RPU44324, Biomatik) for 30 min before recording. Treatments
with either Spike (100nM, Cat#Z03485, Genscript) or the NRP-1 inhibitor EG-00229 (30µM,
Cat#6986, Tocris) was done 30min before adding VEGF-A. The data was analyzed on MEA
symphony and Mobius offline toolkit to extract the firing rate of the active electrodes before and

after prolactin treatment. Firing rate is shown as Hz (event per second) for the electrodes that
showed spontaneous activity.
2.5. Whole-cell patch recordings of Na+ and N-type (CaV2.2) Ca2+ currents in acutely
dissociated DRG neurons.
Recordings were obtained from acutely dissociated DRG neurons as described previously [25;
37]. The solutions and protocols for measuring sodium currents was exactly as descried [35]. The
protocol for isolating N-type calcium currents was previously described by Khanna et al. [10;
28]. To isolate the N-type channel in DRGs, contributions of the high- and low- voltageactivated low calcium channel subtypes was blocked with the following subunit-selective
blockers (all purchased from Alomone Labs, Jerusalem): Nifedipine (10 μM, L-type); ωagatoxin GIVA (200 nM, P/Q-type) [33]; SNX-482 (200 nM, R-type) [39]; and TTA-P2 (1 µM,
T-type)[10]. DRG neurons were interrogated with current-voltage (I-V) and
activation/inactivation voltage protocols as previously described [16; 18; 35].
To determine the effect of VEGF-A application on voltage gated sodium and calcium
currents, we incubated recombinant rat VEGF-A (1 nM in PBS) with DRG neurons for 30
minutes before whole-cell recordings. Additionally, recombinant Spike protein (100 nM in PBS)
and the Neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) blocker EG00229 (30 μM in DMSO, Cat. No. 6986, Tocris
Bioscience) were also applied to the culture medium for 30 minutes before recording. For
experiments where the proteins were tested in combination, the Spike protein was added first for
30 minutes, followed by VEGF-A and EG00229 for another 30 minutes before recording
commenced. The control conditions used either PBS, DMSO, or both to match the solutions used
in the experimental conditions. The proteins and blocker were included at the same
concentrations in the extracellular recording solution during all data acquisition.
2.6. Preparation of spinal cord slices.
As described before [65], transverse 350-μm thick slices were prepared from young rats
(postnatal 10-14 days) for electrophysiological recordings at RT. VEGFA (1nM), NRP-1
inhibitor (EG00229, 30 µM) and Spike protein were added directly to the recording solution as
indicated. Slices were treated for 30 min prior to the recordings.
2.7. Electrophysiological recording in spinal cord slices by whole-cell patch clamp.
Substantia gelatinosa neurons were recorded from using methods exactly as described
previously [66].
2.8. Hind paw injection procedures.
PBS vehicle (NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.5 mM, Na2HPO4 10 mM and KH2PO4 1.8 mM), VEGF-A165
(10 nM), Spike (100 nM) and EG00229 (30 µM) were injected subcutaneously, alone or in
combination, in the dorsum of the left hind paw. Rats were gently restrained under a fabric cloth,
and 50 µL were injected using 0.5 mL syringes (27-G needles).
2.9. Implantation of intrathecal catheter.
For intrathecal (i.t.) drug administration, rats were chronically implanted with catheters as
described by Yaksh and Rudy [63].
2.10. Testing of allodynia.

The assessment of tactile allodynia (i.e., a decreased threshold to paw withdrawal after probing
with normally innocuous mechanical stimuli) using a series of calibrated fine (von Frey)
filaments was done as described in Chaplan et al [8].
2.11. Spared nerve injury (SNI).
Nerve injury was inflicted as described previously [12]. Rats were tested on day 10 following the
surgery, at which time they had developed stable and maximal mechanical allodynia.
2.12. Synapse enrichment and fractionation.
Adult rats were anesthetized using isoflurane and decapitated. Spinal cords were removed, and
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord was dissected as this structure contains the synapses arising
from the DRG. Synaptosomes isolation was done as described previously [42]. Integrity of nonpostsynaptic density (non-PSD) and PSD fractions was verified by immunoblotting. PSD95 was
enriched in the PSD fractions while synaptophysin was enriched in non-PSD fractions (not
shown). BCA protein assay was used to determine protein concentrations.
2.13. Immunoblot preparation and analysis.
Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Cat# PI23225, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Indicated samples were loaded on 4-20% Novex® gels (Cat#
EC60285BOX, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Proteins were transferred for 1h at 120
V using TGS (25mM Tris pH=8.5, 192mM glycine, 0.1% (mass/vol) SDS), 20% (vol/vol)
methanol as transfer buffer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes 0.45μm (Cat#
IPVH00010, Millipore, Billerica, MA), pre-activated in pure methanol. After transfer, the
membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 hour with TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 0.1 % Tween 20), 5% (mass/vol) non-fat dry milk, then incubated separately in
the primary antibodies VEGFR2 (Cat#PA5-16487, ThermoFisher), pY1175 VEGFR2 (Cat#PA5105167, ThermoFisher), Flotilin (Cat#F1180, Sigma) or Neuropilin-1 (Cat#sc-5307, Santa Cruz
biotechnology) in TBST, 5% (mass/vol) BSA, overnight at 4°C. Following incubation in
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from Jackson immunoresearch, blots
were revealed by enhanced luminescence (WBKLS0500, Millipore, Billerica, MA) before
exposure to photographic film. Films were scanned, digitized, and quantified using Un-Scan-It
gel version 7.1 scanning software by Silk Scientific Inc.
2.14. Docking of VEGF-A Spike protein and EG00229 to NRP-1.
Peptide from C-terminus of furin cleaved SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 681-PRRAR-685 (blue
sticks) was docked to NRP-1-b1 domain (white surface with binding site in red; PDB 6fmc [46])
using Glide (Schrödinger [19]). Molecular figures generated with PyMol 1.8 (Schrödinger,
LLC.)
2.15. Statistical Analysis.
All data was first tested for a Gaussian distribution using a D’Agostino-Pearson test (Prism 8
Software, Graphpad, San Diego, CA). The statistical significance of differences between means
was determined by a parametric ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc or a non-parametric
Kruskal Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test depending on if datasets achieved
normality. Behavioral data with a time course were analyzed by Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s
post hoc test. Differences were considered significant if p≤ 0.05. Error bars in the graphs
represent mean ± SEM. All data were plotted in Prism 8.

3. Results
3.1. Ligand specific engagement of NRP-1 signaling induces nociceptor activity and pain.
Initially, we assessed the involvement of Spike and NRP-1 in the VEGF-A/NRP-1
pathway. An interaction between Spike (S1 domain aa 16-685, containing the CendR motif
682
RRAR685) and the extracellular portion of NRP-1 was confirmed by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 1A). We calculated an equilibrium constant of dissociation
(Kd) for this interaction to be ~166.2 nM (Fig. 1A). Next, we plated sensory neurons on
multiwell microelectrode arrays (MEAs), an approach enabling multiplexed measurements of
spontaneous, as well as stimulus-evoked extracellular action potentials from large populations of
cells [9]. VEGF-A increased spontaneous firing of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which
was blocked by the S1 domain of the Spike protein and by the NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229 (Fig.
1A). In contrast, ligands VEGF-B (ligand for VEGFR1 – a co-receptor for NRP-1 [31]) and
semaphorin 3A (Sema3A, ligand for plexin receptor – also a co-receptor for NRP-1) [13; 53])
did not affect the spontaneous firing of nociceptors (Fig. 1B, C). The lack of effect of VEGF-B
and Sema3A rule out a role for VEGF-R1 and plexin, respectively, thus implicating a novel
ligand-, VEGF-A, and receptor-, NRP-1, specific pathway driving nociceptor firing (Fig. 1D).
As both VEGF-A and Spike protein share a common binding pocket on NRP-1 (Fig. 1C)
[6; 11; 43], we asked if the Spike protein could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling to affect pain
behaviors. Consistent with previous reports [4; 58], we confirmed that VEGF-A is pronociceptive as intra-plantar injection of VEGF-A decreased both paw withdrawal thresholds
(Fig. 2A, B and Table S1) and latencies to a thermal stimulus (Fig. 2C, D and Table S1) in male
rats. Similar results were obtained in female rats as well (Fig. 2E-H and Table S1). Preventing
VEGF-A from binding to NRP-1 with the NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229 or Spike from activating
VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling, blunted the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced
by VEGF-A alone (Fig. 2 and Table S1). Neither Spike nor EG00229 alone had any effect on
these behaviors (Fig. 2 and Table S1) in either sex. Together, these data provide functional
evidence that VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling promotes a pain-like phenotype by sensitizing
nociceptor activity (Fig. 1D).
3.2. VEGF-A–mediated increases in DRG ion channel currents are normalized by disruption of
VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling.
To gain insight into the mechanism by which VEGF-A contributed to increased
nociceptor activity, we postulated that ion channels in DRGs may be affected, as these contribute
to nociceptive plasticity [61]. Typical families of Na+ currents from small diameter DRG neurons
are shown in Figure 3A. VEGF-A facilitated a 1.9–fold increase in total Na+ currents compared
to vehicle (PBS)-treated DRGs, which was completely blocked by Spike protein (Fig. 3B, C).
Spike protein alone did not affect Na+ currents (Fig. 3B, C and Table S1). Since this decreased
current could arise from changes in channel gating, we determined if activation and inactivation
kinetics of DRG Na+ currents were affected. Half-maximal activation and inactivation (V1/2), as
well as slope values (k) for activation and inactivation, were no different between the conditions
tested (Fig. 3D, E and Tables S1, S2), except for an ~8 mV hyperpolarizing shift in sodium
channel inactivation induced by co-treatment of VEGF-A and EG00229 (Table S2). Similar
results were obtained for the NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229, which also inhibited the VEGF-A

mediated increase in total Na+ currents (Fig. 3F-H and Table S1) but had no effect on the
biophysical properties (Fig. 3I, J and Tables S1, S2).
As calcium channels play multiple critical roles in the transmission and processing of
pain-related information within the primary afferent pain pathway [61], we evaluated if they
were affected. We focused on N-type (CaV2.2) channels as these mediate neurotransmitter
release at afferent fiber synapses in the dorsal horn and are critical in the pain matrix [50].
VEGF-A facilitated a 1.8–fold increase in total Ca2+ currents compared to vehicle (PBS)-treated
DRGs, which was completely blocked by Spike protein (Fig. 4A-C and Table S1). Spike protein
alone did not affect Ca2+ currents (Fig. 4A-C). Additionally, we did not observe any changes in
activation and inactivation kinetics between the conditions tested (Fig. 4D, E and Tables S1, S2).
Similar results were obtained for the NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229, which inhibited the VEGF-A
mediated increase in N-type Ca2+ currents (Fig. 4F-H and Table S1) but had no effect on the
biophysical properties (Fig. 4I, J and Tables S1, S2). These data implicate Spike protein and
NRP-1 in Na+ and Ca2+ (CaV2.2) channels in VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling.
3.3. VEGF-A enhances synaptic activity in the lumbar dorsal horn that is normalized by
inhibition of NRP-1 signaling and Spike protein.
The spinal cord is an integrator of sensory transmission where incoming nociceptive
signals undergo convergence and modulation [57]. Spinal presynaptic neurotransmission relies
on DRG neuron action potential firing and neurotransmitter release. From these fundamental
physiological principles, as well as the results described above, we were prompted to evaluate
whether synaptic activity was affected in the lumbar dorsal horn. The amplitudes of spontaneous
excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) of neurons in the substantia gelatinosa region of the
lumbar dorsal horn were not affected by VEGF-A (Fig. 5A, B and Table S1). In contrast, VEGFA application increased sEPSC frequency by ~3.6–fold, which was reduced by ~57% by
inhibition of NRP-1 with EG00229 and ~50% by Spike protein (Fig. 5A, C and Table S1).
Amplitude and inter-event interval cumulative distribution curves for sEPSCs are shown in
Figure 5D, E. When compared to vehicle controls, VEGF-A, with or without NRP-1 inhibitor or
Spike protein, had no effect on the cumulative amplitude distribution of the spontaneous EPSCs
(Fig. 5D and Table S1) but changed the cumulative frequency distribution of spontaneous EPSCs
with significantly longer inter-event intervals (Fig. 5E and Table S1). Together, these data
suggest a presynaptic mechanism of action of Spike protein and NRP-1.
3.5. Spike protein and inhibition of NRP-1 confer anti-nociception in the spared nerve injury
model (SNI) of chronic neuropathic pain.
We used the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, chosen because it
produces a reliable and consistent increase in pain sensitivity [12], to evaluate the potential of
disruption of the VEGF-A/NRP-1 pathway to reverse nociception. VEGF-A triggers
autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Y1175 [54], thereby serving as a proxy for activation of
VEGF-A signaling. In rats with SNI, intrathecal application of Spike, decreased the
phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Y1175) on both the contralateral (non-injured) and ipsilateral
(injured) side (Fig. 6A, B). This shows that Spike can inhibit VEGF-A signaling in a rat model of
chronic neuropathic pain. SNI injury efficiently reduced paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs)
(mechanical allodynia, Fig. 6C and Table S1) 10 days post injury. Spinal administration of Spike
protein significantly increased PWTs (Fig. 6C and Table S1), in a dose-dependent manner, for 5
hours. Analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) confirmed the dose-dependent reversal of

mechanical allodynia (Fig. 6D and Table S1) compared to vehicle-treated injured animals.
Similar results were seen with female rats injected with Spike (Fig. 6E, F). Finally, inhibition of
NRP-1 signaling with EG00229 also reversed paw-withdrawal thresholds (Fig. 6G, H and Table
S1).
4.0. Discussion
Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein subverts VEGF-A/NRP-1 pronociceptive signaling. Relevant to chronic neuropathic pain, Spike negated VEGF-A–mediated
increases in: (i) voltage-gated sodium and N-type calcium current densities in DRG neurons; (ii)
spontaneous firing in DRG neurons; (iii) spinal neurotransmission; and (iv) mechanical allodynia
and thermal hyperalgesia. Consequently, Spike protein was analgesic in a nerve injury rat model.
Based on the reported increase in VEGF-A levels in COVID-19 patients [30], one would expect
to observe increased pain-related symptoms. However, our data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein hijacks NRP-1 signaling to ameliorate VEGF-A mediated pain. This raises the
possibility that pain, as an early symptom of COVID-19, may be directly dampened by the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Our results do not exclude the possibility that alternative fragments
of Spike or other viral proteins may be pro-nociceptive. Leveraging this atypical function of
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein may yield a novel class of therapeutics for pain.
Clinical findings that VEGF-A contributes to pain are supported by observations that in
osteoarthritis increased VEGF expression in synovial fluids has been associated with higher pain
scores [55]. VEGF-A has been reported to enhance pain behaviors in normal, nerve-injured and
diabetic animals [23; 58]. Blocking VEGF-A has been shown to reduce nociception in rodents
and to exert a neuroprotective effect by improving neuronal restoration and conduction,
decreasing pro-apoptotic Caspase-3 levels in sensory neurons, preventing neural perfusion and
epidermal sensory fiber loss [24; 52; 67]. Alternative splicing of the VEGF-A gene produces
several isoforms of the mature protein containing between 121 and 206 amino acid residues, with
VEGF-A165a being pro-nociceptive [23] via sensitization of transient receptor potential (TRP)
channels [24] and ATP-gated purinergic P2X2/3 receptors [27] in DRG neurons. VEGF-A165b
is a VEGFR2 partial agonist that competes with VEGF-A165a for binding to VEGFR2. The
VEGF-A165a isoform also binds to the NRP-1 co-receptor, whereas VEGFA165b does not [44].
Thus, it is a balance of the splice isoforms (VEGF-Aa/b) that likely determines the nociceptive
impact effect on sensory neurons.
Our data shows that VEGF-A elicits long-lasting (up to 24 hours) mechanical allodynia
and thermal hyperalgesia in male and female naïve rats, thus supporting the premise that VEGFA is pro-nociceptive. VEGF is augmented in serum of rheumatoid arthritis patients [4; 40]. The
levels of VEGF-A were substantially lower in the sera of asymptomatic individuals compared to
symptomatic individuals and matched those found in healthy controls [30]. Conversely,
transcript levels of the VEGF-A co-receptor NRP-1 were increased in COVID-19 patients
compared to healthy controls [6]. NRP-1 is a dimeric transmembrane receptor that regulates
pleiotropic biological processes, including axon guidance, angiogenesis and vascular
permeability [21; 45; 56]. In chronic neuropathic pain, a concomitant increase of NRP-1 and
VEGF-A have been reported in DRG neurons [29]. We observed that pharmacological
antagonism of the VEGF-A binding b1b2 domain of NRP-1 using EG00229 resulted in
decreased mechanical allodynia in SNI. A corollary to this, VEGF-A–induced DRG sensitization
and the related allodynia/hyperalgesia in naïve rats was annulled by NRP-1 antagonism. This
work identifies a heretofore unknown role of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling in pain. Our working

model shows that VEGF-A engagement of NRP-1 is blocked by Spike protein consequently
decreasing activities of two key nociceptive voltage-gated sodium, likely NaV1.7, and calcium
(CaV2.2) channels (Fig. 1D). The resulting decrease in spontaneous DRG neuronal firing by
Spike protein translates into a reduction in pain (Fig. 1D). Characterization of the molecular
cascade downstream of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling awaits further work.
Altogether, our data suggest that interfering with VEGF-A/NRP-1 using SARS-CoV-2
Spike or the NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229 is analgesic. For cancer, this pathway has been
extensively targeted for anti-angiogenesis. A monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A
(bevacizumab, Avastin®) has been used as a cancer treatment [20]. A phase 1a clinical trial of
NRP-1 antibody MNRP1685A (Vesencumab®), targeting the against VEGF-binding site of
NRP-1, was well-tolerated in cancer patients [62], but neuropathy was noted. Possible reasons
for this include the possibility that anti-VEGF-A therapies may target the alternatively spliced
VEGF-A165b isoform, which has a neuroprotective role. It is important to note that the VEGFA165b isoform binds to the VEGFR2 binding site with equal affinity to VEGF165a but does not
bind to the co-receptor neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) [7], thus acting as an inhibitor of the VEGF-ANRP-1 pathway [3]. Anti-VEGF-A therapies may simultaneously inhibit both pro- and antialgesic pathways involving the multiple VEGF-A isoforms, thus an ensuing loss of balance may
favor nociceptor sensitization. Here, we are specifically studying the downstream actions
following the binding of VEGF-A165a to the b1 domain of NRP-1. Targeting this interaction
may be more specific compared to broad VEGF-A inhibitors that have been developed for cancer
treatment. Thus, our preclinical work provides a rationale for targeting the VEGF-A/NRP-1 pronociceptive signaling axis in future clinical trials.

Figure 1. Ligand specific engagement of NRP-1 signaling induces nociceptor activity,
promoting a pain-like phenotype. (A) Graph showing normalized NRP-1 binding to increasing
concentrations of recombinant Spike protein (n=8 replicates per concentration). Data were
normalized to wells with no antibody and background subtracted. The data was fit assuming a
one site of binding mode and yielded a Kd of ~166.2 nM. (B) Mean action potential firing rates
(Hz, event per second) of cultured DRG sensory neurons incubated for 30 min with VEGF-B (3
nM), Sema3A (100 ng), VEGF-A (1 nM), VEGF-A plus Spike (100 nM) or VEGF-A plus NRP1 inhibitor EG00229 (30 μM) [26]. Of the ligands tested, only VEGF-A, acting on VEGFR2, is a
ligand for NRP-1 that triggers an increase in spontaneous firing of nociceptors. Data is shown as
mean ± s.e.m. and was analyzed by non-parametric two-way analysis of variance (post hoc:
Sidak). P values, versus control (PBS) or VEGF-A, are indicated. EG00229 is an NRP-1
inhibitor (PDB 3i97). (C) Top left: VEGF-A heparin binding domain (gray cartoon with R323 in
sticks) in complex with the NRP-1 b1 domain (white surface with binding site in red; PDB 4deq
[43]). Top right: Peptide from C-terminus of furin cleaved SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 681PRRAR-685 (blue sticks) docked to NRP1-b1 domain (white surface with binding site in red;
PDB 6fmc [46]) using Glide (Schrödinger ). Additional Spike residues 678-TNS-680 modeled
for illustration purposes only (blue cartoon). Bottom: Compound EG00229 (cyan sticks) in
complex with NRP-1 b1 domain ((white surface with binding site in red; PDB 3i97 [26]). (D)
Schematic illustration of the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to NRP-1 b1b2
domain triggers an intracellular cascade that increases sodium and calcium channel activity to
increase nociceptor activity culminating in enhanced pain.
Figure 2. VEGF-A promotes a pain-like phenotype that is blocked by Spike protein or
NRP-1 inhibition in male and female rats. Paw withdrawal thresholds (A, B – male and E, F –
female ) or latencies (C, D – male and G, H – female) for male and female naïve rats injected in
the paw with VEGF-A (10 nM), Spike (100 nM), EG00229 (30 µM) or PBS (vehicle), alone or
in combination (50 µl/rat; = 6-12). For clarity, statistical significance is not presented in the time
course graphs, instead it is presented in Table S1. Panels B, F, D and H are the area under the
curve for 0-24 hours. Data is shown as mean ± s.e.m. and was analyzed by non-parametric twoway analysis of variance where time was the within subject factor and treatment was the between

analysis of variance with Kruskal-Wallis post-hoc test. The experiments were analyzed by an
investigator blinded to the treatment. For full statistical analyses see Table S1.
Figure 3. VEGF-A–mediated increase in sodium currents is normalized by Spike protein or
NRP-1 inhibition in DRG neurons. Representative sodium current traces (A, F) recorded from
small-sized DRGs neurons, incubated for 30 min with the indicated treatments, in response to
depolarization steps from −70 to +60 mV from a holding potential of −60 mV. Summary of
current-voltage curves (B, G) and normalized peak (C, H) currents (pA/pF) from DRG neurons
as indicated. Boltzmann fits for normalized conductance G/Gmax voltage relationship for voltage
dependent activation (D, I) and inactivation (E, J) of the sensory neurons as indicated. Error bars
indicate mean ± s.e.m. Half-maximal activation and inactivation (V1/2) and slope values (k) for
activation and inactivation were not different between any of the conditions (p >0.9999, KruskalWallis test with Dunn’s post hoc); values presented in Table S2. P values of comparisons
between treatments are as indicated; for full statistical analyses see Table S1.
Figure 4. VEGF-A–mediated increase in calcium currents is normalized by Spike protein
or NRP-1 inhibition in DRG neurons. Representative calcium current (via N-type channels)
traces (A, F) recorded from small-sized DRGs neurons, incubated for 30 min with the indicated
treatments, in response to holding voltage of −60 mV with 200-ms voltage steps applied at 5-s
intervals in +10 mV increments from −70 to +60 mV. Pharmacological isolation of N-type
(CaV2.2) current was achieved with a cocktail of toxins/small molecules. Summary of currentvoltage curves (B, G) and normalized peak (C, H) currents (pA/pF) from DRG neurons as
indicated. Boltzmann fits for normalized conductance G/Gmax voltage relations for voltage
dependent activation (D, I) and inactivation (E, J) of the sensory neurons as indicated. Error bars
indicate mean ± s.e.m. Half-maximal activation and inactivation (V1/2) and slope values (k) for
activation and inactivation were not different between any of the conditions (p >0.9999, KruskalWallis test with Dunn’s post hoc); values presented in Table S2. P values of comparisons
between treatments are as indicated; for full statistical analyses see Table S1.
Figure 5. sEPSC frequency is reduced by pharmacological antagonism of NRP-1 by
EG00229. (A) Representative traces of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC)
from neurons from the substantia gelatinosa in the superficial dorsal horn (lamina I/II) treated for
at least 30 min with the indicated conditions. Summary of amplitudes (B) and frequencies (C) of
sEPSCs for all groups are shown. Cumulative distribution of the sEPSCs amplitude (D) and the
inter-event interval (E) recorded from cells as indicated. Perfusion of 30 μM EG00229 decreased
spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission (A-E) in lumbar dorsal horn neurons. P values of
comparisons between treatments are as indicated; for full statistical analyses see Table S1.
Figure 6. SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein and NRP-1 antagonism reverses SNI-induced
mechanical allodynia. Spared nerve injury (SNI) elicited mechanical allodynia 10 days after
surgery. (A) Representative immunoblots of NRP-1, total and pY1175 VEGF-R2 levels at presynaptic sites in rat spinal dorsal horn after SNI. Tissues were collected 3 hours (i.e., at peak of
anti-allodynia) following intrathecal injection of the receptor binding domain of the Spike
protein (2.14 μg/5μl). (B) Bar graph with scatter plots showing the quantification of n= 4
samples as in A (*p<0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). Paw withdrawal thresholds for SNI rats (male)
