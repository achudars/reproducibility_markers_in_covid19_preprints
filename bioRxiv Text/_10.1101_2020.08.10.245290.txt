Abstracts
The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has a great impact on the whole world. In a
theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, pangolins were considered a potential intermediate host.
To assemble the coronavirus found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 were used a reference genome in
most of studies, assuming that pangolins CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the closest neighbors in the
evolution. However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the selection of
reference genome affect the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various
representative CoV as reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting
assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as reference showed better statistics in total
length and N50 than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 maybe a
better reference for assembling CoV in pangolin or other potential intermediate hosts.

Introduction
Recently, the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has caused an ongoing global
pandemic. As of July 21, 2020, the pandemic resulting in a total of 14,562,550 clinical cases and
607,781 deaths all over the world (www.who.int). With an effort of metagenomic RNA deep
sequencing, the genome of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate, Wuhan-Hu-1, was published in [11]. The
genome showed high nucleotide similarity (89.1%) to a group of SARS-like coronavirus that
were identified in bats in China, which indicated the possibility of animal origin.
To identify potential direct or intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus in several
animals were studied and compared with SARS-CoV-2. Bat and pangolin were the two mostly
investigated species. A CoV in bat, RaTG13, showed 96% full-genome similarity with SARSCoV-2 [14]. Other virus isolates from bat, ZXC21 and ZC45 also shared 85% of similarity to
SARS-CoV-2. These results led to the hypothesis that the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 originated
in Bats and it spilled over to humans using another animal as intermediate host. Many
researchers believed that pangolins are a potential intermediate host and they attempted to
characterize coronavirus in pangolin. Liu, Chen, and Chen [8] constructed coronavirus contigs
using de novo assembly method from organ samples of dead Malayan pangolins rescued at the
Guangdong Wildlife Rescue Center. Of the 11 collected pangolins, coronavirus was detected in
two. Zhang, Wu, and Zhang [13] re-analyzed the RNA-Seq reads from two pangolins carrying
coronavirus using reference-guided de novo assembly method, with Wuhan-Hu-1 as the
reference genome. The resulting draft genome shared 91.02 and 90.55% whole genome
similarity with Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13, respectively. Xiao et al. [12] obtained 21 samples
from pangolins rescued by Guangdong Customs and conducted reference-guided genome
assembly, with Wuhan-Hu-1 as the reference genome. The derived viral genome showed 80 and

98% whole genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, respectively. Lam et al. [3]
collected 43 samples from 18 pangolins from Guangxi Medical University, China, and six
samples contained coronavirus sequences. The viral genomes of six samples were de novo
assembled. They also performed RNA sequencing in five archived pangolins samples from
Guangdong, and assembled the genomes using WIV04, another SARS-CoV-2 genome from
human, as reference genome. The resultant draft genomes have 85.5% to 92.4% identity to the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. They suggested two sub-lineages of coronavirus existed in pangolins. In
terms of all coding sites, coronavirus identified in pangolins from Guangdong is more closely
related to WIV04 than Bat-CoV RaTG13, whereas coronavirus genome of pangolins in Guangxi
showed lower genome similarity to WIV04 than Bat-CoV RaTG13. Liu et al. [8] took samples
from three coronavirus positive pangolins rescued in Guangdong and performed deep sequencing.
Using de novo assembly method, they obtained viral genome that showed 90.32% and 90.24% of
whole genome identify to Wuhan-Hu-1and Bat-CoV RaTG13, respectively.
All of the pangolins involved in published coronavirus analysis were from either the
Guangdong collection or the Guangxi collection. Pangolins from the Guangdong collection were
investigated in most studies [3,8,9,12]. The resulting viral genomes were derived from de novo
assembly with or without a guided reference and further curated using blast annotation or PCR
amplicon sequencing. All studies have showed that CoV in pangolin was highly related to BatCoV and SARS-CoV-2. In all of the studies that used reference-guided de novo assemblies, a
SARS-CoV-2 genome (Wuhan-Hu-1 or WIV04) was chosen as reference [3,12,13]. This choice
was based on the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 was the closest neighbor of the Pangolin CoV in
the phylogeny tree. However, this assumption may not necessary be true. Therefore, choosing

the SARS-CoV-2 genome as reference could inadvertently introduce bias in the genome
assembly, leading to inaccurate or incomplete results.
In this study, we assembled the Pangolin CoV genome using several different genomes as
reference. We investigated how the reference genome impact the resulting genome and its
phylogenetic relationship with others. The results from this study will provide guidance for
future studies on how to accurately construct CoV genomes from pangolin or other potential
intermediate hosts.
Material and Methods
Data selection
Two RNA-seq samples, lung07 and lung08, were downloaded from NCBI SRA under
BioProject SRA: PRJNA573298. The two samples were originally published in [8] for viral
metagenomics analysis.
Sequence preparation
Adaptor trimming and quality control were performed on the raw sequence reads using
with the Trimmonmatic program (verson 0.39) [1]. To eliminate host contamination, the
remaining reads were aligned to the Manis javanica genome (SRA: PRJNA256023) using BWAaln (version 0.7.17) [6] and reads mapped to the host genome were discarded. Reads unmapped
to the host reference genome were used to construct genome in the subsequent de novo assembly.

Genome assembly and sequence analysis
Cleaned reads were used to assemble genome using reference-guided de novo assembly.
To investigate how the results were influenced by the choice of reference genome, we explored a
few representative virus genomes on the phylogeny tree (Table 1) as the reference genome.
These genomes were selected based on previous studies [3,9,11,13]. Once a reference genome
was picked, the cleaned reads were aligned to the reference genome using BWA-MEM [5], and
the mapped reads were assembled de novo using MEGHIT (version 1.1.3) with meta-sensitive
mode [4]. The resulting contigs were concatenated into an assembly by aligning them to the
reference genome.
Phylogenetic and similarity analyses
Phylogenetic distance analysis was performed using MEGA X (version 10.1.8) [2].The
whole genome was used in phylogenetic and distance analysis, and phylogenetic trees were
constructed in the best-fit DNA/amino acid substitution mode with 1000 bootstrap replications.
The whole genome nucleotide identity analysis was performed in SimPlot 3.5.1 [10].
Result
A total of eight viral genomes were tested as the reference genome in reference-guided de
novo assembling. Numbers of mapped reads ranged from 2 to 3,060, and length of the resulting

draft assemblies varied from 5,969 to 22,419 bp (Table 2). Two reference genomes, MersCoV
and Bat Hp-BetaCoV Zhejiang2013, failed in reads assembling due to the limited number of
remaining reads. Less than 1,000 reads were mapped to three reference genomes, BJ01,
BM48_31, and Longquan140, resulting in shorter assemblies. A total of 1,061 reads were
mapped to ZC45 and subsequently assembled into a 21,819-bp assembly with 67.8% of coverage.
RaTG13, which is a bat CoV, had 1,287 reads mapped to it, and the resulting assembly has total
length of 21,925 and N50 of 1,428. A total of 3,060 reads were mapped to Wuhan-Hu-1, a
human SARS-CoV-2 strain, which was the highest number among all genomes we surveyed.
The assembly guided by RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1 showed similar coverage at about eighty
percent. However, the resulting assembly had shorter total length (21,819) and N50 (1,195) than
those of the assembly that used RaTG13 as reference.
To understand this seemly contradiction, we investigated the reads coverage and depth on
RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1. The results (Figure 1) show that there were an excessive number of
reads mapped to distal regions of Wuhan-Hu-1, which could indicate artifacts or contaminations
during the sequencing. After removing these tail regions (with > 200X depth), 62 more unique
reads were mapped to Wuhan-Hu-1. Figure 2 shows the overlap of between the unique reads
mapped to RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1.

For further identifying logical relationship of reads mapped to different viral genomes,
unique reads were used to construct Venn diagrams. All reads mapped to Italy strain were also
mapped to Wuahn-Hu-1 genome (Figure 2). The additional 1516 unique reads were mapped to
Wuhan-Hu-1. Most reads were mapped to both RaTG13 and Italy strain, but a total of 45 reads
were aligned to either one. Bat-CoV, ZC45 and RaTG13, shared 999 reads in alignment, and
RaTG13 genome guided over two hundred more reads into assembly.
The two assemblies that used RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1 as reference genomes
respectively, were aligned with the eight reference viral genomes in Table 1 in a multiple
alignment. The multiple alignment result was used for similarity analysis and phylogenetic
analysis. In terms of the whole genome nucleotide, the RaTG13-guided assembly showed 85.8%
and 85.2% identity to RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1, respectively, and the Wuhan-Hu-1-guided
assembly showed 88.6 and 88.8% identity to RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1 respectively. The
difference between Wuhan-Hu-1-guided assembly and RaTG13-guided assembly was not always
consistent with difference between RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1 (Table S1). The differences
between RaTG13-guided and Wuhan-Hu-1-guided assemblies in the regions of 18,431- 18,601
bp were probably due to references between the reference genomes (Table S1). However, the

differences in some regions including 4,761-5,021 bp and 10,121-11,321 bp, were not due to
differences in the reference genomes.
We further investigated phylogenetic relationship between the two assemblies and eight
reference viral genomes using MEGA X with 1000 Bootstrap tests. The two assemblies
positioned between RaTG13 and ZC45 with strong statistical evidence (Figure 3). The SARSCoV-2 genome, Wuhan-Hu-1, and Bat-CoV, RaTG13, clustered closely together. The two
assemblies from this study consistently positioned between this cluster and other CoVs (Figure
4). Among other CoVs, ZC45 is the closest neighbor to the assemblies.
Discussion
Currently, very few samples of coronavirus-positive pangolins have been sequenced.
Pangolins-CoV obtained from the Guangdong collection and the Guangxi collection represent
two lineages of coronavirus [3]. After outbreak of SARS-CoV, thousands of bat samples were
collected and sequenced to identify coronaviruses that bat may carry. We can expect that in near
future more pangolin samples will be collected and studied for better understanding of
coronavirus in pangolin.
In a reference-guided assembling, the resulting assembly may show bias towards the
reference genome [7]. Successful decoding a complete viral genome usually require deep
sequencing and further manual curations to fix the gaps. Inaccuracies in assembling the
sequencing reads could mislead the subsequent curation step. The whole genome identity
between Bat-CoV RaTG13 and SARS-CoV2 Wuhan-Hu-1 is about 96%, which corresponds to a
total difference of about 1,500 nucleotides. Our results have shown that observable difference
could be found in the resulting assemblies when these genomes were used as reference separately.
Particular, when RaTG13 was used as reference, the resulting assembly had a longer total length

and higher N50 value than when Wuhan-Hu-1 was used. This points to the possibility that
Pangolin-CoV is more closely related to RaTG13 than to Wuhan-Hu-1. Therefore, in order to
decode the coronavirus sequence accurately, RaTG13, and possibly other SARS-CoV-2 isolates,
should also be considered as reference in future studies of coronavirus in Pangolin or other
potential intermediate hosts.
In addition to using one reference genome to guide the assembling, we also attempted to
assemble all reads that mapped to either RaTG13 or Wuhan-Hu-1 genomes. The resulting twogenomes-guided assembly has a total length of 22,707 bp, which is slightly longer than that of
the RaTG13-guided assembly. However, the N50, 1,388bp, is slightly shorter.
