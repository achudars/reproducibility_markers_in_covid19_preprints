ABSTRACT

16

Novel pathogenic coronaviruses – including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 – arise by homologous

17

recombination in a host cell1,2. This process requires a single host to be infected with more than one

18

type of coronavirus, which recombine to form novel strains of virus with unique combinations of genetic

19

material. Identifying possible sources of novel coronaviruses requires identifying hosts (termed

20

recombination hosts) of more than one coronavirus type, in which recombination might

21

occur. However, the majority of coronavirus-host interactions remain unknown, and therefore the vast

22

majority of recombination hosts for coronaviruses cannot be identified. Here we show that there are

23

11.5-fold more coronavirus-host associations, and over 30-fold more potential SARS-CoV-2

24

recombination hosts, than have been observed to date. We show there are over 40-fold more host species

25

with four or more different subgenera of coronaviruses. This underestimation of both number and

26

diversity of coronavirus-host associations has resulted in an underappreciation of the potential scale of

novel coronavirus generation in wild and domesticated animals. Our results list specific high-risk hosts

28

in which our model predicts homologous recombination could occur, our model identifies both wild

29

and domesticated mammals including known important and understudied species. We recommend

these species for coronavirus surveillance, as well as enforced separation in livestock markets and

INTRODUCTION

34

The generation and emergence of three novel respiratory coronaviruses from mammalian reservoirs into

35

human populations in the last 20 years, including one which has achieved pandemic status, suggests

36

that one of the most pressing current research questions is: In which reservoirs could the next novel

37

coronaviruses be generated and emerge from in future? Armed with this knowledge, we may be able to

38

reduce the chance of emergence into human populations or develop potential mitigations in advance,

39

such as by the strict monitoring and enforced separation of the hosts identified here, in live animal

40

markets, farms, and other close-quarters environments.

41

Coronaviridae are a family of positive sense RNA viruses which can cause an array of diseases. In

42

humans, these range from mild cold-like illnesses to the lethal respiratory tract infections mentioned

43

above. Seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans3, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

44

causing severe disease, while HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E tend towards milder symptoms in most

45

patients4.

46

Coronaviruses undergo frequent host-shifting events between non-human animal species, or non-human

47

animals and humans5–7, a process that may involve changes to the cells or tissues that the viruses infect

48

(virus tropism). Such shifts have resulted in new animal diseases (such as bovine coronavirus (BCoV)

49

disease8 and canine coronavirus (CCoV) disease9), and human diseases (such as OC4310 and 229E11).

50

The aetiological agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is thought to have originated in bats12 and shifted

51

to humans via an intermediate reservoir host, likely a species of pangolin13.

52

Comparison of the genetic sequences of bat and human coronaviruses has revealed five potentially

53

important genetic regions involved in host specificity and shifting, with the Spike receptor binding

54

domain believed to be the most important1,5. Homologous recombination is a natural process which

55

brings together new combinations of genetic material, and hence new viral strains, from two similar

56

non-identical parent strains of virus. This recombination occurs when different strains co-infect an

57

individual animal, with sequences from each parent strain in the genetic make-up of progeny virus.

58

Homologous recombination has previously been demonstrated in many important viruses such as

59

human immunodeficiency virus14, classical swine fever virus15, and throughout the Coronaviridae1,2,

60

including homologous recombination in Spike being implicated in the generation of SARS-CoV-22.

61

As well as instigating host-shifting, homologous recombination in other regions of the virus genome

62

could also introduce novel phenotypes into coronavirus strains already infectious to humans. There are

63

at least seven potential regions for homologous recombination in the replicase and Spike regions of the

64

SARS-CoV genome alone, with possible recombination partner viruses from a range of other

65

mammalian and human coronaviruses16. Recombination events between two compatible partner strains

66

in a shared host could thus lead to future novel coronaviruses, either by enabling pre-existing

67

mammalian strains to infect humans, or by adding new phenotypes arising from different alleles to pre-

68

existing human-affecting strains.

69

The most fundamental requirement for homologous recombination to take place is the co-infection of a

70

single host with multiple coronaviruses. However, our understanding of which hosts are permissive to

71

which coronaviruses, the pre-requisite to identifying which hosts are potential sites for this

72

recombination (henceforth termed ‘recombination hosts’), remains extremely limited. Here, we utilise

73

a similarity-based analytical pipeline to address this significant knowledge gap. Our approach predicts

74

associations between coronaviruses and their potential mammalian hosts by integrating three

75

perspectives or points of view encompassing: 1) genomic features depicting different aspects of

76

coronaviruses (e.g. secondary structure, codon usage bias) extracted from complete genomes

77

(sequences = 3,271, virus strains = 411); 2) ecological, phylogenetic and geospatial traits of potential

78

mammalian hosts (n=876); and 3) characteristics of the network that describes the linkage of

79

coronaviruses to their observed hosts, which expresses our current knowledge of sharing of

80

coronaviruses between various hosts and host groups.

81

Topological features of ecological networks have been successfully utilised to enhance our

82

understanding of pathogen sharing17,18, disease emergence and spill-over events19, and as means to

83

predict missing links in a variety of host-pathogen networks20–22. Here we capture this topology, and

84

relations between coronaviruses and hosts in our network, by means of node (coronaviruses and hosts)

85

embeddings using DeepWalk23 – a deep learning method that has been successfully used to predict

86

drug-target24, and IncRNA-disease associations25.

87

Our analytical pipeline transforms the above features into similarities (between viruses, and between

88

hosts) and uses them to give virus–mammal associations scores of how likely they are to occur. Our

89

framework then ensembles its constituent learners to produce testable predictions of mammalian hosts

90

of multiple coronaviruses.

91

In this study we address the following three questions: 1) Which species may be unidentified

92

mammalian reservoirs of coronaviruses? 2) What are the most probable mammalian host species in

93

which coronavirus homologous recombination could occur? And 3) Which coronaviruses are most

94

likely to co-infect a single host, and thus act as sources for future novel viruses?

Our model to predict unobserved associations between coronaviruses and their mammalian hosts

98

indicated a total of 126 (ensemble mean probability cut-off >0.5, when subtracting/adding SD from the

101

which SARS-CoV-2 could be found. The breakdown of these hosts by order was as follows (values in

108

Overall, our model predicted 4,438 (mean, SD=-1,903/+2,256, cut-off=0.5) previously unobserved

109

associations that potentially exist between 300 (SD=0/+3) mammals and 201 coronaviruses (species or

110

strains, SD=-60/+13). Our model predicts there are 115 (0/+3) mammal species with no previously

111

observed associations with the 411 input viruses.

On average, each coronavirus (species or strain, complete-genome available, N=411) is predicted to

average, 5.55 coronaviruses (SD=-2.17/+2.58) – Supplementary tables SR2 and SR3 provide results for

136

Figure 2 presents 50 potential mammalian recombination hosts of coronaviruses. Our model predicts

137

231 (SD=- 115 /+58) mammalian species that could host 10 or more of the 411 coronavirus species or

138

strains for which complete genome sequences were available. The breakdown of these hosts by order

139

was as follows: Chiroptera = 129 (-87/+53); Carnivora: 35 (-22/+2); Rodentia = 33 (-4/+3); Artiodactyla

140

= 22 (-2/+0); Eulipotyphla = 5 (-0/+0); Primates = 4 (-0/+0); Lagomorpha = 2 (-0/+0); and Pholidota

141

=1(-0/+0).

142

The addition of predicted associations increased the diversity (mean phylogenetic distance) of

143

mammalian hosts per coronavirus, as well as the diversity (mean genetic distance) of coronaviruses per

144

mammalian host (table 1 lists these changes at 0.95, 0.75 and 0.50 probability cut-offs).

145

Furthermore, we capture the changes in structure of the bipartite network linking coronaviruses with

146

their mammalian hosts (figure 3). On one hand the nestedness of network increased (ranging from:

147

6.39-fold at 0.95 to 10.17-fold at 0.50 cut-off, table 1). On the other hand, the non-independence (C-

148

score) of coronaviruses and mammalian hosts decreased with the addition of new links. Larger values

149

of C-score suggest viral and host communities with little or no overlap in host or virus preferences (e.g.

150

tendencies of coronaviruses to be shared amongst certain host communities, defined by phylogeny or

151

geographical distribution), as visualised in figure 3.

166

DISCUSSION

167

In this study we deployed a meta-ensemble of similarity learners from three complementary

168

perspectives (viral, mammalian and network), to predict the occurrence of associations between 411

169

known coronaviruses and 876 mammal species. We predict 4,438 new associations (11.54-fold

170

increase), leading to the prediction that there are many more mammalian species than are currently

171

known in which more than one coronavirus can occur. These hosts of multiple coronaviruses are

172

potential sources of new coronavirus strains by homologous recombination. Here, we discuss the large

173

number of candidate hosts in which homologous recombination of coronaviruses could result in the

174

generation of novel pathogenic strains, as well as the substantial underestimation of the range of viruses

175

which could recombine based on observed data. Our results are also discussed in terms of which host

176

species are high priority targets for surveillance, both short and long-term.

177

Give that coronaviruses frequently undergo homologous recombination when they co-infect a host, and

178

that SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious to humans, the most immediate threat to public health is

179

recombination of other coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2. Such recombination could readily produce

180

further novel viruses with both the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and additional pathogenicity or viral

181

tropism from elsewhere in the Coronaviridae. Hence, in figure 1 (and supplementary results table SR1),

182

we identify mammals predicted to be hosts of SARS-CoV-2 as well as multiple other coronaviruses.

183

Taking only observed data, there are four non-human mammalian hosts known to associate with SARS-

184

CoV-2 and at least one other coronavirus, and a total of 504 different unique interactions between

185

SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (counting all combinations of virus and host individually). Any

186

of these SARS-CoV-2 hosts which are also hosts of other coronaviruses are potential recombination-

187

hosts in which novel coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 could be generated in future. However,

188

when we add in our model’s predicted interactions this becomes 126 SARS-CoV-2 hosts and 2,544 and

189

1,302 total unique interactions, at 0.5 and 0.9 probability; indicating that observed data are missing

190

31.5-fold of the total number of potential recombination hosts and 5.05-fold increase (at 0.5 probability

191

cut-off, 2.58-fold at 0.9) of the potential unique associations. These large-fold increases in the number

192

of predicted hosts and associations demonstrate that the potential for homologous recombination

193

between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, which could lead to new pathogenic strains, is highly

194

underestimated, both in terms of the range of hosts as well as the number of interactions within known

195

hosts.

196

Our model has successfully highlighted known important recombination hosts of coronaviruses, adding

197

confidence to our methodology. The Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), a viverrid native

198

to south and southeast Asia, was identified by our model as a potential host of 32 and 20 different

199

coronaviruses at 0.5 and 0.9 probability (vs 6 observed). Genetic evolution analysis has shown that

200

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to coronaviruses derived from P. hermaphroditus26, and its role as a

201

reservoir for SARS-CoV27, strongly supporting our findings that it is an important host in viral

202

recombination. This, together with the close association of P. hermaphroditus26 with humans, for

203

example via bushmeat and the pet trade28 and in ‘battery cages’ for the production of Kopi luwak

204

coffee29, highlights both the ability and opportunity of this species to act as a recombination host, with

205

significantly more coronaviruses than have been observed. Furthermore, our model highlights both the

206

greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), which is a known recombination host of SARS-

207

CoV30,31, as well as the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis), which is believed to be

208

recombination host of SARS-CoV-212,32. Our model predicts R. ferrumequinum to be a host to 67 and

209

37 different coronaviruses at 0.5 and 0.9 probability respectively (vs 13 observed); and for R. affinis to

210

host 44 and 22 at 0.5 and 0.9 probability respectively (vs 9 observed). Our model also successfully

211

highlights the pangolin (Manis javanica), a suspected intermediate host for SARS-CoV-213 as a

212

potential host of 15 and 8 different coronaviruses at 0.5 and 0.9 probability (vs 1 observed).

213

The successful highlighting of the speculated main hosts for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 homologous

214

recombination adds substantial confidence that our model is identifying the most important potential

215

recombination hosts. Furthermore, our results show that the number of viruses which could potentially

216

recombine even within these known hosts has been highly underestimated, indicating that there still

217

remains significant potential for further novel coronavirus generation in future from current known

218

recombination hosts.

219

In addition to highlighting known important recombination hosts, our model also identifies a diverse

220

range of species not yet associated with SARS-CoV-2 recombination, but which are both predicted to

221

host SARS-CoV-2 as well as large numbers of other coronaviruses. These hosts represent new targets

222

for surveillance of novel human pathogenic coronaviruses. Amongst the highest priority is the lesser

223

Asiatic yellow bat (Scotophilus kuhlii), a known coronavirus host33, common in east Asia but not well

224

studied, and which features prominently with a large number of predicted interactions (47 at 0.5, 20 at

225

0.9). Figure 1 also implicates the common hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the European rabbit

(Oryctolagus cuniculus) and the domestic cat (Felis catus) as predicted hosts for SARS-CoV-2

227

(confirmed for the cat34) and large numbers of other coronaviruses (20, 23, 65 at 0.5; and 14, 14, 36 at

228

0.9, for the hedgehog, rabbit and cat, respectively). The hedgehog and rabbit have previously been

229

confirmed as hosts for other betacoronaviruses35,36 which have no appreciable significance to human

230

health. Our prediction of these species’ potential interaction with SARS-CoV-2 and considerable

231

numbers of other coronaviruses, as well as the latter three species’ close association to humans, identify

232

them as high priority underestimated risks. In addition to these human-associated species, both the

233

chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and African green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) have large numbers

234

of predicted associations (51, 46 at 0.5; and 16, 11 at 0.9, respectively), and given their relatedness to

235

humans and their importance in the emergence of viruses such as DENV37 and HIV38, also serve as

236

other high priority species for surveillance.

237

The most prominent result in figure 1 is the common pig (Sus scrofa), having the most predicted

238

associations, in addition to SARS-CoV-2, of all included mammals (121 and 73 coronaviruses predicted

239

at 0.5 and 0.9 cut-offs). The pig is a major known mammalian coronavirus host, harbouring both a large

240

number (26) of observed coronaviruses, as well as a wide diversity (figure 2, supplementary results

241

table SR4). Given the large number of predicted viral associations presented here, the pig’s close

242

association to humans, its known reservoir status for many other zoonotic viruses39, and it being

243

involved in genetic recombination of some of these viruses40, the pig is predicted to be one of the

244

foremost candidates for an important recombination host.

245

In addition to the more immediate threat of homologous recombination directly with SARS-CoV-2, we

246

also present our predicted associations between all mammals and all coronaviruses (figures 2 and 3).

247

These associations represent the longer-term potential for background viral evolution via homologous

248

recombination in all species. These data also show that there is a 11.54-fold underestimation in the

249

number of associations, with 421 observed associations and 4438 predicted at 0.5 cut-off (5.72-fold

250

increase with 1989 associations predicted at 0.9 cut-off). This is visually represented in figure 3, which

251

shows the bipartite network of virus and host for observed associations (A), and predicted associations

252

(B-D); with a marked increase in connectivity between our mammalian hosts and coronaviruses, even

253

at the most stringent 0.95 confidence cut-off. This indicates that the potential for homologous

254

recombination between coronaviruses is substantially underestimated using just observed data.

255

Furthermore, our model shows that the associations between more diverse coronaviruses is also

256

underestimated, for example, the number of host species with four or more different subgenera of

257

coronaviruses increases by 41.57-fold from seven observed to 291 predicted (Table S4, shows the

258

degree of diversity of coronaviruses in mammalian host species highlighted in figure 2). The high

259

degree of potential co-infections including different sub-genera and genera seen in our results

260

emphasises the level of new genetic diversity possible via homologous recombination in these host

261

species (table S4). A similar array of host species is highlighted for total associations as was seen for

262

SARS-CoV-2 potential recombination hosts, including the common pig, the lesser Asiatic yellow bat,

263

and both the greater and intermediate horseshoe bats, whilst notable additions include the dromedary

264

camel (Camelus dromedaries). The camel is a known host of multiple coronaviruses and the primary

265

route of transmission of MERS-CoV to humans41,42. Our results suggest that monitoring for background

266

viral evolution via homologous recombination would focus on a similar array of hosts, with a few

267

additions, as monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 recombination. Again, our results strongly suggest that the

268

potential array of viruses which could recombine in hosts is substantially underestimated, reinforcing

269

the message that continued monitoring is essential.

270

Methodologically, the novelty of our approach lies in integrating three points of view: that of the

271

coronaviruses, that of their potential mammalian hosts, and that of the network summarising our

272

knowledge to date of sharing of coronaviruses in their hosts. By constructing a comprehensive set of

273

similarity learners in each point of view and combining these learners non-linearly (via GBM meta-

274

ensemble) a great strength of our analytical pipeline is that it is able to predict potential recombination

275

hosts of coronaviruses without any prerequisite knowledge or assumptions into which parts of the

276

coronavirus genomes are important, or integration of receptor information, or focusing on certain

277

groups of hosts (e.g. bats or primates). This ‘no-preconceptions’ approach enables us to analyse without

278

being restricted by our current incomplete knowledge of the specific biological and molecular

279

mechanisms which govern host-virus permissibility Additionally, the incorporation of similarity-based

280

learners in our three-perspective approach enabled us to capture new hosts (i.e. with no known

281

association with coronaviruses), thus avoiding a main limitation of approaches which rely only on

282

networks and their topology.

283

We acknowledge certain limitations in our methodology, primarily pertaining to current incomplete

284

datasets in the rapidly developing but still understudied field. 1) The inclusion only of coronaviruses

285

for which complete genomes could be found limited the number of coronaviruses (species or strain) for

286

which we could compute meaningful similarities, and therefore predict potential hosts. The same

287

applies for our mammalian species – we only included mammalian hosts for which phylogenetic,

288

ecological, and geospatial data were available. As more data on sequenced coronaviruses or mammals

289

become available in future, our model can be re-run to further improve predictions, and to validate

290

predictions from earlier iterations. 2) Research effort, centering mainly on coronaviruses found in

291

humans and their domesticated animals, can lead to overestimation of the potential of coronaviruses to

292

recombine in frequently studied mammals, such as lab rodents which were excluded from the results

293

reported here (similar to previous work18), and significantly, domesticated pigs and cats which we have

294

found to be important recombination host species of coronaviruses. This latter limitation is partially

295

mitigated. Firstly, in our results, other ‘overstudied’ mammals such as cows and sheep, were not

296

highlight by our model, which is consistent with them being considered less important hosts of

297

coronaviruses, and certain under-studied bats were highlighted as major potential hosts; together, these

298

indicate that research effort is not a substantial driver of our results. Secondly, methodologically, the

299

effect of research effort has been mitigated by capturing similarities from our three points of view (virus,

300

host and network) and multiple characteristics therein.

301

In this study we demonstrate that the potential for homologous recombination in mammalian hosts of

302

coronaviruses is highly underestimated. The ability of the large numbers of hosts presented here to be

303

hosts of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated the capacity for homologous

304

recombination and hence production of further novel coronaviruses. Our methods deployed a meta-

305

ensemble of similarity learners from three complementary perspectives (viral, mammalian and

306

network), to predict each potential coronavirus-mammal association.

307

The current consensus is that SARS-CoV-2 was generated by homologous recombination; originally

308

derived from coronaviruses in bats12 and then shifted to humans via an intermediate reservoir host,

309

likely a species of pangolin13. Importantly, the lineage of SARS-CoV-2 was deduced only after the

310

outbreak in humans. With the greater understanding of the extent of mammalian host reservoirs and the

311

potential recombination hosts we identify here, a targeted surveillance program is now possible which

312

would allow for this generation to be observed as it is happening and before a major outbreak. Such

313

information could help inform mitigation strategies and provide a vital early warning system for future

314

novel coronaviruses.

316

METHODS

317

Viruses and mammalian data

318

Viral genomic data: Complete sequences of coronaviruses were downloaded from Genbank43.

319

Sequences labelled with the terms: “vaccine”, “construct”, “vector”, “recombinant” were removed from

320

the analyses. In addition, we removed these associated with experimental infections were possible. This

321

resulted in total of 3,264 sequences for 411coronavirus species or strain (i.e. viruses below species level

322

on NCBI taxonomy tree). Of these 88 were sequences of coronavirus species, and 307 of strains (in 25

323

coronavirus species, with total number of species included=92).

324

Selection of potential mammalian hosts of coronaviruses: We processed meta-data accompanying

325

all sequences (including partial sequences but excluding vaccination and experimental infections) of

326

coronaviruses uploaded to GenBank to extract information on hosts (to species level) of these

327

coronaviruses. We supplemented these data species-level hosts of coronaviruses extracted from

328

scientific publications via the Enhanced Infectious Diseases Database (EID2)44. This resulted in

329

identification of 313 known terrestrial mammalian hosts of coronaviruses (regardless of whether a

330

complete genome was available or not, N=185 mammalian species for which an association with a

331

coronaviruses with complete genome was identified). We expanded this set of potential hosts by

332

including terrestrial mammalian species in genera containing at least one known host of coronavirus,

333

and which are known to host one or more other virus species (excluding coronaviruses, information of

334

whether the host is associated with a virus were obtained from EID2). This results in total of 876

335

mammalian species which were selected.

336

Quantification of viral and mammalian similarities

337

We computed three types of similarities between each two viral genomes as summarised below.

338

Biases and codon usage: We calculated proportion of each nucleotide of the total coding sequence

339

length. We computed dinucleotide and codon biases45 and codon pair bias, measured as the codon pair
15

340

score (CPS)45,46 in each of the above sequences. This enabled us to produce for each genome sequence

341

(N=3,271) the following feature vectors: nucleotide bias; dinucleotide bias; codon biased; and codon-

342

pair bias.

343

Secondary structure: Following alignment of sequences (using AlignSeqs function in R package

344

Decipher47), we predicted the secondary structure for each sequence using PredictHEC function in the

345

R package Decipher47. We obtained both states (final prediction), and probability of secondary

346

structures for each sequence. We then computed for each 1% of the genome length both the coverage

347

(number of times a structure was predicted) and mean probability of the structure (in the percent of the

348

genome considered). This enabled us to generate six vectors (length = 100) for each genome

349

representing: mean probability and coverage for each of three possible structures – Helix (H), Beta-

350

Sheet (E), or Coil (C).

351

Genome dissimilarity (distance): we calculated pairwise dissimilarity (in effect a hamming distance)

352

between each two sequences in our set using the function DistanceMatrix in the R package Decipher47.

353

We set this function to penalise gap-to-gap and gap-to-letter mismatches.

354

Similarity quantification We transformed the feature (traits) vectors described above into similarities

355

matrices between coronaviruses (species or strains). This was achieved by computing cosine similarity

356

between these vectors in each category (e.g. codon pair usage, H coverage, E probability). Formally,

357

for each genomic feature (N=10) presented by vector as described above, this similarity was calculated

358

as follows:

359

𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑙 (𝑠𝑚 , 𝑠𝑛 ) =

𝑓
𝑓
𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑙 (𝑉𝑚 𝑙 , 𝑉𝑛 𝑙 )

√∑𝑑𝑖=1 𝑉𝑚𝑓𝑙 [𝑖]2 × √∑𝑑𝑖=1 𝑉𝑛𝑓𝑙 [𝑖]2
𝑓

𝑓

360

Where 𝑠𝑚 and 𝑠𝑛 are two genomic sequences presented by two feature vectors 𝑉𝑚 𝑙 and 𝑉𝑛 𝑙 from the

361

genomic feature space 𝑓𝑙 (e.g. codon pair bias) of the dimension d (e.g. d= 100 for H-coverage).

362

We then calculated similarity between each pair of virus strains or species (in each category) as the

363

mean of similarities between genomic sequences of the two virus strains or species (e.g. mean

364

nucleotide bias similarity between all sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and all sequences of MERS- CoV

365

presented the final nucleotide bias similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV). This enabled us

366

to generate 11 genomic features similarity matrices (the above 10 features represented by vectors +

367

genomic similarity matrix) between our input coronaviruses.

368
369

Similarity network fusion (SNF): We applied similarity network fusion (SNF)48 to integrate the

370

following similarities in order to reduce our viral genomic feature space: 1) Nucleotide, dinucleotide,

371

codon, and codon pair usage biases were combined into one similarity matrix - genome bias similarity.

372

And 2) Helix (H), Beta-Sheet (E), or Coil (C) mean probability and coverage similarities (six in total)

373

were combined into one similarity matrix - secondary structure similarity.

374

SNF applies an iterative nonlinear method that updates every similarity matrix according to the other

375

matrices via nearest neighbour approach and is scalable and is robust to noise and data heterogeneity.

376

The integrated matrix captures both shared and complementary information from multiple similarities.

377

Mammalian similarities: We calculated comprehensive set of mammalian similarities. Table 1

378

summarises these similarities and provides justification for inclusion. Supplementary note 2 provides

full details.

383

Quantification of network similarities

384

Network construction: We processed meta-data accompanying all sequences (including partial

385

genome but excluding vaccination and experimental infections) of coronaviruses uploaded to GenBank

386

to extract information on hosts (to species level) of these coronaviruses. We supplemented these data

387

with virus-host associations extracted from publications via the Enhanced Infectious Diseases Database

388

(EID2)44. This resulted in 1,669 associations between 1108 coronaviruses and 545 hosts (including non-

389

mammalian hosts). We transformed this set of associations into a bipartite network linking species and

390

strains of coronaviruses with their hosts.

391

Quantification of topological features: The above constructed network summarises our knowledge to

392

date of associations between coronaviruses and their hosts, and its topology expresses patterns of

393

sharing these viruses between various hosts and host groups. Our analytical pipeline captures this

394

topology, and relations between nodes in our network, by means of node (vertex) embeddings. This

395

approach encodes each node (here either a coronavirus or a host) with its own vector representation in

396

a continuous vector space, which in turns enable us to calculate similarities between two nodes based

397

on this representation.

398

We adopted DeepWalk23 to compute vectorised representations for our coronaviruses and hosts from

399

the network connecting them. DeepWalk uses truncated random walks to get latent topological

400

information of the network and obtains the vector representation of its nodes (in our case coronaviruses,

401

and their hosts) by maximizing the probability of reaching a next node (i.e. probability of a virus-host

402

association) given the previous nodes in these walks (Supplementary Note 3 provides formal and visual

403

summaries of DeepWalk).

404

Similarity calculations: Following the application of DeepWalk to compute the latent topological

405

representation of our nodes, we calculated the similarity between two nodes in our network - n

406

(vectorised as N) and m (vectorised as M), by using cosine similarity as follows 24,25:

407

𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘 (𝑛, 𝑚) = 𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘 (𝑀, 𝑁) =

∑𝑑𝑖=1(𝑚𝑖 × 𝑛𝑖 )
√∑𝑑𝑖=1 𝑚𝑖 2 × √∑𝑑𝑖=1 𝑛𝑖 2

408

where d is the dimension of the vectorised representation of our nodes: M and N, and 𝑚𝑖 and 𝑛𝑖 are the

409

components of vectors M and N, respectively.

410
411

Similarity learning meta-ensemble – a multi-perspective approach

412

Our analytical pipeline stacks 12 similarity learners into meta-ensembles and selects the best performing

413

ensemble following internal and external validation processes. The constituent learners based on

414

different data and points of views and can be categorised as follows:

415

Coronaviruses – the viral point of view: we assembled three models derived from a) genome similarity,

416

b) genome biases, and c) genome secondary structure. Each of these learners gave each coronavirus-

417

mammalian association (𝑣𝑖 → 𝑚𝑗 ) a score, termed confidence, based on how similar the coronavirus

418

𝑣𝑖 is to known coronaviruses of mammalian species 𝑚𝑗 , compared to how similar 𝑣𝑖 is to all included

419

coronaviruses24,25. In other words, if 𝑣𝑖 is more similar (e.g. based on genome secondary structure) to

420

coronaviruses observed in host 𝑚𝑗 than it is similar to those coronaviruses not observed in 𝑚𝑗 , then the

421

association 𝑣𝑖 → 𝑚𝑗 is given a higher confidence score. Conversely, if 𝑣𝑖 is somewhat similar to

422

coronaviruses observed in 𝑚𝑗 , and also somewhat similar to viruses not known to infect this particular

423

mammal, then the association 𝑣𝑖 → 𝑚𝑗 is given a medium confidence score. The association 𝑣𝑖 → 𝑚𝑗

424

is given a lower confidence score if 𝑣𝑖 is more similar to coronaviruses not known to infect 𝑚𝑗 than it

425

is similar to coronaviruses observed in this host.

426

Formally, given an adjacency matrix A of dimensions |𝑉| × |𝑀| where |𝑉| is number of coronaviruses

427

included in this study (for which a complete genome could be found), and |𝑀| is number of included

428

mammals, such that for each 𝑣𝑖 ∈ 𝑉 and 𝑚𝑗 ∈ 𝑀, 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 1 if an association is known to exist between

429

the virus and the mammal, and 0 otherwise. Then for a similarity matrix 𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑣𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑙 corresponding to each

430

of the similarity matrices calculated above, a learner from the viral point of view is defined as

431

follows24,25:

∑|𝑉|
(𝑣

𝑙=1,𝑙≠𝑖 𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑣𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑖 , 𝑣𝑙

433

Mammals – the host point of view: we constructed 7 learners from the similarities summarised in table

434

1. Each of these learners calculated for every coronavirus-mammalian association (𝑣𝑖 → 𝑚𝑗 ) a

435

confidence score based on how similar the mammalian species 𝑚𝑗 is to known hosts of the coronavirus

436

𝑣𝑖 , compared to how similar 𝑚𝑗 is to mammals not associated with 𝑣𝑖 . For instance, if 𝑚𝑗 is

437

phylogenetically close to known hosts of 𝑣𝑖 , and also phylogenetically distant to mammalian species

438

not known to be associated with this coronavirus then the phylogenetic similarly learner will assign

439

𝑣𝑖 → 𝑚𝑗 a higher confidence score. However, if 𝑚𝑗 does not overlap geographically with known hosts

440

of 𝑣𝑖 , then the geographical overlap learner will assign it a low (in effect 0) confidence score.

441

corresponding to each of the similarity matrices summarised in table 1 and calculated in Supplementary

incorporate the three points of views descried above, as well as varied aspects of the coronaviruses and

Ensemble sampling: our gbm ensembles comprised 100 replicate models. Each model was trained with

460

balanced random samples using 10-fold cross validation. Final ensembles were generated by taking

461

mean predictions (probability) of constituent models. Standard deviation (SD) from mean probability

462

was also generated and its values subtracted/added to predictions.

463

Validation and performance estimation: We validated the performance of our analytical pipeline

464

externally against 5 held-out test-sets. each test-set was generated by splitting the set of observed

465

associations between coronaviruses and their hosts into two random sets: a training-set comprising 85%

466

of all known associations and a test-set comprising 15% of known associations. These test-sets were

467

held-out throughout the processes of generating similarity matrices; similarity learning, and assembling

468

our learners, and were only used for the purposes of estimating performance metrics of our analytical

469

pipeline. This resulted in 5 runs in which our ensemble learnt using only 85% of observed associations

470

between our coronaviruses and their mammalian hosts. For each run calculated three performance

471

metrics based on the mean probability across each set of 100 replicate models of the gbm meta-

472

ensembles: AUC, true skills statistics (TSS) and F-score.

473

AUC is a threshold-independent measure of model predictive performance that is commonly used as a

474

validation metric for host-pathogen predictive models21,45. Use of AUC has been criticised for its

475

insensitivity to absolute predicted probability and its inclusion of a priori untenable prediction 51,53, we

476

also calculated the True Skill Statistic (TSS = sensitivity + specificity -1)54. F-score captures the

477

harmonic mean of the precision and recall and is often used with uneven class distribution. Our approach

478

is relaxed with respect to false positives s(unobserved associations), hence the low F-score recorded

479

overall.

480

Changes in network structure: We quantified the diversity of the mammalian hosts of each CoV in

481

our input by computing mean phylogenetic distance between these hosts. Similarly, we captured the

482

diversity of CoVs associated with each mammalian species by calculating mean (hamming) distance

483

between the genomes of these CoVs. We termed these two metrics: mammalian diversity per virus and

484

viral diversity per mammal, respectively. We aggregated both metrics at the network level by means of

485

simple average. This enabled us to quantify changes in these diversity metrics, at the level of network,

486

with addition of predicted links at three probability cut-offs: >0.5, >0.75 and ≥0.95.

487

In addition, we captured changes in the structure of the bipartite network linking CoVs with their

488

mammalian hosts, with the addition of predicted associations, by computing comprehensive set of

489

structural properties (Supplementary Note 4) at the probability cut-offs mentioned above, and compare

490

the results with our original network. Here we ignore properties that deterministically change with

491

addition of links (e.g. degree centrality, connectance, table S2 lists all computed metrics and changes

492

in their values). Instead we focus on non-trivial structural properties. Specifically, we capture changes

493

in network stability, by measuring its nestedness55–57; and we quantify non-independence in interaction

494

patterns by means of Checkerboard score58 (C-Score). Supplementary note 4 provides full definition of

495

these concepts as well as other metrics we computed for our networks.
