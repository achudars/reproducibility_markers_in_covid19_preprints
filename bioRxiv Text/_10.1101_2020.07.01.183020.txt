One Sentence Summary: ​A repurposed drug that targets an essential enzymatic activity of
SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising COVID-19 therapeutic.

Abstract:​ A recently emerged betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis
that calls for the identification of effective therapeutics for COVID-19 disease. Coronavirus
papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target as it is essential for viral polyprotein
cleavage and for deconjugation of ISG15, an antiviral ubiquitin-like protein. We show here that
6-Thioguanine (6-TG) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 PLpro-catalyzed viral polyprotein cleavage and
ISG15 deconjugation in cells and inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells and
Calu3 cells at submicromolar levels. As a well-characterized FDA-approved orally delivered
drug, 6-TG represents a promising therapeutic for COVID-19 and other emerging coronaviruses.

Main Text:
Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus
highly similar to SARS (now SARS-CoV-1) ​(​1​, ​2​)​. An urgent need exists for treatment
strategies, and repurposed FDA-approved drugs with existing supply chains and
well-characterized pharmacologic properties represent a rapid and efficient approach toward
COVID-19 therapeutics ​(​3​)​.
Enzymes encoded by SARS-CoV-2 are attractive drug targets, including PLpro, an
essential cysteine protease activity within the nsp3 protein ​(​4​)​. PLpro cleaves the pp1a
polyprotein at three sites, generating mature nsp1, 2 and 3 proteins. The PLpro recognition site
(LXGG) is also found at the C-terminus of ubiquitin and ISG15, an antiviral ubiquitin-like
modifier, although SARS-CoV-1 and -2 PLpro preferentially catalyze de-ISGylation over
de-ubiquitylation ​(​5​, ​6​)​. Therapeutic inhibition of PLpro would therefore be predicted to have
two antiviral effects: restoration of the antiviral effect of ISGylation and inhibition of viral
replication by blocking polyprotein cleavage. Further, de-ISGylation by PLpro, through
generation of free (unconjugated) ISG15, enhances the secretion and extracellular signaling
function of ISG15, which in turn promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production from cells of
the immune system ​(​7​)​. Therefore, a potential third effect of inhibiting PLpro would be a
decrease in pro-inflammatory “cytokine storms” associated with COVID-19 ​(​8​)​.
6-Thioguanine (6-TG) is an FDA-approved drug that has been used in the clinic since the
1950s, originally for the treatment of childhood leukemias and subsequently for treatment of
inflammatory bowel and Crohn’s disease ​(​9​)​. 6-TG was previously reported to inhibit the
SARS-CoV-1 and MERS PLpro catalytic domain ​in vitro​ ​(​10​, ​11​)​, with an IC50 of 5 µM and

24.4 µM, respectively, however there was no further follow up of its ability to inhibit
de-ISGylation or viral polyprotein cleavage in cells or its ability to inhibit viral replication. Fig.
1A shows that co-expression of PLpro (residues 746-1061 of nsp3) with ISG15 and its
conjugation enzymes (Uba7, Ube2L6, and Herc5) in HEK293T cells resulted in nearly complete
loss of ISG15 conjugates, while expression of the active-site C-to-A variant of PLpro (C856 of
nsp3; PLpro​CA​) was inactive. Addition of 6-TG resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of PLpro
de-ISGylation activity, with half-maximal inhibition at approximately 0.1 µM (Fig. 1A;
quantitation shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A).
The PLpro domain, located within nsp3, generates mature nsp-1, 2 and 3 proteins from
the pp1a polyprotein through self-catalyzed cleavage reactions (Fig. 1B, schematic). We
determined whether 6-TG inhibited polyprotein processing, as this is an essential function of
Plpro and the natural context in which PLpro is expressed. An N-terminally TAP-tagged fusion
of nsp1, 2 and 3 (TAP-nsp123​WT​) was expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B, schematic), as well
as the active-site C-to-A variant (TAP-nsp123​CA​). The fusion protein was detected with
anti-TAP antibody, and TAP-nsp1 was expressed separately as a size marker for the fully
processed fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, expression of TAP-nsp123​WT​ resulted primarily
in a product the size of TAP-nsp1 (42 kD), as expected if the fusion protein was fully processed,
while expression of TAP-nsp123​CA​ resulted in the expected full-length protein (~336 kD) along
with several breakdown products of the full-length protein. Increasing concentrations of 6-TG
inhibited PLpro-mediated processing of the TAP-nsp123​WT ​polyprotein, with loss of the
TAP-nsp1 product and accumulation of the full-length fusion protein, with the same pattern of
breakdown products seen with the TAP-nsp123​CA​ protein. Half-maximal inhibition of

polyprotein cleavage occurred between 0.1 and 0.5 µM (quantitation shown in Supplementary
Fig. 1B). This result indicates that 6-TG inhibits an essential function of PLpro activity and that
it inhibits PLpro when it is expressed in the context of the full-length nsp3 protein.
In addition to its function as a ubiquitin-like modifier, free (unconjugated) ISG15 exits
cells and signals to LFA-1-expressing cells of the immune system (​e.g​., NK cells, T cells) to
release specific cytokines, including IFN-γ and IL-10 ​(​7​, ​12​)​, while ISG15 conjugates are
retained in cells. Therefore, a secondary effect of PLpro-mediated de-ISGylation is the enhanced
secretion of ISG15 (​7​). We determined whether 6-TG would block this effect. Fig. 2A shows
that expression of PLpro in HEK293T cells led to decreased intracellular ISG15 conjugates
(upper blot, total cell lysates) and increased free ISG15 in the extracellular space (lower blot,
IP-western of ISG15 from cell culture supernatants), and that 6-TG not only restored intracellular
conjugates but also blocked the production of free extracellular ISG15.
IFN-​γ,​ IL-10 and IL-6 are associated with uncontrolled cytokine release syndrome and
have been shown to be elevated in COVID-19 patients ​(​13​, ​14​)​. The complete range of cytokines
affected by extracellular ISG15 signaling is unknown, but the relationship of ISG15 to IFN-​γ​ and
IL-10 ​(​12​)​ led us to test whether ISG15 also induced the secretion of IL-6​ from human PBMCs.
In a trans-well culture system, HEK293T cells (lower chamber) were transfected with ISG15,
with or without the ISG15 conjugation enzymes (E1/E2/E3) and/or PLpro. PBMCs were placed
in the upper chamber, separated from the lower chamber by a 0.4 micron membrane. In this
system, ISG15 released from cells in the lower chamber signals to LFA-1-expressing cells in the
upper chamber, and cytokine release in the upper chamber is measured by ELISA ​(​7​)​. Fig. 2B
shows that expression of ISG15, alone, in the HEK293T cells led to secretion of IL-6 from

PBMCs, and this effect was diminished when the conjugation enzymes were co-expressed with
ISG15 (compare lanes 1, 3, and 5). De-ISGylation catalyzed by PLpro resulted in enhanced IL-6
secretion (compare lanes 5 and 7), and the addition of 6-TG reversed the effect of PLpro, leading
to diminished IL-6 production (compare lanes 7 and 8). These results identify IL-6 as an
additional cytokine that is responsive to extracellular ISG15 signaling and suggest that PLpro
may be at least partially responsible for enhanced cytokine responses in COVID-19 patients.
Therapeutically, 6-TG inhibition of PLpro might therefore have the additional benefit of limiting
excessive cytokine responses associated with poor patient outcomes.
6-TG was next analyzed for its ability to inhibit SARS-C​oV-2 ​replication ​(strain 2019
n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020; ​18​) in Vero-E6 African green monkey kidney cells and in the Calu3
human lung epithelial cell line. As shown in Fig. 3, 6-TG inhibited viral replication in Vero-E6
cells with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.647 ± 0.374 μM. By comparison,
Remdesivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-E6 cells similarly, with an EC50 of 0.77
µM ​(​15​)​. 6-TG inhibited virus replication in Calu3 cells at a lower EC50, 0.061 ± 0.049 μM.
While the basis of the difference between the two cell lines is not known, cell lines can vary
significantly with respect to thiopurine uptake and metabolism​ ​(​16​)​. 6-TG did not elicit
significant cellular toxicity in either Vero-E6 or Calu3 cells (CC50 >50 μM), yielding selectivity
indices (SI) of >77 in Vero-E6 cells and >819 Calu3 cells. Together, the results presented here
indicate ​that 6-Thioguanine is a direct-acting SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, inhibiting PLpro
de-ISGylation, polyprotein cleavage, and viral replication at submicromolar concentrations.
To our knowledge, 6-TG is the first identified FDA-approved inhibitor of PLpro
demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. 6-TG is a widely available orally delivered

generic drug on the World Health Organization list of essential medicines ​(​17​)​. Dosing regimens
vary significantly depending on its use, from 10 mg per day for long-term treatment of
inflammatory diseases, to up to 3 mg/kg/day in acute lymphocytic leukemia treatments ​(​18​)​.
While toxicity can be significant at higher dosages, it is anticipated that its use as an antiviral
would be over a relatively short time period and that toxicity issues would likely be minimal. We
propose that the results presented here warrant the initiation of human clinical trials of 6-TG as a
SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic. As PLpro is a conserved and essential enzymatic activity of the beta
coronaviruses, 6-TG may prove useful in the current and future coronavirus pandemics and as a
complement to other antivirals in development.

Cells, viruses, and compounds.
All cell lines were maintained at 37ºC, 5% v/v CO​2​ in a humidified incubator. HEK293T
cells were grown in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) and 1%
Penicillin-Streptomycin (Corning).​ ​PBMCs from healthy individuals were isolated from
Leukoreduction System (LRS) Chambers obtained from We Are Blood (Austin, TX). The LRS
chamber blood was diluted 1:1 with PBS with 2% FBS and transferred to a SepMate tube (Stem
Cell Technologies) containing an equal volume of Ficoll Plaque (GE Healthcare). The tube was
centrifuged at 1,200 x ​g​ for 10 minutes at room temperature. The top layer containing the
enriched mononuclear cells (MNCs) was poured off to a separate tube. The enriched MNCs were
washed twice with PBS containing 2% FBS. To eliminate any red blood cells (RBCs) present in
the MNC fraction, cells were lysed with 1X RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend). The MNCs were then
counted and either frozen in RPMI 1640 containing 20% FBS and 5% DMSO or plated in RPMI
1640 at 1x10​6​ cells per mL.
Vero-E6 (ATCC), Calu3 (ATCC) were cultured at 37ºC, 5% v/v CO​2​ in a humidified

Michael S. Diamond, Washington University School of Medicine. All work with infectious
SARS-CoV2 was performed in Institutional Biosafety Committee approved A-BSL3 facilities at
Washington University School of Medicine using appropriate positive pressure air respirators
and protective equipment.
Plasmids
​
pcDNA3.1-TAP-PLpro​WT​ and pcDNA3.1-TAP-PLpro​CA were
described in ​(​7)​ ​.

pcDNA3.1-TAP-nsp123 was generated from a partial orf1ab clone (S2-A2_p57 plasmids)
encoding residues 1-1504; nsp1, nsp2, and part of nsp3; (gift from Hongbing Jiang and David
Wang, Washington University School of Medicine ) with the remainder of the nsp3 ORF
(residues 1505 - 2767 of pp1a, derived from Addgene cat# 141257). The
pcDNA3.1-TAP-nsp123 active site variant (C to A substitution, residue 1677 of polyprotein 1a,
corresponding to residue 856 of mature nsp3) was generated from this clone by overlapping
PCR. pGEX6P ISG15 was described previously (​12)​ and the pGEX6P ISG15-precursor was
made by adding nucleotides corresponding to the amino acid sequence TEPGGRS
YPYDVPDYA (the natural ISG15 C-terminal extension and an HA tag) to the 3’ end of
pGEX6P ISG15. Plasmids expressing FLAG-ISG15, and the ISG15 E1, E2, and E3 enzymes
(Uba7, Ube2L6, and Herc5) have been described previously (​12​).
Transfections and drug treatments
HEK293T cells were plated in a 6 well plate at a density of 3x10​4 ​cells/mL. The next day
cells were transfected using X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (Roche). Plasmids
were transfected at the following amounts: 0.5 µg FLAG-Ubiquitin, 0.35 µg FLAG-ISG15, 0.25
µg Uba7, 0.25 µg Ube2L6, 0.35 µg HA-Herc5, 1 µg TAP-nsp123 (WT or CA), 0.2 µg

TAP-PLpro​CA​, and TAP-PLpro​WT​ (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, or 1.0 µg). Cells were treated with 6-TG at
the indicated concentrations immediately following transfection (100 mM 6-TG stock in DMSO
and is diluted to working concentrations in PBS).
Transwell assay and IL-6 ELISA
HEK293T cells (1x10​5​ cells per well) were plated in the lower chambers of 24-well
Corning transwell plates (0.4 μm membrane; Fisher Scientific). At the same time, PBMCs (1x10​6
cells per ml) were plated in a separate 10 cm dish in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin streptomycin and allowed to rest for 16 hours. HEK293T cells were transfected with
100 ng of plasmid expressing FLAG-ISG15, with or without ISG15 conjugation components (50
ng Ube1L, 50 ng UbcH8, 100 ng Herc5) and/or SARS-CoV2 PL​pro​, using X-tremeGENE HP
DNA transfection reagent (Roche) and treated with and without 0.5 µM 6-TG. 0.3 mL of
PBMCs (at 1x10​6​ per mL) were added to the upper chamber of the transwell chamber, and
cultured for 48 hours. Cell culture supernatants were collected from the upper transwell chamber
and assayed for IL-6 production by IL-6 ELISA according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
(Thermo Scientific).
Protein purification.
ISG15 and ISG15-precursor (ISG15-pre) proteins were purified as GST fusion proteins in
BL21 E. coli. Overnight starter cultures were grown at 37ºC for 16 hours. Cultures were diluted
1:10 and cultured with shaking for 2 hours at 37ºC. Expression of proteins was induced with 100
µM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 hours at 30ºC. Cells were collected by
centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mL PBS with 1% Triton X-100, and sonicated for 30 seconds.
Lysates were spun at 15,000xg for 10 minutes, and supernatants were incubated with 100 µL

centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mL TBS with 0.00025% Tween 20, 0.01 mM DTT and 5%
glycerol (Binding Buffer), and sonicated for 1 minute. Lysates were spun at 15,000xg for 10
minutes and supernatants were incubated with 100 µL per liter of culture Glutathione Sepharose
(GE Healthcare) for 4 hours with rotation at 4ºC. Beads were collected and washed three times
with Binding Buffer supplemented with 0.1mM EDTA and subjected to site-specific cleavage
with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) to remove the GST tag. Beads were removed and the
protein concentration in the supernatant was quantified by SDS-PAGE using a Licor Odyssey
Imager.
In vitro cleavage of GST-ISG15-pre​.
0.1 µM PLpro was incubated with 0.1 µM GST-ISG15-pre for the indicated amount of
time with the indicated amount of 6-TG. Reactions were initiated by the addition of
GST-ISG15-pre and stopped by addition of 10µL of 250mM tris pH 6.8, 40% glycerol 8% SDS
and 400mM DTT. Samples were run on 10% Tris-Glycine gels and stained with Coomassie blue
stain. Gels were imaged using a Licor Odyssey Imager.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations
Samples assessing ISGylation or ubiquitination were lysed in 1% NP40 lysis buffer (100
mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl ,1% NP40) supplemented with 10 mM NEM, 170 µg/mL PMSF,
2 µg/mL leupeptin, 2 µg/mL aprotinin and 10 mM DTT for 10 minutes on ice followed by a 10
minute spin at 20000 x​ g.​ Samples were run on BOLT 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Thermo) and blotted
with the M2 FLAG antibody (Sigma). Samples assessing the effect of 6-TG on TAP-nsp123
cleavage were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.1% SDS,
0.5% Sodium deoxycholate w/v) supplemented with 10 mM NEM, 170 µg/mL PMSF, 2 µg/mL
leupeptin, 2 µg/mL aprotinin, 10 mM DTT, and 2 units/mL Universal Nuclease (Pierce) for 10
minutes on ice followed by a 10 minute spin at 20000 x ​g​. Samples were run on 3-8%
Tris-Acetate gels (Thermo) and blotted for TAP using the anti-protein A antibody (Sigma). Actin
blots were performed with an anti actin antibody clone: AC-15 (Invitrogen).
For detection of extracellular ISG15, cell culture supernatants were collected and cleared
of any cell debris by centrifugation at 1000 x ​g.​ The supernatants were further cleared of IgG
from the serum by two one-hour bindings with Protein A sepharose (Invitrogen) at room
temperature. 20 µL of Sera-Mag SpeedBead Protein A/G magnetic beads (GE Life Sciences), 10
µL of ISG15 antibody (Invitrogen 7H29L24) and 20 mL of 0.1% NP40 in PBS pH 7.0 were
added to the cell culture supernatants and rocked for 2 hours at room temperature. Beads were
isolated with a neodymium magnet and washed 3X with 0.1% NP40 in PBS pH 7.0. ISG15 was
eluted from the beads by boiling in 80 µl of 1X loading buffer and 40 µl was run on a NuPAGE
4-12% Bis-Tris gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for western blotting. ISG15 was detected
with the M2 Flag antibody (Sigma).

Virus replication assays
1.5-2 x 10​5 ​Vero-E6 and 5 x 10​5​ Calu3 cells were seeded in a 24 well format. The cells
were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.001 diluted in culture media containing 2% FBS.
Virus inoculum was removed after one hour and cells were washed with 1mL PBS twice.
Infected cells were cultured in media containing 6-TG (25 µM, 5 µM, 1 µM, 200nM, 40nM,
8nM, NoTx). 100 µl of culture supernatants were harvested into (ORF) 300 μL TRK lysis
buffer plus BME at 24 and 48 hours. RNA was isolated from homogenates of TRK lysates using
an E.Z.N.A. Total RNA kit I (Omega). Isolated RNA was resuspended in UltraPure H​2​O
(Ambion). RT-qPCR was performed on a ViiA 7 or an ABI 7500 qPCR machine (Thermo
Scientific) using the TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems) with a 20 μL total
reaction volume per well including 8.5 μL of RNA sample and Taqman primers and
SARS-CoV2 N1 probe of 2019-nCoV RUO Kit from Integrated DNA Technologies. The
following PCR cycling protocol was used: 15 minutes at 48°, 10 min at 95°, and 50 cycles of 15
sec at 95° and 1 min at 60°C. RNA copy number was determined for each sample using the
matching RNA standard (gift of Adam Bailey, Michael S. Diamond lab, Washington University
School of Medicine).
6-TG toxicity assays
The real-time cytotoxicity events were analyzed by using a 2-color IncuCyte ZOOM
in-incubator imaging system (Essen Bioscience). Dead cells were detected by uptake of the
cell-impermeable dye SYTOX Green (Invitrogen). The total cell numbers were estimated by
calculating cell numbers staining with cell-permeable dye SYTO24.

Quantification and Statistical analysis.
Graphpad Prism 8 software was used to plot ELISA, virus replication and densitometry
data. Bars represent three or more biological replicates. Error bars represent the standard error of
the mean (SEM). Ordinary one-way ANOVA was performed on each ELISA data set comparing
all conditions to treatment with 6-TG, alone. EC​50​ and CC​50​ of 6-TG were calculated using
"log(inhibitor) vs. normalized response -- Variable slope". Cell viability, dose response curve,
and EC​50​ with 95% confidence interval was plotted/indicated in the graph. Asterisks indicate
p-values: *=0.02, **=0.002, ***=0.004, ****<0.0001, and non significant changes are indicated
by ns.
