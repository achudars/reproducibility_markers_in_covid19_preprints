ABSTRACT

23

The cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses

24

types 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) requires sequential protease processing of the

25

viral spike glycoprotein (S). The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-

26

2 S at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased

27

transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation

28

of the S precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal

29

cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site

30

in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to

31

interferons, and more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein

32

family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is

33

restricted predominantly by IFITM2 and the degree of this restriction is governed by

34

route of viral entry. Removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-

35

CoV-2 entry highly pH- and cathepsin-dependent in late endosomes where, like

36

SARS-CoV-1 S, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we find that

37

potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated

38

by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage

39

site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part

40

to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and

41

transmission. This suggests therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated

42

cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I

43

IFNs.

IMPORTANCE

47

The furin cleavage site in the S protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2

48

and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between

49

individuals compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits

50

more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring

51

processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is

52

inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2, and that the sensitivity is

53

exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site which restricts viral entry to low pH

54

compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the

55

antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest

56

one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate

57

immune restriction, and thus may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-

58

19 treatment development.

INTRODUCTION

70

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel

71

coronavirus that was identified in early 2020(Wu et al., 2020). Entry of SARS-CoV-2

72

into the cell is initiated by the spike glycoprotein binding to its receptor, angiotensin-

73

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, Schroeder, et al., 2020).

74

Spike is a type I transmembrane protein that is synthesised as a polyprotein

75

precursor and requires two steps of proteolytic cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary and

76

at the S2’ site in order to mediate fusion of the viral and cell membranes. Due to the

77

insertion of four amino acids at the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 spike, with the

78

sequence 681PRRA|RSV687, SARS-CoV-2 spike contains a canonical furin-like

79

protease cleavage site (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, Schroeder, et al., 2020). This

80

allows the SARS-CoV-2 spike to be cleaved by furin-like proteases intracellularly

81

prior to virion release. TMPRSS2 on the target cell surface and cathepsins B and L

82

in endosomes may cleave the S2’ site and activate the fusion machinery depending

83

on the relative availability of these enzymes. The presence of this site has been

84

suggested to be important for determining viral tropism and transmission of SARS-

85

CoV-2 (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020; Hoffmann, Kleine-

86

Weber, & Pöhlmann, 2020; Peacock et al., 2020). However, the necessity for this

87

site is cell-type dependent. It has been shown that this site can be lost after several

88

passages in TMPRSS2-negative Vero-E6 cells (Davidson et al., 2020).

89

Nevertheless, similar mutations have only been found rarely in a small number of

90

patients (Liu et al., 2020; Sasaki et al., 2020). This suggests a selective pressure to

91

conserve the polybasic cleavage site for in vivo transmission but not necessarily in

92

vitro, depending on the cell line used (Davidson et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020;

93

Peacock et al., 2020; Sasaki et al., 2020). Structural data of SARS-CoV-2 spike

94

indicates that cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary results in exposure of the receptor-

95

binding domain (RBD) of spike (Wrobel et al., 2020). It has been suggested that this

96

exposure of the RBD facilitates binding to ACE2 and the secondary cleavage of the

97

S2’ site of spike, facilitating membrane fusion.

98

Interferons (IFNs) upregulate the expression of a range of antiviral proteins

99

termed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit various aspects of viral lifecycles,

100

including entry (Schoggins, 2019). One of these protein families, IFN-induced

101

transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are membrane spanning proteins which inhibit the

102

entry of several viruses, including HIV-1, influenza, Ebola and SARS-CoV-1 through

103

blocking the fusion of the cellular and viral membranes, possibly by decreasing

104

membrane fluidity or affecting membrane curvature (Foster, Pickering, & Neil, 2018;

105

Zhao, Li, Winkler, An, & Guo, 2019). Three IFITMs demonstrate antiviral activity in

106

humans: IFITM1 which localises to the plasma membrane, and IFITMs 2 and 3

107

which localise to late and early endosomes respectively (Foster et al., 2016; Shi,

108

Schwartz, & Compton, 2017). Previous research has shown the route of entry

109

correlates with the restriction of both influenza virus and HIV-1. Mislocalising IFITM3

110

to the cell surface abrogates IFITM3 restriction of influenza virus (Brass et al., 2009)

111

. In HIV-1, CCR5-tropic viruses which fuse at the plasma membrane are more

112

restricted by IFITM1, and CXCR4-tropic viruses which utilise the endosomal route

113

are more restricted by IFITMs 2 and 3 (Foster et al., 2016). It has been reported that

114

SARS-CoV-2 is highly sensitive to type I and III IFNs, and more specifically, to

115

IFITM3 (Felgenhauer et al., 2020; Lokugamage et al., 2020; Peacock et al., 2020;

116

Stanifer et al., 2020). Conversely, other authors have suggested expression of

117

IFITMs can enhance entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Bozzo et al., 2020). Given that entry is

118

the first key step in viral transmission and IFITMs have been shown to be expressed

119

in lung tissue, the interplay between IFITM restriction and SARS-CoV-2 entry is likely

120

to be fundamental to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and transmit (Bailey, Zhong,

121

Huang, & Farzan, 2014; Hachim et al., 2020). Here, we have shown the differential

122

sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to IFITMs and how the presence of a polybasic cleavage

123

site may affect entry in the context of IFITM restriction.

124

RESULTS

125

Sensitivity of SARS CoV-2 and pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (PLVs) with

126

SARS-CoV-2 spike to human type-I, type II and type III interferons in A549-

127

ACE2 cells

128

In order to examine the restriction of SARS CoV-2 replication by human antiviral

129

proteins, we first sought to confirm the sensitivity of replication-competent SARS-

130

CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 strain England 2) to type I (a and b), type II (g) and type III (l)

131

IFNs in human A549 lung cancer cells stably expressing ACE2. We pre-treated the

132

cells with different doses of recombinant human IFNa2, b, l4 and g overnight and

133

then challenged them with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.005 based on Vero-E6). 48 hours

134

later we measured the levels of viral RNA by RT-qPCR using both Centres for

135

Disease Control N1 and N2 primer probe sets (Figure 1A and D). We found that

136

SARS-CoV-2 is highly sensitive to IFNb and IFNg with very low IC50 values, and less

137

sensitive but nonetheless still restricted by IFNa and IFNl. In addition to measuring

138

intracellular viral RNA abundance in the IFN-treated cells, we infected Vero-E6 cells

139

with the supernatant harvested from IFN-treated and infected A549-ACE2 cells and

140

quantified the expression of nucleocapsid (N) protein 24 hours later. This assay

141

measures the amount of infectious virus produced by the mock or IFN-treated cells

142

and showed similar results (Figure 1B and E), thus confirming previous studies that

143

the virus is highly IFN sensitive, particularly to IFNb and IFNg, indicating that a

144

number of ISGs have direct antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.

145

In order to address the activities of ISGs directed against spike-mediated

146

entry, we first determined whether we could recapitulate the IFN phenotypes

147

observed above using pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (PLVs). We generated PLVs

148

containing SARS-CoV-2 spike bearing a luciferase reporter gene and tested them for

149

sensitivity to IFNs on A549-ACE2. Similar to full-length SARS-CoV-2, we found that

150

PLVs with SARS-CoV-2 spike are also highly sensitive to IFNb and IFNg (Figure 1C

151

and F). Whilst the early events of HIV-1 are known targets of IFN treatment in some

152

cell lines, these data suggest that when we isolate the entry stage of SARS-CoV-2

153

infection we observed inhibition by IFNb and IFNg (Doyle, Goujon, & Malim, 2015).

154

SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFITM2, but not IFITM3, in A549-ACE2 cells

155

IFITMs are a family of ISGs upregulated by IFNs that predominantly inhibit fusion of

156

viral and cellular membranes (Foster et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017). Considering that

157

our PLVs with SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated a similar extent of inhibition by IFNs

158

to the full-length virus we suspected that IFITMs, which have previously been

159

reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and more recently suggested to inhibit SARS-CoV-2,

160

may be contributing to this inhibition (Bozzo et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2011;

161

Peacock et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2019).

162

To test the impact of each individual IFITM on SARS-CoV-2 infection, we

163

generated stable A549-ACE2 cell lines expressing each human antiviral IFITM

164

(Figure 2A) and infected these with PLVs of SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-

165

CoV-2 showed a small but significant sensitivity to IFITM1 and a comparatively

166

greater sensitivity to IFITM2 (Figure 2B). We recapitulated these phenotypes by

167

challenging the A549-ACE2-IFITM cells with SARS-CoV-2 at increasing MOIs and

168

using the supernatant of these cells 48 hours later to infect Vero-E6 cells, and

169

measuring viral infectivity by staining for N protein (Figure 2C). At low MOI, SARS-

170

CoV-2 was particularly sensitive to IFITM2 but not IFITM3, with an inhibitory effect

171

seen with IFITM1, and these sensitivities were ameliorated at high viral inputs. As

172

both single round PLVs and the full-length virus essentially displayed similar

173

phenotypic sensitivity to IFITM2, these results suggest that a predominant antiviral

174

effect is mediated at cellular entry.

175

Both IFITM2 and IFITM3 predominantly localize to endosomal compartments

176

but reach them via endocytosis from the cell surface through the recruitment of the

177

clathrin adaptor AP2 to a tyrosine-based endocytic signal (YxxF) in the IFITM2/3

178

cytoplasmic tail. We and others have previously demonstrated that mutating the

179

Y19/Y20 to a phenylalanine in IFITM2 and IFITM3 respectively results in their

180

accumulation at the plasma membrane (Chesarino, McMichael, Hach, & Yount,

181

2014; Foster et al., 2016). To test this, we stably expressed IFITM2 Y19F A549-

182

ACE2 (Figure 2D) and infected these cells with both PLVs and replication competent

183

SARS-CoV-2 and found that infection was not inhibited, but rather was enhanced by

184

the presence of IFITM2 Y19F (Figure 2E, 2F). Although surprising that

185

mislocalisation of IFITM2 resulted in enhancement of infection rather than simply an

186

absence of restriction, these data are consistent with a recent report suggesting that

187

similar mutants of IFITM3 enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection (Shi et al., 2020). These

188

data suggest that the localisation of IFITM2 to endosomes or its recruitment to

189

clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane is key to its inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

190

entry.

191

The polybasic cleavage site determines sensitivity to IFITM2 in the presence or

192

absence of TMPRSS2

193

A major difference between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the majority of the

194

phylogenetically related bat Sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, is the presence

195

of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary which facilitates the processing

196

of spike to S1/S2 during viral assembly in the producer cell rather than during entry

197

of the target (Figure 3A). As this feature has been proposed to be associated with

198

the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesized that it might affect

199

the sensitivity of the virus to IFITM2. To investigate this, we deleted the polybasic

200

cleavage site from SARS-CoV-2 (while preserving the adjacent RS cathepsin site)

201

and swapped the corresponding region from (P681-A684) SARS-CoV-2 into SARS-

202

CoV-1, generating SARS-CoV-2DPRRA and SARS-CoV-1 PRRA respectively

203

(Figure 3A). We made PLVs of these mutants and analysed spike expression and

204

virion incorporation by western blot using a polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-

205

1/2 S2 (Figure 3B). We found that all spike proteins were equivalently expressed in

206

the transfected producer 293T-17 cell. As expected, the SARS-CoV-1 spike exists

207

predominantly as the S1/2 precursor on pelleted virions in the supernatant. By

208

contrast, processed S2 was the predominant species found on virions pseudotyped

209

with SARS-CoV-2 spike, indicating furin-mediated cleavage during virion assembly.

210

By contrast, as expected SARS-CoV-2DPRRA was no longer cleaved. Insertion of

211

the SARS-CoV-2 cleavage site into SARS-CoV-1 was sufficient to lead to processed

212

spike, however this was not as efficient as in SARS-CoV-2, with virions incorporating

213

both cleaved and uncleaved spikes (Figure 3B). In keeping with results from others,

214

in Vero-E6 cells SARS-CoV-2DPRRA PLVs had a markedly increased infectivity of

215

approximately 50-fold in A549-ACE2 cells compared to the wild type spike,

216

approaching those of SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 3C) (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, &

217

Pöhlmann, 2020). Addition of the PRRA site to SARS-CoV-1 slightly reduced titres.

218

Since SARS-CoV-2 requires TMPRSS2 in the target cells to activate spike for entry,

219

we over-expressed TMPRSS2 in A549-ACE2 cells by retroviral transduction and

220

found that this specifically enhanced infection of SARS-CoV-2 PLVs, indicating that

221

in the absence of TMPRSS2 expression, much of the SARS-CoV-2 inoculum is not

222

infectious in these cells.

223

We then tested IFITM sensitivity of these PLVs in A549-ACE2 cells with and

224

without TMPRSS2 overexpression (Figure 3D and 3E). As expected, SARS-CoV-2

225

was sensitive to both IFITM1 and IFITM2 in A549-ACE2 cells (Fig 3D). SARS-CoV-1

226

PLVs were significantly more sensitive to IFITM2 but displayed no restriction by

227

IFITM1, suggestive of distinct subcellular site of entry between SARS-CoV-1 and

228

SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly deletion of PRRA in SARS-CoV-2 rendered this spike as

229

sensitive as SARS-CoV-1 to IFITM2 and slightly reduced the IFITM1 sensitivity. By

230

contrast the addition of a cleavage site to SARS-CoV-1 significantly reduced IFITM2

231

sensitivity, albeit not to the levels of the fully cleaved SARS-CoV-2 spike. When we

232

overexpressed TMPRSS2, we found that while IFITM1 sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2

233

could be abolished, this was not sufficient to rescue SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-

234

2DPRRA from IFITM2. Thus, the presence of the polybasic cleavage site markedly

235

reduces the sensitivity of SARS CoV-2 S-mediated entry to IFITM2, suggesting it

236

affects the route of cellular entry into the cell and distinguishes it from SARS CoV-1.

237

To address the effects of spike cleavage on route of entry, we first determined

238

the pH-sensitivity of the spike cleavage mutants using concanamycin A (ConA), an

239

inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase in late endosomes (Figure 4A). As expected, SARS-

240

CoV-1 PLVs were exquisitely sensitive (1000 fold) to ConA inhibition in A549-ACE2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.423592; this version posted December 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this

241

indicating that entry was occurring exclusively in a low pH endosomal compartment.

242

In the presence of TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-1 pH sensitivity was reduced, but entry

243

still remained 20-50 fold lower suggesting any enhanced S2’ processing was not

244

sufficient to abolish pH-dependent entry. Similarly, while insertion of a partially

245

processed polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-1 reduced but did not abolish pH-

246

dependent entry in either cell type. By contrast, entry of SARS CoV-2 PLVs was only

247

mildly affected (2-3 fold) by ConA treatment irrespective of TMPRSS2

248

overexpression, indicating that most viral entry was occurring at neutral pH, and

249

TMPRSS2 was enhancing entry at this point rather than elsewhere in the cell.

250

Similar to SARS-CoV-1, deletion of the PRRA site from SARS-CoV-2 rendered PLVs

251

strictly pH-dependent without affecting titre. In keeping with these data, unlike SARS-

252

CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2DPRRA-mediated entry was inhibited by the

253

endosomal cathepsin inhibitor E64D but not the TMPRSS inhibitor Camostat (Figure

254

4B-I). By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 only was sensitive to E64D in TMPRSS2-

255

overexpressing cells. Together these data suggest that S1/S2 cleavage by furin in

256

the producer cell promotes TMPRSS2-mediated entry at the plasma membrane or

257

soon after internalization, and abolishes the requirement for cathepsin-mediated

258

processing in the acidic endosomal compartments. The data further suggest that in

259

the absence of abundant TMPRSS2 at the cell surface, the processed SARS-CoV-2

260

cannot efficiently enter through a low pH compartment. Thus, the PRRA site dictates

261

the route of entry into the cell and thus its sensitivity to IFITM proteins that occupy

262

different cellular locations.

263

IFITM2 contributes to the antiviral restriction of SARS-CoV-2 by IFNb

264

Having established that IFITM2 can restrict SARS-CoV-2 depending on its

265

mechanism of entry, we wanted to determine how much of the inhibition of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.423592; this version posted December 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this

266

replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 by IFNb and IFNg could be attributed to IFITM2.

267

We examined the expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in IFN-treated A549-ACE2 and

268

observed a robust upregulation of both IFITM2 and IFITM3 following treatment with

269

IFNb. By contrast, while IFITM3 was also robustly induced by IFNg, IFITM2 was

270

weakly induced (Figure 5A). Using siRNAs against IFITM2 that rescued SARS-CoV-

271

2 replication in A549-ACE2-IFITM2 cells (Figure 5B, 5C), we then knocked down

272

IFITM2 in the context of pre-treating A549-ACE2 cells with IFNb or IFNg and

273

challenged the cells with SARS-CoV-2, measuring infectious virus output on Vero-E6

274

cells 48h later (Figure 5D and E). IFITM2 depletion substantially relieved the

275

inhibition of viral replication by IFNb treatment, whereas that induced by IFNg was

276

only modestly alleviated. This was reflected in the 20-fold increase in the IC50 of

277

IFNb, but only a 2-fold increase in IFNg, indicating that in these cells IFITM2 is a

278

major component of the type I IFN-antiviral state protecting cells from SARS-CoV-2

279

(Figure 5F). Furthermore, in A549-ACE2 cells overexpressing TMPRSS2, the

280

knockdown of IFITM2 essentially abolished all the antiviral activity of pretreating the

281

cells with IFNb (Figure 5G). Thus IFITM2-mediated entry restriction is a major type-I

282

IFN activity that constitutes an antiviral state, blocking the replication of SARS CoV-

283

2.

284

DISCUSSION

285

In this study we have provided evidence that IFITM2 has potent inhibitory activity

286

against SARS-CoV-2 entry and constitutes at least part of the antiviral activity

287

conferred by treatment of target cells with IFNb. Furthermore, we find that the

288

presence or absence of the polybasic cleavage site, which facilitates pH-

289

independent entry of SARS-CoV-2, modulates the sensitivity of the virus to IFITM2

290

In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 and other related SARS-like CoVs in bats, SARS-

291

CoV-2 is distinguished by the presence of a furin cleavage site at the S1/S2

292

boundary. This leads to the spike on SARS-CoV-2 virions being predominantly

293

cleaved in the producer cell rather than by cathepsins during endocytic entry into the

294

target cell. This renders its entry pH-independent, suggesting fusion occurs at, or

295

near, the cell surface. Recent evidence further indicates that the furin cleavage

296

generates a C-terminal ligand on S1 that interacts with neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) on the

297

surface of target cells in the lung (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; Daly et al., 2020).

298

The role of NRP-1 is not completely clear, but there is some suggestion that it may

299

stabilize the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 at the cell surface to facilitate either ACE2

300

interaction or processing of the S2’ site by TMPRSS2. Structural analyses of the

301

SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer further shows that furin-mediated cleavage facilitates at

302

least one RBD domain to adopt an erect conformation that would further promote

303

ACE2 interaction (Wrobel et al., 2020). Interestingly, deletion of the PRRA is not

304

detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 entry in all cell types in culture, and in fact in TMPRSS2-

305

low Vero-E6 cells the furin-cleavage site is rapidly lost upon passage, suggesting it

306

can actively hinder infection. Herein we show that while wild-type spike-mediated

307

entry is insensitive to inhibition of endosomal pH, the cleavage mutant is strictly

308

dependent on endosome acidification and cathepsins. Interestingly, for efficient

309

entry, SARS-CoV-2 requires high TMPRSS2 expression to activate the fusion

310

mechanism by cleaving S2’. However, in cells where TMPRSS2 is limiting, SARS-

311

CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2DPRRA entry is far more efficient. Thus, in its uncleaved

312

form SARS-CoV-2 spike can mediate entry in endosomes, but in its mature form

313

entry cannot be rescued in low pH compartments of TMPRSS2-low cells. This would

314

imply that the cleaved spike is unstable at endosomal pH, and interestingly recent

315

studies from the Kwong group indicate that conformational dynamics of the RBD are

316

also pH sensitive (Zhou et al., 2020). Despite this potential greater fragility of the

317

SARS-CoV-2 trimer, the furin cleavage site appears to be essential for replication in

318

primary airway epithelium and for transmission in ferret models (Peacock et al.,

319

2020). We suggest that one of the reasons pH-independent fusion at or near the cell

320

surface is maintained is to mitigate the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins, particularly

321

IFITM2.

322

The localization of IFITMs largely defines which viruses they can restrict.

323

Whilst they can be incorporated into nascent virion membranes and exert an antiviral

324

effect there, their best studied mechanism of action is to prevent fusion of an

325

incoming virus at the target cell membrane. IFITM1 is predominantly found at the

326

plasma membrane, whereas IFITM2 and IFITM3 occupy endosomal compartments

327

by virtue of a conserved endocytic signal. Palmitoylation of the intracellular loop of

328

the IFITM stabilizes their conformation in the membrane and promotes their homo-

329

and heterotypic interactions. The current model for their action is that IFITM:IFITM

330

interactions exert a level of positive curvature to the target membrane that arrests

331

enveloped viral entry at the hemi-fusion stage (Rahman et al., 2020). IFITM3 is

332

particularly potent against influenza viruses and its redistribution away from early

333

endosomes by mutating the endocytic site in the cytoplasmic tail abolishes its

334

antiviral activity. Comparatively less is known about IFITM2, although it has been

335

shown to inhibit a number of other enveloped viruses that enter in later endosomes.

336

Of note, human IFITM2 and 3 differ from each other by only 10 amino acids, and yet

337

their restriction patterns are not interchangeable. While IFITM2 and 3 are localized in

338

endosomal compartments, they traffic via the cell surface, and their recruitment into

339

clathrin coated pits would imply that they may have some activity at viral entry sites

340

at the plasma membrane as well. However, our observations that IFITM2, but not

341

IFITM3, in the A549 system inhibits SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 would suggest that

342

neither virus fuse significantly in a cellular compartment occupied by IFITM3. Cell

343

type specificity in IFITM localization (due to endocytic rate etc) and hetero-typic

344

interactions between IFITMs suggests that when all are co-expressed, they may

345

form a more complex barrier to enveloped virus fusion than an individual IFITM

346

alone.

347

Studies on SARS-CoV-1 and recent papers and preprints on SARS-CoV-2

348

have shown a variety of phenotypes with different IFITMs on both viral entry and cell-

349

to-cell fusion mediated by the spike protein(Bozzo et al., 2020; Peacock et al., 2020;

350

Shi et al., 2020). IFITM1 appears to block syncytium formation between infected and

351

uninfected cells and this is overcome by TMPRSS2 expression, which is in keeping

352

with our observations that in stably expressing cells small effects of IFITM1 on

353

SARS-CoV-2 entry in A549-ACE2 cells can be abolished similarly (Buchrieser et al.,

354

2020). Other data has implicated IFITM3, and demonstrated that it can be enhancing

355

if its expression is restricted to the cell surface. Most of these experiments have

356

been performed in transiently transfected 293T cells with PLVs, and whilst the known

357

determinants of IFITM3 function are required, whether transient overexpression

358

faithfully represents the localization and potency of IFITM2 and IFITM3 natural

359

expression is unclear. Here we find that stable ectopic expression of IFITM2 and to

360

some extent IFITM1 restricts both the entry of PLVs and the replication of the SARS-

361

CoV-2 virus itself in A549-ACE2 cells. The enhanced sensitivity of the PRRA mutant

362

of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 to IFITM2 is entirely consistent with their

363

dependence on low pH compartments for cathepsin cleavage. By restricting IFITM2

364

to the plasma membrane and outside of clathrin coated pits by abolishing AP2

365

interaction, we see similar enhancement effects to those seen by the Yount group

366

with IFITM3 (Shi et al., 2020). Why this happens is not known, but given the effects

367

that IFITMs have on membrane fluidity, this may be an indirect effect on the surface

368

levels and distribution of entry cofactors at the plasma membrane. It also suggests

369

why there may be an association of the rs12252-C polymorphism that expresses an

370

N-terminally truncated IFITM3 with COVID-19 severity (Gómez et al., 2021).

371

Restriction by IFITM2 but not IFITM3 is surprising. This would suggest that IFITM2

372

localization is not only limited to later endosomes than IFITM3, but may also reside

373

in distinct localizations at or near the plasma membrane dependent on its AP2-

374

binding site.

375

In addition to examining the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to individual IFITM

376

proteins, we also showed that IFITM2 knockdown is sufficient to alleviate much of

377

the antiviral effect of pretreating A549 cells with type I, but not type II IFN. Studies

378

from many groups have shown that while SARS-CoV-2 is a poor inducer of IFN-

379

responses in infected cells early in the replication cycle, it is highly sensitive to

380

pretreatment of target cells by both type I, II and III IFNs (Lokugamage et al., 2020;

381

Nchioua et al., 2020; Stanifer et al., 2020). This suggests the potential for multiple

382

ISGs to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication and has raised the possibility of IFNs as

383

possible treatments for COVID-19 (Haji Abdolvahab et al., 2020). The role of IFNs in

384

SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is complex. Genetic lesions in pattern-recognition and

385

IFN signaling as well as serum autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs are

386

associated with risk of severe COVID-19(Bastard et al., 2020). However,

387

dysregulated or delayed IFN responses driving systemic inflammation may underlie

388

some of the pathology in COVID-19 (Lucas et al., 2020). Understanding which

389

aspects of the IFN-response are antiviral against SARS CoV-2 is thus of very high

390

importance.

391

In A549-ACE2 cells, IFITM2 is more potently induced by IFNb than IFNg and

392

its knockdown substantially reduces the sensitivity of the virus to IFNb-induced

393

restriction. The sequence similarity between IFITM2 and IFITM3 means that it is

394

difficult to knockdown one without affecting the other. The lack of IFITM3 restriction

395

when expressed alone, and its potent expression after both IFNb and IFNg treatment

396

would argue against IFITM3 playing the major role. However, given that IFITMs can

397

interact with each other, we cannot rule out that IFITM1 or IFITM3 play a role in

398

potentiating IFITM2’s antiviral activity after IFN induction. The former is a distinct

399

possibility as IFITM2 knockdown fully rescues SARS-CoV-2 from IFNb treatment in

400

cells over-expressing TMPRSS2. Since we found that the minor restriction conferred

401

by IFITM1 alone is abolished by TMPRSS2 expression, a plausible explanation is

402

that more robust S2’ activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike at the cell surface overcomes

403

IFITM1inhibition by saturating its activity (Weston et al., 2016). While it is surprising

404

that IFNb has no effect in these cells when IFITM2 is knocked-down, we would

405

caution against interpreting that IFITM2 is the only ISG targeting SARS-CoV-2

406

replication. The rapidity and burst-size of SARS-CoV-2 replication in culture may

407

render other relevant antiviral proteins difficult to measure. Furthermore, the virus

408

encodes a number of antagonists of antiviral pathways (Xia et al., 2020). As shown

409

clearly by the IFNg phenotype, expression of other ISGs or their differential

410

regulation may make a give antiviral more less potent. Of note, the IFNg-mediated

411

inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 is in part mediated through the zinc-finger antiviral protein

412

(ZAP) (Nchioua et al., 2020).

413
414

Despite the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to IFITM2, deletion of the PRRA cleavage site

415

in spike substantially potentiates its antiviral activity. In most cells in culture

416

expressing low levels of TMPRSS2, furin cleavage is detrimental to entry, and in

417

A549 cells this can be rescued to the mutant levels of entry by ectopic expression of

418

TMPRSS2. In primary lung epithelial cells, however, the wildtype spike is clearly

419

superior and out competes the mutant as well as being more transmissible in ferret

420

models (Peacock et al., 2020) . Epithelial barrier tissues constitutively express a

421

level of ISGs through the tonic activity of type I IFNs (Broggi et al., 2020). Therefore,

422

it is tempting to speculate that the selection pressure for maintaining this attribute in

423

SARS-CoV-2 spike is in part to promote cell surface fusion in target cells that already

424

express IFITM2. Interestingly, Peacock et al have shown that an equivalent PRRA

425

mutant virus can be rescued in lung epithelial cells by the antifungal drug

426

amphotericin B, known to disrupt IFITM function (Peacock et al., 2020). Addition of a

427

partially active PRRA cleavage site is not sufficient to reduce the IFITM2 restriction

428

of SARS-CoV-1 S to that of SARS-CoV-2, and thus other determinants in spike are

429

likely to modulate sensitivity.

430

In sum we show that IFITM2 is a key antiviral protein targeting SARS-CoV-2

431

entry, and its activity is modulated by the furin-cleavage site in spike. These data

432

therefore suggest that therapeutic strategies which upregulate IFITM2 in epithelial

433

tissues or inhibit furin-mediated cleavage of spike may render the virus more

434

sensitive to innate-immune mediated control.

with different amounts of IFNb or IFNg for 18 hours. B, C) A549-ACE2s were

795

transfected with siRNAs against non-targeting control or IFITM2 and supernatants

796

used to infect Vero-E6 cells for 24 hours and stained for nucleocapsid protein. RU =

797

relative units. N=3, Mean±SEM. D) A549-ACE2 were pre-treated with IFNβ and IFNɣ

798

for 18 hours and infected with replication-competent SARS-COV-2. Infected

799

supernatant was used to infect Vero-E6 cells for 24 hours and cells stained for N

800

protein. N=3, Mean±SEM. F) IC50s of D) and E) were calculated in Prism. N=3,

801

Mean±SEM. G) A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 were transfected with siRNAs against non-

802

targeting control or IFITM2 when seeding and prior to IFN treatment. Cells were

803

treated with IFNβ and infected with replication competent SARS-COV-2 18 hours

804

later. Infected supernatant was used to infect Vero-E6 cells for 24 hours and cells

805

stained for N protein. N=3, RU = relative units. Mean±SEM.
