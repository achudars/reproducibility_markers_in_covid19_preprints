Abstract
Background
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the Family Coronaviridae, Genus
Betacoronavirus. In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) characterized by
severe respiratory symptoms was discovered. The causative pathogen was a novel coronavirus
known as 2019-nCoV and later as SARS-CoV-2. Within two months of its discovery, COVID-19
became a pandemic causing widespread morbidity and mortality.
Methodology
Whole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were
retrieved by downloading from GISAID database. A total of 18 sequences that satisfied quality
assurance (length > 29700 nts and number of unknown bases denoted as `N’ < 5%) were used for
the study. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was done in MAFFT (Version 7.471) while SNP

calling was implemented in DnaSP (Version 6.12.03) respectively and then visualized in Jalview
(Version 2.11.1.0). Phylogenetic analysis was with MEGA X software.
Results
Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% genomic similarity with four large conserved genomic regions.
A total of 66 SNPs were identified out of which 31 were informative. Nucleotide diversity
assessment gave Pi = 0.00048 and average SNP frequency of 2.22 SNPs per 1000 nts. Non-coding
genomic regions particularly 5’UTR and 3’UTR had a SNP density of 3.77 and 35.4 respectively.
The region with the highest SNP density was ORF10 with a frequency of 8.55 SNPs/1000 nts).
Majority (72.2%) of viruses in Nigeria are of L lineage with preponderance of D614G mutation
which accounted for 11 (61.1%) out of the 18 viral sequences. Nigeria SARS-CoV-2 revealed 3
major clades namely Oyo, Ekiti and Osun on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.
Conclusion and Recommendation
Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 reveals high mutation rate together with preponderance of L lineage and
D614G mutants. Implication of these mutations for SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the need for more
aggressive testing and treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria is discussed. Additionally, attempt to
produce testing kits for COVID-19 in Nigeria should consider the conserved regions identified in
this study. Strict adherence to COVID-19 preventive measure is recommended in view of Nigerian
SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clustering pattern, which suggests intensive community transmission
possibly rooted in communal culture characteristic of many ethnicities in Nigeria.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the Family Coronaviridae, Genus
Betacoronavirus [1, 2]. These viruses are of special interest because they possess the largest
genome among RNA viruses and also have the capability to infect a wide host range causing
intestinal and respiratory infections in animals and humans [3, 4]. In recent times, coronaviruses
have attracted renewed interest in view of a novel coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID19) that originated in Wuhan, China [5]. The causative agent was found to be a novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) that was identified in December, 2019. Barely two months after its discovery, had
the disease become a pandemic of global concern causing widespread morbidity and mortality [6,
7]. Because COVID-19 is a serious respiratory disease, the causative pathogen was later known as
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Before the origin of SARS-CoV-2, six coronaviruses were known to infect man [5, 8]. Out of
these, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused severe respiratory illness in humans [9, 10]. In 2002,
SARS-CoV, originating from Guangdong Province, Southern China, and MERS-CoV emerging
from Saudi Arabia caused serious epidemics in 2002/2003 and 2012 respectively [11, 12]. The
severity of the respiratory diseases occasioned by these viruses and the resulting wide spread
morbidity and mortality had been reported elsewhere [13].
Immediately after its identification, scientists in several laboratories swiftly sequenced SARSCoV-2 genome making the complete and partial sequences available in public databases. Within
few months, the number of viral genome entries in databanks grew exponentially, and this afforded
scientists unprecedented opportunity for undertaking molecular, phylogenetic and epidemiological
studies on SARS-CoV-2. It was re-established that coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 possess

the largest genome ranging from 26.4 to 31.7 kb among all RNA viruses [14, 15]. Like other
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). The first
two-third portion of the genome beginning from the 5’ end codes for a polyprotein pp1ab, whose
cleavage gave several non-structural proteins (nsps) that are mainly associated with genome
replication and transcription [15, 16]. On the remaining portion of coronavirus genome (i.e.
towards the 3’ end), there are four genes that encode viral structural proteins namely Spike, (S),
Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) necessary for viral infectivity and
transmissibility [17]. Out of these four structural genes, the S gene has attracted the greatest
attention because it encodes the spike protein which binds human angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE2) for viral attachment and entry into human cells. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly
optimized for binding to human ACE2 receptor using the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the
spike glycoprotein [18].
The first coronavirus genome sequence report in Africa was from a Nigerian index case who
travelled to the country from Italy in February, 2020 [19]. In early March, 2020, complete (29,798
nt) and partial (486 nt) genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 collected from the index case were
produced by Nigerian scientists at African Centre of Excellence for the Genomics of Infectious
Disease (ACEGID) at the Redeemers University of Nigeria (RUN), and the Centre for Virology

and Genomics at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Nigeria, respectively. The
partial and the complete sequences were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank (Accession No: MT159778) and the Global Initiative on Sharing
All Influenza Data (GISAID) databases (EPI_ISL_413550) respectively. At the time of writing
this paper on the 5th August, 2020, additional 41 complete SARS-CoV-2 Nigerian SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences have been added to GISAID by ACEGID to give a total of 42 complete

sequence records. Preliminary molecular and phylogenetic analyses gave a phylogenetic tree
where the Nigerian index case clustered with a European clade [19]. Subsequent analysis of 18
complete sequences suggested multiple introduction and community transfer in Nigeria [20].
These preliminary reports focused on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations without a
comprehensive molecular characterization in terms of number and distribution of SNPs, haplotype,
and conserved genomic regions of Nigerian SARS-CoV-2. We hereby present a report of a detailed
computational analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction of the Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 using
genome data deposited in GISAID database. The results of this study will aid the understanding
of variability and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome in Nigerian population bearing in mind that
such knowledge is crucial for efficient genetic testing, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of
COVID-19 interventions in Nigeria.
Materials and Methods
Data Retrieval
Whole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were
retrieved by downloading from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data)
database. A total of 43 sequences were deposited as at 18th July, 2020. Out of these, 42 sequences
were complete genome sequences when filtered out by selecting the ‘complete’ filter button in
GISAID database page implying that one sequence was partial. To ensure acceptable size and
quality of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence for the study, ‘high coverage’ filtering button was also
selected. This and quality check by visualization left us with 18 sequences that satisfied all the
selection criteria (Table 1). According to GISAID database, ‘complete’ genome sequences are
sequences with >29,000 nucleotides (nts) while ‘high coverage’ sequences are those with <1% Ns

and no insertions and deletions unless verified by the submitter. The sequences were retrieved by
downloading in FASTA file format from GISAID database for further analysis.
Sequence Homology and Mapping
To ensure true homology, non-biological differences (i.e. differences due to technical variations)
were removed from retrieved sequences. The sequences were aligned in MAFFT and trimmed at
the 5’ and 3’ ends in MEGA X to obtain homologous sequences of 29,787 nts each. Alignment
revealed that 49 nucleotides should be removed at the 5’ end while 67 nucleotides should be pruned
away at the 3’ end to obtain the 29,787 nts for each of the homologous sequences used for the
study. The trimmed sequences were mapped onto a reference genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2
retrieved by downloading from NCBI GenBank (Accession No: NC_045512.2) in order to
determine the location of sites on the sampled genome sequences [15]. The 5’ and the 3’ ends of
the aligned sequences are shown in Fig. 1.

implemented in MEGA X. The genomes were initially aligned with MAUVE to check for large
scale genomic changes including large deletions, gene inversion, and genome rearrangements.
Then, the sequences were re-aligned in MAFFT (Fig.1) to produce aligned sequences that were

fed into DnaSP for SNP and haplotype analysis and subsequently into Jalview 2.11.1.0 for
visualization and automatic determination of allelic frequency of SNPs.
Variation and SNP Analysis
Genomic locations of SNPs were determined relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
sequence obtained from NCBI GenBank (Accession No: NC 045512.2). A polymorphic site is
considered as a genomic location with the frequency of the second most frequent allele greater
than 1%; otherwise, they were referred to as monomorphic. Rare alleles are those with minor allele
frequency (MAF) less than 1%, and the viruses carrying them were rare variants. Detection of
SNPs, linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis was done in DnaSPv6.12.03 while SNP
distribution and density was obtained by a series of MS Excel formulae packaged by us.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree construction was implemented in MEGA X using
sequences that had been aligned by MAFFT employing Tamura-Nei evolutionary model under
assumption of uniform nucleotide substitution [21, 22]. The tree that had topology with superior
log likelihood value was selected from the initial trees by applying neighbor-joining (NJ) and bioNJ algorithm in a heuristic search. Analysis of the tree was based on topology and clustering
pattern analysis. Tree validation was by 100 bootstrap replicates [23].

Results of SNP Analysis
Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% genomic similarity with four large conserved genomic regions
(Region 1: 13020-14407, Region 2: 16742-18876, Region 3: 20375-21897, and Region 4: 2340725470). A total of 66 SNPs were identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes used for this study out
of which 31 were informative. All the SNPs were diallelic except a SNP located at 29791 nt which
was triallelic. The overall nucleotide diversity among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes analyzed was Pi
= 0.00048. The average frequency of SNPs on SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Nigeria was 2.22 SNPs
per 1000 nts (Table 2). The SNPs were not, however, evenly distributed in the entire genome:
highest SNP densities were observed in the 5’UTR and the 3’UTR regions with SNP frequency of
3.77 and 35.4 respectively. The coding regions with the highest SNP density was ORF10 (8.55
SNPs/1000 nts). No SNP was detected in ORFs 6, 7a, 7b and E gene.

Haplotype Analysis for Delineation of L and S Lineages
Linkage analysis involving pairwise comparison of SNPs showed that several SNPs are in 2locus linkage disequilibrium (LD) in SARS-CoV-2 genome with majority of the SNPs above the
significant (P<0.05) horizontal threshold line indicated in Fig. 2. The total number of significant
pairwise haplotypes detected by Fisher’s exact test was 108 out of which 12 were highly
significant (P<0.001) by Bonferoni procedure (Table 3). Two linked SNPs: a C/T SNP at
location 8782 nt in the orf1ab region and a T/C SNP at 28144 nt in ORF8 region identified by
Cui et al., [1] were absolutely linked in this study (Table 4). The frequency of CT haplotype (L

Results of D614G Mutation Analysis
Multiple sequence alignment of translated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene revealed a D/G amino
acid substitution at position 614 of the spike protein (Fig. 4). There was a preponderance of
D614G mutation because majority 11 (61.1%) of the analyzed genomic sequences of SARSCoV-2 had G at 614 position of spike protein as compared to 7 (39.9%) that had D at the site.

Discussion
In the present study, whole-genome sequence characterization and phylogenetic reconstruction
of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 subjects was carried out. Out of the 42
Nigerian complete genome sequences in GISAID database, only 18 fulfilled our selection criteria
for inclusion in the study. In view of the implications of quality of results for validity of results,
it was better, in our opinion, to use 18 sequences of acceptable quality rather than using 42
sequences where more than half of the sequences are of low or questionable quality.
Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% implying 0.01% dissimilarity in accordance with the global
trend [15, 16]. It was therefore not surprising that four large conserved genomic regions were
identified in this study. This observation supports the well-established view that the novel virus
has a recent origin estimated to be between 6th October and 11th December 2019 [24].
Furthermore, Nigeria has extended family and communal structure, which could favour
community transmission of the novel virus. Thus, Nigeria’s socio-cultural attributes may
contribute (at least in part) to the high degree of similarity and the ethnic based clustering pattern
on the phylogenetic tree obtained in this study. It will be of interest to carry out comparative
analysis of conserved regions involving genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in other parts of the world to
compare their tree topologies with that of Nigeria.
Despite the high degree of similarity, some degree of diversity resulting from SNPs found in
SARS-CoV-2 genome, was detected. The number of SNPs detected in this study was low when
compared with other studies [25]. A limitation of this study is the small sample size of eighteen
genome sequences used in this study, which we consider too small for detection of all SARSCoV-2 SNPs in Nigeria. In subsequent studies, it will be of interest to see if distribution of SNPs

and conserved regions identified in this study are peculiar to Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 or have
complete overlap with genomes of SARS-CoV-2 found elsewhere. If there are regions of nonoverlap, any attempt to produce testing kits with high sensitivity for Nigeria’s COVID-19 cases
should take note of the conserved regions and SNP distribution in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2
detected in this study.
The frequency of SNPs observed in the Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 genome is higher than twice the
frequency of SNPs in human genome which is generally taken to be 1 SNP per 1000 bps. The
UTRs, especially 3’UTR, are mutation hot spots in Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 genome. This is
expected because UTRs, unlike coding sequences, are generally under more relaxed or neutral
selection pressure which allow mutations to accumulate at a higher rate in that region [25].
Relatively high SNP densities were also recorded in some of the coding regions of Nigerian
SARS-CoV-2. An example is ORF 10 region with a SNP density of 8.55 SNPs/1000 nts.
Although coronaviridae have proofreading capability due to their exonuclease activity during
nucleotide replication, mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at ~6 × 10− 4
nucleotides/genome/year with the capacity to mutate during human-to-human transmission [24].
We share the view that characterizing organisms and viruses by haplotypes is more informative
than using individual SNPs. Such haplotype analysis gave results which agreed with an early
report by Cui et al., [1] who proposed two major lineages namely the L lineage carrying CT
haplotype at the closely linked positions C8782 and T28144 respectively and the S lineage with
nucleotides T and C (TC haplotype) at the corresponding genome locations. The higher
frequency of L lineage viruses which was higher than those of S lineage in this study is consistent
with the original finding by Cui et al., [1]. Few recombinants were observed in their study unlike
the present study where both loci were absolutely linked such that no recombinants were

recovered. According to Cui et al., [1], identification as L and S lineages was based on the amino
acids resulting from T28144C substitution in which leucine (L lineage) is replaced with serine
(S lineage).
Similar increased frequency of viruses in the L lineage as compared to those in the S lineage was
observed at 23403 nt position where A23403G nucleotide substitution caused D614G mutation
on SaRS-CoV-2 spike protein. Majority of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria were G614 (G type) mutants
as opposed to the D614 (D type) ancestral form in agreement with the global trend [26].
Preponderance of L and G variants in many populations was accounted for by their increased
Darwinian fitness whereby these newly evolved strains have competitive advantage over their
alternative and more ancestral forms in terms of infectivity, transmissibility and, possibly,
virulence. Others felt that the preponderance of the L and the G mutants might result from
sampling bias and founder effect [27].
Results of studies just concluded in the Center for Genomics Noncommunicable and
Personalized Healthcare (CGNPH) in the University of Lagos, Nigeria (not yet published),
suggested that SNPs and mutation pattern of SARS-CoV-2 vary between continents and, in some
cases, between different countries in the same continent. In view of the fact that testing kits are
generally nucleic acid based and the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to evade detection due to its
mutational dynamics, it is difficult or impossible to have universal testing kits with equal
efficiency for detecting the novel coronavirus in all parts of the world [28]. Therefore, the
identified conserved regions and the distribution of SNPs in the genome of SARS-CoV-2
circulating in Nigeria has implications for Nigeria-based intervention programmes in the area of
viral detection, drug designing and treatment options as had been generally noted by Vankadari
[29]. According to Puty et al., [28], it is important for every population to identify key SARS-

CoV-2 mutations and SNPs for appropriate population-based intervention specific for its
population. The view of Wang et al., [15] that limited sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection kits
is possibly associated with genetic variation of the virus is pertinent. Thus, any meaningful
intervention activity should consider SARS-CoV-2 strains in the concerned population.
