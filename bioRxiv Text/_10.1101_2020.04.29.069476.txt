Molecular mimicry of host proteins is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses
to evade immune surveillance and exploit host cell systems. We report that SARS-CoV-2
has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site (RRARSVAS), absent in any previous
coronavirus sequenced, that results in mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on
the human epithelial sodium channel α-subunit (ENaC-α). Genetic truncation at this ENaCα cleavage site causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting the functional
importance of the mimicked SARS-CoV-2 peptide. Single cell RNA-seq from 65 studies
shows significant overlap between the expression of ENaC-α and ACE2, the putative
receptor for the virus, in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary
pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular fingerprint with amino acid
cleavage signatures of 178 human proteases shows the potential for tissue-specific
proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. We extrapolate that the
evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global coronavirus pandemic may be in part due to its
targeted mimicry of human ENaC and hijack of the associated host proteolytic network.
The surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions is coated with the spike (S) glycoprotein, whose
proteolysis is key to the infection lifecycle. After the initial interaction of the S-protein with the
ACE2 receptor1, host cell entry is mediated by two key proteolytic steps. The S1 subunit of the Sprotein engages ACE2, and viral entry into the host cell is facilitated by proteases that catalyze
S1/S2 cleavage2,3 at Arginine-667/Serine-668 (Figure 1a). This is followed by S2’ site cleavage
that is required for fusion of viral-host cell membranes1.
We hypothesized that the virus may mimic host substrates in order to achieve proteolysis.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV shows that the former has acquired a distinctive
sequence insertion at the S1/S2 site (Figure 1a). The resulting tribasic 8-mer peptide
(RRARSVAS) on the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site is conserved among 10,956 of 10,967 circulating
strains deposited at GISAID4, as of April 28, 2020 (Table S1). This peptide is also absent in over
13,000 non-COVID-19 coronavirus S-proteins from the VIPR database5. Strikingly, examining
over 10 million peptides (8-mers) of 20,350 canonical human proteins from UniProtKB shows that
the peptide of interest (RRARSVAS) is present exclusively in human ENaC-ɑ, also known as
SCNN1A (p-value = 4E-4) (Supplementary Methods). The location of this SARS-CoV-2 mimicked
peptide in the ENaC-ɑ structure is in the extracellular domain (Figure 1b).
ENaC regulates Na+ and water homeostasis and its expression levels are controlled by
aldosterone and the associated Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)6. Similar to
SARS-CoV2, ENaC-ɑ needs to be proteolytically activated for its function7. FURIN cleaves the
equivalent peptide on mouse ENaC-ɑ between the Arginine and Serine residues in the 4th and 5th
positions respectively (RSAR|SASS)8,9, akin to the recent report establishing FURIN cleavage at
the S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1b)1. Furthermore, a frameshift mutation leading to a
premature stop codon in Serine-205 at the 5th position of the ENaC-ɑ mimicked peptide
(RRAR|SVAS) is known to cause the monogenic disease Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1
(PHA1)10. This emphasizes the functional salience of the 8-mer peptide being mimicked by SARSCoV-2.

Mimicry of human ENaC-ɑ by the S1/S2 site raises the specter that SARS-CoV-2 may be
hijacking the protease network of ENaC-ɑ for viral activation. We asked whether there is an
overlap between putative SARS-CoV-2 infecting cells and ENaC-ɑ expressing cells. Systematic
single cell expression profiling of the ACE2 receptor and ENaC-ɑ was performed across human
and mouse samples comprising ~1.3 million cells (Supplementary Methods, Figure 1c)11.
Interestingly, ENaC-ɑ is expressed in the nasal epithelial cells, type II alveolar cells of the lung,
tongue keratinocytes, and colon enterocytes (Figure 1c and Figures S1-S6), which are all
implicated in COVID-19 pathophysiology11,12. Further, ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ are known to be
expressed generally in the apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells13,14. The overlap of the
cell-types expressing ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ, and similar spatial distributions at the apical surfaces,
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be leveraging the protease network responsible for ENaC
cleavage.
Beyond FURIN that cleaves the S1/S2 site1, we were intrigued by the possibility of other
host proteases also being exploited by SARS-CoV-2. We created a 160-dimensional vector space
(20 amino acids x 8 positions on the peptide) for assessment of cleavage similarities between the
178 human proteases with biochemical validation from the MEROPS database (Supplementary
Methods; 0 < protease similarity metric < 1)15. This shows that FURIN (PCSK3) has overall
proteolytic similarity to select PCSK family members, specifically PCSK5 (0.99), PCSK7 (0.99),
PCSK6 (0.99), PCSK4 (0.98), and PCSK2 (0.94) (Table S2). It is also known that the protease
PLG cleaves the ɣ-subunit of ENaC (ENaC-ɣ)16.
In order to extrapolate the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 from the lens of the host
proteolytic network, we assessed the co-expression of these proteases concomitant with the viral
receptor ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ (Figure 2). This analysis shows that FURIN is expressed with ACE2
and ENaC-ɑ in the colon (immature enterocytes, transit amplifying cells) and pancreas (ductal
cells, acinar cells) of human tissues, as well as tongue (keratinocytes) of mouse tissues. PCSK5
and PCSK7 are broadly expressed across multiple cell types with ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ, making it
a plausible broad-spectrum protease that may cleave the S1/S2 site. In humans, concomitant with
ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ, PCSK6 appears to be expressed in cells from the intestines, pancreas, and
lungs, whereas PCSK2 is noted to be co-expressed in the respiratory tract and the pancreas
(Figure 2). It is worth noting that the extracellular proteases need not necessarily be expressed
in the same cells as ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ. Among the PCSK family members with the potential to
cleave the mimicked 8-mer peptide, it is intriguing that the same tissue can house multiple
proteases and also that multiple tissues do share the same set of proteases.
Our findings emphasize that redundancy may be wired into the mechanisms of host
proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2, and call for some caution in the ongoing development of
selective human protease inhibitors as COVID-19 therapeutics. The mimicry of a cleavable host
peptide central to cardiovascular, renal, and pulmonary function provides a new perspective to
the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as the first coronavirus pandemic.
