Abstract.
Memory B cells play a fundamental role in host defenses against viruses, but to date, their role
have been relatively unsettled in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We report here a longitudinal single-

cell and repertoire profiling of the B cell response up to 6 months in mild and severe COVID19 patients. Distinct SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific activated B cell clones fueled an early
antibody-secreting cell burst as well as a durable synchronous germinal center response. While
highly mutated memory B cells, including preexisting cross-reactive seasonal Betacoronavirusspecific clones, were recruited early in the response, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific
clones accumulated with time and largely contributed to the late remarkably stable memory Bcell pool. Highlighting germinal center maturation, these cells displayed clear accumulation of
somatic mutations in their variable region genes over time. Overall, these findings demonstrate
that an antigen-driven activation persisted and matured up to 6 months after SARS-CoV-2
infection and may provide long-term protection.

Introduction
The new emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected 55 million people and killed
over 1 million individuals worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic. Understanding the
mechanisms underlying the establishment of protective immune memory in recovering
individuals is a major concern for public health and for anticipating vaccination outcomes.
In response to viral infection, virus-specific T and B cells are activated, expand and
differentiate into effector cells (Wherry and Ahmed, 2004). At the early phase of COVID-19
infection, most infected individuals generate antibodies targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) and
the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, including spike receptor binding domain (RBD) specific
antibodies with strong neutralizing potential (Wajnberg et al., 2020). COVID-19 patients also
develop potent early CD8+ and CD4+ T cell specific responses (Braun et al., 2020; Ferretti et
al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020, 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020; Meckiff et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020;
Sekine et al., 2020; Swadling and Maini, 2020)
Studies have documented that B cells from patients with severe COVID-19 harbored
low mutations frequencies in their heavy-chain variable region (VH) genes, notably those
producing anti-RBD antibodies (Nielsen et al., 2020). This suggested an active early
extrafollicular response in which naïve unmutated B cells first engage in cognate interactions
with T cells and become fully activated to divide and differentiate into plasma cells (Jenks et
al., 2019). Along with limited somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection, cells derived from
extrafollicular responses are usually considered as short-lived (Mac Lennan et al., 2003).
Long-term humoral immunity following infection relies on two types of cells derived
from germinal center responses: long-lived plasma (LLPC), which continuously secrete
antibodies (Slifka et al., 1998) and memory B cells (MBCs), which can expand and differentiate
into antibody-secreting cells (ASC) upon a new antigenic challenge. MBCs can also adapt to
cope with antigenic changes linked to virus mutations, as exemplify by the coevolution of
neutralizing antibodies against mutating epitopes during HIV infection (Escolano et al., 2016;
Liao et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011). Assessing whether a MBC response, with the ability to
rapidly produce SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies upon a new infectious challenge months
or years after initial infection, is indeed established in convalescent COVID-19 patients is thus
of immediate relevance for ongoing modeling of herd immunity and the formulation of vaccine
strategies.

Serological studies have so far reported contradictory results on the persistence of
humoral immunity in asymptomatic, mild and severe patients (Iyer et al., 2020; Long et al.,
2020; Luchsinger et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020; Ripperger et al., 2020; Wajnberg et al., 2020;
Weisberg et al., 2020). Furthermore, although memory B cells have been observed up to 6
months after infection in an increasing number of recent publication (Chen et al., 2020; Gaebler
et al., 2020; Nguyen-Contant et al., 2020; Rodda et al., 2020; Vaisman-Mentesh et al., 2020), a
recent study suggested that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may blunt the germinal center (GC)
response and subsequently compromise the generation of long-lived, affinity-matured memory
B cells (Kaneko et al., 2020). In this context, analysis of the longevity and functionality of the
anti SARS-CoV-2 memory B cell response becomes a major issue.
In the present study, we present a longitudinal deep profiling of the anti-SARS-CoV-2
memory B cell response in two parallel cohorts of patients with severe (S-CoV) and mild (MCoV) COVID-19. We combined single cell transcriptomics, single cell culture and IgH VDJ
sequencing to track and characterize the cellular and molecular phenotype and clonal evolution
of spike-specific MBCs clones from early time points after SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 6
months after the initial symptoms. Our results provide new insights on the origin, magnitude
and stability of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 MBC response and revealed in most patients a robust
acquisition of GC-derived humoral immunity.

Investigating anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response in mild and severe COVID-19
patients.
To characterize the longitudinal evolution of the humoral response against SARS-CoV2, we set-up a prospective cohort of patients with severe (S-CoV, n=21) and mild forms of
COVID-19 (M-CoV, n=18) (MEMO-COV, NCT04402892, see Methods and Table
S1). Initial samples were collected from patients in median 18.2 days and 35.5 days after
disease onset for S-CoV and M-CoV respectively (M0). Two additional blood samples were
collected at 3 (M3), and 6 months (M6), at a stage when all patients had fully recovered. All
sera were first examined for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies against

the

immunodominant nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins using commercial ELISA. As
previously observed in other studies (Ripperger et al., 2020), N-specific IgG antibodies showed
a rapid decrease in both cohorts (Figure 1A). This decrease was particularly pronounced in MCoV patients, among which 9 out of 18 had titers below the threshold of positivity at 6 months
(Figure 1A, Table S1). In contrast, S-specific IgG antibodies appeared quite stable with time
and only two M-CoV patients showed anti-S antibodies titers below detection threshold at the
time of our last sampling (Figures 1B and 1C). Levels of S-specific IgG antibodies at 3 and 6
months, however, were significantly higher in patients who had developed a more severe form
of the disease (Figures 1B-1C). Elevated titers of anti-S IgG strongly correlated with enhanced
neutralization potential of patients’ sera in vitro (Figure 1D, Figures S1A and S1B),
confirming the spike trimetric glycoprotein as a primary target of the protective immune
response in patients.
To further track the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cell response, we next
implemented two complementary in-depth approaches on four S-CoV patients’ samples. First,
we generated His-tagged trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain and used successive staining
with His-tagged S and two fluorescently labeled anti-His antibodies to stain and perform high
purity single-cell sorting of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B cells (Figure 1E). Single B cells were
further cultured in an optimized in vitro culture assay (McCarthy et al., 2018) (Figure 1F).
After 21 days of culture, RNA was extracted from single-cell cultures to determine their
immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) sequence. Culture supernatants with IgG concentration over
1µg/ml were additionally tested by ELISA to validate the cell specificity towards SARS-CoV2 S (over 95 % purity in this assay (Figure 1G)), investigate its recognition of SARS-CoV-2S receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralization potential, and analyze potential crossreactivity to seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1/HCoV-OC43). In parallel, to get a broader

view of the overall B cell response towards SARS-CoV-2 at both early (M0) and late time
points (M6), we sorted CD19+IgD- B cells from the same patients (Figure S1C) and performed
scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics technology. This allowed us to couple both 5′ single-cell
RNA sequencing, V(D)J profiling and Feature Barcoding of 20 known B cell surface markers,
and we developed as well anti-His barcoded antibodies to reveal His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Sspecific B cells.
Spike-responding B cells harbor phenotypically and transcriptionally an activated
phenotype and a time-dependent maturation toward the memory B cell lineage.
Unsupervised clustering analysis of our scRNA-seq dataset revealed that CD19+IgD- B
cells could be divided in 5 major clusters according to their gene expression profile (Figure
2A-B and S2A-B), a clustering which correlated nicely with the expression of barcoded surface
markers included in our dataset (Figure 2C-D). Two of these clusters corresponded to antibodysecreting cells (ASCs), with both a short-lived plasmablasts cluster (PB), enriched for
expression of cell proliferation-related genes, and non-dividing plasma cells (PC). Both PB/PC
populations were strongly reduced by 6 months, confirming the resolution with time of the
primary extrafollicular response in these severe COVID-19 patients (Figures 2B). The
remaining B cells were separated in 3 populations: a mixture of naïve/transitional B cells, a
resting memory B cell population (MBCs) and a CD95+ activated cluster. This activated cluster
could be further subdivided in 3 distinct populations: CD21lowCD27+CD38+CD71+ activated B
cells (ABC), CD21lowCD27lowCD38-CD71lowCD11c+FcRL5+ cells, likely corresponding to
atypical memory and/or double-negative 2 population (DN2) (Sanz et al., 2019) and
CD21+CD27int/+CD38-CD71lowCD95+ cells corresponding to a cluster with intermediate
characteristics between ABC and memory B cells (Figures 2C-D and S2A-B). The contraction
of the primary response, clearly observed for ASCs, could also be seen for ABCs, with a parallel
increase in resting MBCs. All other clusters remained stable.
To gain insight into the specificity of this B cell response and the clonal relationship
between the different B cell clusters, we first used the initial burst of ASCs seen at M0 as a
proxy for the overall SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell response. Investigating the top 10% ASC
clones at M0 for each patient in our dataset revealed a strong link between the ABC cluster and
the ASC population (Figures 2E-F and S2C-D). The bimodal distribution of somatic
hypermutation (SHM) seen in ASCs further suggests the existence of a strong extra-follicular
reaction recruiting newly engaged naïve and memory B cells, which fuels the primary response
towards SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2G). In line with the resolution of the immune response, most

of these clones were no longer present in ASCs six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with
only few cells, clonally-related to the original ASC burst, still detectable in residual PC, while
they were increased in the resting MBC compartment by that time (Figures 2E and 2F, S2C
and S2D). Parallel analysis of barcoded-spike reads in our dataset allowed us to identify clear
populations of Spike-specific ABCs and ASCs at M0, mirroring - yet showing limited
overlapping with - the bulk of the ASC primary response. By 6 months, spike-specific cells
mainly localized in the resting MBC cluster and showed significant expansion with still very
limited relationship with the original ASC response, suggesting two distinct, albeit synchronous
responses in COVID-19 patients.
Spike-specific memory B cells mature from ABCs and accumulate up to 6 months posinfection in COVID-19 patients.
To further analyze the dynamics of the overall and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B cell
response at the level of our entire cohort, we next performed multi-parametric FACS analysis
using a flow panel which included 7 surface markers identified in our scRNA-seq dataset as
sufficient to clearly delineate all major B cell and ASC subsets involved in the initial response
(CD19, CD21, CD27, CD38, CD71, CD11c, IgD, as well as His-tagged trimeric S protein).
Unsupervised analysis of CD19+IgD- switched B cell populations (Figures S3A-C),
concatenated from 83 samples collected at M0, M3 and M6 from patients in our cohort,
confirmed our initial observation that Spike-specific B cells were enriched in a cluster of
CD27+CD38int/+CD71+ ABCs and in ASCs at M0 (Figures 3 A-C). The enrichment in ASCs
was most prominent in severe COVID-19 patients and is in line with the strong ASC burst seen
in these patients (Figures S3 A-C). Spike-specific ASCs were marginally detectable at 6
months, at which time point Spike-specific B cells mostly resided in the CD21+CD27+CD38CD71int/- resting memory B cell compartment in both severe and mild COVID-19 convalescent
patients. Of note, some spike-specific cells were still found in the CD71+ ABC cluster at M6 in
both groups of patients but were much less frequent in the DN2/atypical compartment (Figure
3C).
Based on these results, and using a more traditional gating strategy, we next focused our
analysis on the switched CD27+IgD-CD38int/- memory B cell compartment, which includes both
ABCs and resting memory B cells (Figure S1C). In contrast to the rapid disappearance of spikespecific ASCs, both the percentage and absolute number of spike-specific CD27+IgD- B cells
appeared stable up to 6 months in the vast majority of patients in our cohort, and even
continuously increased up to that time point in a subset of the convalescent S-CoV patients

(Figures 3D-E and S3D and S3D). Of note, and as previously mentioned, the double-negative
population contained few spike-specific cells (Figures S3F and S3G). Convalescent S-CoV
patients showed significantly higher frequencies of spike-specific MBCs at the 6-month time
point of our study. Most M-CoV patients, however, still harbored a sizeable population of spikespecific memory B cells at 6 months post-infection (mean 0.94% ±0.17 of MBCs) and only one
(M-CoV24) out of the 16 M-CoV patients analyzed at 6 months in our study showed a
frequency of spike-specific switched CD27+ memory B cells below that of pre-pandemic
healthy donors. Even more striking is that both M-CoV patients whose serum levels of Sspecific IgG had drop below detectable levels by 6 months (correlating with an absence of in
vitro neutralizating potential) still harboured a clear population of spike-specific MBCs at that
time point (0.41 and 0.60% of MBCs, respectively). Altogether, these results demonstrate the
induction of a robust and stable spike-specific MBC population in both mild and severe
COVID-19 patients. Aside from severity, none of the clinical parameters or treatment that we
could monitor, notably corticosteroids, appeared to have any clear influence on the long-term
establishment of these spike-specific MBCs (Figures S3J-N).
To ensure that such stable levels of spike-specific CD27+ switched-memory B cells did
not simply reflect a sustained immune response in these convalescent COVID-19 patients, we
further used CD19 and CD71 to separate ABCs (CD19highCD71+) and resting MBCs
(CD19+CD71low) among spike-specific cells over time, as previously described (Ellebedy et al.,
2016). Confirming our initial observation in the 4 S-CoV patients included in the scRNAseq
dataset (Figure 2E) and the clear enrichment of spike-specific B cells in cluster 3 of our
unsupervised FACS analysis (Figures 3A-C), the majority of spike-specific memory B cells
displayed a CD19highCD71+ ABC phenotype in the days following infection (Figure 3F). In
both S-CoV and M-CoV, the proportion of spike-specific ABCs steadily decreased over time,
along with an increase of spike-specific classical, resting MBCs (Figures 3 G and 3H).
Interestingly, ABCs were still detectable in both cohorts at 6 months (approximately 20% in
both cohorts), suggesting continued antigen-driven activation, as has been described after Ebola
infection (Davis et al., 2019a). In S-CoV patients, a small fraction of these early responding
MBCs expressed the transcription factor T-bet, but such expression appeared only transient
(Figure S3H). More interestingly, we noted a significantly higher frequency of ABCs among
spike-specific MBCs in S-CoV as compared to M-CoV patients, as well as large inter-patients
variability for this parameter in both group (Figure 3 G). This heterogeneity could not be
simply explained by inter-patient variations in the time of initial sampling. However, the

proportion of spike-specific ABCs at M0 correlated significantly with the proportion of spikespecific MBCs at 6 months (Figure 3I). Overall, these results suggest a potential link between
early activated B cells and memory B cells established at later time points in the response. They
also highlight the presence of CD19highCD71+ early ABCs as a potential marker to predict the
magnitude of classical, possibly long-term memory against SARS-CoV-2.
Acquisition of somatic hypermutations in RBD-specific IgVH genes of MBCs.
In order to better understand the origin, fine specificity and developmental pathways
involved in the generation of memory B cells against SARS-CoV-2, we next performed single
cell sorting and culture of spike-specific memory B cells at 3 and 6 months post-infection in all
4 donors previously analyzed in the context of our scRNA-seq experiment (Figure 1E). A total
of 2412 cells at M3 and 2423 cells M6 from the 4 donors were sorted (Table S2), and 488 and
1027 supernatants (respectively at M3 and M6) post single-cell culture were tested for
specificity against SARS-CoV-2 S protein as well as Spike protein from two other related
seasonal Betacoronavirus (HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43) (Huang et al., 2020), and against
the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein which is the main target of neutralizing
antibodies in COVID-19 patients. We found that a sizeable proportion of SARS-CoV-2 spikespecific memory B cells also recognized the spike protein of H-CoV-HKU1 and H-CoV-OC43,
with many of these cells recognizing both, as previously reported (Shrock et al., 2020, Wec et
al., 2020). The proportion of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 specific MBCs clones, however,
readily decreased between M3 and M6 (12.4%±4.9 to 4.8%±1.7 respectively), suggesting that
these specificities, while actively participating in the early response, are not preferentially
recruited in the later memory B cell compartment. In contrast, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2
RBD-specific MBCs clones clearly increased between the M3 and M6 time points in all donors
(11.1%±2.1 and 26.3%±5.1 respectively). (Figures 4A and 4B, Figure S4A and S4B). SARSCoV-2 RBD-specific clones were mostly sorted from resting CD71- CD27+ switched memory
B cells at these late time points (Figures S4C and S4D) and were detectable within the same
proportion in M-CoV and S-Cov patients at 6 months (Figure 4B). Finally, only a minority of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones cross-reacted with HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 spike
protein, as anticipated by the low similarity of the RBD domain between these different viruses
(Figures S4A and S4B). Overall, these results suggested an early and rapid recruitment of
cross-reactive memory B cells through the extra-follicular pathway, in parallel with the
establishment of a new immune response against epitopes unique to SARS-CoV-2, with a
delayed and progressive output of memory B cells.

To evaluate whether such memory B cell output corresponds to an ongoing GC
response, we next evaluated the occurrence and evolution of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in
spike-specific MBCs. Heavy chain VH sequencing from spike or SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific
wells (Table S2) in our in vitro culture assay, at both M3 and M6 (Figure S4E), allowed us to
identify clonal relationships with sequences obtained in our scRNA-seq dataset at both M0 and
M6. Mutations in VH sequences of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific clones at M0 displayed a bimodal
distribution with both near germline and highly mutated sequences. In line with an initial
recruitment of cross-reactive memory B cells into the anti-SARS-CoV-2 early humoral
response, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 specific clones contained sequences that were
already highly mutated at M0 (Figure 4C). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones
displayed low SHM in VH sequences, as previously described in numerous studies during the
early stages of this pandemic (Brouwer et al., 2020; Kreer et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Robbiani
et al., 2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wec et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020). Both
early SARS-CoV-2 S-specific and RBD-specific IgH sequences showed high level of
convergence between donors in our dataset, but also with published SARS-CoV-2 spike- and
RBD-specific antibody sequences (43/874 sequences in clonal relationship with cells from our
dataset) (Figure S4F). Although near germline sequences were initially present in spikespecific clones, and even predominated in those with SARS-CoV-2 RBD specificity in both our
M0 dataset and in the literature, longitudinal tracking of clonal relationships at 3 and 6 months
revealed a progressive acquisition of SHM in VH sequences over time (Figures 4D and 4E and
S4G-H). Most importantly, over 70% of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific culture supernatants at
M6 showed intermediate to strong neutralizing potential against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in both
S-CoV and M-CoV patients (Figure 4F). Progressive accumulation of SHM in VH sequences
was not associated with a loss of neutralization potential (Figure 4H). In contrast, a strong
neutralizing capacity was identified along lineage trees including previously described near
germline anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies and the mutated versions that we identified at M6
in this work. (Figures 4G and S4I). Dynamics of such clones and emergence of highly mutated
neutralizing sequences, along with the robustness of the memory response observed in S-CoV
and M-CoV patients, demonstrate that MBCs bearing unique specificities and neutralizing
potential against SARS-CoV-2 can expand and mature over time through an ongoing germinal
center response.

Discussion
The long-term stability of humoral immune memory following viral infection is
provided by separate pools of protective long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and memory B cells
that can last for a lifetime (Amanna et al., 2007). Upon re-infection, long-lived memory B cells
generate a new wave of short-lived plasma cells and LLPC, while preserving the pool of
memory B cells. In this study, we focused on SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with mild or severe
disease and investigated the establishment of humoral memory and how this memory relates to
the primary B cell response that emerges at the early stage of infection.
Experimental infections of volunteers with Betacoronaviruses responsible for common
colds and longitudinal serological studies have suggested the absence of durable immunity
against these seasonal infections (Sariol and Perlman, 2020). Furthermore, early reports have
shown potentially defective GC formation in severe COVID-19 patients in intensive care unit
(Kaneko et al., 2020) and predominantly near-germline anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies (Ju et al., 2020; Nielsen et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020). Such observations
suggested a strong bias of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response toward the extrafollicular
pathway in these patients, which may preclude the formation of a long-term memory.
Our study demonstrate, in contrast, a remarkable stability of the overall spike-specific
memory B cells population up to 6 months after infection, and even its expansion in severe
patients, extending recent observations on memory persistence in COVID-19 (Gaebler et al.,
2020). Tracking of spike-specific B cells provided a more complex picture than previously
anticipated, characterized by two synchronous responses with distinct dynamics throughout the
extra-follicular reaction. Indeed, near germline B cell clones recognizing the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein were mobilized, but also pre-existing highly mutated MBCs specific for the spike
protein of other seasonal Betacoronaviruses.
The longitudinal VDJ sequencing of spike-specific MBCs revealed that neutralizing
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones, including convergent antibody rearrangements across
donors, accumulated with time and acquired somatic mutations in their variable region genes,
the hallmark of a GC-dependent immune response. Such GC imprinting is of major importance
because it usually predicts the generation of long-lived memory B cells (Mesin et al., 2016).
Along this line, a recent report observed the presence of viral proteins in the intestine of patients
several months after the initial diagnostic, which could sustain such B cell response (Gaebler et
al., 2020).

Cross-reactivity against the spike domain of betacoronaviruses has been already
documented in serological studies showing reactivity to conserved regions of the spike protein
(Aydillo et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), by the presence of preexisting antibodies recognizing
conserved epitopes in the S2 protein of SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals (Ng et al., 2020)
and cross-reactivity of sorted spike-specific B cells with seasonal coronavirus (Song et al.,
2020; Wec et al., 2020). Such cross-reactivity also exists for T-cells (Braun et al., 2020; Grifoni
et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020), but its protective potential remains debated (Ng et al., 2020;
Sermet et al., 2020). The proportion of cross-reactive clones, however, decreased from 3 to 6
months, suggesting that, after an initial activation, these clones were not positively selected in
the memory pool.
As observed previously by others for antibody titers (Ripperger et al., 2020), the overall
strength and stability of the memory B cell response was positively correlated with the initial
severity of COVID-19-associated pathologies in convalescent patients. Interestingly, the
memory response appeared also linked to the magnitude of the initial SARS-CoV-2 S-specific
ABC response. Activated B cells in COVID-19 patients have been previously reported with
various phenotypes (Juno et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Oliviero et al., 2020; Woodruff et
al., 2020), including a double-negative CD11c-positive population (DN2). One study has also
suggested the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific DN2 cells as a correlate of critical illness
(Kaneko et al., 2020). We found here, that most spike-responding B cells harbored an activated
phenotype that notably differed from DN2 but was similar to the one described after Ebola or
Influenza virus infection (Ellebedy et al., 2016). These SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific ABCs were
in clonal relationship with expanded cells from the initial burst of antibody-secreting cells, but
also with resting memory B cells that persisted at 6 months. Given the limited clonal overlap
between the early ASC burst and the later mutated memory B cell response, it is tempting to
suggest that a distinct part of ABCs is dedicated to fueling the GC response in these patients,
while another part contribute to the ASC burst. Of note, the ABC population remains detectable
up to 6 months post infection in convalescent patients, with some, albeit few spike-specific
cells, suggesting, as described for Ebola (Davis et al., 2019), an antigen-driven activation that
persisted for months after infection.
Collectively, taking into account this report and previous studies, the COVID-19
infection seems in most non-critical cases to induce both an immediate protective antibody
response together with the ongoing maturation of memory B cells, which should give rise to
neutralizing antibody-secreting cells upon reinfection. While this overall picture is positive,

notably in the context of vaccine campaigns to come, the long-term duration of the protective
memory B cell response remains an open question.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Study participants.
In total 50 patients with COVID-19 were recruited. We included 21 COVID-19 patients
requiring oxygen (S-CoV) and 18 healthcare workers, with a mild COVID-19 (M-CoV).
SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as confirmed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal swab or clinical presentation associated with typical aspect on CTscan and/or serological evidence. Samples were collected in mean 18.8 (±SD: 8.8 days) days
after disease onset in S-CoV, and in mean 35.5 days (± SD: 12.8 days) for M-CoV. Samples
were additionally collected 3 months (mean ±SD: 89.8 ± 15.8 days for S-CoV and 94.2 ± 8.2
for M-CoV), and 6 months (mean ± SD: 170.5 ± 12.9 days for S-CoV and 184.6 ± 10.2 for MCoV) after onset. Clinical and biological characteristics of these patients are summarized in
Table S1. Patients were recruited at Henri Mondor University Hospital (AP-HP), between
March and May 2020. Samples from healthy donors were obtained at EFS Henri-Mondor and
frozen before 2019. MEMO-COV-2 study (NCT04402892) was approved by the ethical
committee Ile-de-France VI (Number: 40-20 HPS), and was performed in accordance with the
French law. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants.

METHOD DETAILS
SARS-CoV-2 viral detection by RT-PCR
Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in transport media and plasma samples were held at 4 °C (or -80°C
if > 12h) prior to testing on the Alinity M SARS CoV-2 Amp kit and/or Cepheid Xpert Xpress
SARS-CoV-2 kit. The GeneXpert ®Dx System (Cepheid) and Alinity M (Abbott) perform
automated specimen processing and real-time RT-PCR analysis. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress
SARS-CoV-2 kit detects N and E genes of the SARS CoV-2 genome; Alinity M SARS CoV-2
Amp kit detects RdRp and N genes.
Anti-S and anti-N commercial assays
Serological assays were performed for IgG anti-N, IgG anti-S and total antibodies (ab) anti-S
detection. Serum samples were processed for anti-Nucloprotein (N) detection on Abbott SARSCoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Serum samples were further analyzed using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Products, for IgG Anti-Spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 detection and for total Ab anti-spike (S)
detection (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics). All assays were performed by trained laboratory
technicians according to the respective manufacturer's standard procedures. Qualitative results
and index values reported by the instruments were used in analysis.
Recombinant proteins purification
Construct design
The human coronavirus Spike (S) proteins were expressed as ectodomains that were stabilized
to preserve their trimeric prefusion conformation. The SARS-CoV-2 S (residues 1-1208) was
stabilized by introducing six proline substitutions (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P, K986P,
V987P), a GSAS substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685) and a C-terminal
Foldon trimerization motif (Hsieh et al., 2020), followed by Hisx8 and Strep tags. This construct
was cloned using its endogenous signal peptide in pcDNA3.1(+). The OC43 S ectodomain
(residues 15-1263) was cloned in the pCAGGS vector with a CD5 N-terminal signal peptide
and a C-terminal GCN4 trimerization motif, a thrombin cleavage site and a single Strep-tag.
Additionally, it contains mutations to abolish the furin cleavage (754-RRSRG-758 to 754GGSGG-758) at the S1-S2 junction (Tortorici et al., 2019). The HKU1-CoV S protein (residues
14-1276) was stabilized by a double-proline mutation (N1067P, L1068P), the substitution of
the RRSRG motif by GGSGG (residues 754-758) to avoid a potential S1/S2 furin cleavage, and

a C-terminal Foldon motif. This construct was cloned in pcDNA3.1(+) with an IgK signal
peptide and a thrombin cleavage site at the C-terminus that was followed by a Hisx8 tag.
The SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) was cloned in pcDNA3.1(+)
encompassing residues 331-528 from the Spike ectodomain, and it was flanked by an Nterminal IgK signal peptide and a C-terminal Thrombin cleavage site followed by a Hisx8-tag.

Protein expression and purification
The plasmids coding for the recombinant proteins were transiently transfected in Expi293FTM
cells (Thermo Fischer) using FectroPRO DNA transfection reagent (Polyplus), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were incubated at 37 C for 5 days and then the
culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was concentrated. The proteins were purified from
the supernatant by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The first purification step
was performed using StrepTactin columns (IBA) (SARS-Cov-2 S, OC43 S) or His-TrapTM
Excel columns (GE Healthcare) (HKU1 S, SARS-Cov-2 RBD). The different S ectodomains
were further purified using a Superose6 10/300 colum (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS,
while a Superdex200 10/300 column was used for the SARS-Cov-2 RBD.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
PBMCs were isolated from venous blood samples via standard density gradient centrifugation
and used after cryopreservation at -150°C. Cells were thawed using RPMI-1640 (Gibco) 10%
FBS, washed twice and incubated with 10µg of the SARS-CoV-2 his tagged spike protein in
100µL of PBS (Gibco) 2% FBS during 20 minutes on ice. Cells were washed and resuspended
in the same conditions, then fluorochrome-conjugated antibody cocktail including the 2 antiHis was added at pre-titrated concentrations for 20 min at 4°C and viable cells were identified
using a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) incubated
with conjugated antibodies (see Table S3). If a permeabilization was needed (T-Bet staining),
cells were washed and resuspended in 250µL of Fix/perm (eBioscience) for 25 minutes, then
washed with appropriate buffer before adding the conjugated antibody on the cell pellet for a
further 25 minutes at 4°C. Samples were acquired using a LSR Fortessa SORP (BD
Biosciences). For cell sorting, cells were stained using the same protocol then sorted in 96 plates
using an ultra-purity mode on a MA900 cell sorter (SONY), or Aria III (BD Biosciences). Data
were analyzed with FlowJo or Kaluza softwares. Detailed gating strategies for individual
markers are depicted in Figure S1.

For UMAP generation and visualization (Figure 3A-C), data from all 83 samples from patient
with complete panel acquisition at M0, M3 and M6 (Table S1) in our dataset were individually
down-sampled to 3000 cells each using the Downsample (v3.3) plugin in FlowJO. All samples
were subsequently concatenated and FlowJO’s UMAP (v3.1) plugin was used to calculate the
UMAP coordinates for the resulting 249,000 cells (with 30 neighbors, metric = euclidian and
minimum distance = 0.5 as default parameters). FlowSOM plugin was used in parallel on the
same downsampled dataset to create a self-organizing map (using n = 9 clusters as default
parameter) that was then applied to the initial FCS files from all 83 samples to calculate total
and spike-specific memory B cell repartition in identified clusters. Both UMAP and FlowSOM
plugin were runned taking into account fluorescent intensities from the following parameters:
FSC-A, SSC-A, CD19, CD21, CD11c, CD71, CD38, CD27 and IgD. Contour plots (equal
probability contouring, log scale) for each identified cluster representing more than 5% of the
total cells in the dataset were further overlaid in FlowJO for visualization purposes.
Single-cell culture.
Single cell culture was performed as previously described (Crickx et al., 2019). Single B cells
were sorted in 96-well plates containing MS40 cells expressing CD40L (kind gift from G.
Kelsoe). Cells were cocultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 during 21 or 25 days in RPMI-1640
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% HyClone FBS (Thermo Scientific), 55 µM 2mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 ug/mL
streptomycin, and MEM non-essential amino acids (all Invitrogen), with the addition of
recombinant human BAFF (10 ng/ml), IL2 (50 ng/ml), IL4 (10 ng/ml), and IL21 (10 ng/ml; all
Peprotech). Part of the supernatant was carefully removed at days 4, 8,12, 15 and 18 and the
same amount of fresh medium with cytokines was added to the cultures. After 21 days of single
cell culture, supernatants were harvested and stored at -20°C. Cell pellets were placed on ice
and gently washed with PBS (Gibco) before being resuspended in 50µL of RLT buffer (Qiagen)
supplemented with 10% beta-mercaptoethanol and subsequently stored at -80°C until further
processing.
ELISA
IgG and SARS-CoV 2, HKU1-CoV and OC43-CoV spike-specific IgG from culture
supernatants were detected by home-made ELISA. Briefly, 96 well ELISA plates (Thermo
Fisher) were coated with either goat anti-human Ig (10μg/ml, Invitrogen) or recombinant
SARS-CoV-2, HKU1 or OC43 spike or SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (2.5µg/ml each) in sodium
carbonate during 1h at 37°C. After plate blocking, cell culture supernatants were added for 1h,

then ELISA were developed using HRP-goat antihuman IgG (1μg/ml, Immunotech) and TMB
substrate (Eurobio). OD450 and OD620 were measured and Ab-reactivity was calculated after
subtraction of blank wells. Supernatants whose ratio of OD450-OD620 over control (i.e. non
spike specific supernatant from the same single cell culture assay) was over 3 were considered
as positive for RBD ELISA. A cut-off at a ratio of 5 was chosen for HKU1 and OC43 ELISA.
Single-cell IgH sequencing.
Clones whose culture had proved successful (IgG concentration ≥ 1µg/mL at day 21-25) were
selected and extracted using the NucleoSpin96 RNA extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. A reverse transcription step was then performed
using the SuperScript IV enzyme (ThermoFisher) in a 14 μl final volume (42°C 10min, 25°C
10min, 50°C 60min, 94°C 5min) with 4 µl of RNA and random hexamers (GE Healthcare). A
PCR was further performed based on the protocol established by Tiller et al (Tiller et al., 2008).
Briefly, 3.5 μl of cDNA was used as template and amplified in a total volume of 40 μl with a
mix of forward L-VH primers (Table S3) and reverse Cγ primer and using the HotStar® Taq
DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and 50 cycles of PCR (94°C 30s, 58°C 30s, 72°C 60s). PCR
products were sequenced with the reverse primer CHG-D1 and read on ABI PRISM 3130XL
genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence quality was verified with the CodonCode
Aligner software (CodonCode Corporation) and data were analyzed with the IMGT/HighVQUEST web portal (from The International Immunogenetics Information System) or in parallel
with the VDJ sequences generated as part of our scRNA-seq dataset (see below).
Oligonucleotide conjugation of anti-His antibody.
Unconjugated anti-His antibodies were purchased at Biolegend and custom oligonucleotides
were ordered at Integrated DNA Technologies, following the 10Xgenomics protocol available
at

Single-cell RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing.
Peripheral (CD3-CD14-CD15-CD56-CD19+IgD-) B cells were FACS-sorted (MA900, Sony) in
PBS/0.08% FCS from 4 patients (S-CoV) at baseline (M0) and 6 months (M6). 5x104 to 10x105
cells were obtained for each subset. The scRNA-seq libraries were generated using Chromium
Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kit v.1.1 with Feature Barcoding (10x Genomics)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression (mRNA), ADT and VDJ BCR
libraries were constructed. Briefly, cells were counted and up to 20 000 cells were loaded in the
10x Chromium Controller to generate single-cell gel-beads in emulsion. After reverse
transcription, gel-beads in emulsion were disrupted. Barcoded complementary DNA was
isolated and amplified by PCR. Following fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing, sample
indexes were added during index PCR. The purified libraries were sequenced on a Novaseq S2
flowcell (Illumina) with 26 cycles of read 1, 8 cycles of i7 index and 91 cycles of read 2,
targeting a median depth of 50000 reads per cell for gene expression and 5000 reads per cell
for each other two libraries (BCR VDJ and ADT Feature barcoding).
Single-cell gene expression analysis:
Paired-end FASTQ reads for all three libraries were demultiplexed and aligned against the
GRCh38 human reference genome (GENCODE v32/Ensembl 98; July 2020) using 10x
Genomics’ Cell Ranger v4.0.0 pipeline. Outputs of Cell Ranger were directly loaded into Seurat
v3.2.2 (Stuart et al., 2019) for further QC steps and analysis. Following manual inspection of
cell quality, only genes detected in at least 10 cells and cells with more than 500 unique genes
detected and less than 25% of UMI counts mapped to mitochondrial genes were kept. Reads
mapping to the immunoglobulin genes locus were further stored in a separate assay at this step
to avoid unwanted clustering based solely on differential isotype expression and cells with
exactly one heavy chain sequence were retained for final analysis. UMI counts were then lognormalized.

The

genes

were

identified

using

the

FindVariableFeatures() function in Seurat and the default vst method. Normalized counts were
then scale end centered using the ScaleData() function, removing unwanted variation related to
the percentage of mitochondrial UMI counts at that step. After principal component analysis,
potential donor and sort-specific batch effects were removed using the Harmony algorithm
(Korsunsky et al., 2019). The first 30 corrected PCA dimensions were then used to construct a
knn graph (k=20 neighbors) and perform graph-based clustering (Louvain) with a resolution
parameter of 0.2 as well as compute the UMAP coordinates for each cell. Further separation of
the “Activated” cell cluster was performed using a resolution parameter of 0.4. Two small

clusters with T (0.2%) and monocyte (0.1%) signatures were removed from further analysis as
clear doublets, as well as a separate cluster of apoptotic cells (2.1% of all cells), grouped solely
based on high percentages of mitochondrial UMI count.
Computational analyses of VDJ sequences:
Processed FASTA sequences from cultured single-cell heavy chain sequencing, 10x single-cell
RNA sequencing and 874 published SARS-CoV-2 RBD and/or S-specific antibodies (Brouwer
et al., 2020; Kreer et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Shi
et al., 2020; Wec et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020) were annotated using Igblast v1.16.0 against
the human IMGT reference database. Non-productively rearranged sequences were removed at
that step as well as sequences from cells that did not pass the initial QC cut-offs from our
scRNA-seq analysis. Cases of 10x barcodes with two or more consensus heavy chain sequences
for which more than ten UMI were detected were generally flagged as potential doublets for
removal from our scRNA-seq analysis. Similarly, cases where no clear heavy chains could be
attributed (none above 10 UMIs) were also flagged for removal. Two exceptions were made:
1/ in cases of identical CDR3s but differing isotypes (c_call), in which case the isotype switched
sequence was kept and UMI counts from both contigs were aggregated; and 2/ in cases when
one the heavy chains was clearly over represented at the UMI level and the second most
represented sequences did not exceed ten UMIs, in which case the most represented sequence
was kept.
Clonal

assignment

(DefineClones.py)

and

germline

reconstruction

(CreateGermlines.py) was performed using the Immcantation/Change-O toolkit (Gupta et al.,
2015) on all heavy chain V sequences. Sequences that had the same V-gene, same J-gene,
including ambiguous assignments, and same CDR3 length with maximal length normalized
nucleotide hamming distance of 0.15 were considered as potentially belonging to the same
clonal group. Mutation frequencies in V genes were then calculated using the
calcObservedMutations() function from Immcantation/SHazaM v1.0.2 R package. For the
analysis of the initial ASC response in our 10x dataset (Figure 2E/F), clonal assignments were
further corrected using available light chain information (light_cluster.py script from
Immcantation). All SARS-CoV-2 S-specific clones described in Figure 4 were manually
curated based on available light chain information (10x and published antibodies only) and
CDR3 sequences. Further clonal analysis were implemented in R. Based on final clonal
affectation, clones were defined as SARS-CoV-2 S specific if they contained 1 or more
validated single-cell culture sequence or if more than ten percent of the cells from that clone

were positively stained by our barcoded His-tagged S protein in our scRNAseq dataset. Clones
were defined as SARS-CoV-2 RBD or HKU1/OC43 S-specific if they contained 1 or more
validated single-cell culture sequence with a positive ELISA against one of these proteins.
Graphics were obtained using the ggplot2 v3.3.2 and circlize v0.4.10 packages. Phylogenetic
trees were generated using the Immcantation/IgPhyML toolkit (Immcantation/suite v4.0.0
docker image) and further visualize in R using the Alakazam v1.0.2 and igraph v1.2.6 packages.
Virus neutralization assay
Virus neutralization was evaluated by a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). Vero E6
cells were seeded at 2x104cells/well in a 96-well plate 24h before the assay. Two hundred focusforming units (ffu) of Sars-CoV-2 virus (BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 strain, a kind gift
from the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses at Institut Pasteur, Paris, originally
supplied through the European Virus Archive goes Global platform) were pre-incubated with
serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera or supernatant from B-cell clones for 1h at 37°C before
infection of cells. After 2h infection, the virus/antibody mix was removed and foci were left to
develop in presence of 1.5% methylcellulose for 2 days. Cells were then fixed with 4%
formaldehyde and foci were revealed using an anti-S antibody and a secondary HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody. Foci were visualized by diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining and counted
using an Immunospot S6 Analyser (Cellular Technology Limited CTL). Neutralization curves
and 50% FRNT values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 6,
GraphPad software.
Statistics
Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare continuous variables as
appropriate. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses
involved use of GraphPad Prism 8.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA).
