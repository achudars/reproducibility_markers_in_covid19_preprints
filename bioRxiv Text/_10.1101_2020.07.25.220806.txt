Abstract
Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may elicit uncontrolled
and damaging inflammatory reactions, due to an excessive immune response and
dysregulated production of cytokines and chemokines. Thus, it is critical to identify
compounds able to inhibit virus replication and thwart the excessive inflammatory
reaction and tissue lesions secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show
that

synthesis/replication in human monocytes and viral production in lung epithelial
cells. VIP and PACAP protected these cells from virus-induced cytopathicity,
reduced the production of proinflammmatory mediators, and prevented the SARSCoV-2-induced NF-kB activation, which is critically involved in the production of
inflammatory mediators. Both neuropeptides promoted CREB activation in infected
monocytes, a transcription factor with antiapoptotic activity and also a negative
regulator of NF-kB. As a possible host response to control patient inflammation,
we identified that VIP levels were elevated in plasma from patients with severe
forms of COVID-19, correlating with the inflammatory marker CRP and survival on
those patients. Since a synthetic form of VIP is clinically approved in Europe and
under two clinical trials for patients with COVID-19, our results provide the
scientific evidence to further support clinical investigation of these neuropeptides
against COVID-19.

Introduction

Individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1, may present
asymptomatic or mild disease to severe lung inflammation and the life threatening
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)2,3. Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is
characterized

by

elevated

serum

levels

of

proinflammatory

mediators

(hypercytokinemia, also known as cytokine storm) such as, for example, IL-2, IL-6,
TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1b, IFN-γ2–5. The excessive immune response and the
dysregulated production of cytokines and chemokines are hallmarks of SARSCoV-2 infection and have been pointed as the main cause of the severe lung
damage and unfavorable clinical progression of patients with COVID-193–6.

During the inflammatory response to human pathogenic coronaviruses
(hCoVs), circulating monocytes migrate and infiltrate the lungs7,8 and there
become the main producers of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbating the
disease9. In addition, MERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-infected macrophages produce
high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines10,11. More recently,
Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al6 showed that lung monocytes from severe
pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 are potent producers of TNF-α and IL-6,
whose levels were increased in the serum of the same patients.

Given that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an uncontrolled and
damaging inflammatory reaction, which might favor the virus propagation, it is
critical to identify agents able to prevent the infection and concurrently thwart the
prototypical excessive inflammatory reaction and tissue lesions secondary to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, we evaluated whether the neuropeptides

Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating
Polypeptide (PACAP), which present immunoregulatory functions12 and are also
able to reduce viral production in HIV-1-infected macrophages13,14, can present the
antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities needed to attenuate the damages caused
by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The neuropeptides VIP and PACAP, which are members of the
Secretin/Glucagon family of peptides, share many biological properties through
their interaction with the G protein-coupled receptors VPAC1, VPAC2 and PAC115.
PACAP binds to all three receptors, with higher affinity to PAC1, while VIP
interacts preferentially with VPAC1 and VPAC215,16. VIP and PACAP are produced
by Th2 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells17–19, and their receptors are expressed by a variety
of cell types, including T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells15.

VIP and PACAP have well-characterized regulatory effects on the immune
system and anti-inflammatory properties, including control of cell activation and
differentiation, down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen
species and induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1020–25. Based on their
consistent anti-inflammatory activities, both neuropeptides have been considered
as promising therapeutic agents for autoimmune disorders and chronic
inflammatory illnesses12,26,27. In this paper, we report that both neuropeptides are
able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 gene replication in human monocytes and viral
production

Materials and Methods

Cells, virus and reagents. African green monkey kidney cells (Vero, subtype E6)
and human lung epithelial cell lines (Calu-3) were expanded in high glucose
DMEM (Vero) or MEM (Calu-3) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone), with
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Pen/Strep; Gibco) at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient
centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, GE Healthcare) from buffy-coat preparations of blood
from healthy donors. PBMCs (2 x 106 cells) were plated onto 48-well plates
(NalgeNunc) in RPMI-1640 with 5% inactivated male human AB serum (Merck) for
3 hours. Non-adherent cells were removed and the remaining monocytes were
maintained in DMEM (low-glucose) with 5% human serum (Merck) and 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Pen/Strep; Gibco). The purity of human
monocytes was above 90%, as determined by flow cytometric analysis (FACScan;
Becton Dickinson) using anti-CD3 (BD Biosciences) and anti-CD14 (BD
Biosciences) monoclonal antibodies.

SARS-CoV-2 was expanded in Vero E6 cells from an isolate contained on a
nasopharyngeal swab obtained from a confirmed case in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
(GenBank accession no. MT710714). Viral isolation were performed after a single
passage in a cell culture in a 150 cm2 flasks with high glucose DMEM plus 2%
FBS. Observations for cytopathic effects were performed daily and peaked 4 to 5
days after infection. All procedures related to virus culture were handled in a
biosafety level 3 (BSL3) multiuser facility according to WHO guidelines. Virus titers
were determined as plaque forming units (PFU/mL). Virus stocks were kept in 5

80°C ultralow freezers. VIP (Vasoactive intestinal peptide), PACAP (Pituitary
adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide), and the VPAC1 agonist (Ala11,22,28)-VIP
and VPAC2 agonist Bay 55-9837 were purchased from Tocris. The PAC1 agonist,
Maxadilan was kindly donated to us by Dr. Ethan A. Lerner (Department of
Dermatology, Massachusetts General Hospital, MA, USA).

Infections and virus titration. Infections were performed with SARS-CoV-2 at
MOI of 0.01 (monocytes) or 0.1 (Calu-3) in low (monocytes) or high (Calu-3)
glucose DMEM without serum. After 1 hour, cells were washed and incubated with
complete medium with treatments or not. For viral titration, monolayers of Vero
cells (2 x 104 cell/well) in 96-well plates were infected with serial dilutions of
supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were washed and
1.2% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)/DMEM (high glucose) semisolid medium
with 2% FBS was added. At 3 days post-infection, plaque number was scored in at
least 3 replicates per dilution by independent readers. The reader was blind with
respect to source of the supernatant.

Molecular detection of virus RNA levels. The total RNA was extracted from
cultures using QIAamp Viral RNA (Qiagen®), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using QuantiTect Probe RTPCR Kit (Quiagen®) in an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems). Amplifications were carried out in 25 µL reaction mixtures containing
2× reaction mix buffer, 50 µM of each primer, 10 µM of probe, and 5 µL of RNA
template. Primers, probes, and cycling conditions recommended by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol were used to detect the SARSCoV-2 (CDC 2020). The standard curve method was employed for virus

quantification. For reference to the cell amounts used, the housekeeping gene
RNAse P was amplified. The Ct values for this target were compared to those
obtained to different cell amounts, 107 to 102, for calibration.

Measurements of Inflammatory Mediators, Cell Death, NF-kBp65, CREB and
neuropeptides. The levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and MIF were quantified in the
monocyte supernatants from infected and uninfected cells by ELISA (R&D
Systems), following manufacturer’s instructions, and results are expressed as
percentages compared to uninfected cells controls. Cell death was determined
according to the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture
supernatants using a CytoTox® Kit (Promega, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Results are expressed as percentages of released
LDH compared to control cells lysed with 0.8% Triton X-100. Supernatants were
centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 1 minute, to remove cellular debris. Evaluation of NFkBp65 and CREB activation was performed in monocytes, infected or not,
according to manufacturer’s instructions: NFkB p65 (Total/Phospho) InstantOne™,
CREB (Total/Phospho) Multispecies InstantOne™ ELISA Kits (Thermo Fisher).
VIP and PACAP were quantified in plasma from patients or control volunteers,
using standard commercially available ELISA and EIA Kits according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Abelisa).

Human subjects. We prospectively enrolled severe or mild/asymptomatic COVID19 RT-PCR-confirmed cases, and SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. Blood and
respiratory samples were obtained from the 24 patients with severe COVID-19
within 72 hours from intensive care unit (ICU) admission in two reference centers

Janeiro, Brazil). Severe COVID-19 was defined as those critically ill patients,
presenting viral pneumonia on computed tomography scan and requiring oxygen
supplementation through either a nonrebreather mask or mechanical ventilation.
Four outpatients presenting mild self-limiting COVID-19 syndrome, and two SARSCoV-2-positive asymptomatic subjects were also included. All patients had SARSCoV-2 confirmed diagnostic through RT-PCR of nasal swab or tracheal aspirates.
Peripheral vein blood was also collected from 11 SARS-CoV-2-negative control
participants as tested by RT-PCR on the day of blood sampling. The
characteristics of severe (n = 24), mild/asymptomatic (n = 6) and control (n = 10)
participants are presented in Table 1. Mild and severe COVID-19 patients
presented differences regarding the age and the presence of comorbidities as
obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (Table 1), which is consistent with
previously reported patient cohorts2,28–30. The SARS-CoV-2-negative control
group, however, included subjects of older age and chronic non-communicable
diseases, so it is matched with mild and critical COVID-19 patients, except for
hypertension (Table 1). All ICU-admitted patients received usual supportive care
for severe COVID-19 and received respiratory support with either noninvasive
oxygen supplementation (n=5) or mechanical ventilation (n= 19) (Supplemental
Table 1). Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were
managed with neuromuscular blockade and a protective ventilation strategy that
included low tidal volume (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight) and limited driving
pressure (less than 16 cmH2O) as well as optimal PEEP calculated based on the
best lung compliance and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. In those with severe ARDS and
PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 150 despite optimal ventilatory settings, prone position was
initiated. Our management protocol included antithrombotic prophylaxis with

antivirals or other anti-inflammatory or anti-platelet drugs. The SARS-CoV-2negative control participants were not under anti-inflammatory or anti-platelet
drugs for at least two weeks. All clinical information was prospectively collected
using a standardized form - ISARIC/WHO Clinical Characterization Protocol for
Severe Emerging Infections (CCPBR). Clinical and laboratory data were recorded
on admission in all severe patients included in the study and the primary outcome
analyzed was 28-day mortality (n = 11 survivors and 13 non-survivors,
Supplemental Table 2). Age and the frequency of comorbidities were not different
between severe patients requiring mechanical ventilation or noninvasive oxygen
supplementation neither between survivors and non-survivors (Supplemental
Table 1 and 2).

donors were performed with samples obtained after written informed consent and
were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Oswaldo Cruz

Results

VIP and PACAP inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis in human primary
monocytes, protecting them from virus-mediated cytophatic effects. Based
on our previous findings showing that VIP and PACAP present antiviral effects on
HIV-1 infection13,14, and on their ability to control the inflammatory response, we
initially investigated whether both neuropeptides could inhibit viral life cycle in
SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes. Thus, human primary monocytes were treated
with either VIP or PACAP, then infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the replication of
viral genome was measured 24 hours later. We found that VIP significantly
reduced the SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, achieving 33% and 45% inhibition at 5
nM and 10 nM, respectively (Fig. 1A). PACAP similarly inhibited levels of viral
RNA synthesis with 5 nM (40%) and 10 nM (39%) (Fig. 1A). In parallel, we
observed that VIP and PACAP, at 10 nM each, completely protected the SARSCoV-2-mediated cytophatic effect, as measured by the LDH levels in the cell
culture supernatant (Fig. 1B). These results show that both neuropeptides are
similarly effective in their ability to reduce SARS-CoV-2 genome replication in
monocytes and to prevent the virus-induced cell death.

Receptor contribution for the VIP and PACAP mediated inhibition of SARSCoV-2 replication. Because VIP binds the receptors VPAC1 and VPAC2, and

PACAP has high affinity for PAC1, but also binds the VPAC1 and VPAC215,16, we
analyzed the role of the individual receptors in the neuropeptide-mediated
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication. To this end, monocytes were treated
with specific agonists to VPAC1, VPAC2 and PAC1 (Ala-VIP, Bay 55 9837 and
Maxadilan, respectively), and then exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We found that the
sole activation of VPAC2 at 1 nM, 5 nM and 10 nM, and of VPAC1 at 10 nM,
significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 gene replication (Fig. 1C). The ligation of
only VPAC1 at 1 and 5 nM, and of PAC1 at 5 and 10 nM also diminished the viral
replication, without reaching, however, statistical significance. Of note, the optimal
concentrations of the receptor agonists that significantly decreased the SARSCoV-2 RNA synthesis were similar to those of the natural receptor ligands VIP and
PACAP. Overall, these findings suggest that the three receptors contribute for the
VIP- and PACAP-mediated SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, and that the sole activation of
each of these receptors can lead to a diminished viral inhibition similar as that
induced by the own neuropeptides.

VIP and PACAP inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells and protect
them from virus-mediated cytophatic effects. We next evaluated whether VIP
and PACAP could also be able to restrict the virus production in pulmonary cells,
one of the major targets of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, Calu-3 cells, a lineage of epithelial
lung cells highly susceptible to this virus, were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and
treated with a range of concentrations of either peptide. We found that VIP
decreased the productive infection, reaching 41% and 28% of inhibition with 1 nM
and 5 nM, respectively (Fig.2A). PACAP also diminished virus production by 33%,
35% and 42% at concentrations equivalent to 5 nM, 10 nM and 50 nM (Fig. 2B).
The different potency between VIP and PACAP in their ability to control the viral

productive infection in Calu-3 cells might be explained by the relative abundance
of the neuropeptide receptors, since it has been shown that these cells express
only VPAC131. However, all three receptors are reported to be expressed in lungs,
with some studies showing that VPAC1 levels are much higher than VPAC2 (the
other VIP receptor) or PAC1 (to which PACAP binds with higher affinity than to
VPAC1 and VPAC215,32–34). Likewise we found for monocytes, VIP and PACAP
VIP also protected Calu-3 cells from the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic
effects, at the same optimal viral inhibitory concentrations (1 nM and 50 nM,
respectively) of each neuropeptide (Fig. 2C).
Given that monocytes and epithelial cells can be in close proximity in the
lungs, and, thus, can interact and exchange molecules, we investigated whether
conditioned medium (CM) obtained by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes exposed
to VIP or PACAP could repress the viral production in human lung cells. While the
transference of CM from uninfected monocytes, treated or nor with either
neuropeptide, did not modify the virus growth, the addition of CM (at 50% vol/vol –
the combination of fresh medium at this ratio did not altered the basal replication of
SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells, Supp. Fig. 1) from infected monocytes, treated with
VIP or PACAP, to Calu-3 cells, resulted in a 50% reduction of virus replication in
these cells (Fig. 2D). This finding raises the hypothesis that both neuropeptides,
besides inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 gene replication, induce monocyte production
and release of factors endowed with antiviral activity, which may increase the
resistance of neighboring cells to SARS-CoV-2 growth. This bystander effect can
reduce viral propagation, thus eventually protecting the tissues from lesions
secondary to SARS-CoV-2-replication and dissemination. Future studies are
needed to identify the nature of these putative soluble factors.

VIP and PACAP reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines by SARSCoV-2-infected monocytes and Calu-3 cells. Given the hypothesis that
controlling the production of proinflammatory cytokines may be critical for reducing
SARS-CoV-2 replication and limiting tissue damages, and based on evidence that
VIP and PACAP can regulate the inflammatory response24,35, we next evaluated
whether both neuropeptides could attenuate the production of proinflammatory
mediators by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes or lung epithelial cells. As shown
in Fig. 3A, SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes produced large amounts of the
proinflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and MIF relative to uninfected cells
(15, 4, 12 and 18 times more, respectively). In contrast, the treatment of
monocytes with either neuropeptide after SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced to 66%,
50%, 66% and 50% the cellular production of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and MIF,
respectively. Furthermore, VIP and PACAP reverted by approximately the same
degree the release of IL-6 and IL-8 by Calu-3 cells (Fig. 3B), implying that VIP and
PACAP may offer a critical protection to inflamed lungs affected by SARS-CoV-2
replication.

Because

replication, which, in turn, can amplify the cellular synthesis of these mediators,
these findings may support our assumption that VIP and PACAP offer tissue
protection by inhibiting virus replication and regulating the boost of cytokine
production.

VIP and PACAP regulate the activation of transcription factors in SARS-CoV2-infected monocytes. Based on the fact that the transcription factor NF-kB is
critically involved in the cellular production of inflammatory mediators36, and on our
own findings that VIP and PACAP can inhibit its activation in HIV-1-infected
macrophages14, we investigated whether both neuropeptides would exert this

same activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, we
firstly observed that NF-kB is up-modulated in infected cells (as measured by the
increased amount of phosphorylated NF-kBp65 subunit) and, second, that VIP and
PACAP reduced the NF-KBp65 phosphorylation, evidencing the significant antiNF-kBp65 activity of VIP and PACAP. We believe that the SARS-CoV-2-induced
NF-kB activation could have contributed for the elevated production of
proinflammatory cytokines by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, and that the
inhibition of this transcription factor by VIP and PACAP was critical for the
decreased synthesis of these mediators by the same cells.
We also analyzed the effects of both neuropeptides on the activation of
CREB, a transcription factor induced by several GPCRs ligands, including VIP and
PACAP37. CREB and NF-kB share the CREB-binding protein/p300 (CBP/p300
protein) as a cofactor, and CREB activation results in the inhibition of NF-kB38. We
initially observed that activation of CREB was diminished in SARS-CoV-2-infected
monocytes, a finding coherent with NF-kB activation in the same cells (Fig. 4B).
Consistent with this finding, VIP and PACAP promoted CREB activation (as
measured by augmentation of CREB phosphorylation) in those infected
monocytes, a result matching the inhibition of NF-kB and the reduction of cellular
production of proinflammatory cytokines.
Plasma levels of VIP are elevated in patients with severe forms of COVID-19.
Based on our results showing that VIP and PACAP, besides inhibiting viral
replication and production, can also control the production of proinflammatory
mediators by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, we measured the levels of both
neuropeptides in plasma samples of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. We found
that the amount of VIP is significantly elevated in patients affected by the most

severe forms of infection, relative to levels of uninfected healthy controls and
asymptomatic/mild patients (Fig. 5A), and that some critically ill patients had
increased levels of PACAP, but without statistical significance when considering
the entire group (Fig. 5B). In addition, levels of VIP positively correlated with levels
of C-reactive protein (Fig. 5C), but neither VIP nor PACAP levels correlated with
other inflammatory markers, such as D-dimer, fibrinogen or IL-6 (data not shown),
or with each other (Fig. 5D). Severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU were
further stratified between those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or
noninvasive O2 supplementation, or according to the 28-day mortality outcome as
survivors or non-survivors, and, while for PACAP we did not observed statistical
significance in the stratified groups (Fig. 5E and 5F), we detected that VIP plasma
levels were significantly higher in survivors than in non-survivors (Fig. 5H).
Taking into account that VIP and PACAP regulate inflammatory reactions, it
is possible that their increased circulating amounts reflect a counter-regulatory
effect elicited by the dysregulated immune response typical of the more severe
clinical status of COVID-19 patients. The levels of VIP and PACAP in SARS-CoV2-infected tissues should be a matter of future studies, to substantiate our
hypothesis.
Discussion

In this work, we report that the neuropeptides VIP and PACAP, endogenous
molecules presenting anti-inflammatory properties, are able to inhibit the SARSCoV-2 RNA synthesis and viral production (in monocytes and human lung cells),
and reduce the exacerbated synthesis of proinflammatory mediators due to
infection. Also we identified that VIP was elevated in patients with severe form of

COVID-19, correlating with levels of CRP and that the elevated levels also
correlated with survival. Our findings attain great relevance, given that VIP (as a
synthetic form, Aviptadil), in an intravenous39 and inhaled40 formulation, is under
two clinical trials for COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, whose first results
are expected to be disclosed in September39/November40 this year. Clinical data,
along with mechanism for antiviral inhibition, may allow larger trials.

We provide here experimental evidence showing that VIP and PACAP
encompass critical activities for preventing the tissue damage caused by SARSCoV-2 infection, i.e, inhibiting viral replication, maintaining the cellular viability, and
controlling the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. These findings may
support the assumption that the association of anti-inflammatory agents with
antivirals should be suitable for COVID-19 treatment. In this sense, the recent
reported administration of dexamethasone to patients with COVID-19 resulted in a
significant clinical benefit for those affected with the more severe forms of this
disease41.

VIP and PACAP are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous
system and in many other sites, including the lymphoid tissue17–19 and the
lungs15,42, where, together with brain and gut, the higher levels of VIP are
found15,42. Both neuropeptides regulate the inflammatory response due to their
ability to decrease the production of proinflammatory mediators, such as
chemokines, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α and
MIF, and to elicit the production of anti-inflammatory molecules, such as IL-4 and
IL-1021–24. The receptors for VIP and PACAP, the G protein-coupled receptors
VPAC1, VPAC2 and PAC1, are expressed in cells of the immune system and

largely distributed in other tissues15. The systemic distribution of both
neuropeptides and their receptors explain the pleiotropic effects of VIP and
PACAP. While both neuropeptides have been extensively studied in chronic
inflammatory illnesses, reports of their effects on infectious processes are scarce,
and, specifically for viral infections, we reported that VIP and PACAP inhibit HIV-1
replication in human primary macrophages13,14.

We initially observed that VIP and PACAP decreased the genome
replication of SARS-CoV-2 in monocytes, in parallel with protecting the cells from
virus-induced cytopathicity. While at this moment it is unclear the mechanism by
which both neuropeptides reduce the SARS-CoV-2 gene replication, it is possible
to speculate that, by diminishing the intracellular levels of viral RNA and other viral
molecules, VIP and PACAP could prevent the cell death by pyroptosis, which has
been described as one of the main causes of cell damage during SARS-CoV-2
infection43. While maintaining the monocyte viability, VIP and PACAP also
diminished the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and
MIF by these cells, a result which is in agreement with the reported ability of these
neuropeptides to regulate the inflammatory response21–24,44. The ability of both
neuropeptides to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, protect cells from virus-mediated
cytophaticity and reduce cellular production of inflammatory mediators was also
extended to lung epithelial cells, a finding that further support the assumption that
VIP and PACAP may offer a critical protection to inflamed lungs affected by
SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because these mediators have been found to be
elevated in patients with COVID-19, and that VIP and PACAP regulate
inflammatory reactions, it is possible that the higher amounts of VIP in patients
affected by the most severe forms of infection may reflect a counter-regulatory

feedback elicited by the dysregulated immune response typical of the more severe
clinical status of COVID-19 patients.

Interestingly, the cellular protection conferred by VIP or PACAP to SARSCoV-2-infected monocytes can be transferred to other neighboring virus target
cells, as we observed that conditioned medium from neuropeptide-treated
infected-monocytes diminished the productive infection in Calu-3 lung epithelial
cells. Thus, we understand that this bystander effect can ultimately protect other
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells not directly interacting with VIP or PACAP. Our
findings warrant more investigations to identify the nature of the protecting factors
presumably released by monocytes that survived the infection by SARS-CoV-2.

Our findings showing that VIP and PACAP inhibited the SARS-CoV-2induced activation of the subunit p65 of the transcription factor NF-kB, which is a
classical inducer of inflammatory mediators36, pertain to a complex molecular
mechanism probably participating in the neuropeptide-mediated reduction of
proinflammatory cytokines by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes. As we also
previously described for HIV-1 infection in macrophages14, the ability of VIP and
PACAP to prevent the SARS-CoV-2-mediated NF-kBp65 activation might be
associated to a concomitant neuropeptide-induced CREB activation. In fact, we
detected here that the transcription factor CREB, which can act as a negative
regulator of NF-kB45,46, is down-regulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, in
opposition to NF-kB activation in the same cells. In some models47–52, CREB
activation is related to induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines concomitant with
reduction of pro-inflammatory molecules, mainly through direct transcription of its
targets, like IL-10, or through competing with NF-kB by their shared co-activador

protein CBP/p30045,46,52,53. Besides its role in the balance between pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines, CREB activation is also involved with the anti-apoptotic
response in monocytes and macrophages, during differentiation and inflammatory
stimuli54,55. Thus, the imbalance between CREB and NF-kB, either as a direct
effect of infection by SARS-CoV-2 or a consequence of exposure of bystander
cells to viral products and inflammatory molecules, could be an important target for
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 deleterious effects, at least in monocytes and probably
also in lung cells, as a similar imbalance between CREB and NF-kB was observed
in an acute inflammatory pulmonary condition38.

Quite important for the understanding of the VIP and PACAP anti-SARSCoV-2 effects and for COVID-19 pathogenesis is the definition that the
engagement of the individual VIP and PACAP receptors by specific agonists
recapitulate the actions of the native neuropeptides in monocytes. Because VIP
and PACAP signaling pathway outcome is dependent of the combined action of
the receptors activated by them (VIP and PACAP receptors can elicit cell signaling
in homo and hetero dimers56, it is possible that all receptors are involved in the
final outcome analyzed. Our assays suggest that the three receptors may have
contributed for VIP- and PACAP-mediated reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
synthesis in monocytes. This finding is particularly interesting for VPAC1, whose
solely activation in HIV-1-infected cells enhanced viral production in human
primary macrophages13 and in CD4+ tumor cell lines and PBMCs57. The inhibition
profile of SARS-CoV-2 by VIP and PACAP in Calu-3 cells may be biased
regarding the expected action in the lungs, since Calu-3 cells appear to express
only VPAC131. However, lung tissues, while reported to express high levels of
VPAC1, also express VPAC2 and PAC132,34, and, more specifically, VPAC2

mRNA was detected in airway epithelial, glandular, and immune cells of the lung33.
Therefore, while the inhibition curve of SARS-CoV-2 by VIP and PACAP in Calu-3
cells point to different optimal doses than those obtained for monocytes, it is
possible that in normal lung cells and tissue, VIP and PACAP could present a
broader range of action in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, VIP and specific
agonists for VPAC1 or VPAC2 have been proposed and tested for respiratory
conditions, like asthma58–60, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)58,61,62 and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)58,59,63, demonstrating that the antiinflammatory actions of VIP/PACAP can be achieved in lung tissues. Future
studies should define which of these receptors would preferentially be activated by
specific agonists to restrain SARS-CoV-2 replication in lungs or other sites. Also,
the loss of VIP capacity to inhibit virus production at the more elevated
concentrations in Calu-3 cells might involve receptor desensitization, a common
feature for GPCRs, which is also described for VIP/PACAP receptors64,65.
Together with the possible differences of receptor expression and self-regulatory
characteristics of GPCRs, a third regulation level of VIP and PACAP action on
pulmonary cells can be achieved by the activity of proteases and peptidases, as
lungs are described to express high levels of several of them in both normal and
pathological conditions66–68. Some of these peptidases could target VIP and
PACAP, thus altering the ligand/receptor ratio and modulating the signaling
pathways. Studies are underway in our laboratory to verify whether the
combination of these agonists could potentiate their individual effects.

It has been described that SARS-CoV-2 propagates throughout the
organism, thus causing inflammatory damages in several tissues4. Since VIP and
PACAP, and their receptors are systemically distributed, we suppose that the

antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of both neuropeptides would not be
restricted to the respiratory tract. Just as an example, VIP and PACAP have been
shown to protect nervous tissues form injuries caused by a number of neurotoxic
agents69. This neuroprotective effects might be particularly important in the light of
new indication that COVID-19 patients can be affected by a range of neurological
lesions and disorders70.

Because up to now there are no antivirals specific to SARS-CoV-2, and that
the hyper-inflammation may persist even after the lowering of the viral load, the
searching for compounds that target the aberrant production of proinflammatory
cytokines and, simultaneously, the own viral replication, should be stimulated. Our
present results showing that VIP and PACAP hold these two critical activities point
these neuropeptides or their analogue molecules as potential therapeutic agents
for COVID-19.

Legends for figures

Figure 1. VIP and PACAP inhibit SARS-CoV-2 gene replication in monocytes and
protect the cells from vírus-mediated cytophaticity. (A) Monocytes were exposed to
the indicated concentrations of VIP or PACAP during 30 min, and then infected with
SARS-CoV-2. Virus RNA synthesis was evaluated by qPCR in the culture supernatants
20-24 hours after infection. (B) Cellular viability was analyzed by measuring LDH release
in the supernatants of uninfected or SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, treated or not with
VIP or PACAP. (C) Similar to (A), except that cells were treated with agonists for VIP and
PACAP receptors, as indicated, at different concentrations. Data in A and C are shown
normalized to infected cells kept only with culture medium, and in C represent means ±
SD of absolute values. *p ≤ .05; **p ≤ .01.
Figure 2. VIP and PACAP inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells, protect the
cells from virus-mediated cytophaticity, and mediate transmission of viral
resistance from monocytes to human lung cells. Calu-3 cells were infected by SARSCoV-2 and then left untreated (0) or treated with the indicated concentrations of VIP (A) or
PACAP (B). After 60 hours, supernatants were collected and viral replication was
evaluated by quantifying PFUs in plaque assay. (C) Cellular viability was analyzed by
measuring LDH release in the supernatants of uninfected or SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3
cells, treated or not with VIP (1 nM) or PACAP (50 nM). (D, three bars on the left) SARSCoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells were kept untreated (Nil) or received CM (50% final dilution)
from VIP- or PACAP-treated uninfected monocytes. (D, three bars on the right) SARSCoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells were kept untreated (Nil) or received CM (50% final dilution)
from VIP- or PACAP-treated SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes. After 60 hours,
supernatants were collected and viral replication was evaluated by quantifying PFUs in
plaque assay. Data are shown as means ± SD. *p ≤ .05; **p ≤ .01.

Figure 3. VIP and PACAP reduce production of proinflammatory mediators by
SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and Calu-3 cells. Monocytes and Calu-3 cells were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour, and then exposed to VIP or PACAP (10 nM each for
monocytes, 1 nM of VIP or 50 nM of PACAP for Calu-3 cells). The levels of IL-6, IL-8,
TNF-α and MIF were measured in culture supernatants of monocytes after 24 hours (A),
and of IL-6 and IL-8 after 60 hours for Calu-3 cells (B), by ELISA. Data represent means ±
SD. *p ≤ .05; **p ≤ .01.
Figure 4. VIP and PACAP regulate the activation of transcription factors in SARSCoV-2-infected monocytes. Monocytes were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and, 1 hour after
infection, the infected cells were exposed (or not - Nil) to VIP or PACAP (at 10 nM) and 24
hours later, cells were lysed and the ratios between phosphoNF-kBp65 / total NF-kBp65
(A) and phosphoCREB / total CREB (B) were quantified by ELISA in the cell lysates.
“Control” indicates uninfected monocytes kept only with culture medium. Data in A and B
represent means ± SD. *p ≤ .05; **p ≤ .01; ***p ≤ .001.
Figure 5. Plasma level of VIP is elevated in patients with severe forms of COVID-19.
The levels of VIP (A) and PACAP (E) in the plasma of SARS-CoV-2-negative control
participants, SARS-CoV-2-positive asymptomatic subjects, or symptomatic patients
presenting mild to severe COVID-19 syndrome were quantified by ELISA. Correlation
between VIP and CRP (B) and between levels of both neuropeptides (F) in the plasma
from patients with COVID-19. (C and G) Severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU
were stratified between those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or noninvasive O2
supplementation. (D and H) Severe COVID-19 patients were stratified according to the
28-day mortality outcome as survivors or nonsurvivors. One outlier (CRP = 621.64 mg/dL)
was excluded from the analysis in panels B-D according to the ROUT test. Linear
regression (with the 95 % confidence interval) and Spearman’s correlation were
calculated according to the distribution of the dots (controls: grey; asymptomatics: brown;
mild: green; severe: red). The horizontal lines in the box plots represent the median, the
