Abstract

16

Nucleotide substitution rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-

17

2) is relatively low compared to the other RNA viruses because coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-

18

2 encode non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) that is an error-correcting exonuclease protein. In this study,

19

to understand genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic, we examined mutations of

20

SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 which could inhibit its error-correcting function. First, to obtain functionally

21

important sites of nsp14, we examined 62 representative coronaviruses belonging to alpha, beta,

22

gamma, delta, and unclassified coronaviruses. As a result, 99 out of 527 amino acid sites of nsp14

23

were evolutionarily conserved. We then examined nsp14 sequences obtained from 28,082 SARS-CoV-

24

2 genomes and identified 6 amino acid changes in nsp14 mutants that were not detected in the 62

25

representative coronaviruses. We examined genome substitution rates of these mutants and found that

26

an nsp14 mutant with a proline to leucine change at position 203 (P203L) showed a higher substitution

27

rate (35.9 substitutions/year) than SARS-CoV-2 possessing wild-type nsp14 (19.8 substitutions/year).

28

We confirmed that the substitution rate of the P203L is significantly higher than those of other variants

29

containing mutations in structural proteins. Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing

30

P203L mutation of nsp14 is limited (26), these mutants appeared at least 10 times independently in the

31

current pandemic. These results indicated that the molecular function of nsp14 is important for survival

32

of various coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and that some mutations such as P203L of nsp14

33

inhibiting its error-correcting function are removed rapidly due to their deleterious effects.

Introduction

37

Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) became a pandemic in 2020, infecting more than

38

60 million people worldwide as of the end of November 2020 with no end in sight. Severe acute

39

respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causing agent of this symptom (Lu,

40

et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, et al. 2020; Zhu, et al. 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense

41

single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) that belongs to the coronavirus family (Coronaviridae), which is a

42

member of the order Nidovirus (Lu, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, et al. 2020; Zhu, et al. 2020).

43

According to the classification of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),

44

Coronaviridae

45

Orthocoronavirinae is composed of four genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-) of coronaviruses

46

(CoVs). Betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV are mainly composed of 5

47

subgenera: Salbecovirus, Hibecovirus, Nobecovirus, Merbecovirus, and Embecovirus (Woo, et al.

48

2010; Nakagawa and Miyazawa 2020). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belongs to the subgenus

49

Salbecovirus (Lu, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020; Zhu, et al. 2020).

are

divided

into

two

subfamilies,

Letovirinae

and

Orthocoronavirinae.

50

One of the unique genomic characteristics of CoVs is their lower mutation rates compared

51

with other RNA viruses (Eckerle, et al. 2007; Eckerle, et al. 2010). RNA viruses usually have a high

52

mutation rate, which is partially caused by the relatively low fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA

53

polymerase (RdRp) and the lack of correction of nucleotide incorporation errors. In CoVs, however,

54

nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) in an open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) cleaved by internal proteases

55

(present in nsp3 and nsp5) (Hegyi and Ziebuhr 2002; Thiel, et al. 2003) contains an exoribonuclease

56

(ExoN) domain that performs proofreading during replication steps (Snijder, et al. 2003). Functional

57

inactivation experiments of nsp14 of SARS-CoV demonstrated 10-20 times higher mutation rates

58

(Eckerle, et al. 2010; Graham, et al. 2012; Smith, et al. 2013). It is known that CoVs have the largest

59

RNA genome of all RNA viruses (Gorbalenya, et al. 2006), and, therefore, nsp14 could be important

60

for maintaining their genomes.

61

To understand genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic, we examined

62

SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 mutants that may impair its error-correcting function. First, to examine the

63

evolution and diversity of nsp14 in CoVs, we generated a phylogenetic tree of the nsp14 gene obtained

64

from a variety of 62 CoVs belonging to the four genera as well as an unclassified one (Supplementary

65

table 1). We then evaluated evolutionary conserved amino acid sites to infer functionally important

66

sites. We examined 28,082 SARS-CoV-2 genomes that are available in the GISAID database, which

67

includes not only sequencing data but also sampling date, country, and institution information (Shu

68

and McCauley 2017). We examined various nsp14 SARS-CoV-2 mutants that had spread in the viral

69

population. Among them, highly frequent nsp14 mutants that were not observed among the diversified

70

62 CoVs were identified. Based on those results, we found that an amino acid replacement from proline

71

(P) to leucine (L) at position 203 of nsp14 increased a nucleotide substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2

72

genomes. We validated the higher mutation rate compared with those of structural proteins. These

73

results indicate that some of variations in nsp14 may increase diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Results

77

Conserved region of nsp14 proteins in various coronaviruses

78

We first generated a phylogenetic tree of amino acid sequences of the nsp14 gene obtained

79

from representative 62 coronaviruses (CoVs); the viruses used in the analysis was summarized in

80

Supplementary table 1. The phylogenetic tree based on the 62 amino acid sequences of nsp14 clearly

81

showed the relationship of the four genera of CoVs (Fig. 1), which is almost identical to the results

82

obtained by using the partial amino acid sequences of ORF1ab described in a previous report

83

(Nakagawa and Miyazawa 2020). Our results suggest that the nsp14 gene is under negative selection

84

due to its molecular function, and that the conserved amino acid sites in particular could be important.

85

Subsequently, we examined the conserved amino acid sites of the nsp14 gene among the 62

86

CoVs (Fig 2A). The amino acid positions of nsp14 are based on SARS-CoV, three-dimensional

87

structure of which is available (PDB ID: 5C8S). SARS-CoV is a coronavirus belonging to the

88

subgenus Sarbecovirus in the genus Betacoronavirus, which is the same as SARS-CoV-2. For nsp14,

89

the number of identical amino acids was 482/527 (91.5%) in 8 representative CoVs belonging to the

90

subgenus Sarbecovirus, and 359/527 (68.1%) if we added nsp14 of the Bat Hp-

91

betacoronavirus/Zhejiang2013 (GenBank ID: NC_025217.1) belonging to the subgenus Hibecovirus

92

which is known as the outgroup of Sarbecovirus. Moreover, 200/527 (38.0%) positions were preserved

93

among 29 viruses of the genus Betacoronavirus, and 108/527 (20.5%) positions were preserved among

94

the 61 CoVs (Supplementary table 1). If we include an unclassified CoV found in Tropidophorus

95

sinicus (Chinese waterside skink) (Shi, et al. 2018), the conserved amino acid positions were 99/527

96

(18.8%). These results suggest that various amino acid sites of nsp14 gene are conserved among

97

diverse CoVs because they may be functionally important. We further validated this hypothesis by

98

calculating nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rates on a per-site basis for the

99

nsp14 sequences of 62 CoVs using SLAC program (see Materials and Methods) (Kosakovsky Pond

100

and Frost 2005). Note that codon position 504 of nsp14 was calculated using 61 CoVs excluding the

101

Chinese waterside skink CoV because it has a mixed nucleotide at that position. As a result, no positive

102

selection sites were found in nsp14, whereas 379 out of 527 sites were under negative selection (P <

103

0.01, Supplementary fig 1). In total, 91 amino acids were unchanged as well as under negative selection

104

in nsp14 of the 62 representative CoVs.

105

We investigated whether the amino acids that are known to be important for the error-

106

correcting function of nsp14 are conserved. CoV nsp14 is an enzyme that possesses both ExoN and

107

N7-MTase activities. The ExoN domain of CoV nsp14 was originally identified based on sequence

108

similarity to distant cell homologs (Snijder, et al. 2003) and has been assigned to the DEDD

109

exonuclease superfamily, which includes the proofreading domains of many DNA polymerases and

110

other eukaryotic and prokaryotic exonucleases. The nsp14 proteins with four conserved active site

111

residues were distributed in three standard motifs of the primary structure: residues 90D/92E (motif I),

112

191E (motif II), and 273D (motif III) (Ogando, et al. 2019; Romano, et al. 2020). We found that the

113

four active sites of nsp14 were conserved among the 62 CoVs examined in this analysis (Fig 2B).

114

Moreover, there were three zinc fingers that were essential for nsp14 function: the first zinc finger

115

(ZF1): 207C, 210C, 226C, and 229H; the second zinc finger (ZF2): 257H, 261C, 264H, and 279C; and

116

the third zinc finger (ZF3): 452C, 473C, 484C, and 487H. S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding

117

motif I include residues 331D, 333G, 335P and 337A (or 337G), which were involved in the (N7

118

guanine)-methyl transferase reaction by nsp14. We found that all of these residues were conserved

119

among the nsp14 sequences of the 62 CoVs examined in this analysis (Supplementary fig 2). These

120

results suggest that the amino acids of the nsp14 that are functionally important are conserved among

121

diversified CoVs.

122
123

Diversity of nsp14 in SARS-CoV-2

124

Amino acid comparisons of nsp14 in the 62 representative CoVs revealed that several sites

125

are strongly conserved, and that some substitutions may have deleterious effects for the survive of

126

SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in humans in 2019 and has spread rapidly all over the

127

world in a short period of time. Therefore, some mutations of nsp14 that impair its error-correcting

128

function may remain in the SARS-CoV-2 population. Therefore, we attempted to identify such

129

deleterious mutations in the current SARS-CoV-2 population.

130

We downloaded the aligned nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV2 (87,625 sequences) from

131

the GISAID database as of September 7, 2020. The SARS-CoV2 genomes isolated from humans were

132

extracted (87,304 sequences), and the sequences containing undetermined and/or mixed nucleotides

133

were removed; the remaining 28,082 sequences were used in subsequent analyses. The coding region

134

of nsp14 is translated and compared. As a result, 25,913 nsp14 amino acid sequences (92.27%) were

135

identical to that of the reference sequence, while 2169 sequences contain at least one amino acid

136

replacement in nsp14 (Supplementary table 2). Among them, the top 20 variants possessing nsp14

137

with amino acids that were different from the major sequence are summarized in Table 1. Note that

138

frameshift mutants were excluded in Table 1 because they may affect downstream genes as well. It

139

was revealed that SARS-CoV-2, which acquired various mutations in nsp14, was present, although

140

the number of examined sequences is limited. Notably, among the 20 amino acid nsp14 mutants, 6

141

amino acids (177F, 377L, 369F, 501I, 203L and 297S) were not found in the 62 nsp14 of the

142

representative CoVs (Supplementary fig 2).

143

We further analyzed the evolutionary selection pressures of these 6 amino acid sites using 73

144

CoVs belonging to the genus Betacoronaviruses that includes SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary table 3).

145

We confirmed the 6 amino acid variants were not found in the 73 Beta-CoVs (Supplementary table 3).

146

The 6 conserved positions (177, 203, 297, 369, 377, and 501) were also found to be under negative

147

selection (P < 0.01, Supplementary table 4). Overall, the results indicated that the conserved amino

148

acid sites of nsp14 are evolutionarily selected in the genus Betacoronaviruses as well.

149
150

Correlation between amino acid sequences of nsp14 and nucleotide substitution rates in the viral

151

genome

152

To examine whether the 6 amino acid replacements observed in the nsp14 gene of SARS-

153

CoV-2 variants affect its proofreading function, we investigated a correlation between the amino acid

154

variants of nsp14 and the genetic diversities of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The nucleotide substitution

155

rates of SARS-CoV-2 possessing mutated nsp14 variants were compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 with

156

wild-type nsp14. Note that sequences for which sampling date information (year, month, and day) was

157

not available were excluded from this analysis. Nucleotide substitutions per year were calculated based

158

on the regression coefficient using hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_402125) as a

159

reference sequence (see Materials and Methods).

160

We found that SARS-CoV-2 containing the wild type nsp14 had 19.8 nucleotide substitutions

161

in whole genome per year (Table 2). Conversely, 7 SARS-CoV-2 variants containing nsp14 with

162

amino acid replacements showed 27.3 (L177F), 59.8 (L177F/T372I), 35.9 (P203L), 17.1 (P297S), 26.2

163

(S369F), 13.0 (F377L), or 21.9 (M501I) nucleotide substitutions per year (Fig 3). Although the

164

substitution rates of the L177F/T372I and F377L variants were found to be not reliable because of

165

limited time ranges, those of the other variants were clearly correlated (Fig 3). Therefore, SARS-CoV-

166

2 variants possessing nsp14 with the L177F, P203L, S369F, or M501I replacement may have a

167

particularly higher genomic mutation rate than do SARS-CoV-2 variants with wild-type nsp14.

168

We further verified the elevated substitution rates found in various nsp14 mutants. We used

169

all sequences that did not contain any ambiguous nucleotides (shown in Supplementary table 5) to

170

calculate the mutation rates; however, this could cause an overestimation because of sampling biases.

171

Therefore, we extracted representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes by selecting the sequence showing the

172

oldest sampling date if the genome sequences were identical. Using the representative dataset, we

173

analyzed the nucleotide substitutions per year of the amino acid replacements for each site of nsp14 if

174

amino acid replacements were present in 20 or more sequences. Note that amino acid replacements

175

caused by frameshifts were removed. As a result, 16 amino acid replacements in nsp14 were evaluated,

176

and the mean value of nucleotide substitution rate was 20.7 (Supplementary fig 3A). Among them, we

177

found that the P203L variant of nsp14 (nsp14-P203L) showed the highest mutation rate (35.7

178

nucleotide mutations per year).

179

We also evaluated the substitution rates of the 7 nsp14 variants for each single cluster in which

180

the maximum number was observed. We assumed that variants were in the same clade if their Pangolin

181

lineages (Rambaut, et al. 2020) and GISAID clades were identical. We found that nsp14-P203L

182

variants in the Pangolin lineage B.1.1.33 showed the largest nucleotide substitution rate (58.8

183

nucleotide substitutions/year) (Fig 4A, B and Table 3). Although the number of variants was limited

184

(6), a correlation was clearly observed (Fig 4B and Table 3). In addition, other 6 nsp-P203L variants

185

in a different cluster (B.1) also showed a relatively high nucleotide substitution rate (28.0 nucleotide

186

substitutions/year) (Table3 and Supplementary fig 4). These results clearly indicate that SARS-CoV-

187

2 variants containing nsp14-P203L could accumulate mutations in the viral population.

188
189

Mutations in structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 and validation of substitution rates

190

It was reported that nucleotide mutations in the M and E structural genes have been used to

191

calculate genome-wide mutation load of SARS-CoV-2, the mutations of which may not affect RNA

192

replication (Eskier, Karakulah, et al. 2020; Eskier, Suner, et al. 2020). Therefore, we also analyzed

193

nucleotide mutations of the structural genes that do not directly interact with viral RNAs: the S, M,

194

and E genes. As the number of nucleotide mutations in the E or M gene was only 0 or 1 in most

195

sequences, we summed up the number of mutations in those three genes. We found that viruses

196

containing nsp14-L177F or nsp14-P203L had higher rates of nucleotide substitutions in the S, M and

197

E genes per year than did viruses with the wild-type nsp14 (Table 2). These results suggest that viruses

198

carrying nsp14-L177F and nsp14-P203L viruses have an increased substitution rate.

199

To examine whether the substitution rates observed in the nsp14 mutants are high, we

200

calculated the nucleotide substitution rates of the mutants of each structural gene if they were present

201

in 20 or more sequences. 40 mutants containing 22, 3 and 5 amino acid replacements in sites of the S,

202

E and M genes, respectively, were remained. The mean rate of nucleotide substitutions per year was

203

18.4, and its distribution is shown in Supplementary fig 3B. We then investigated a possibility that the

204

increase in nucleotide substitution rates observed in the nsp14 gene occurred by chance. We found that

205

the nucleotide substitution rate of the nsp14-P203L mutant was over 5% in the distribution, although

206

the largest rate was found in the S-V6F mutant (Fig 5). However, the elevated nucleotide substitution

207

rate of V6F was found to be due to the effects of an outlier sample shown in the black dot in

208

Supplementary fig 5. In fact, if we removed the outlier sample, the nucleotide substitution rate was

209

reduced to 26.2. Conversely, the amino acid replacement rate of nsp14 did not show any extreme bias

210

in the sample. These results suggest that P203L of nsp14 has a higher rate of genomic mutation

211

compared with other amino acid replacements.

212
213

nsp14-P203L variant in the SARS-CoV-2 population

214

The nsp14-P203L variants have been isolated 26 patients mainly in Europe and North

215

America, with the first being reported on March 5, 2020 in Netherlands (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_454756,

216

Supplementary table 5). Considering their Pangolin lineages (Rambaut, et al. 2020) as well as GISAID

217

clades (shown in Supplementary table 5), the nsp14-P203L variant appeared at least 10 times. In fact,

218

the nsp14-P203L variants were observed in both of the Spike D614 and G614 variants, which changes

219

the efficiency of infection and have spread worldwide (Korber, et al. 2020). However, we also found

220

that the nsp14-P203L variants did not increase steadily over time. As we examined, the largest number

221

of the nsp14-P203L variants found in the B.1.1.33 and B.1 lineages was only 6 for each

222

(Supplementary table 5).

224

nsp14-P203L mutation effect on protein structure.

225

To estimate an effect of the P203L mutation of nps14, we first investigated the location of the

226

residue 203 using a tertiary structure model of SARS-CoV nsp14 (PDB ID: 5C8S) (Ma, et al. 2015).

227

As the protein structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 is currently not available in the PDB database, we used

228

the protein structure of SARS-CoV nsp14. Note that the amino acid residues around position 203 of

229

nsp14 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are well conserved (Supplementary fig 6A). Residue 203 is

230

exposed on the surface of the protein and is located in the loop stretching from residues 200 to 214

where is in the interstices of zinc and magnesium binding sites (positions 207 and 191, respectively,

232

Fig 6). We found that the loop is close to the amino acids 1-58, which constitutes an interaction

233

surface for binding a co-factor, SARS-CoV nsp10 (Supplementary fig 6B) (Ogando, et al. 2020). It

234

was reported that the interaction with nsp10 greatly increases nucleolytic activity of SARS-CoV nsp14

235

(Bouvet, et al. 2012). Therefore, we investigated the possibility that residues at or around position 203

236

play an important role in nsp10-nsp14 interaction. We searched the interaction interface using SARS-

237

CoV nsp14-nsp10 complex structure (PDB ID: 5C8S) (Ma, et al. 2015) by focusing the residues

238

around position 203. Residues 199-203 (VKIGP) of the nsp14 were identified as a part of interaction

239

interface. However, the detailed analysis of the protein complex showed that the residues 200 and 201

240

alone bound directly to the residues 9 and 21 of the nsp10 which are also well conserved between

241

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary fig 6A). These results suggest that the residue 203 may

242

support binding to nsp10 indirectly by constituting the interaction interface around residues 200 and

243

201. We further predicted the impact of the P203L mutation on protein-protein binding affinity using

244

BeAtMuSiC program (Dehouck, et al. 2013), and found that the mutation decreases the binding

245

affinity of the protein (0.38 kcal/mol). The mutation of P to L increases hydrophobicity at the position

246

203 (Supplementary fig 6C and 6D), which might alter the local structure afforded by the residues

247

around position 203, and lead to a change in the affinity between nsp14 and nsp10.

Discussion

250

In this study, we found that nsp14 was well conserved in highly diversified CoVs (Fig 2), and

251

that 379 out of the 527 amino acid sites of nsp14 of the 62 representative CoVs were under negative

252

selection (Supplementary fig 1). For SARS-CoV-2, we found that 92.27% of the viruses had an nsp14

253

amino acid sequence that was identical to the reference sequence in all of the genome sequences

254

examined in this study (Table 1). We found that the nsp14-P203L variants showing a higher nucleotide

255

substitution rate did not increase steadily over time (0.09% in the current population, Table 1),

256

although they appeared multiple times. In fact, the nsp14-nsp10 complex of SARS-CoV suggests that

257

the amino acid residue at position 203 of nsp14 could be important to interact with nsp10, around

258

which amino acids are well conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Supplementary fig 6A).

259

The nsp14-P203L mutants were suggest to weakly interact with nsp10 (Supplementary fig 6C and 6D),

260

possibly resulting in reduction of the proofreading activity of nsp14. Overall, these results suggest the

261

biological importance of nsp14 in various CoVs including SARS-CoV-2, and that nsp14 mutations

262

may have deleterious effects on the survival of these viruses. In RNA viruses, rapid mutation and

263

substitution rates are sometimes beneficial because certain mutations allow them to survive in various

264

situations (Mansky and Cunningham 2000; Vignuzzi, et al. 2006; Holmes 2009; Duffy 2018).

265

However, in CoVs, high mutation rates may not be preferred, which may be beneficial for the

266

development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.

267

The frequency of nucleotide substitutions of CoVs may be affected not only by the nsp14

268

proofreading mechanism but also by the characteristics of other proteins, such as fidelity of RNA-

269

dependent RNA polymerase (nonstructural protein 12; nsp12) (Graepel, et al. 2017). In addition, the

270

proofreading activity of nsp14 is also affected by the amino acid substitution of nsp10, which

271

contributes to its interaction with nsp14 (Bouvet, et al. 2012). It is possible that amino acid

272

replacements in other proteins involved in genome replication, rather than nsp14-203L, actually

273

affected the nucleotide substitution rates of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, amino acid replacements were

274

examined among nsp14-203L variants with the following genes being involved in gene replication:

275

nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, nsp15, and nsp16. As result, proline-to-lysine replacement at

276

position 323 (P323L) of nsp12 was frequently found (20/25) in sequences of SARS-CoV-2 possessing

277

nsp14-203L (Supplemental table 6). However, the P323L mutation in nsp12 (nsp12-P323L) is known

278

to accompany an aspartate-to-glycine replacement at position 614 (D614G) of S protein (Hou, et al.

279

2020; Korber, et al. 2020). The S-D614G mutant was first reported in the end of January 2020 in China

280

and Germany, and after March 2020, the mutant is major variant in various regions in all over the

281

world (Korber, et al. 2020). Therefore, P323L mutation nsp12 was found in nsp14-203L variants as

282

well. Indeed, the genomic mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 with the P323L amino acid replacement in

283

nsp12, was found to be 17.7 nucleotide mutations per year (Supplemental fig 7). Therefore, it is

284

unlikely that the P323L in nsp12 directly affects the genomic mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 with the

285

P203L amino acid replacement in nsp14.

286

According to previous reports, SARS-CoV-2 base substitutions are mostly C to U nucleotide

287

substitutions (Simmonds 2020). Our analysis also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has many C to U

288

nucleotide substitutions (Supplemental table 7). Furthermore, it was clarified that there are many

289

nucleotide substitutions from C to U in the nucleotide substitution in the population possessing nsp14-

290

P203L (Supplemental table 7). These results suggest that the proofreading activities of nsp14-203P

291

and nsp14-203L may not have nucleotide preferences.

292

It is known that alanine substitution of an amino acid that is important for the proofreading

293

activity of nsp14 of SARS-CoV increases viral genomic mutations in cultured cell (Eckerle, et al.

294

2010; Smith, et al. 2013) and in vivo (Graham, et al. 2012). In addition, Graham et al. reported that the

295

SARS-CoV virus is attenuated by alanine replacement of an amino acid that is important for the

296

proofreading activity of nsp14 (Graham, et al. 2012). The effects of amino acid replacements in nsp14

297

on coronavirus infections, which have been found in nature, have not been investigated to date. In our

298

study, the candidates that might affect nsp14 function were searched by focusing on the amino acid

299

replacements of nsp14 in epidemic viruses and comparing genomic mutation rates; subsequently, we

300

proposed candidates for amino acid replacements that may affect viral properties. However, the

301

molecular mechanisms underlying the amino acid replacements in SARS-CoV-2 suggested by our

302

study are unclear. Further studies are required to clarify the effects of the candidate amino acids on the

303

properties of CoVs. In conclusion, we propose that rare amino acid replacements (particularly leucine

304

at amino acid site 203) in coronavirus nsp14 may increase the rate of genomic mutations.

Methods

417

Coronavirus sequence data

418

Amino acid sequences of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of the 62 representative CoVs

419

(summarized in Supplementary Table 1) were obtained from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

420

and the GISAID EpiCoV database (https://www.gisaid.org) as reported previously (Nakagawa and

421

Miyazawa 2020). Aligned nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and their metadata were obtained

422

from the GISAID EpiCoV database as of September 7, 2020 (87,625 sequences). The CoV genome

423

sequences of which host were annotated as “Human” were extracted, and sequences containing

424

undetermined and/or mixed nucleotides were removed. The 28,082 remaining genomes were used for

425

the analyses. The open reading frame (ORF) of each sequence was determined from the alignment

426

sequence based on the ORF information of hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (GISAID ID:

427

EPI_ISL_402125, GenBank ID: NC_045512.2), which was used as the reference sequence. We then

428

removed the gaps from the alignment and translated the nucleotide sequences. To detect amino acid

429

replacements for each site, the amino acid sequence after the stop codon was removed and amino acid

430

sequences were aligned using the L-INS-i program in MAFFT version v7.453 (Katoh and Standley

431

2013). From the sequence alignment of nsp14 of the representative CoVs, the amino acids aligned at

432

the amino acid positions of SARS-CoV are shown using WebLogo 3 (Crooks, et al. 2004). Note that,

433

in the alignment sequence, gap sites were removed based on the SARS-CoV nsp14 sequence.

434
435

Molecular evolutionary phylogenetic analysis

436

To compute phylogenetic tree of nsp14 of the 62 representative CoVs, their nsp14 amino acid

437

sequences were aligned using the L-INS-i program in MAFFT version 7.453 (Katoh and Standley

438

2013). To estimate the appropriate amino acid replacement model, we used ProtTest3 version 3.4.2

439

(Darriba, et al. 2011) based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values. We then computed a

440

phylogenetic tree using RAxML-NG version 1.0.0 (Kozlov, et al. 2019) with rapid 1000 bootstrap

441

replicates (Lanave, et al. 1984).

442

We also generated a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 genomes belonging to the Pangolin

443

lineages B.1.1.33 including nsp14-P203L variants. Using CD-HIT-EST version 4.8.1 (Li and Godzik

444

2006), the identical genomic sequences were removed: from 200 to 142 sequences. The 142 nucleotide

445

sequences were aligned by the L-INS-i program in MAFFT version 7.453 (Katoh and Standley 2013).

446

To estimate the appropriate nucleotide substitution model, we used ModelTest-NG (Darriba, et al.

447

2020) based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values, and GTR+I+G4 was selected. We then

448

computed a phylogenetic tree using RAxML-NG version 1.0.0 (Kozlov, et al. 2019) with rapid 1000

449

bootstrap replicates (Lanave, et al. 1984).

450
451
452

Mutation rate analysis

453

A multiple sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from the GISAID

454

database was used to analyze the genomic mutation rate. The number of nucleotide substitutions per

455

site from between sequences was counted. Analyses were conducted using the Kimura 2-parameter

456

model. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All gaps were removed for each

457

sequence pair with a pairwise deletion option. Counting of the number of nucleotide substitution was

458

conducted in MEGA X (Kumar, et al. 2018). The hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (GISAID ID:

459

EPI_ISL_402125, GenBank ID: NC_045512.2) was selected as the reference sequence. Sequences

460

with the information on the collection date were used for the analysis. Note that we omitted sequences

461

that were collected before December 26, 2019, the date on which the reference sequences were

Structural analysis

473

A PDB file (5C8S) of the SARS-CoV nsp14-nsp10 complex was obtained from the PDB database

474

(https://www.rcsb.org). Using chains C and D of the structure, further analyses were performed. The

475

residues at the interface of the SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp14 docked complex were determined using the

476

“InterfaceResidues” PyMol script (http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/InterfaceResidues/). We

477

used the SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp14 docked complex for the prediction of the effect of the P203L

478

mutation

(http://babylone.3bio.ulb.ac.be/beatmusic/query.php) (Dehouck, et al. 2013). P203L mutant
