SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay

ABSTRACT

25

In late 2019 a human coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged, likely from a zoonotic

26

reservoir. This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to

27

hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and

28

ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit

29

morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-

30

SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be

31

limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order

32

to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are

33

required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent

34

RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro. 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral

35

therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle

36

cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify

37

inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived

38

protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CLpro. This experimentally optimized reporter assay

39

allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-

40

throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug

41

libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2

42

replication and spread.

IMPORTANCE

46

The COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 400,000 deaths and innumerable changes

47

to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals

48

to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires

49

efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present

50

a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. This reporter-based

51

assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with

52

high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis. This assay may help identify novel

53

antivirals to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay
55

INTRODUCTION

56

In December 2019, a novel human coronavirus (hCoV) was identified in the Hubei Province of

57

China (1–3). The virus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, causes the transmissible and pathogenic

58

disease COVID-19 (4). COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and infected over 8 million

59

people and caused ~500,000 deaths to date (5). Current efforts to control COVID-19 are largely

60

focused on behavioral modifications such as social distancing and the use of masks (6). These

61

approaches attempt to slow the spread of the virus, but meaningful control of the virus will

62

ultimately be the result of a combination of efficacious vaccines and antiviral therapeutics (7).

63
64

Antiviral therapeutics aim to disrupt the replication cycle and reduce viral load in infected

65

individuals. Therapeutic development efforts have led to a number of candidate antiviral

66

compounds focused mainly on two essential viral enzymes, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

67

(RdRp) and the viral proteases. Remdesivir (GS-5734), recently FDA approved as an antiviral for

68

SARS-CoV-2, targets the polymerase to suppress hCoV replication by inducing termination of

69

RNA polymerization (8); however, the benefits of this drug in clinical trials and early use appear

70

limited (9). Another nucleoside analogue, β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-1931), also

71

inhibits SARS-CoV-2 polymerase activity, likely via inducing lethal mutagenesis of the viral

72

genome (10). In addition to the RdRp, the viral proteases, which are critical to liberate individual

73

viral proteins from the polyprotein produced by initial genome translation, present another

74

attractive drug target. For SARS-CoV-2, lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor combination, is

75

shown to interact with the main coronavirus protease, known as 3CLpro or Mpro (11); however,

76

early clinical trial results with these compounds have shown no significant benefits to SARS-CoV-

77

2 patients (12). More recently, structure-based design has enabled the rapid development of new

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay
78

antivirals targeting the SARS-CoV-2 protease, 3CLpro (13–15). At this time, these newly designed

79

compounds are in the early stages of testing. Thus, the discovery of additional effective SARS-

80

CoV-2 antiviral drugs remains of high importance. The identification (and subsequent

81

improvement) of novel drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 will require robust and high-throughput

82

screening approaches.

83
84

Here, we report the development and validation of a fluorescent reporter optimized to detect

85

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity. This assay is performed in human cell culture and does not require

86

biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment. Our reporter is based on FlipGFP, which only fluoresces

87

after protease mediated activation (16). We generated and tested three reporter constructs with

88

distinct cleavage target sequences for activation by the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. We also show that

89

the reporter with the best signal-to-noise ratio for SARS-CoV-2 is also activatable by other

90

coronavirus 3CLpro proteins across subgroups (beta, alpha, gamma) and host species (human,

91

rodent, bird). Finally, we used this reporter to test the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with

92

a known coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376 (17), and then validated the correlation between

93

reporter inhibition and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. These experiments together

94

demonstrate the utility of this approach for the identification of novel antiviral drugs that target

95

the SAR-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro.

RESULTS

98

Generation of a fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity reporter

99

In order to develop a fluorescent reporter responsive to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, we started

100

with the FlipGFP protein (16). FlipGFP is used to detect protease activity by expressing the GFP

beta-strands b10-11 separately from, and in a conformation incompatible with, the rest of the GFP

102

beta-barrel, b1-9 (Fig. 1A). A linker containing a cleavage site holds the two GFP beta strands, 10

103

and 11, in an inactive, parallel conformation. When the appropriate protease is present the linker

104

containing the cleavage site is cut. This cleavage allows GFP b11 to reorient such that GFP b10

105

and 11 are antiparallel and able to fit into GFP b1-9, inducing fluorescence ~100-fold over

106

background (16).

107
108

SARS-CoV-2 generates two proteases that cleave the viral polyprotein, a papain-like protease

109

(PLpro) and a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). 3CLpro, also known as the main protease or

110

Mpro, is the more conserved viral protease, with only 5 amino acid changes between SARS/SARS-

111

like CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 compared to the 102 differences found in PLpro (18). 3CLpro cleaves

112

at a highly conserved consensus sequence, LQ¯, across the coronavirus family (19), and has been

113

shown to effectively cleave luciferase-based protease biosensors (20, 21) and FRET-based assays

114

(13, 17, 22–28). With the aim of generating a protease reporter compatible with SARS-CoV-2 and

115

other present and future coronaviruses to support viral inhibitor screening, we selected the CoV

116

3CLpro as our protease target.

117
118

Although the CoV 3CLpro requires the minimal consensus sequence LQ¯ for cleavage, the

119

cleavage site context influences cleavage efficiency (29). Among the CoV polyprotein cleavage

120

sites, 3CLpro targeted sites surrounding the 3CLpro sequence itself are generally cleaved most

121

efficiently (30). Additionally, different CoVs have distinctive optimal cleavage site sequences

122

(24). In order to develop an efficiently cleaved CoV 3CLpro reporter, we tested three different

123

cleavage sequences predicted to be highly compatible with the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Fig. 1A).

cleaved by many CoV family members (24). As a negative control, we also generated a construct

128

harboring the Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site.

129
130

Our goal was to identify a construct with minimal background fluorescence while still being

131

efficiently cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, allowing strong fluorescence for detection via

132

microscopy, plate reader, or flow cytometry. To test our 3CLpro reporters, we co-transfected each

133

reporter with a SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro expression plasmid. At 48 hours post-transfection, we could

134

detect GFP-positive cells with each of the three CoV reporters transfected with in the SARS-CoV-

135

2 3CLpro (Fig. 1B). In contrast, with transfection of a negative control, nucleoprotein protein from

136

an H1N1 influenza virus (A/PR8/1934 NP), we did not detect any signal above background levels

137

of fluorescence. Further, the reporter containing the TEV cleavage site was not activated by SARS-

138

CoV-2 3CLpro (Fig. 1B). Quantification of the fluorescent signal across all of the treatment

139

conditions demonstrated that while all three CoV reporters showed significant induction of GFP

140

signal when co-expressed with the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, CoV reporter 2 had substantial

141

background and the level of induction with the CoV reporter 1 reached only half of the other two

142

CoV reporters (Fig. 1C). With a 100-fold change in fluorescence and minimal background, we

143

selected CoV reporter 3 for further testing.

144
145

Many CoV 3CLpro proteins activate the FlipGFP CoV 3CLpro reporter

146

CoV 3CLpro proteins are reasonably conserved across coronavirus groups (Fig. 2A) (33). Further,

147

CoV reporter 3 was based on an optimized cleavage sequence for CoV 3CLpros from each

148

coronavirus group (24). To test whether this protease reporter was compatible with a variety of

with a plate reader demonstrated that SARS-CoV (Beta, human) and avian infectious bronchitis

154

(IBV- Gamma, avian) resulted in similar levels of fluorescence to SARS-CoV-2 (Beta, human)

155

(Fig. 2C). Murine hepatitis virus (MHV- Beta, murine) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-

156

229E- Alpha, human) were less compatible with CoV reporter 3, while still producing 12- and 80-

157

fold changes in fluorescence, respectively, over background (Fig. 2C). These experiments show

158

our FlipGFP 3CLpro reporter is generally compatible with many CoV 3CLpro proteins across

159

coronavirus groups and host species, potentially enabling protease inhibitor screening for a variety

160

of CoVs in addition to SARS-CoV-2.

161
162

Development of a FlipGFP CoV 3CLpro reporter-based assay for in vivo protease inhibitor

163

screening

164

To develop an assay for protease inhibitor screening using our CoV reporter 3, we first needed to

165

optimize the experimental conditions. We performed a transfection timecourse with SARS-CoV-

166

2 3CLpro to determine an early, appropriate timepoint for sample collection (Fig. 3A). At 12 hours

167

post-transfection, only a few GFP fluorescing cells are visible and fluorescent signal is just above

168

background (Fig. 3B). At 24 hours post-transfection, green cells are visible without appreciable

169

background signaling (Fig. 3B). At 48 hours post-infection, most cells produce a high GFP signal,

170

with some background fluorescence detectable (Fig. 3B). We therefore selected the 24 hour post-

171

transfection timepoint. To increase the sensitivity of our assay, we titrated the level of SARS-CoV-

172

2 3CLpro transfected with CoV reporter 3; our goal was to maximize activation of the reporter

173

while minimizing the amount of protease available in the cell. We transfected cells with five ratios

174

of reporter-to-protease: 1:1, 1:0.8, 1:0.4, 1:0.2, and 1:0. 24 hours post-transfection, we observed

significant decreases in reporter activation at reporter-to-protease ratios 1:0.4 and 1:0.2 (Fig. 3C).

177

However, a 1:0.8 reporter-to-protease ratio resulted in no significant loss of fluorescence compared

178

to a 1:1 ratio (Fig. 3C). Based on these experiments together, we selected a 1:0.8 reporter-to-

179

protease ratio for transfection and a 24-hour post-transfection end point as the optimal conditions

180

for our protease inhibitor assay using the FlipGFP 3CLpro reporter, CoV reporter 3.

181
182

Finally, we wanted to verify that our assay could detect drug inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro

183

with a known inhibitor. Therefore, we selected a recognized pan-coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitor,

184

GC376, to test our assay (17). Four concentrations of GC376, that did not significantly impact cell

185

viability compared to vehicle alone, were applied to cells at the time of transfection with CoV

186

reporter 3 and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. As expected, reporter activity levels were maintained at the

187

lower protease inhibitor concentrations, while fluorescence was reduced at the higher

188

concentrations of GC376 (Fig. 3D). Thus, our assay successfully detected inhibition of SARS-

189

CoV-3 3CLpro by the protease inhibitor GC376. However, it is also important to verify that

190

inhibition of our reporter is strongly correlated with inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We

191

infected VeroE6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 before applying protease inhibitor at

192

the same four concentrations as tested with the protease reporter. 24 hours post infection, we

193

collected RNA and performed RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA; similar to the reporter,

194

viral RNA levels were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3E). Our observed inhibition

195

of the virus is consistent with reports of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by GC376 in the literature (22,

196

23). All together, these experiments demonstrate feasibility of using our FlipGFP CoV 3CLpro

197

reporter assay to identify protease-targeting inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay
199

DISCUSSION

200

Our goal for this study was to develop a cell-based assay to screen for novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral

201

drugs at BSL2; to our knowledge, no such assay optimized for SARS-CoV-2 currently exists.

202

Therefore, we generated a reporter requiring a coronavirus protease, 3CLpro, for activation of a

203

GFP-fluorescent signal. We showed this reporter is responsive to the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, in

204

addition to many different coronavirus 3CLpro proteins. After optimizing screening conditions, we

205

demonstrated that our reporter was sensitive to treatment with a known coronavirus protease

206

inhibitor, GC376. These experiments illustrate the utility of our approach to identify, and

207

subsequently optimize, novel protease inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.

208
209

To meet the demands of virus research during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, reporter assays need

210

to be flexible and high-throughout. Our reporter is activated with expression of a single CoV

211

protein, 3CLpro, allowing for SARS-CoV-2 drug testing at BSL2. Additionally, the reporter is

212

compatible with many CoV 3CLpro proteins, supporting rapid testing of inhibitors against a variety

213

of coronaviruses, present or future, and without synthesis of protease substrates or purification of

214

viral proteins (13, 17, 22–28). Further, as our assay is performed in living cells, our system enables

215

the discovery of protease inhibitors while simultaneously evaluating effects on cellular viability.

216

Our assay is scalable, and the analysis requires only a basic fluorescent plate reader, supporting

217

high-throughput screening. In addition to applications in drug discovery pipelines, this assay could

218

be deployed to determine targets of antivirals identified via viral screening.

219
220

Reporter assays, including ours, also have limitations. Our reporter utilizes the CoV 3CLpro

221

expressed alone; during a CoV infection the protease is only one of dozens of viral proteins present,

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay
222

and any inhibitors that may affect cross-viral protein interactions would be missed. Additionally,

223

CoV infection induces significant cellular membrane rearrangements that transfection of the

224

protease alone does not. Thus, the subcellular access of therapeutic compounds to the viral protease

225

may fail to be reflected in our assay, and the effects of an identified protease inhibitor could

226

significantly differ when applied to authentic viral infection. Finally, although this plasmid-based

227

expression presents many advantages, it also necessitates further screen hit testing in the context

228

of coronavirus infection. Although the correlation between our reporter and inhibition of viral

229

infection was appreciable with the drug GC376, testing of more inhibitors is required to make

230

generalizable correlations between our reporter assay and viral infection readouts.

231
232

To have the greatest impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral needs

233

to be identified as early as possible. Countries around the world have taken drastic and necessary

234

steps to limit the spread of virus, yet infection rates continue to rise in some. An antiviral treatment

235

is unlikely to stop the spread of infection, but it is likely to limit the mortality associated with

236

SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is our hope that this reporter assay facilitates the identification of SARS-

237

CoV-2 protease inhibitor candidates to be rapidly optimized and translated to clinical use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

240

Cell culture. All cells were obtained from ATCC and grown at 37°C in 5% CO2. 293T cells were

241

grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine

242

serum, GlutaMAX, and penicillin-streptomycin. VeroE6 cells were grown in MEM supplemented

243

with 10% fetal bovine serum, pyruvate, NEAA and penicillin-streptomycin. For transfection, 24

244

hours before plates were poly-lysine treated and seeded with 293Ts. The next day, plasmid DNA,

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay
245

Opti-MEM, and TransIT-LT (Mirus) were combined using pipetting and incubated at room

246

temperature for 20min before being added to cells by droplet.

247
248

Plasmids. All constructs were cloned into the pLex expression vector using the BamHI and NotI

249

restriction sites and DNA assembly (NEB). Coronavirus 3CLpro expression plasmids (SARS-CoV-

250

2, SARS-CoV, MHV, IBV, HCoV-229E) were generated using codon-optimized gBlocks (IDT).

251

The TEV control FlipGFP was designed to include a silent NheI restriction site ahead of the TEV

252

cleavage sequence and generated using a gBlock (IDT). The coronavirus 3CLpro FlipGFP reporters

253

(CoV reporter 1, CoV reporter 2, CoV reporter 3) were generated using forward primers containing

254

the cleavage sequences along with the initial FlipGFP reverse primer, and assembled into the NheI

255

and NotI digested control FlipGFP plasmid. DNA was transformed into NEB 5-alpha high

256

efficiency competent cells (NEB). Insert size was verified with PCR and purified plasmids were

257

sequenced using Sanger sequencing.

258
259

Imaging and Quantification. Cells were fixed with 2% PFA at room temperature for 20 min before

260

incubating in 1:10,000 Hoescht 33342 (Life Technologies) in PBS at 4oC overnight. Images were

261

obtained using the ZOE Fluorescent Cell Imager (Bio-Rad). Quantification was performed using

262

the CellInsight CX5 (Thermo Scientific).

263
264

Cytotoxicity Assays. 24 hours before treatment, plates were poly-lysine treated and seeded with

265

293T or VeroE6 cells. The next day, media was exchanged for complete media containing GC376

266

(MedKoo) at the indicated concentrations using a constant level of vehicle (DMSO). After 24

270

SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Viral qPCR. 24 hours before infection, plates were poly-lysine

271

treated and seeded with VeroE6 cells. The next day, the cells were washed with PBS before

272

infection with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 from BEI Resources in 2% FBS MEM

273

infection media at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 hour. Virus was removed and cells were then placed in

274

infection media containing GC376 (MedKoo) at the indicated concentrations using a constant level

275

of vehicle (DMSO). 24 hours post-infection, cells were collected in TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed

276

by RNA isolation. One-step RT-qPCR was performed with primers targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N

277

region (BEI) using the EXPRESS One-Step Superscript qRT-PCR Kit (ThermoFisher) on an

278

Applied Biosystems QuantStudio3 instrument. RNA was normalized using an endogenous 18S

279

rRNA primer/probe set (Applied Biosystems).
