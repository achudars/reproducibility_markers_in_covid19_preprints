Impact of mutations on the evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are

18

needed for ongoing global efforts to track and trace the current pandemic, in order to enact effective prevention and

19

treatment options. SARS-Co-V-2 viral genomes were detected and sequenced from 18 Romanian patients suffering

20

from coronavirus disease-2019. Viral Spike S glycoprotein sequences were used to generate model structures and

21

assess the role of mutations on protein stability. We integrated the phylogenetic tree within the available European

22

SARS-Co-V-2 genomic sequences. We further provide an epidemiological overview of the pre-existing conditions

23

that are lethal in relevant Romanian patients. Non-synonymous mutations in the viral Spike glycoprotein relating to

24

infectivity are constructed in models of protein structures. Continuing search to limit and treat SARS-CoV-2 benefit

25

from our contribution in delineating the viral Spike glycoprotein mutations, as well as from assessment of their role

26

on protein stability or complex formation with human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Our results help

27

implement and extend worldwide genomic surveillance of coronavirus disease-2019.

Introduction

34

In December 2019, in China, an outbreak started due to a novel coronavirus strain that causes a

35

severe illness, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus, SARS-CoV-2, has since

36

spread globally [1]. Data reported to European Center for Disease Control show that clinical

37

presentation of COVID-19 ranges from no symptoms to severe pneumonia, and that many cases

38

have led to death [2]. According to available data, 32 % of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the

39

EU/EEA have been hospitalized, and 4% thereof had severe form of illness [3]. Additionally,

40

hospitalization rates have been significantly higher for adults 65 years and older [4]. The first

41

positive case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Romania was confirmed on 26th of February

42

2020. With the ongoing spread of the virus, it is becoming critical to detect and classify the virus

43

in patient samples. As such, full genome characterization of this virus is instrumental for

44

updating diagnostics criteria and assessing viral evolution. To assess its genetic variation in a

45

South-Eastern European population, we herein generated genome sequences using metagenomic

46

sequencing, from 18 Romanian patients. We delineated the non-synonymous mutations and

47

constructed models of the protein structures from these sequences. We explicitly focused on the

48

spike (S) glycoprotein because it mediates infection of human cells, and is the main target of

49

most vaccine strategies and antibody-based therapeutics [5].

Materials and Methods

51

Collection and processing of samples

52

Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from individuals from different

53

Romanian geographical areas. Total nucleic acid extraction was performed using the Maxwell®

54

RSC Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega, USA) as described by the

55

manufacturer. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected using the E gene assay as the first-line

56

screening tool, followed by confirmatory testing with the RdRp gene assay [6]. The RiboZero

57

Gold rRNA depletion protocol was used to remove human cytoplasmic and mitochondrial rRNA.

58

The total RNA quantity and integrity were measured with the Qubit RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen,

59

Carlsbad, CA, USA). The TrueSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit along with the

60

IDT for Illumina TruSeq RNA UD Indexes were used for sequencing-ready library preparation.

61

RNA fragmentation, first and second-strand cDNA synthesis, adenylation, adapter ligation and

62

amplification were done according to the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA protocol. After

63

amplification, the prepared libraries were quantified, pooled and loaded onto Illumina MiSeq

64

DNA Sequencer. Sequence data from each sample was aligned to the SAR-CoV-2 reference

65

genome (GenBank accession number: NC_045512.2) and variants called using SeqMan NGen

66

(DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). Alignments were manually inspected to confirm variant calls

67

and the viral sequence from each sample exported with SeqMan Pro (DNASTAR).

68

Data mining for structures

69

Atomic coordinates of the template, the novel SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in complex with

70

Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2),

71

PDB: 6LZG, were retrieved from RCSB protein data bank. Spike protein sequences from our

72

genomes were modeled using I-Tasser [7] and the quality of models of Spike S proteins was

73

assessed with MolProbity [8]. Full length models were superimposed over template and root

74

mean square deviations (RMSD) of carbon alpha backbones were determined using PyMol

75

(PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC).

76

Mutational analyses and molecular docking

77

Site Directed Mutator (http://marid.bioc.cam.ac.uk/sdm2/) was used to assess the impact of non-

78

synonymous single, double or triple mutations on the protein stability and to determine the ઢઢG

79

values for each protein. For mutations in the Spike protein binding site to RBD from ACE2, the

80

difference in protein stability between Spike protein:RBD complex and Spike protein alone is

81

indicated. For in silico docking, the HawkDock server (http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/hawkdock/) was

82

used to conduct docking simulations between our modeled Spike S protein structures and ACE2.

83

All molecular structures were visualized with PyMol.

We performed real time RT-PCR tests on 32233 individuals, starting on 16.02.2020 until

87

22.06.2020, and summarized the data in Table 1. We compared our data to public information on

88

national testing relevant for this pandemic, valid at the time of writing.

A recent analysis of risk factors in Romanian patients was performed for a subset of 842

93

deceased individuals or 7.1 % out of a subset of 11790 confirmed cases (data accessed on May

94

23rd, 2020) [10]. For both sexes, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions were 2.89

95

times more likely to succumb than patients who were not affected by this type of illness.

96

Importantly, the next categories of patients who died were suffering from chronic renal diseases

97

(death more probable by 2.69) and diabetes (by 2.3 times). Given the high expression and

98

circulating levels of hACE2 in the heart and kidneys, these findings support a mechanism

99

whereby Spike glycoprotein may attach to hACE2 in a dose-response manner. We also note that

100

102

103

when suffering with chronic renal diseases (Odds Ratio of 4.3). This finding may reflect possible

An overview of the 7 mutations of the Spike proteins detected from Romanian sequence is

125

presented in the structure of Figure 2 and listed in Table 2. We note that only the N439K variant

126

is involved in the binding interface, where the lysine now H-bonds with Gln 325 from the

127

hACE2. Mutants included single, double and triple Spike protein variants. The impact of the

128

mutations on the stability of the complexes made with hACE2 is also indicated in Table 2.

hACE2 is also indicated in Table 2. Although all mutants have negative (favorable) binding

142

energy, compared to the native complex, only the triple mutant has a significantly higher value

143

(60% increase). We note that the double mutant N439K, D614G that directly affects the binding

144

interface, has only negligible positive effect on binding, but ranks above the rest of the variants.

Mutations in the spike surface glycoprotein may be conducive to conformational changes, which

151

can translate into changing antigenicity. As such, identifying the amino acids involved in

152

conformational changes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike surface glycoprotein structure is essential to

153

inform on patterns of mutations subject to positive selection. The role of detected mutations on

154

overall thermodynamic stability of the protein variants is thus imperative, as shown in Table 3.

Spike D614G variant has been the most widespread mutant encountered thus far in the 2020

159

genome datasets outside East Europe (3577 counts in GISAID database) [13]. D614G mutation

160

is embedded into an immunodominant antibody epitope and is recognized by monoclonal

161

antibodies isolated from recovered individuals, who had been infected with the original SARS-

162

CoV [14]. A very recent experimental study comparing Spike variants D614G against D614S

163

indicates that the former is less stable thermodynamically, which translates into markedly

164

increased infectivity of ACE-2 expressing cells, consistent with epidemiological data.15

165

Furthermore, pseudoviruses containing both of these variants were neutralized with comparable

166

efficiency by convalescent plasma [14]. However, another recent study demonstrated that Spike

167

variant D614G significantly infects ACE-2 expressing cells, when compared to the native Spike

168

protein, and that convalescent sera showed decreased neutralizing activity against D614G

pseudovirus [16]. Given these factors, this mutant could mediate immune avoidance, although

170

there is as-yet no definite clinical data to correlate the impact of this or any other mutation on

171

infectivity. We note that none of the other mutations we describe have been found thus far in

172

other cohorts, and that other mutations are themselves rare [13]. Tracking mutations in viral

173

Spike glycoprotein continues to be paramount for vaccine and antibody therapy strategies that

174

are currently being developed, and on evaluating new SARS-CoV-2 strains as they emerge and

175

evolve.
