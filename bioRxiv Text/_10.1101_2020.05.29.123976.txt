Abstract
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) has caused an unprecedented pandemic. Since the first sequenced
whole-genome of SARS-CoV-2 on January 2020, the identification of its genetic
variants has become crucial in tracking and evaluating their spread across the
globe.
In this study, we compared 134,905 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from all
affected countries since the outbreak of this novel coronavirus with the first
sequenced genome in Wuhan, China to quantify the evolutionary divergence of
SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we compared the codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-2 genes
encoding the membrane protein (M), envelope (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S),
nucleoprotein (N), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The polyproteins
ORF1a and ORF1b were examined separately.
We found that SARS-CoV-2 tends to diverge over time by accumulating
mutations on its genome and, specifically, on the sequences encoding proteins N
and S. Interestingly, different patterns of codon usage were observed among these
genes. Genes S and N tend to use a narrower set of synonymous codons that are
better optimized to the human host. Conversely, genes E and M consistently use
the broader set of synonymous codons, which does not vary in respect to the
reference genome. CAI and SiD time evolutions show a tendency to decrease that
emerge for most genes. Forsdyke plots are used to study the nature of mutations
and they show a rapid evolutionary divergence of each gene, due to the low values
of x-intercepets.

Introduction

The recent emergence of the novel, human pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid spread poses a
global health emergency. On March 11 2020, WHO publicly declared the
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a pandemic.

SARS-CoV2 belongs to Coronaviridae family, with a genome around 30 kb in
length and a structure characteristic of known coronaviruses. The virus genome
encodes for structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins [12]. The four
structural proteins are the envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M), the
nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike glycoprotein (S). ORF1ab gene encodes for
the two isoforms of the poliprotein complex pp1a and pp1ab, where the first is the
intial segment of the latter, which are further proteolytically cleaved to produce 16
different non-structural proteins. [1], [2], [3].
The nucleocapsid protein plays an important role in maintaining the RNA
conformation stable for the replication, transcription, and translation of the viral
genome along with protecting the viral genome [9]. It is highly immunogenic and
capable of modulating the metabolism of an infected cell [9]. The envelope protein
acts as a viroporin [15] and plays multiple roles in viral replication and signaling
pathways that affect inflammatory and type 1 INF γ signaling [13]. The spike
protein S is responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion that leads
to viral entry into the host cells [23]. Finally, the membrane protein is associated
with the spike protein and is responsible for the virus budding process [8].
Characterization of viral mutations can provide valuable information for
assessing the mechanisms linked to pathogenesis, immune evasion and viral drug
resistance. In addition, viral mutation studies can be crucial for the design of new
vaccines, antiviral drugs and diagnostic tests. The mutation rate of RNA viruses
(10−5 − 10−3 per replication cycle [10]) is dramatically higher than their
mammalian hosts (10−9 per year [11]). This high mutation rate is correlated with
virulence modulation and evolvability, which are considered beneficial for viral
adaptation [4].
According to data from the public database Global Initiative on Sharing All
Influenza Data (GISAID), seven major clades of SARS-CoV-2 can be identified
and are referred to as clade V (variant of the ORF3a-G251V and of NSP6-L37F),
and clade S (variant ORF8-L84S and NSP4:S76S), clade G (variant of the spike
protein S-D614G and of NSP12b-P314L), and the subclades GH and GR, that
have an additional mutation to the G ones (respectively, ORF3a-Q57H and
N-RG203KR), and finally the GV that presents both G and V mutations [6, 7]. In
particular, Giorgi et al., showed that clade G, the most spread of all clades but
prevalent in Europe, carries a D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which is
responsible for the initial interaction of the virus with the host human cells [7] .
In the present study, we investigated the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genomes
and codon usage patterns over time, as well as virus adaptation to the human host.
For this purpose, we focused on the four SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding the
structural proteins membrane (M), envelope (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S)
and nucleoprotein (N), as well as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and
the two segments of polyproteins ORF1ab separately, ORF1a and ORF1b.

Materials and Methods
Sequence data analyzed

All available SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported across the world were obtained from
GISAID (available at
https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/nexthcov-19-app/), on December 4,
2020. Then, the sequences were classified according to their isolation dates. Only
complete genomes (29-30 Kb) were included in the present analysis, with a list of
134,905 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We used the SARS-CoV-2 coding DNA sequences
(CDSs) deposited in January 2020 by Zhu and coworkers [14], formerly called
“Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus”, also referred to as ”Wuhan-Hu-1”
(WSM, NC 045512.2), as reference sequence. We retrieved these sequences from
NCBI public database at https : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The coding DNA
sequences (CDS) of the reference SARS CoV-2 genome (NC 045512.2) were used

to retrieve the homologous protein-coding sequences from the genomes under
study, by using Exonerate with default parameters [16].

2.2

Relative Synonymous Codon Usage

RSCU vectors for all the genomes were computed by using an in-house Python
script, following the formula:
RSCUi =

1
Ni

Xi
Pni

j=1

Xj

(1)

In the RSCUi Xi is the number of occurrences, in a given genome, of codon i,
and the sum in the denominator runs over its ni synonymous codons. If the RSCU
value for a codon i is equal to 1, this codon was chosen equally and randomly.
Codons with RSCU values greater than 1 have positive codon usage bias, while
those with value less than 1 have relatively negative codon usage bias [22].
Stop codons and non-degenerate amino acids have been excluded from the
calculations, making RSCU a 59-component vector.

2.3

Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [38] is a multivariate statistical method to
transform a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly
uncorrelated variables (called principal components) spanning a space of lower
dimensionality. The transformation is defined so that the first principal component
accounts for the largest possible variance of the data, and each subsequent
component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is
orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components.
We use this technique on the space of RSCU vectors, so that each gene of
SARS-COV-2 is represented as a 59-dimensional vector with codons as coordinates.
Such coordinates are separately normalized to zero mean and unit variance over
the whole genome. We then obtain the associated covariance matrix between the
four dimensions of codon bias and diagonalize it. The eigenvectors of the
covariance matrix, ordered according to the magnitude of the corresponding
eigenvalues, are the principal components of the original data.
PCA has been performed by using Pythons sklearn.

2.4

Codon Adaptation Index

The codon adaptation index (CAI) [21, 22] was used to quantify the extent of
codon usage adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human coding sequences. The
principle behind CAI is that the codon usage in highly expressed genes can reveal
the optimal (i.e., most efficient for translation) codons for each amino acid. Hence,
CAI is calculated based on a reference set of highly expressed genes to assess, for
each codon i, the relative synonymous codon usages (RSCUi ) and the relative
codon adaptiveness (wi ):
RSCUi =
1
ni

Xi
ni
P

;

wi =

Xj

RSCUi
;
max {RSCUj }

(2)

j=1,...,ni

j=1

In the RSCUi , Xi is the number of occurrences of codon i in the genome, and
the sum in the denominator runs over the ni synonymous codons. RSCU
measures codon usage bias within a family of synonymous codons. wi is defined as
the usage frequency of codon i compared to that of the optimal codon for the same
amino acid encoded by i (i.e., the the most used one in a reference set of highly
expressed genes). Finally, the CAI value for a given gene g is calculated as the

geometric mean of the usage frequencies of codons in that gene, normalized to the
maximum CAI value possible for a gene with the same amino acid composition:

CAIg = 

lg
Y

1/lg
wi 

,

(3)

i=1

where the product runs over the lg codons belonging to that gene (except the stop
codon).
This index ranges from 0 to 1, where the score 1 represents a greater tendency
of the gene to use optimal codons in the host organism. The CAI analysis was
performed using DAM BE 5.0 [20].

2.5

Similarity Index

The similarity index (SiD) was used to provide a measure of similarity in codon
usage between SARS-CoV-2 and various potential host genomes. Formally, SiD is
defined as follows:
P59
ai · b i
SiD = qP k=1 P
(4)
59
59
2
2
a
·
b
k=1 i
k=1 i
where ai is the RSCU value of 59 synonymous codons of the SARS-CoV-2
coding sequences; bi is the RSCU value of the identical codons of the potential
host. SiD is defined as the cosine value of the angle included between A and B
spatial vectors, and therefore, quantifies the degree of similarity between the virus
and the host in terms of their codon usage patterns. In our analysis, we considered
as host Homo sapiens and the synonymous codon usage data were retrieved from
the codon usage database CUBAP (https://cubap.byu.edu/) [18]. SiD values
range from 0 to 1; the higher the value of SiD, the more adapted the codon usage
of SARS-CoV-2 to the host [25].

2.6

Effective Number of Codons

We calculated the effective number of codons (EN C) to estimate the extent of the
codon usage bias of SARS-CoV-2 genes. The values of EN C range from 23 (when
just one codon is used for each amino acid) to 61 (when all synonymous codons
are equally used for each amino acid) [19]. For each sequence, the computation of
EN C starts from Fα , a quantity defined for each family α of synonymous codons:
Fα =

2
mα 
X
nkα + 1
nα + m α

(5)

k=1

where mα is the number of different codons in α
one appearing
P(each
α
n1α , n2α , ..., nmα times in the sequence) and nα = m
n
k
α.
k=1
Finally, the gene-specific ENC is defined as:
P
P
P
K3 K3 nα
K4 K4 nα
K2 K2 nα
+ PK3 α=1
+ PK4 α=1
EN C = Ns + PK2 α=1
α=1 (nα Fα )
α=1 (nα Fα )
α=1 (nα Fα )

(6)

where NS is the number of families with one codon only and Km is the number
of families with degeneracy m (the set of 6 synonymous codons for Leu can be
split into one family with degeneracy 2, similar to that of phenylalanine (Phe),
and one family with degeneracy 4, similar to that, for example, of proline (Pro)).
The same applies to the other 6-fold families.
EN C was estimated by using a Python script following [17].

2.7

ENC plot

An EN C plot analysis was performed to estimate the relative contributions of
mutational bias and natural selection in shaping CUB of 13 genes encoding
proteins that are crucial for SARS-CoV-2. In this plot, the EN C values are
plotted against GC3 values. If codon usage is dominated by the mutational bias,
then a clear relationship is expected between EN C and GC3 :
EN C = 2 + s +

29
s2 + (1 − s)2

(7)

s represents the value of GC3 [19]. If the mutational bias is the main force
affecting CUB of the genes, the corresponding points will fall near Wright’s
theoretical curve. Conversely, if CUB is mainly affected by natural selection, the
corresponding points will fall considerably below Wright’s theoretical curve.
To quantify the relative extent of the natural selection, for each gene, we
calculated the Euclidean distance d of its point from the curve.
We then showed the average values of the distance over time with a heatmap,
drawn with MATLAB. We consider the difference of the distance of the dots from
the curve and that of Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genes.

2.8

Forsdyke plot

To study the mutational rates of genes, we performed an analysis by using our
previously defined Forsdyke plot [43]. Each gene of the SARS-CoV-2 sequencings
considered was compared to its orthologous gene in the reference genes of
Wuhan-Hu-1 genome. Each pair of orthologous genes is represented by a point in
the Forsdyke plot, where protein divergence is correlated with RNA divergence (see
Methods in [43] for details). The protein sequences were aligned using Biopython.
The RNA sequences were then aligned using the protein alignments as templates.
Then, both RNA and protein divergences were assessed as explained in
Methods in [43] by counting the number of mismatches in each pair of aligned
sequences. Thus, each point in the Forsdyke plot measures the divergence between
pairs of orthologous genes in the two viruses, as projected along with the
phenotypic (protein) and nucleotidic (RNA) axis. The first step in each
comparison is to compute the regression line between protein vs RNA sequence
divergence in the Forsdyke plot getting values of intercept and slope for each
variant of genes. To test whether the regression parameters associated with each
variant are different or not, we have followed a protocol founded by Dilucca et al.,
considering a p-value ≤ 0.05.

2.9

Protein-Protein Network Analysis

In this study, we used the 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human
protein-protein interactions (PPI) collected by Gordon et al. [31] who identified
the viral proteins that physically associate with human proteins using
affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS). We downloaded these PPI from
NDEx (https://public.ndexbio.org/network/43803262 − 6d69 − 11ea − bf dc −
0ac135e8bacf ).
To detect communities of PPI, we used the application Molecular Complex
Detection (MCODE) [32] in Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/). In a nutshell,
MCODE iteratively groups together neighboring nodes with similar values of the
core-clustering coefficient, which for each node is defined as the density of the
highest k-core of its immediate neighborhood times k.1 MCODE detects the
1 The density of a graph G with n nodes and l links is the ratio between l and the maximum number
of possible links, namely n(n − 1)/2, whereas, a k-core is a graph G of minimal degree k, meaning that
each node belonging to G has degree greater or equal than k.

densest regions of the network and assigns to each detected community a score
that is its internal link density times the number of nodes belonging to it.
We also characterized the first ten communities c with the mean value x̄c and
standard deviation σc of codon bias values
√ within the community, and use them to
compute a Z-score as Zc = (x̄c − x̄n )/ σc2 + σn2 (where x̄n and σn are,
respectively, the mean value and standard deviation of codon bias values computed
for all proteins). In this way, a value of Zc > 1 (Zc < −1) indicates that
community c features significantly higher (lower) codon bias than the population
mean. Cytoscape was used to detect the degree k of a protein.

Results
Dataset Distribution

The records of virus genomes according to geographical location and month of
isolation are shown in Figure 1. A detailed report of all extracted genes per region
can be found in Table 1.
A great percentage of the annotated SARS-CoV-2 genomes (about 62% and
22% respectively) are distributed in Europe and North America. The number of
complete viral genomes is non-homogeneous, going from 200-300 in the first
months, to a peak of 24,000 in March. In the other months the values fluctuate
among 7,000 and 23,000.

Principal Component Analysis of RSCUs

We performed PCA over the space of RSCU vectors measured for each
SARS-COV-2 gene in all sequences. The two first principal components (P C1 and

6

P C2 ) appear to represent as much as 78% of the total variance of codon bias over
the genome (respectively 52% for P C1 and 26% for P C2 ).
The projections of the first two principal components on the individual codons
show that none of the codons predominantly contributes to the data variability
(see Figure 4). Thus, the placement of a gene on the P C1 -P C2 plane depends on a
weighted contribution of all codons.

Figure 2. PCA of SARS-CoV-2 Genes.All available sequences for each gene has
been used in this study, by calculating RSCUs and performing PCA for each of them.
Approximately the same number of data was analyzed for each gene.
A great number of codons highly affect P C1 , resulting in distinct clusters,
whereas P C2 is mostly affected by triplets that code for Phenylalanine (TTT and
TTC), Leucine (TTA, TTG and CTA), Isoleucine (ATT, ATC), Lysine (AAG)
and Valine (GTA).
Interestingly, the genes encoding for the polyproteins and spike protein are
very close in PCA plane in the bottom of the graph, far apart from the others.
Regarding N , the coordinate in P C1 is similar to those of the forementioned
nucleus, while is quite distant in P C2 . M is closer to N in P C2 , denoting a
similar usage of codons coding for the five amino acids displayed above. Finally, E
is the most separated cluster due to its shorteness, and apparently affect the
RSCU values (see Figure 2).
Taken together, this analysis shows that the longer genes carry a signature
RSCU of the virus, that in two proteins, namely M and N , differs in the codons
encoding for 5 amino acids.

3.3

Codon Adaptation Index Time Evolution

To measure the codon usage bias in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we first evaluated
CAI for all genes under investigation. For each gene, we performed a daily mean of
the values, which are displayed in Figure 4. As in the previous analysis, the CAI
starting values are very similar for Spike, ORF1a, ORF1b and RdRp while
Nucleocapsid has the highest and Membrane shows the lowest value. Envelope
protein analysis is redundant for constant CAI values through evolution.

Figure 3. Projection of the first two PCA components on the RSCU vectors.
The distribution of each codon in P C1 is more uniform, resulting from a weighted and
coherent contribution of all codons, whereas, in P C2 the contribution is more focused
on specific codons.

from all the available sequences, averaged over each day, with standard deviation as
errorbar.

The fastest evolving gene appears to be the one coding for Nucleocapsid with a
globally descending trend. Spike too displays the same trend but with a
down-peak in the month of July. This is mostly due to Oceania sequences which
were very abundant in the summer period. A detailed output of CAI temporal

evolution per country can be found for this protein in Figure 6.
Membrane shows a constant evolution until August, where a steep ascent
occurs. On the other hand, RdRp has a sudden decrease in the first months and a
subsequent stabilization on a lower value. This may be due to the initial
adaptation to the new host and the finding of a more optimized amino acidic
sequence, that rapidly superseded the older one.
Finally, the two segments of gene ORF1ab manifest a more localized evolution,
in accordance with the fundamental role of these proteins for replication.
Overall, the genes display a descending trend, against the hypothesis that a
virus evolves in order to align its codon usage bias to the one of the host. This
phenomenon though, has previously been observed by Dilucca et al. [24] and is
thought to be beneficial for the virus, as it can exploit the host resources at its
best. A plausible explanation is that the virus has already adapted its genome to
Homo Sapiens. In order to spread, a virus ”is willing” to keep the host alive, and
therefore they adapt a sub-optimal codon usage bias. If the virus replicates
efficiently it is more likely to be more successful at invading a given host, and,
eventually kill it.

3.4

SiD

In line with our previous study [24], we calculated the similarity index (SiD) of
SARS-CoV-2 genomes in respect to the human host. To understand the rationale
behind these results, the higher the value of SiD, the more adapted the codon
usage of SARS-CoV-2 to the host under study [25].
In the present analysis, we calculated SiD for each gene under study, for all the
available sequences, and performed a daily average (see Figure 5).

Figure 5. SiD values daily means in SARS-CoV-2 genes. SiD values estimated
from all the available sequences, averaged over each day, with standard deviation as
error bar.

In line with the previous statements concerning CAI, the more adapted gene
appears to be the one coding for Nucleocapsid, while the gene encoding Spike
seems to be the least adapted. Also in this case Spike, RdRp and ORF1ab show
similar values, confirming the hypothesis of a signature codon bias.
Moreover, the trends are mostly descending, remarking the previous statements
on CAI.
By looking at the Spike temporal evolution of SiD, it shows the down peak in
July, as occurred for CAI. To have a clearer picture we made a region-based
analysis, averaging over 10 days to smooth the curves. It is immediate from Figure
6 that the peaks for both CAI and SiD are due to sequences from Oceania.

Figure 6. SiD and CAI values region details. SiD and CAI temporal evolution
per country can be found for Spike protein with an average every 10 days to explain the
down-peak occuring in July.

ENC Plot Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genes

To further investigate the evolutionary forces that affect the SARS-CoV-2 codon
usage, an ENC-plot analysis was conducted separately for each of the genes
considered herein. First, a scatter plot of ENC vs GC3 of reference sequence
Wuhan-Hu-1 genes has been created, together with the curve, in Figure 7. This
was done to have a reference for the subsequent temporal evolution. All genes are
found below the curve, meaning that they have evolved under a selective
pressure [19].
Afterwards variations over time have been investigated by generating ENC
plots for sets of genes binned by the time. To illustrate more clearly the temporal
diversities, 10-day averages of the distances from Wright’s theoretical curve have
been estimated. Then we calculated the difference between these values and the
scattered values of Wuhan-Hu-1, represented in Figure 7 and graphically
illustrated in a heatmap in Figure 8.
The average distances from Wright theoretical curve tend to increase over time
for most genes, except for ORF1a, which appears to be stable. This could be
interpreted as the action of natural selection over time. On the other hand,
Nucleocapsid and Membrane are getting closer to the curve, suggesting that the
codon usage of these genes is mostly affected by mutational bias. It should be
mentioned though that, except for E that has a different bias due to its short
length, M and N have the greatest distance from Wright’s curve, pointing that
they already are the most subject to natural selection.

Forsdyke plots

The RNA and protein sequence divergence of the seven selected genes have been
analyzed by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the reference Wuhan-Hu-1
genes and their corresponding protein sequences with the other SARS-CoV-2
sequences under study. This has been done to estimate evolutionary divergences of
each gene. Each gene is represented in a different panel in Figure 9. Usually each
sequence is represented by a point in the plot but due to the discreetness of

Each point in the Forsdyke plots represents the divergence between a pair of
orthologous genes - in this case being part of the same species, they are variants of
the same gene - as projected along the phenotypic (protein) and nucleotide (RNA)
axis. Thus, the slope is an estimation of the fraction of RNA mutations that
results in amino acid substitutions [43]. In Figure 9, a separate Forsdyke plot is
shown for each gene. Envelope protein plot did not show many mutations.
Overall, protein and RNA sequence divergences are linearly correlated, and

these correlations correspond to slopes and intercepts of the linear regressions in
Table 2.
Gene M displays the lowest slope, pointing that this protein tends to evolve
slowly by accumulating mutations on its corresponding gene. The low value of the
R-squared is due to the fact that it is the shortest protein and it has less mutations,
thereby appearing more scattered in the plot. Conversely, the steeper slopes for
genes N and S suggest that these genes tend to evolve faster compared to other
ones. This is in line with a previous work of Dilucca et al. [24], according to which
N and S are the two proteins driving the speciation process among Coronaviruses.
ORF1b has a low slope and a positive intercept in the Forsdyke plot. This
points out that a number of synonymous mutations is accumulating before the
phenotypic divergence. As it codes for fundamental proteins for replication, a
higher conservation of the sequences is expected.
On the other hand, RdRp, that is part of gene ORF1b, has a higher slope,
pointing out the faster evolution of this protein in respect to the others of the
same ORF. This can be due to an selective pressure in response to antiviral drugs
which mostly target this protein.
Noteworthy, all x-intercepts are very close to 0, denoting the fact that there is
low accumulation of synonymous mutations in different genes, suggesting that the
virus is continually evolving towards another species, due to the overall higher
number of non-synonymous mutations.

3.7 Codon Bias and the Connectivity Patterns of
SARS-CoV-2 Protein Interaction Network
As far as the network of interacting proteins in SARS-CoV-2 is concerned, we first
investigated codon usage bias in relation with the degree connectivity patterns of
the network. The degree distribution of the network suggests that it is scale-free

(Figure 10), meaning that the network contains a large number of poorly connected
proteins and a relatively small number of highly connected proteins or ’hubs’. The
corresponding genes of these hub proteins have consistently higher values of codon
usage bias when this is measured by CAI and lower when this is measured by
EN C, as these two codon bias indices are anti-correlated (see Table11).

Figure 10. Degree distribution of proteins P(k). The degree distribution of the
network follows a power law, indicating that the network is scale-free.

Figure 11. Correlation between codon bias indices of genes and the degree k
of the corresponding proteins in the PPI. CAI of a gene consistently increases
with the connectivity of the corresponding protein in the PPI, whereas EN C decreases.
Moreover, we examined codon bias in relation with the community structure of
the PPI, where a community is a group of proteins that are more densely
connected within each other than with the rest of the network. Table ?? shows the
features of the first ten communities together with their average degree and their
average of the two codon bias indices (CAI and ENC). We also calculated the
internal average value x̄c and the Z-scores, comparing the distribution of bias
inside the community with all the proteins. Of note, all ten communities passed

the Z-score test (Z>2). Regarding the first community, which includes only 13
proteins (3.9% of the whole network), basically overlaps with the main core of the
PPI (i.e., the k-core with the highest possible degree). Notably, proteins belonging
to this community have on average a codon bias index (as measured by CAI and
EN C) that is significantly higher than the average of the rest of the network (the
Z-score > 1).

Discussion

In this study we performed a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary
divergence and codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 over time, considering all genomes
available in GISAID up to December 4, 2020. After filtering out incomplete
genomes, we retained a total of 134,905 complete genomes, with the purpose of
investigating their divergences from the first sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome
(NC 045512.2). We focused on seven SARS-CoV-2 genes/proteins that are crucial
for virus structure, synthesis, transmissibility and virulence, namely the Spike,
Nucleocapsid, Membrane, Envelope, RdRp and the two segments of ORF 1ab
separately, ORF 1a and ORF 1b.
The SARS-CoV-2 genomes have a tendency to diverge constantly from the
reference genome. This is in accordance with a recent study by Pachetti and
colleagues (2020) where they have demonstrated that the number of SARS-CoV-2
mutations change over time [4]. The accumulation of mutations most likely affects
the codon usage bias and has been investigated through RSCU, CAI, SiD and
ENC.
By performing PCA in the space of RSCUs for all sequences and genes under
investigation, we obtained distinct clusters: ORF 1a, ORF 1b and Spike exhibit
very similar RSCUs and are very compact. Being also the longest genes of the
genome, they represent the signature RSCU of the virus. Envelope appears to be
the most spread but it should be considered that there are more than 134,000
points for that gene, that must be localized. Due to its shortness, every mutation
has a high impact on the RSCU, resulting in a rather dispersed cluster.
Nucleocapsid spread instead is due to the high rate of mutations occurring in that
gene.
Overall, if E is excluded, the genes have similar values in the major principle
component (P C1 ), being mainly separated in P C2 that mostly accounts for 5
amino acids.
On the basis CAI and SiD time evolutions, most SARS-CoV-2 genes show a
tendency to slowly decrease. This is in contrast with the initial hypothesis of
adaptation of the viral Codon Usage to the host one. An explanation can be found

in the already high starting values for SiD and CAI: having a close codon usage
with the host would increase the efficiency of translation, for the cellular resources
could be used in the most efficient way, speeding up viral replication. This can
lead to the death of the host and is thought to be counterproductive for the virus,
as it would stop its spreading. For this reason, an efficiency balance needs to be
reached through continuous adjustments.
The ENC-plot analysis revealed that the codon usage of the viral genes under
study are subject to different balances between mutational bias and natural
selection. For instance, the codon preference of the genes S, RdRp, E and
ORF 1ab, are mainly determined by natural selection, as opposed to the genes M
and N , the codon usage of which is rather affected by mutational bias.
From Forsdyke plots we obtained results confirming those of our previous
study [24], showing that the speciation process is predominately driven by genes N
and S.
According to Rehman et al. (2020), the spike protein, which mediates the virus
interaction with the human host cells, is more prone to mutations and particularly
those occurring in the amino acids implicated in the spike-angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) interface [34]. The key genes, N and S, accumulate beneficial
mutations that would increase the evolvability and transmissibility of
SARS-CoV-2, and enable it to continuously adapt to different populations, like
spilling over from bats, or other candidate natural reservoirs, to human.
RdRp, which catalyzes the transcription and replication of the coronaviral
genome, binds to Nsp7 and Nsp8 to form the core RNA synthesis machinery of
SARS-CoV-2 [39]. Accordingly, the genes coding for RdRp appear to be subject to
natural selection, suggesting that it has an increased ability to adapt into novel
hosts. Despite the fact that RdRp is considered less vulnerable to mutations [4]
due to its vital role in maintaining viral genome fidelity, the mutations that occur
in RdRp likely promote the virus adaptive flexibility and enhance its resistance to
antiviral drugs [40].
Furthermore, we found that in the human-SARS-CoV-2 network, the most
highly connected or hub proteins have consistently higher codon usage bias
relatively to the less connected proteins. This observation leads to the suggestion
that evolutionary pressure is exerted upon the genes encoding those proteins, most
probably because of their great biological significance for the virus environmental
adaptability. In other words, if these nodes are removed the entire network will
eventually collapse [42].
