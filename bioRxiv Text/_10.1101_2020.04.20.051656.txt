Abstract:

10

Pandemics originating from pathogen transmission between animals and humans

11

highlight the broader need to understand how natural hosts have evolved in response to

12

emerging human pathogens and which groups may be susceptible to infection. Here, we

13

investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein bound by SARS-CoV and

14

SARS-CoV-2. We find that the ACE2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats, the group

15

in which the progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved,

16

particularly in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We detect positive selection

17

in non-bat mammals in ACE2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats, without

18

enrichment of selection in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we

19

evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact SARS-CoV or

20

SARS-CoV-2, revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of

21

predicting spillover events. This work increases our understanding of the relationship between

22

mammals, particularly bats, and coronaviruses, and provides data that can be used in functional

23

studies of how host proteins are bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Main:
The recent coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the disastrous impacts of zoonotic

27

spillovers and underscores the need to understand how pathogens and hosts evolve in

28

response to one another. Evolutionary analyses of host proteins targeted by infections reveal

29

the pressures that hosts have faced from pathogens and how they have evolved to resist

30

disease, informing predictions about spread of infections and how to counter them. The virus,

31

SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, like its close relative SARS-CoV, is thought to

32

have its progenitor origins in bats1–3. Bats have been suggested to be “special” reservoirs of

33

emerging infectious viruses4 and of coronaviruses in particular5. However, often this species-

34

rich, ecologically diverse clade is treated as a homogenous group, represented by one or two

35

species, particularly when considering the interaction of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with host

36

proteins (but see Hou et al.6 and Demogines et al.7 which consider multiple bat species).

37

Examination of host proteins bound by potential zoonoses can be used not only to infer

38

past and current evolutionary pressure but to inform the likelihood of cross-species

39

transmission. One major barrier to cross-species transmission is the ability of the virus, adapted

40

to one host protein, to bind another species’ protein8,9. Accordingly, many studies have

41

examined the ACE2 sequence of suspected disease reservoirs to understand how different viral

42

strains bind different species’ ACE2 and where zoonotic spillover may have originated6,8,10–12.

43

These studies, especially ones involving functional assays or in-depth modeling of virus-host

44

contacts, are usually limited in their comparisons to a small subset of domestic animals or

45

suspected reservoirs, e.g. rhinolophid bats or civets – a suspected intermediate host for SARS-

46

CoV13. Often similarity, or lack thereof, between humans and other species in key ACE2

47

residues are used to predict the species that may have transmitted viruses to humans but

48

because studies only examine a small subset of the existing diversity, it is hard to determine

49

whether the selected species are more or less similar to humans than a random sample of

50

animals.

51

Here, we investigate how angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein

52

bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-23,14,15, has evolved in bats compared to other mammals.

53

We analyze sequences drawn from 90 bat species, including 55 sequences generated for this

54

study, an eight-fold increase over prior studies, and 108 other mammal species. Finally, we use

55

our dataset of ACE2 sequences to highlight the potential for transmission of COVID-19 from

56

humans into wildlife and the difficulty of predicting intermediate and amplifying hosts in spillover

57

based on receptor similarity alone.

Results and Discussion

61

Mammals, particularly bats, are diverse at ACE2 contact residues for SARS-CoV and SARS-

62

CoV-2

63

We analyzed a total of 207 ACE2 sequences from 198 species (90 bat species; 108

64

non-bat species) representing 18 mammalian orders (Table S1). There are 24 amino acid sites

65

on ACE2 that are important for stabilizing the binding of ACE2 with the receptor binding domain

66

of SARS-CoV (22 sites; Table S2) and/or SARS-CoV-2 (21 sites; Table S2)6,8,10,11,14–16. Across

67

these 24 sites, which we refer to by their position in the human ACE2, we found a minimum of

68

132 unique amino acid combinations in the 207 sequences; across a subset of 7 amino acids

69

identified as virus-contacting residues or important for the maintenance of salt bridges by most

70

studies6,8,15,16 we found a minimum of 82 unique amino acid sequences (Figure 1). In bats

71

(N=96), we found a minimum of 64 unique amino acid sequences across the 24 amino acids

72

and 49 across the 7 amino acids, while in other mammals (N=111), we found a minimum of 68

73

unique amino acid sequences across the 24 amino acids and 38 across the 7 amino acids.

74

Within species for which we were able to observe multiple individuals, we observed differing

75

levels of diversity in the 24 sites with Bos indicus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Camelus

76

dromedarius and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum identical within species across individuals and

77

sites; Canis lupus showed one amino acid difference across two individuals; in contrast all four

78

individuals of Rhinolophus sinicus were different from one another.

79

Across all sequences, the 24 amino acid sites varied from monomorphic across all

80

examined sequences (e.g. Phe28 and Arg357) to having 10 or more possible amino acids (e.g.

81

24, 27, 31, 34, 79, 82, 329). The most diverse sites (as measured by Shannon’s diversity index)

82

were amino acid positions 24, 34, 79, 82, 329 and 354, while the most even sites were positions

83

24, 30, 34, 41, 82 and 329 (Table S2). Of the 22 sites with more than one amino acid, bats were

84

more diverse than other mammals at 13 and were more even at 15. That bats demonstrate a

85

similar diversity in their ACE2 across these loci and greater diversity in some sites than that

86

observed across the rest of mammals suggests they may be particularly diverse in their ACE2,

87

and supports the idea that bats are more diverse than other suspected SARS-CoV and SARS-

88

like CoV hosts6.

89
90

Bats drive the signal of mammalian selection and adaptation to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

91

We also conducted a series of selection analyses each on 5 phylogenetic trees drawn

92

from Upham et al. 17. Across all mammals, the 20 variable sites in ACE2 that contact SARS-

93

CoV were not more likely to be under positive selection than other residues in the gene (MEME

94

p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees >0.35; Table S3), though there was some marginal

95

evidence for increased selection in these residues (MEME p < 0.1, Fisher’s exact test, p two trees <

96

0.06; Table S3). Similarly, the 19 variable sites that contact SARS-CoV-2 were not more likely to

97

be under positive selection than other residues in the gene when considering sites under

98

selection at p < 0.05 (MEME p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.1; Table S3). However,

99

when considering sites under selection at p < 0.1, residues that contact SARS-CoV-2 do indeed

100

appear to be more likely to be under selection than other residues in the gene, likely due to the

101

reduction in statistical power loss (MEME p < 0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.02). Therefore

102

there is some evidence that the locus is evolving in response to coronaviruses; this is similar to

103

the finding of strong selection in aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) in response to coronaviruses in

104

mammals18. However, this pattern is driven by and strengthened in bats; in bats a greater

105

proportion of residues that contact SARS-CoV (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees <

106

0.03; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.02; Table S3) and SARS-CoV-2 (MEME p <

107

0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.02; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.0004;

108

Table S3) were under selection than other residues in the gene, whereas residues that contact

109

SARS-CoV (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test,

110

pall trees > 0.5; Table S3) or SARS-CoV-2 (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4;

111

MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.5; Table S3) were not more likely to be under

112

selection in non-bat mammals. Increased sampling can improve the ability of MEME to detect

113

selection at individual sites19. Because our dataset of bat sequences is smaller than our

114

mammalian dataset, it further strengthens our conclusion that bats are under positive selection

115

in contact residues. Across all mammals, positions 24 and 42 were under selection (Table S2; 5

116

trees, MEME, p < 0.05), but in bats positions 27, 31, 35 and 354 (Table S2, 5 trees, MEME, p <

117

0.05) and 30, 38, 329 and 393 (Table S2, 5 trees, MEME, p < 0.1) were additionally under

118

positive selection while positions 45 (Table S2, 5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05) and 353 (Table S2, 5

119

trees, MEME, p < 0.1) were under selection in non-bat mammals but not bats.

120

Using aBSREL we tested two a priori hypotheses, the first that bats are under positive

121

selection in ACE2 and the second that the family Rhinolophidae, the bat family in which the

122

progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved3,20, specifically,

123

is under positive selection. Both bats (pall trees < 0.002) and Rhinolophidae (pall trees < 0.00007) are

124

under positive selection in ACE2 (Table S4). When we conducted an adaptive branch-site test

125

of positive selection on all branches without specifying a foreground branch, branches in the bat

126

clade were more likely to be selected than branches in other parts of the mammalian phylogeny

127

(Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.05; Table S4) and the branch at the base of Rhinolophidae was

128

under positive selection (pall trees, Holm-Bonferroni correction < 0.04, Table S4). We found that bat

129

branches are more likely to be under positive selection than other branches despite the fact that

130

these branches are a subset of the total phylogeny and branch-site tests of positive selection

131

have reduced power to detect selection on shorter branches, making our test conservative18,21.

132

It is possible that the sequences we generated through target capture and genomic sequence

133

were of poorer sequencing quality than the reference genomes (though the number of residues

134

covered by sequences we generated and publicly available reference sequences was similar;

135

two-tailed t-test, t = -0.49, p = 0.63). When we removed the bat sequences we generated and

136

examined the remaining terminal branches, a greater proportion of bat branches were under

137

selection than non-bat branches, but statistical significance was lost, likely due to reduced

138

power (Table S4). Increased positive selection in bats in ACE2 compared with other mammals

139

is consistent with their status as rich hosts of coronaviruses5. Host diversity of bats in a region is

140

associated with higher richness of coronaviruses5; the diversity of bat ACE2 is consistent with

141

the idea that a diversity of bats and their ACE2 sequences are coevolving with a diversity of

142

viruses.

143

Two bat families, Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae, have been associated with SARS-

144

related betacoronaviruses5, which use the ACE2 molecule as a viral receptor9. Interestingly,

145

while we found evidence that Rhinolophidae are under selection in ACE2, we found widespread

146

selection across bats. Branches in the rhinolophid/ hipposiderid clade were not more likely to be

147

under selection than other branches within bats (Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.7; Table S4) and

148

bat lineages that live outside the predicted range of these viruses (e.g. in the Americas5) are

149

also under positive selection. Therefore, there are still aspects of the bat-coronavirus

150

relationship that we do not fully understand. At least one other coronavirus uses ACE2 to gain

151

entry into the host cell, HCoV-NL63, which may have its origin in bats22; we found some

152

evidence for increased selection in the residues that contact this virus in bats (MEME p < 0.05,

153

Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.07; MEME p < 0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.08; Table S3),

154

but not in non-bat mammals (MEME p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.6; MEME p < 0.1,

155

Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4; Table S3). Many ACE2 residues that interact with HCoV-NL63

156

also interact with one or both of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-223,24, which may be driving the

157

evidence of selection in these residues. However, we did find evidence of selection in residues

158

321 and 326 in both bats and non-bat mammals (Table S2, 5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05), as well as

159

selection in bats in residue 322 (Table S2, 5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05); these three residues

160

contact HCoV-NL63 but not SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Our finding of selection in residues

161

that contact HCoV-NL63 but not SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 contrasts with the findings of a

162

smaller dataset of bats mostly from Europe, Asia and Africa7 and may result from our greater

163

power to detect signal or signal originating from bats in different regions than previously tested.

164

ACE2 regulation is known to impact survival in some influenza A infections25; New World bats

165

are known to host many influenza A viruses26, so it is possible the selection we detect could

166

result from infection from non-coronavirus infections. Still, our results raise questions about

167

whether there are or were SARS-related coronaviruses in these regions that have not been

168

detected?

169
170

Similarity of ACE2 yields predictions of susceptible hosts but cannot completely determine host

171

range of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

172

To determine how similar bats, civet, pangolin (a suspected source of SARS-CoV-227)

173

and other groups are to humans in 24 ACE2 residues that bind SARS-CoV (22 residues) and/or

174

SARS-CoV-2 (21 residues), in all 207 sequences we quantified how many of the residues were

175

identical or very similar to humans, likely maintaining current binding properties, versus how

176

many were likely to disrupt binding. All of the apes and most of the Old World monkeys we

177

examined were identical to humans across all amino acid sites; those that were not identical

178

differed by only 1 or 2 amino acids (Figure 2; Table S1). However, amino acid similarity in these

179

sites across different species often diverged from what we would have predicted from phylogeny

180

alone. Notably, two rodents (Mesocricetus auratus and Peromyscus leucopus) had identical or

181

very similar amino acids to humans in all but 2 sites for each virus, and many artiodactyls (e.g.

182

cows, deer, sheep, goats), cetaceans, cats, and pangolin were as similar or more similar to

183

humans than New World monkeys both in residues that contact SARS-CoV and in residues that

184

contact SARS-CoV-2. The civet fell in the middle of mammals in its similarity to humans in

185

residues that contact either or both viruses. In general, bats were not very similar to humans at

186

these 24 amino acid sites, some with as many as five changes that would likely reduce virus

187

binding, the most observed across mammals. Additionally, most bat sequences (56 of 91)

188

showed that at least one of the two salt bridges (Lys31-Glu35; Asp38-Lys353 in humans) within

189

ACE2 would be disrupted by changing a charged amino acid to an uncharged amino acid or to

190

an amino acid with a clashing charge (Table S1). In Rhinolophidae, only one sequence of the

191

ten examined did not have a change in position 31 or 35 that would result in a clash between

192

two positively charged amino acids. Because of the large overlap in residues that contact

193

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (19 residues) generally species were roughly as similar to

194

humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV and in residues that contact SARS-CoV-2 (Figure

195

2). However, bats (two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0001) and carnivores (two-sided

196

Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0004), particularly mustelids including ferrets, were more

197

similar to humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV-2 than residues that contact SARS-CoV

198

(Figure 2).

199

Examination of the diversity of ACE2 sequences across mammals and the similarity

200

between distantly related groups at key residues for interaction with SARS-CoV and SARS-

201

CoV-2 allows one to make predictions about potential spillover hosts or other susceptible

202

species. In some cases, similarity of host residues seems to predict infection ability well. Old

203

World primates were identical to humans across all 24 residues and, consistent with the idea

204

that identical residues would confer susceptibility, experimental infections have demonstrated

205

that SARS-CoV replicates in multiple macaque species28. Additionally, in our analysis, domestic

206

cats were among the species most similar humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV and

207

SARS-CoV-2. Notably, cats can become infected and can shed both SARS-CoV and SARS-

208

CoV-229,30. Pangolins were as similar in their ACE2 residues to humans as cats, lending some

209

support for the idea that a virus that can bind pangolin ACE2 might be able to transmit to

210

humans. Accordingly, it seems prudent to exercise precautions when interacting with species

211

whose ACE2 is similar to humans in the contact residues for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,

212

especially domestic animals such as cats, cows, goats and sheep. Care should also be taken

213

with wild animals; for example, interactions between people with macaques or visitation of

214

mountain gorillas by tourists could lead to cross-species transmission, endangering the health of

215

humans and wildlife.

216

In other cases, it can be hard to predict susceptibility to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2

217

infection based on overall similarity of ACE2 residues. A single amino acid change can impact

218

the binding of a virus to ACE2. In position 24, a diverse, even and selected site across all

219

mammals that contacts both viruses, mutation from Gln (human) to Lys (16 bat species and

220

Rattus norvegicus) reduced association between the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE212.

221

Position 27, a selected site in bats with many amino acid variants, is a Thr in humans; when

222

mutated to a Lys (as in some bats), the interaction disfavored SARS-CoV binding by disrupting

223

hydrophobic interactions with the SARS-CoV virus, while mutation to Ile, found in other bats,

224

increased the ability of the virus to infect cells6. Some rodents, including Mesocricetus auratus

225

and Peromyscus leucopus, which were among the most similar species to humans, have a

226

glycosylated Asn in position 82 that disrupts the hydrophobic contact with Leu472 on SARS-CoV,

227

reducing association between the spike protein and ACE212,15; in conjunction with other

228

mutations this glycosylation can disrupt binding11. We predict this same glycosylated Asn is also

229

present in some rhinolophid bats (R. ferrumequinum and some R. sinicus), though not all (R.

230

pusillus, R. macrotis and some R. sinicus). Additionally, intraspecies variation could be an

231

important component of reservoir competency that we are unable to assess. It is likely that not

232

all individuals in a species are equally susceptible to infection, complicating the identification of

233

reservoirs.

234

Additionally, spillover potential is not regulated solely by ACE2 sequence and sometimes

235

SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 are able to replicate in hosts with divergent ACE2. Compatibility of

236

the host protease with the virus is important for determining host range9 and viral strains vary in

237

their binding properties to different species15, with some SARS-like coronaviruses able to bind

238

human, civet and rhinolophid ACE2, despite major ACE2 sequence differences between the

239

species20. Additionally, SARS-CoV can enter cells expressing the ACE2 of Myotis daubentonii

240

and Rhinolophus sinicus with limited efficiency6, even though these species only share 13-16

241

amino acids with humans that contact either virus and each contain some mutations that should

242

interfere with binding. Similarly, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated well in ferrets,

243

whose ACE2 ranked among the least similar to humans in their contact residues for SARS-CoV,

244

though more similar for SARS-CoV-229,30. And species whose ACE2 sequence is not very

245

similar to humans can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV11,31.

246
247
248

Conclusions
Taken together, our data suggest that mammals, particularly bats, are evolving in

249

response to coronaviruses with a diverse suite of ACE2 sequences that likely confer differing

250

susceptibility to various coronavirus strains. Predicting which species will expose humans to

251

potential zoonoses is difficult. Data about viruses circulating in wildlife can help trace the origins

252

of zoonotic disease outbreaks but are of minimal use if people continue to expose themselves to

253

the reservoirs. Growing evidence suggests that some viruses are capable of evolving to infect

254

different hosts, even when there might be sizable barriers such as divergent host receptors. The

255

best solution is to prevent people and domestic animals from contacting wildlife to minimize

256

opportunities for disease transmission and host switching.

Alignment of mammalian ACE2 sequences:

283

Sequences for ACE2 were obtained either through Genbank or, in the case of several

284

bat species, sequenced for this study. On 21 February 2020, ACE2 orthologs for all jawed

285

vertebrates were downloaded from Genbank32. In addition, we sought out all bat sequences of

286

ACE2, adding sequences from Hou et al.6, as well as the palm civet ACE2 sequences because

287

of their putative role as reservoirs of SARS-CoV. Only sequences from mammalian species

288

found in Upham et al.17 were retained and are listed in Table S1. Two Costa Rican bat species

289

(Artibeus [Dermanura] watsoni and Artibeus [Dermanura] phaeotis) were not included in the

290

phylogenetic hypotheses17 and were therefore excluded from the molecular evolution analyses

291

but were included in analyses of amino acid identity and diversity. Multiple individuals were

292

available for a few species (four individuals of Rhinolophus sinicus; three individuals of

293

Rhinolophus ferrumequinum; and two each for: Bos indicus, Camelus dromedarius, Canis lupus

294

and Rousettus leschenaultii), however only one sequence per species was used in molecular

295

evolution analyses, noted in Table S1.

296

We sought additional data on the diversity of the ACE2 gene across bats using a

297

combination of samples collected in the field in Costa Rica and granted from museums (63

298

species; summarized in table S1). For samples collected in the field, bats were captured in mist

299

nets and a wing biopsy sample was collected. Bats were released immediately after sampling.

300

Research was approved by the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee

301

(protocols 26920 and 29978) and conducted under the appropriate Costa Rican permits. From

302

these species, we isolated DNA from tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit

303

(Valencia, CA, USA) and created genomic libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II kit (New England

304

BioLabs; Ipswich, MA, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. For some species, ACE2

305

was captured as part of a targeted capture using genomic libraries and a custom target

306

enrichment kit (Arbor Biosciences; Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s

307

instructions with modifications33, while in other cases ACE2 was isolated from total genomic

308

sequence. Briefly, genomic reads were mapped to the nearest bat genome of Rousettus

309

aegyptiacus, Pteropus alecto, Desmodus rotundus, Myotis lucifugus or Eptesicus fuscus using

310

LAST34 to generate a consensus sequence and the ACE2 coding regions were extracted using

311

a translated DNA search in BLAT35 and the ACE2 coding sequence from Myotis lucifugus36.

312

Sequences are available from Genbank (MT333480-MT333534; Table S1).

313

All sequences for ACE2 were aligned in Geneious37. Sequences were corrected by hand

314

to remove sequences outside the coding region and adjust gaps to be in frame with the coding

315

region using the human mRNA as a guide. Missing sequence, gaps and premature stop codons

316

were converted to Ns for downstream analyses and comparison of residues with the human

317

coding region.

Investigation of important residues for CoV binding
We sought to understand how the residues important for coronavirus binding are

322

conserved (or not) across mammals to determine probable host range of SARS-CoV and

323

SARS-CoV-2. We compared amino acid sequences across 24 positions known to be important

324

for binding of SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 as determined by others6,8,10,11,14–16. To determine

325

which amino acid positions were the most variable, we calculated Shannon’s diversity index

326

(which accounts for the number and evenness of amino acids), number of unique amino acids

327

and evenness for each of the 24 amino positions using the vegan38 package (version 2.5-6) in

328

R39 (version 3.6.2). We also calculated how “human-like” a species was across these 24 amino

329

acids, as well as separately for residues contacting SARS-CoV and residues contacting SARS-

330

CoV-2 by giving a score to each amino acid in each position. Residues that were identical or

331

relatively equivalent to humans were given a score of 1; relative equivalency was inferred when

332

amino acids retained similar properties and abilities to participate in hydrogen bonds, Van der

333

Waals forces or salt bridges. Residues that would likely be worse at binding were given scores

334

of -1; reduced binding was inferred when amino acid properties were dramatically altered from

335

that of the human amino acid motif (e.g. replacement of a positively charged amino acid with a

336

negatively charged amino acid in a salt bridge). In general, asparagine and glutamine were

337

considered similar enough not to disrupt binding, as were amino acids with the same charge

338

and amino acids with small hydrophic side chains (valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine).

339

Amino acids whose effect was hard to determine were given scores of zero. Exact

340

determinations of the impact can be found in Table S2. The human-like score was calculated as

341

a sum of each amino acid score divided by the total amino acids observed across all 24 sites or

342

all sites that contacted a given virus (since some species had missing data). We predicted the

343

N-linked glycosylation of Asn when Asn was found in the following motif N-X-S/T where X is not

344

a proline40. Glycosylation was not taken into account when calculating the human-like score.

Molecular evolution analyses
To determine whether it was likely to be interactions with coronavirus driving the

348

evolution of ACE2 we used MEME19 to infer the residues under selection across the mammal

349

phylogeny, in just bats and in non-bat mammals and used a Fisher’s exact test to determine

350

whether residues that interact with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-NL6323 were more likely

351

to be under selection than other residues in ACE2. Only codons that showed variation (e.g.

352

more than one amino acid across all 198 species) and that were present in humans were

353

considered in the Fisher’s exact test. We used a p < 0.05 cutoff for inferring selection at each

354

site via MEME but some results were shaper when using a p < 0.1 cutoff, likely due to the

355

reduction in loss of statistical power (Table S3).

356

Additionally, to determine whether bats, and specifically the family Rhinolophidae, are

357

under strong selection to adapt to viruses we used the adaptive branch-site random effects

358

model test of positive selection, aBSREL21, as implemented in HyPhy, version 2.5.841, using a

359

pruned subset of five phylogenetic hypotheses chosen from the pseudo-posterior distribution of

360

Upham et al.17 to account for phylogenetic uncertainty. We tested three conditions: 1) in which

361

the branch leading to Rhinolophidae was considered the foreground branch; 2) in which the

362

branch leading to the common ancestor of all bats was considered the foreground branch; and

363

3) in which all branches were tested without a priori specification of background and foreground

364

branches. In determining whether bats are more likely to be under selection than other

365

mammals, we used Fisher’s exact tests to test whether an excess of branches in the bat lineage

366

were under selection compared to the rest of the phylogeny. We used p < 0.05 as our cutoff for

367

a branch being under selection without any Holm-Bonferroni correction because it seemed

368

unlikely that bat branches were more susceptible to false positives than any other branch and all

369

our comparisons were between branches within the same aBSREL analysis. If one only accepts

370

significance at a p < 0.05 with Holm-Bonferroni correction, a very stringent requirement, the

371

general trends remain but the results lose statistical significance (Table S4). As described in the

372

results, to guard against bias due to potentially lower sequence quality in the sequences we

373

generated, we repeated our Fisher’s exact test using only terminal branches and removing

374

sequences we generated; the trend of a larger proportion of bat branches being under selection

375

was maintained but the results lose statistical significance (Table S4).

Figure 1: ACE2 is diverse across mammalian phylogeny at 7 residues responsible for

380

contact with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Dashed lines connect species to their ACE2

381

sequence. Numbers at the top of the table indicate the amino acid position in the human ACE2;

382

human residues are listed as the reference. A period indicates identity with the human amino

383

acid; unshaded boxes are amino acids that are identical or similar to humans; light gray

384

indicates no or unknown impact on the interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV/ SARS-CoV-2 and

385

dark gray indicates an amino acid that would likely disrupt the virus-host interaction. Asterisks

386

on N indicate predicted presence of N-linked glycosylation. Blank boxes indicate a lack of data

387

for that species and residue. The bat clade is collapsed on the left (top) and expanded in the

388

right column.

Figure 2: Similarity of ACE2 residues contacting SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 to human.

391

Similarity of residues was calculated based on the number of residues that were identical or

392

highly similar in binding properties to those found in human ACE2 with penalties for residues

393

that would likely disrupt binding (see methods). Scores of 1 indicate residues that contact the

394

virus are identical (or highly similar to humans). Boxes cover the interquartile range with a line

395

indicating the median and whiskers extending to the largest value less than 1.5 times the

396

interquartile range. Each point indicates a single sequence; only sequences with data for at

397

least 21 of 24 residues are shown. Sequences are grouped by mammalian order; “other”

398

includes all orders with fewer than 4 sequences. The green squares in Carnivora indicate the

399
