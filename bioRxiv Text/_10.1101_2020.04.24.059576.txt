Abstract
Following the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December
2019, specific COVID-19 surveillance was launched in France on January 10, 2020. Two weeks
later, the first three imported cases of COVID-19 into Europe were diagnosed in France. We
sequenced 97 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from
samples collected between January 24 and March 24, 2020 from infected patients in France.
Phylogenetic analysis identified several early independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions without
local transmission, highlighting the efficacy of the measures taken to prevent virus spread from
symptomatic cases. In parallel, our genomic data reveals the later predominant circulation of a
major clade in many French regions, and implies local circulation of the virus in undocumented
infections prior to the wave of COVID-19 cases. This study emphasizes the importance of
continuous and geographically broad genomic sequencing and calls for further efforts with
inclusion of asymptomatic infections.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of
an outbreak of severe respiratory infections in Wuhan, China in December 2019 (Zhu, Zhang et
al. 2020). Although Chinese authorities implemented strict quarantine measures in Wuhan and
surrounding areas, this emerging virus has rapidly spread across the globe, and the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on
March 11, 2020.
Strengthened surveillance of COVID-19 cases was implemented in France on January 10,
2020, with the objective of identifying imported cases early to prevent secondary transmission in
the community, and the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (NRC) hosted at
Institut Pasteur identified the first cases in Europe. With the extension of the epidemic,
identification of SARS-CoV-2 cases was shared with the NRC associated laboratory in Lyon and
then extended to additional first line hospital laboratories, with the NRC at Institut Pasteur
focusing on the Northern part of France, including the densely populated capital. Screening and
sampling for SARS-CoV-2 was targeted towards patients who had symptoms (fever and/or
respiratory problems) or had travel history to risk zones of infection. With the spread of the virus,
it became clear that clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients vary greatly (Guan, Ni et al.
2020, Onder, Rezza et al. 2020) with a proportion of asymptomatic infections or mild disease
cases (Li, Pei et al. 2020).
Viral genomics coupled with modern surveillance systems is transforming the way we respond
to emerging infectious diseases (Gardy and Loman 2018, Ladner, Grubaugh et al. 2019). Realtime genomic epidemiology data has proven to be useful to reconstruct outbreak dynamics:
from virus identification to understanding the factors contributing towards global spread
(Grubaugh, Ladner et al. 2019). Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from clinical cases
sampled since the beginning of the syndromic surveillance in France. We used the newly
generated genomes to investigate the origins of SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Northern
France and better understand its spread.

Results/Discussion
We generated complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from nasopharyngeal or sputum
samples addressed to the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses at the Institut
Pasteur in Paris as part of the ongoing surveillance (Figure 1A). We combined the 97 SARSCoV-2 genomes from France and 3 from Algeria generated here with 338 sequences published
or freely available from the GISAID database, and performed a phylogenetic analysis focusing
on the initial introductions and spread of the virus in France.

Early introductions do not appear to have resulted in local transmission
Our analysis indicates that the quarantine imposed on the initial COVID-19 cases in France
appears to have prevented local transmission. The first European cases sampled on January
24, 2020 (IDF0372 and IDF0373 from Île-de-France, described in (Lescure, Bouadma et al.
2020) were direct imports from Hubei, China, and the genomes fall accordingly near the base of
the tree, within clade V, according to GISAID nomenclature (Figure 2, Figure 3A). These
identical genomes both harbor a V367F (G22661T) mutation in the receptor binding domain of
the Spike, not observed in other genomes. Similarly, IDF0515 corresponds to a traveler from
Hubei, China. This basal genome falls outside of the three major GISAID proposed clades V, G,
and S (Figure 2, Figure 3A), but carries the G11083T mutation associated with putative lineage
V1 (Figure 3A, Figure S2), suggesting convergent evolution or more likely a reversion of the Vclade defining G26144T change. Subsequent early cases in the West or East of France
(B2334/B2340, clade V and GE1583, clade S), all with recent history of travel to Italy, add to the
genomic diversity of viruses from Northern Italy, but also do not appear to have seeded local
transmission with the current sampling (Figure 2).

The current outbreak lineages
All other sequences from Northern France fall in clade G (defined by a single non-synonymous
mutation, D614G (A23403G) in the Spike, Figure 2), and this includes sequences captured
during the steep increase of reported cases in many strongly affected regions (Figure 1). While
a more thorough sampling will be needed to confirm this observation, it suggests that, unlike
what is observed for many other European countries (Gudbjartsson, Helgason et al. 2020,
Zehender, Lai et al. 2020), the French outbreak has been mainly seeded by one or several
variants of this clade. This clade can be further classified into lineages, albeit supported again
by only 1 to 3 substitutions (putatively named G1, G2, G3, G3a, G3b), and the diversity of the
sequence from Northern France is spread out, with most regions represented in the different

lineages. Several genomes correspond to patients with recent history of travel in Europe
(GE3067, N1620, IDF2792), United Arab Emirates (IDF2936), Madagascar (HF1993) or Egypt
(B1623, B2330), and might represent additional introductions of the same clade. On the other
hand, in lineage G3b, three sequences sampled in Algeria are closely related to sequences
from France and likely represent exported cases in light of recent history of travel to France.

The syndromic surveillance allowed to capture one of the earliest representatives of clade G
(HF1463, sampled on February 19th) (Figure 2). Importantly, this sequence carries 2 additional
mutations compared to the reconstructed ancestral sequence of this clade (Figure 3B). Other
sequences sampled weeks later (IDF2849, GE1973) are more basal to the clade, highlighting
the complexity and risk of inferences based on 1 or 2 nucleotide substitutions. Because of this,
and the scarcity of early sequences in many countries in Europe, country and within-country
level phylogeographic estimations for the origin of clade G are also unreliable with the current
dataset.
Crucially, while all early symptomatic suspected COVID-19 cases were addressed to the NRC
for testing, this was no longer the case as the epidemic developed (Figure 1A). In addition,
pauci or asymptomatic cases are scarcely represented here. As the earliest representative of
clade G (HF1463) had no history of travel or contact with returning travelers, we can infer that
the virus was silently circulating in France in February, a scenario compatible with the large
proportion of mild or asymptomatic diseases (Li, Pei et al. 2020), and observations in other
European countries (Gudbjartsson, Helgason et al. 2020, Onder, Rezza et al. 2020). While this
is also compatible with the time to the most recent common ancestor estimate for clade G
(Figure 2), the current sampling clearly prevents reliable inference for the timing of introduction
in France.

This study reveals areas for potential improvement of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in
France. Several regions are poorly represented yet, likely due to the heavy burden on hospitals,
which were quickly able to perform local testing as the molecular detection tools were rapidly
shared by the NRC. Because of this, and of the syndromic-only based surveillance, we likely
underestimate the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in France.

In conclusion, our study sheds light on the origin and diversity of the COVID-19 outbreak in
France with insights for Europe, and highlights the challenges of containment measures when a
significant proportion of cases are asymptomatic.

Materials and Methods
Ethical statement
Samples used in this study were collected as part of approved ongoing surveillance conducted
by the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (NRC) at Institut Pasteur (WHO
reference laboratory providing confirmatory testing for COVID-19). The investigations were
carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)
2016/679 and Directive 95/46/EC) and the French data protection law (Law 78–17 on
06/01/1978 and Décret 2019–536 on 29/05/2019).

Sample collection
After reports of severe pneumonia in late December 2019, enhanced surveillance was
implemented in France to detect suspected infections. For each suspected case, respiratory
samples from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates) and when
possible from the lower respiratory tract, were sent to the NRC, to perform SARS-CoV-2specific real-time RT-PCR. Demographic information, date of illness onset, and travel history,
were obtained when possible. A subset of samples were selected according to the viral load and
their sampling location in order to have a broad representation across different regions of
France.

Molecular test
RNA extraction was performed with the Extraction NucleoSpin Dx Virus kit (Macherey Nagel).
RNA was extracted from 100 µl of specimen, eluted in 100 µl of water and used as a template
for RT-qPCR. Samples were tested with a one-step RT-qPCR using three sets of primers as
described on the WHO website (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/real-timert-pcr-assays-for-the-detection-of-sars-cov-2-institut-pasteur-paris.pdf?sfvrsn=3662fcb6_2).

Virus Sequencing
Viral genome sequences were generated by two different approaches. The first consisted in
direct metagenomic sequencing, which resulted in complete or near complete genome
sequences for samples with viral load higher than 1.45×104 viral genome copies/µl, which
corresponds to a Ct value of 25.6 with the IP4 primer set (Figure 1B, Supplementary material,
Table S3). Briefly, extracted RNA was first treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion) followed by
purification using SPRI beads Agencourt RNA clean XP (Beckman Coulter). RNA was
converted to double stranded cDNA. Libraries were then prepared using the Nextera XT DNA

Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 (2×150 cycles) on the
Mutualized Platform for Microbiology (P2M) at Institut Pasteur.
For samples with lower viral load, we implemented a highly multiplexed PCR amplicon approach
(Quick, Grubaugh et al. 2017) using the ARTIC Network multiplex PCR primers set v1
(https://artic.network/ncov-2019), with modification as suggested in (Kentaro, Tsuyoshi et al.
2020). Synthesized cDNA was used as template and amplicons were generated using two
pooled primer mixtures for 35 rounds of amplification. We prepared sequencing libraries using
the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) and barcoded
with NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Dual Index Primers Set 1) (New England Biolabs).
We sequenced prepared libraries on an Illumina MiSeq using MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (2×300
cycles) at the biomics platform of Institut Pasteur.

Genome assembly
Raw reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.36 (Bolger, Lohse et al. 2014) to remove
Illumina adaptors and low quality reads, as well as primer sequences for samples sequenced
with the amplicon-based approach. We assembled reads from all sequencing methods into
genomes using Megahit, and also performed direct mapping against reference genome
Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (NCBI Nucleotide – NC_045512, GenBank – MN908947) using the CLC
Genomics Suite v5.1.0 (QIAGEN). We then used SAMtools v1.3 to sort the aligned bam files
and generate alignment statistics (WysokerA, RuanJ et al.). Aligned reads were manually
inspected using Geneious prime v2020.1.2 (2020) (https://www.geneious.com/), and consensus
sequences were generated using a minimum of 3X read-depth coverage to make a base call.
No genomic deletions were detected in the genomes analyzed.

Phylogenetic analysis
A set of 100 SARS-CoV-2 sequences generated in this study (97 from France, 3 from Algeria)
was complemented with 338 genomes published or freely available sequences on GenBank or
the GISAID database. From the latter, only published sequences were chosen (Deng, Gu et al.
2020, Fauver, Petrone et al. 2020) (Supplementary material, Table S2). A total of 438 full
genome sequences were analyzed with augur and auspice as implemented in the Nextstrain

from France were subset to analyze shared SNPs. No evidence of recombination was detected
using RDP v4.97 (Martin, Murrell et al. 2015). A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built
using IQ-TREE v1.5.5 with the GTR model (Kalyaanamoorthy, Minh et al. 2017), after masking
130 and 50 nucleotides from the 5’ and 3’ ends of the alignment, respectively, as well as single
nucleotides at positions 18529, 29849, 29851, 29853 as normally set in Nextstrain
implementation for SARS-CoV-2. We checked for temporal signal using Tempest v1.5.3
(Rambaut, Lam et al. 2016). The temporal phylogenetic analyses were performed with augur
and TreeTime (Sagulenko, Puller et al. 2018), assuming clock rate of 0.0008±0.0004 (SD)
substitutions/site/year (Rambaut 2020), coalescent skyline population growth model and the
root set on the branch leading to the Wuhan/Hu-1/2020 sequence. The time and divergence
trees were visualized with FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Nucleotide
substitutions from the reference sequence that define internal nodes of the tree were extracted
from the final Nextstrain build file and annotated on the tree using a custom R script
(https://www.R-project.org/) with packages tidyverse v1.3.0 (Wickham, Averick et al. 2019) and
jsonlite v1.6.1 (Ooms 2014). Adobe Illustrator 2020 was used to prepare final tree figures.
