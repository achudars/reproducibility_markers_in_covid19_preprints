ABSTRACT

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, the viral mediator for binding and entry into the host
cell, has sparked great interest as a target for vaccine development and treatments with
neutralizing antibodies. Initial data suggest that the virus has low mutation rates, but its large
genome could facilitate recombination, insertions, and deletions, as has been described in other
coronaviruses. Here, we deep-sequenced the complete SARS-CoV-2 S gene from 18 patients (10
with mild and 8 with severe COVID-19), and found that the virus accumulates deletions
upstream and very close to the S1/S2 cleavage site, generating a frameshift with appearance of
a stop codon. These deletions were found in a small percentage of the viral quasispecies (2.2%)
in samples from all the mild and only half the severe COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that
the virus may generate free S1 protein released to the circulation. We propose that natural
selection has favored a “Don’t burn down the house” strategy, in which free S1 protein may
compete with viral particles for the ACE2 receptor, thus reducing the severity of the infection
and tissue damage without losing transmission capability.

INTRODUCTION
RNA viruses replicate using their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which
lacks proofreading mechanisms and is prone to mutate at high rates (10-3 - 10-5 substitutions
/nucleotide/replication cycle), lending the virus a quasispecies structure(1, 2). Previous studies
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis viruses
have reported moderate mutation rates of 9.06x10-7 and 2.5x10-6 subs/site/cycle respectively,
below the expected range for RNA viruses(3). This is consistent with a role for non-structural
protein (nsp) 14 in RNA proofreading or repair functions because of its 3’-5’ exonuclease (ExoN)
activity. Nonetheless, the large size of the CoV RNA genome increases the probability that
deletions will be generated and recombination events will take place, which could facilitate
adaptation to new host environments, as occurs with jumping between species1, 2. One naturally
occurring deletion on 29 nucleotides in the open reading frame (ORF) 8 of SARS-CoV after
human-to-human transmission was found to be associated with attenuation of replication(4).
The low mutation rate, high human-to-human transmissibility (R0=2.2)(5), and absence
of human pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 could explain its rapid spread through the
human population, with very high sequence identity (99.9%) between isolates recovered all over
the world (sequence published in the repository sequence data banks, GISAID and GenBank).
The high pathogenicity of the virus, the severity of COVID-19 and the lack of an effective antiviral
treatment or vaccine has pushed the scientific community worldwide to develop, in record time,
a solution for this pandemic(6).
Among the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), and
membrane (M) constituting the viral coat, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein that packages the
viral genome, the S glycoprotein is the most promising as a therapeutic and vaccine target. The
S protein is encoded by the S gene, and following trimerization, it composes the spikes of the
characteristic viral particle crown (corona). The S protein is essential for SARS-CoV-2 to infect a
host cell(7), by recognizing and binding to the human cell receptor, angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2)(8), and possibly (with lower affinity) to other receptors, such as CD209L (LSIGN), also used by SARS-CoV(9) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), used by MERS(10).
The S gene has 3,822 nucleotides with 1,273 amino acids (GenBank reference sequence
MN908947.3). It has five essential domains: the receptor-binding domain (RBD), O-linked glycan
residues flanking a polybasic S1/S2 cleavage site, fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeats HR1 and
HR2, and a transmembrane domain (TM). The S1 RBD includes 6 amino acid positions that show
high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is widely distributed, but mainly present in
alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells of the lungs(11). Once the virus is attached to the host cell receptor

cleavage occurs between subunits S1 and S2, and subunit S2 drives the viral and cellular
membranes to fuse(12). Thus, S1 recognizes and binds to the human cell receptor ACE2, whereas
S2 directly facilitates entry into the host cell. Both functions are crucial for infection, and therein
lies the interest of S as a target for the development of vaccines and antiviral agents.

Because of the importance of the S protein, we carried out a deep-sequencing study of
the S gene in upper respiratory tract samples from 18 patients with mild or severe SARS-CoV-2
disease. Of particular note, hot-spot deletion sites were found in minority mutants located
upstream and very close to the S1/S2 and S2’ cleavage sites, suggesting that these genomes
code for a truncated S protein. The variants were significantly more prevalent in patients with
mild than those with severe disease. Thus, their effect on the protein could constitute a
favorable regulatory mechanism emerging in the viral quasispecies to modulate the pathological
effect of the infection. Discussion is provided on the implications this observation may have in
the biology of SARS-CoV-2.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
PATIENTS
Upper respiratory tract specimens (naso/oropharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal
aspirates) from individuals consulting in the emergency room were collected for SARS-CoV-2
testing in the Department of Microbiology at Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron (HUVH),
Barcelona (Spain). Samples from 18 patients with no previous comorbidities other than COVID19 were included in the study. As defined by CDC criteria (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html), 10 patients had a mild clinical presentation

of COVID-19 (absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia, no hospitalization requirement, able to
manage their illness at home), whereas 8 patients had severe disease (ICU requirement for
supportive management of complications of severe COVID-19, eg, pneumonia, hypoxemic
respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, and other
complications). All patients, both those with mild and severe disease, had a favorable outcome
with resolution of the infection.
METHODS
Detection of SARS-CoV-2
The diagnosis of COVID-19 was performed by two tests, an in-house PCR assay using the
primer/probe set from the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Qiagen,
4

Germany) and a commercial real-time RT-PCR assay, the Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene,
Korea).
SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
The eighteen respiratory specimens were inactivated by mixing 140 µL of sample with
560 µL of AVL buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extraction of nucleic acids was then performed
using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturers’
instructions but without the RNA carrier, obtaining a final elution of 30 µL.
The complete S gene was amplified using a double PCR. The first RT-PCR step consisted
in amplifying 2 large fragments, 3314 base pairs (bp) and 3591bp in length, respectively. The 5’
end of primer 1 and 3’ end of primer 2 were designed to be outside the S region to ensure that
we were amplifying SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, and not subgenomic RNA. (Table S13).
The SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq HiFi DNA Polymerase
(Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for the RT-PCR. Reverse transcription was done at 50ºC
for 30 min, followed by a retrotranscriptase inactivation step at 94ºC for 2 min. Next, 30 cycles
of PCR amplification were performed as follows: denaturation at 94ºC for 15 sec, annealing at
54ºC for 30 sec, and elongation at 68ºC for 5 min. After the last cycle, amplification ended with
a final elongation step at 68ºC for 5 min.
The second round of amplification (nested) was done using overlapping internal primer
pairs to amplify fragments 470bp to 313bp in length. The FastStart High-Fidelity PCR System
dNTPack (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, CA) was used for this purpose, as follows: activation at 94ºC for
4 min, followed by 30 cycles with denaturation at 94ºC for 30 sec, annealing at 55ºC for 30 sec,
and elongation at 72ºC for 40 sec, ending with a single elongation step at 72ºC for 7 min.
PCR products were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) with QG buffer, following the manufacturers’ instructions, and eluted DNA was
quantified by fluorometry using the QUBIT dsDNA BR Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). For
each patient, PCR products were normalized to 1.5 ng/µL, pooled in a single tube, and purified
using KAPA Pure Beads (KapaBiosystems, Roche, Pleasanton, CA, USA) to ensure that no short
DNA fragments were present in the library. Library preparation was done using the KAPA Hyper
Prep Kit (Roche Applied Science, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and each pool was individually indexed
using the SeqCap Adapter Kit A/B (Nimblegen, Roche, Pleasanton, CA USA). After library
enrichment and a second clean-up with KAPA Pure Beads, the pools were quantified again using
the QUBIT dsDNA BR Assay Kit and quality-tested using the 4150 TapeStation System (Agilent).

All pools underwent a final normalization to 4 nM, and 10 µL of each pool was added to the final
library tube. The final library was qPCR-quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit
(KapaBiosystems, Roche, Pleasanton, CA USA) in a LightCycler 480 system (Roche) to obtain the
precise concentration of indexed DNA. PhiX internal DNA control (PhiX V3, Illumina, San Diego,
CA) was added to the final dilution. The library was loaded in a MiSeq Reagent Kit 600V3
cartridge (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego,
CA).

Bioinformatics analysis. InDel study
The sequence analysis aimed to obtain high-quality haplotypes fully covering the amplicons.
The pipeline comprises the following steps:
1. Amplicons were reconstructed from the corresponding R1 and R2 paired ends using
FLASH(13) and setting a minimum of 20 overlapping bases and a maximum of 10%
mismatches. Low-quality reads that did not match meet the requirements were
discarded.
2. Next, all reads with more than 5% of bases below a Phred score of Q30 were filtered
out.
3. The reads were demultiplexed by matching primers, allowing a maximum of three
mismatches, and the primers were trimmed at both read ends. Identical reads were
collapsed to haplotypes with the corresponding frequencies as read counts. A fasta file
was generated with each pool/primer/strand combination. The reverse haplotypes
were reverse complemented.
4. Raw forward and reverse haplotypes were multiple aligned with MUltiple Sequence
Comparison by Log- Expectation (Muscle)(14), then separated into strands, and
haplotypes common to both strands at abundances ≥0.1% were identified. Lowabundance haplotypes (<0.1%) and those unique to one strand were discarded. The
haplotypes common to both strands, with frequencies not below 0.1% are called
consensus haplotypes, and are the basis of subsequent computations.
The amino acid alignments were computed as follows:
1- Gaps were removed and haplotypes translated to amino acids.
2- The translated stops generated were identified, and haplotypes were trimmed after the
stop.

All computations were made in the R language and platform(15), developing in-house
scripts using Biostrings(16) and Ape(17) packages.

RESULTS
Eighteen coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients (10 mild, 8 severe) were included
in the study. In total, 48,746,647 reads, ranging from 81,202 to 597,558 reads per amplicon
(median 171,478), were analyzed from upper respiratory tract samples (Table 1), using 13
overlapping amplicons covering the complete S protein. Thus, we studied 3,749,742 complete S
genes, with a mean of 208,319 per patient. Results related to amplicon positions, coverage,
percentage of the master sequence, gap incidence per patient and per amplicon, and premature
stop codons are available as Supplementary Tables S1-S10.
Deletions were not randomly accumulated along the S gene, but instead, were found at
specific regions (Figure 1, Figures S1-S27). Deletions coded as delta (Δ1- Δ18) ranged from 1 to
42 nucleotides lost (Table 2). In some cases, the sequence recovered the correct reading frame,
in others, the frameshift caused the appearance of a premature stop codon very close to the
deletion site, whereas in still others, a new amino acid segment appeared.
Deletions were found in all amplicons, but they were mainly observed at frequencies
<1% (Table 2). Most deletions in amplicons N04, N05, N06, N10, N11, N12, and N13, were found
in only 1 or 2 patients, whereas deletions in amplicons N01, N02 N08 and N09, ranging from 2
to 16 nucleotides, were observed in 4 to 9 patients. A deletion of 6 nucleotides in amplicon N07
(nt 1865-1870), generating a stop codon, was present at a frequency of 3.84% of the
quasispecies in samples from patients P09 and P17. The largest deletion, involving 42
nucleotides (nt 1283-1324) and found in N05 of patient P09, resulted in a loss of 14 amino acids,
but the reading frame recovered.
A striking result was the accumulation of deletions (“hot-spot”) in amplicon N07,
between nucleotides 1980-2035 (aa Y660-N679) in 14/18 (78%) patients, which included 100%
of the patients with mild disease (P01-P07, P14, P15 and P18), and only half of those with severe
disease (P08, P09, P10 and P11). In this particular hot-spot, deletions Δ2 to Δ34 were produced
(Figure 2, Table 2). Among the severe patients, P12, P13, and P16 had no deletions in the N07
amplicon, and P17 showed a deletion outside this hot-spot location (Table S11). Viral variants
carrying these deletions were significantly more frequent in mild than severe COVID-19 patients
(Fisher test: odds-ratio: 95% confidence interval 0.0 - 0.9605; p=0.02288) (Table S12).

Among the total of 43, Δ15 deletions in amplicon N07, a premature stop codon appeared
immediately after the deletion site in five cases (11.6%) and the reading frame recovered after
losing 4, 5, or 7 amino acids in six cases. However, a frameshift that changed the reading frame
and caused the appearance of a premature stop codon several amino acids later was generated
in most of the deletions 32/43 (74.4%), and in consequence the S1/S2 cleavage site and the
polybasic domain (PRRAR/S) disappeared. In 39 of the 43 (90.7%) N07 deletions, a TATA box-like
motif (nt 2,007-2,010) was lost. In this particular region, the deletion was characterized by a
similar 3’ cutting edge (Table S11). An interesting result at the amino acid level was that
regardless of the starting point of the deletion (nt 654, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667 or 671), in 9 of
the mild patients (all except P14) and in 2 severe ones (P09 and P10), the frameshift caused by
the deletion generated a new peptide motif, RLRLILLGGHVV*, with a stop codon (*) at the end
(Table S11).
In 9 patients, a second deletion hot-spot was found deleting a number of nucleotides
(from 2 to 16) between positions 2451 and 2467 (aa 817F-823F), coinciding with the secondary
S cleavage site (S2’). The hot spot was located between nt2431 (811K) and nt2454 (818I), just
after the exact S2’ cleavage site (KPSKR/SFI) (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Here, we describe the naturally occurring deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 S gene in a set of
patients with mild or severe COVID 19. The deletions mainly clustered in two hot-spot regions,
one (Δ15, affecting aa660-aa679) located upstream but very close to the S1/S2 cleavage site (aa
685/686) and the second (Δ16 affecting aa817-823) situated just upstream to the secondary
cleavage site S2’ (aa 815/816). These two deletions were found in most of the patient samples
studied, and notably, the Δ15 deletion was present in 100% of patients with mild infection and
in half of those with severe disease, three fourth of the studied patients (Table 2). This finding
suggests that the deletions are not sporadic events even though these deletions were seen in a
relatively small percentage of the viral quasispecies (2.2% for Δ15; and 0.54% for Δ16). The
mutants could be interpreted as a strategy that natural selection has favored during the SARSCoV-2 infectious life cycle to facilitate extensive spread of the infection, as is discussed below.
This study involved deep-sequencing of the complete SARS-CoV-2 spike gene using 13
overlapping amplicons in laboratory confirmed samples for SARS-CoV-2 in 18 patients. In studies
with other SARS-CoV viruses, several subgenomic RNAs were reported to be generated during
the cell cycle(6, 18). To exclusively study the genomic viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2, RT-PCR was
performed using two large PCR products in which the 5’ end of primer pair 1 and the 3’ end of
primer pair 2 were designed to be outside the spike region (5’ end in ORF1ab and 3’ end in

ORF3a) (Table S13, Figure S28). Taking into consideration that CoV have 3’-5’ ExoN activity
(nsp14 protein), consistent with a proofreading mechanism to correct mutations during
replication, the deep-sequencing analysis accepted mutants present at a low frequency of
≥0.1%. Because the possibility of PCR artefacts, deep-sequencing point mutations, or deletion
of single nucleotides generated mainly at homopolymeric sites, we did not include single
deletions unless they were found in different patients and in overlapping amplicons at higher
frequencies (>1%). No insertions were found.
Entry of the viral genome into the cell depends on recognition and binding of the surface
subunit S1 to the ACE2 human receptor(11), whereas the S2 subunit is responsible for fixing the
S protein to the viral membrane surface. After binding to the ACE2 cell receptor, the S protein
is primed by the serine-protease, TMPRSS2, which leads to S protein cleavage at S1/S2 and
S2’(8). After cleavage, S1 remains attached to ACE2, while subunit S2 anchors the viral and
cellular membranes, inducing fusion and viral entry. The Δ15 deletion (Table 2) mainly causes a
frameshift that generates an in-frame stop codon. The presence of this new stop codon would
result in translation of a truncated S, which would consist of an almost complete S1 subunit, and
total absence of the S2 subunit responsible for anchoring S to the lipid membrane of the viral
particle. The absence of the S2 anchor peptide suggests that S1 could be produced as a “free”
protein (free S1). As S1 is located on the exposed outside of SARS-CoV-2 in the crown structures,
it could have hydrophilic domains and be a soluble peptide with potential for release outside
the infected cell, in the lower respiratory tract and even to plasma. (Figure 3). These free soluble
proteins, which are not a part of the viral cycle or components of the viral particles have also
been observed in other viral infections. For example, a huge amount of “empty” subviral
genomic particles, consisting of viral envelope proteins (HBsAg), are often found in plasma of
patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. These empty particles are produced and secreted
during HBV infection, and have an immunomodulatory role(19). In addition, soluble HBV e
antigen (HBeAg), which is not a component of the viral particles and shares immunoactive
epitopes with the HBV core antigen (HBcAg viral capsid component), is detected during HBV
infection and has an immunomodulator role(20).
Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is another respiratory virus with the ability to
produce pre-anchored proteins. The attachment protein (G) of HRSV is an anchored protein
whose main function is viral attachment to the host’s cell membrane through a still unknown
receptor(21). As in many other viruses, this protein has several functions, and in this case,
because of the existence of a second start codon, a soluble form of G protein lacking the anchor
is produced, and this is shed to the extracellular medium(22) in abundant quantities by infected

cells. The function of soluble, free G is to inhibit toll-like receptors, thereby modulating the host’s
immune response. Free G also binds to the host’s neutralizing antibodies, which are mainly
directed to this protein. In this way, neutralization of circulating virions is reduced, favoring viral
infection(23).
The free S1 binding subunit of SARS-CoV-2 without its membrane anchor S2 could have
similar functions (Figure 3). One putative action of secreted free S1 protein might be to attach
to the human ACE2 cell receptor, thereby competing with complete viral particles to re-infect or
newly infect respiratory tract cells, resulting in less severe disease. This could be interpreted as
an effect of natural selection to attenuate the infection and facilitate its persistence with
minimal damage, increasing the human-to-human transmission into the community. This
strategy, which we have dubbed “Don’t burn down the house” is supported by the finding that
these minor variants carrying these deletions were statistically more frequent in patients with
mild that severe COVID19. This self-modulating viral strategy has also been seen in hepatitis
delta virus (HDV) infection, where one viral antigen (short HDV antigen SHDAg) enhances HDV
replication, while a second antigen (large HDV antigen LHDAg), produced after a stop codon
edition (TAG to TGG) by cellular adenosine deaminase, acts as a negative regulator of
replication(24).
The fact that the truncated S protein was present in only a low percentage of the entire
viral quasispecies suggests that natural selection may have designed a favorable equilibrium in
which a limited number of deleted virions are generated to balance virus production with
infection of new cells during disease progression. A likely reason for maintaining a minority
population of genomes with deletions able to produce free S1 protein would be to infect a host
while causing minimal damage, which would greatly facilitate transmission of the virus within
the population. It would be of interest to determine whether the percentage of these viral
mutants changes during disease progression and whether there are differences between the
quasispecies isolated from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. As a consequence of
the frameshift a new peptide motif, RLRLILLGGHVV* appeared in several sequences with a
deletion that started in different nucleotide points. Additional work is needed to determine
whether acquisition of this peptide motif has biological consequences.
Two other putative consequences of the S mutants might be that free S1 protein could
bind with S-specific antibodies, acting as a decoy and weakening the immune response, or to
circulating ACE2, released from the cell membrane to plasma(25, 26), with cardiovascular
effects. However, as the deletions were mainly found in patients with mild disease and
considering the zoonotic origin of the virus (animal immune and cardiac systems differ from

human ones) and the short time that the virus has been evolving in the human population, we
believe that the most likely reason for maintaining a minor population of mutant genomes able
to produce free S1 protein would be to cause an infection with limited damage in the host, thus
facilitating transmission and persistence of the virus in the population. The observation of
mutation hot spots in the S gene opens the door to further work on a number of potentially
related aspects.
In a recent study (27), Lau et al reported the results of plaque purification of Vero-E6
cultured SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirate of a COVID-19 patient.
The authors found deletions of 10 to 15 nucleotides at the S1/S2 junction. In a further
experiment, infection of hamsters with virus containing these variants led to attenuated viral
disease. These findings strongly support our hypothesis that deletions close to the S1/S2
cleavage site may be a phenomenon favoured by natural selection to enhance spread of the
SARS-CoV-2. The authors failed to detect these deletions in this and other clinical specimens,
but this may be attributable to the relatively low sequencing throughput of the Sanger technique
used. In the cell culture experiments, the lack of genomes with deletions that generate a
premature stop codon in the S gene can be easily explained, as the truncated S gene would
produce non-infectious particles.
To conclude, in-depth sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 S gene in 18 patients with COVID19 enabled identification of a naturally occurring deletion very close to the S1/S2 cleavage site.
Our results indicate that the mutant S would have a large impact on the S protein, and suggest
that the virus could produce free S1, which may have implications regarding the candidacy of S
protein as a target for vaccination and antiviral treatment strategies. The deletions were
significantly more prevalent in patients with mild than in those with severe disease, supporting
the notion that they are a strategy of natural selection to decrease the injury caused after onset
of the infection. In this “Don’t burn down the house” strategy, the ability of the virus to bind
with ACE2 receptor and spread to others would be unchanged; thus its propensity for
transmission would be enhanced by a mildly affected host. To prove this hypothesis, it is
essential to further investigate whether the truncated S protein (free S1) is present in respiratory
tract specimens and in plasma.

Figure 3. Based on the life cycle of SARS-CoV, this diagram represents the hypothesis derived
from our results. Entry of the virus in the host cell is shown at the top right of the diagram. At
the transcription step, two scenarios are depicted: to the left, the viral particle resulting from
normal S protein, and to the right the viral particle resulting from truncated S. In normal
conditions, once the nucleoprotein is freed into the cytoplasm ss+RNA is translated into the nonstructural proteins required for transcription. ss+RNA is transcribed into ss-RNA and later into
genomic ss+RNA which is encapsidated (left side of the figure). Once the complete viral particle
has been formed, it is secreted from the cell by exocytosis. The right side of the figure depicts
the situation when a deletion occurs in the S gene during transcription of the complete genome
and before subgenomic mRNAs are generated to produce the structural proteins. Translation of
a deleted subgenomic spike mRNA would lead to a truncated S protein composed of the S1
domain without S2, which could be shed outside the cell as free S1. The box depicts possible
destinations of free S1, which could bind to 1) the ACE2 cell receptor, 2) S1-specific neutralizing
antibodies, or 3) free ACE2 receptor.
The red triangle indicates the deletion in genomic RNA.
