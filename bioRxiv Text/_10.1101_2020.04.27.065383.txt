ABSTRACT

25

Background

26

The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

27

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a serious infectious disease affecting human health

28

worldwide and rapidly declared a pandemic by WHO. Early, several RT-qPCR were designed by

29

using only the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.

30

Objectives

31

A few days later, when additional SARS-CoV-2 genome were retrieved, the kit GPS™ CoVID-19

32

dtec-RT-qPCR Test was designed to provide a highly specific detection method and commercially

33

available worldwide. The kit was validated following criteria recommended by the UNE/EN ISO

34

17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012.

35

Methods

36

The present study approached the in silico specificity of the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test

37

and RT-qPCR designs currently published. The empirical validation parameters specificity

38

(inclusivity/exclusivity),

39

(repeatability/reproducibility) and sensitivity (detection/quantification limits) were evaluated for a

40

minimum of 10-15 assays. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference

41

laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), (Madrid, Spain) and the Public Health

42

England (PHE; Colindale, London, UK).

43

Results

44

The GPS™ RT-qPCR primers and probe showed the highest number of mismatches with the

45

closet related non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including some indels. The kits passed all

46

parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100%

47

correlated with these obtained by suing reference methods and received an evaluation with 100%

48

of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

49

Conclusions

50

The GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, available with full analytical and diagnostic validation,

51

represents a case of efficient transfer of technology being successfully used since the pandemic

52

was declared. The analysis suggested the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test is the more

53

exclusive by far.

1. INTRODUCTION

59

Last 30th January, the Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) under the

60

International Health Regulations (IHR) declared an outbreak of pneumonia, lately named Corona

61

Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern"

62

(PHEIC). The disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-

63

CoV-2) and the first genome was rapidly provided (http://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-

64

genome/319). SARS-CoV-2 is a Betacoronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus of group 2B and, in

65

many ways, it resembles SARS-CoV, Bat-SARS-CoV and other Bat SARS-like-CoV [1-6] A few

66

weeks later, this novel coronavirus spread worldwide and forced the WHO to declare a Pandemic

67

on March 11 when more than 118,000 positives and 4,291 deaths were already registered in 114

68

countries. Today, 5th May, the number of positive cases globally amounts to more than 3.6 million

69

people with more than 250,000 deaths. Faced with the aggressiveness of this global alarm, the

70

massive, reliable, and rapid diagnosis is undoubtedly vital and foremost priority for decision-

71

making at each stage to facilitate public health interventions, and the needs have overwhelmed

72

any forecast.

73

Current molecular diagnostic tools for viral detection are typically based upon the amplification of

74

target-specific genetic sequences using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). In acute

75

respiratory infection, real time PCR (so-called quantitative PCR; qPCR) is the gold-standard and

76

routinely used to detect causative viruses as, by far, is the most sensitive and reliable method [7-

77

11]. On the 17th January, the WHO published the very first primers and probes for Reverse

78

Transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) developed by Corman et al., 2020 [12]. They used known

79

genomic data from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related (Bat viruses) to generate a non-redundant

80

alignment. The candidate diagnostic RT-PCR assay was designed upon the first SARS-CoV-2

81

sequence release, based on the sequence alignment match to known SARS-CoV. Because only

82

a single SARS-CoV-2 genome was available, the two monoplex PCR protocols (ORF1ab and N

83

genes) designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 are also reactive to SARS-CoV and Bat SARS-like-CoV.

84

A few days later, 23rd January, the same laboratory together with reference laboratories from the

85

Netherlands, Hong Kong, France, United Kingdom, and Belgium, added a third monoplex-RT-

86

qPCR [12]. Many laboratories worldwide are currently using this RT-qPCR protocol [13] and also

87

it has been the basis to develop many commercial kits. Almost simultaneously, other primers and

88

probes were designed and available by scientists from the Institut Pasteur, París; Centers for

89

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Viral Diseases, Atlanta, USA; National Institute

90

for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), China; Hong Kong University; Department of

91

Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand; the National Institute of Infectious Diseases,

Japan [12-19]. The Respiratory Viruses Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, CDC, Atlanta, recently

93

(4th February) updated a manual of Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for detection of this 2019-Novel

94

Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was modified 15th March. The SARS-CoV-2 primer and probe

95

sets were designed for the universal detection of SARS-like coronaviruses (N3 assay) and for

96

specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 assays). Finally, authors from the Institut Pasteur,

97

Paris, based on the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available on the GISAID database (Global

98

Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) on 11th January, updated a protocol for the detection of

99

SARS-CoV-2 for two RdRp targets (IP2 and IP4) [14].

100

Some biotechnology-based companies have recently developed kits for detection of SARS-CoV-

101

2, based on RT-qPCR and provided easy transfer of technology to laboratories worldwide. A fully

102

SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-qPCR thermostable kit was early launched on 27th January by Genetic

103

PCR Solutions™ (GPS™), a brand of Genetic Analysis Strategies SL. (Alicante, Spain). The

104

alignments used at that time included 13 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences released by 6 different

105

laboratories, deposited in GISAID and available since 19th January 2020. With the purpose to

106

discriminate this new SARS-CoV-2 of present outbreak from previous related SARS, a second

107

independent monoplex RT-qPCR test to detect any other non-SARS-CoV-2 was also produced

108

and provided (not shown). On this study, we have performed a deep analytical and diagnostic

109

validation of the GPS™ COVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, following the UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005

110

and ISO/IEC 15189:2012, respectively. A comparative analysis of the specificity (inclusivity and

111

exclusivity) of the designed primers and probes with most previously published RT-qPCR methods

112

is also here reported.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

124

2.1.

GENOME SEQUENCES ALIGNMENT AND PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS

125

Partial alignments of ten SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and these from strains of Bat-CoV,

126

Bat SARS-like-CoV, SARS-CoV, Pangolin-CoV (ca. 18,141 bp) and the corresponding

127

phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) was obtained by Neighbour joining method [20], with bootstrap values

128

for 1000 replicates, using the MEGA 5.2.2 software [21].

129

2.2.

IN SILICO COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PRIMERS/PROBES SPECIFICITY

130

The primers and probes of GPS™ COVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test and the RT-qPCR designs

131

recently published [12-19] were aligned to the corresponding homologous regions of 63 SARS-

132

CoV-2 strains and closely related Betacoronavirus using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool

133

(BLAST) software available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI,

134

https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) website databases (Bethesda, MD, USA). This in silico

135

analysis was periodically updated with new entries currently available. Number of mismatches of

136

the primers and probes of the GPS™ kit and the designs recently published was calculated to

137

evaluate the in silico specificity (Table 1). An illustration of the mismatching of primers/probe

138

sequences of the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, respect of the SARS-CoV-2, Bat SARS-

139

like-CoV, SARS-CoV, Bat-CoV, and Pangolin-CoV groups is shown in Figure 2.

140

2.3.

GPS™ COVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test

141

Assays using the GPS™ COVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR kit (Alicante, Spain) were prepared and

142

reaction mixtures were subjected to qPCR in a QuantStudio3 (ABI) as described in the manual

143

provided. Internal, positive, and negative PCR controls were included. Standard curve calibration

144

of the qPCR was performed by preparing ten-fold dilution series containing 10 to 106 copies of

145

standard template provide in the kit, but also using 5·106 to 5·10 copies of two complete synthetic

146

RNA genomes from SARS-CoV-2 isolate Australia/VIC01/2020 (GenBank No.: MT007544.1) and

147

isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, (GenBank No.: MN908947.3), provided by Twist Bioscience (South San

148

Francisco, United States of America).

ANALYTICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC VALIDATION OF THE GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RTqPCR Test

151

The method for SARS-CoV-2 detection using the GPS™ kit was subjected to strict validation

152

according to guidelines of the UNE/EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189 [22, 23], as

153

previously described in detail [22]. Validation terms included were repeated 10-15 times and the

154

acceptance criteria are shown in Table 2. Diagnostic validation was a service performed by the

3. RESULTS

191

The phylogenetic relationships of selected SARS-CoV-2 genomes and other Betacoronavirus

192

SARS-CoV, Bat SARS-like-CoV, Bat-CoV, and Pangolin-CoV are shown in Figure 1. The analysis

193

indicated that Bat-CoV RaTG13 and a sequence of Pangolin-CoV showed the highest sequence

194

similarity to SARS-CoV-2 (96.70% and 90.74%, respectively) while other Pangolin-CoV

195

sequences available showed a lower homology (85.21%). For in silico specificity analysis, primers

196

and probes sequences of the GPS™ kit and the other RT-qPCR designs recently published (16-

197

27), were aligned to SARS-CoV-2 and the other Betacoronaviruses sequences and number of

198

mismatches were annotated in Table 1. In order to illustrate the extent of mismatching of GPS™

199

kit, an alignment of primers/probe sequences to selected SARS-CoV sequences is shown in

200

Figure 2. Analytical and diagnostic validation of the GPS™ kit, according to the guidelines of the

201

UNE/EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189 [23, 24], was undertaken and the results were

202

summarized in Table 2. Standard calibration curves of the qPCR were performed from ten-fold

203

dilution series (Figure 3a, b) and synthetic RNA genomes of Australia/VIC01/2020 and Wuhan-

204

Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Figure 3c, d). Finally, results of diagnostic validation achieved by the

205

Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) are shown in Table 3, and 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and

206

specificity was assigned. Evaluated by the Public Health England (PHE; Colindale, London, UK)

207

and yielded 100% correlation with reference RT-qPCR (not shown).

4. DISCUSSION

225

Only three months ago, an outbreak of severe pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-

226

CoV-2 started in Wuhan (China) and rapidly expanded to almost all areas worldwide. Due to the

227

need of urgent detection tools, several laboratories developed RT-qPCR methods by designing

228

primers and probes from the alignment of a single-first provided SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence

229

to known SARS-CoV, and some of these protocols were published at the WHO website [12-19].

230

As the number of genomes available rapidly expanded during last January, the GPS™ CoVID-19

231

dtec-RT-qPCR Test was based on a more specific target for SARS-CoV-2 detection, being this

232

company one of the pioneers marketing a PCR-kit for the CoVID-19 worldwide.

233
234

The phylogenetic analysis indicated that, while SARS-CoV-2 shows a high sequence homology

235

(over 99.91-99.97%), the closest relatives were strains of several Betacoronaviruses, with

236

considerable sequence identity to Pangolin isolates, (Figure 1) which confirmed previous results

237

[1, 6, 25-27, 29]. We have found that a single genome sequence of the Bat coronavirus RaTG13

238

isolated from Rhinolophus affinis in Wuhan, showed the highest homology level (96.70%) to

239

SARS-CoV-2, as previously described [1, 2, 4, 6, 29, 230]. However, because only a single Bat-

240

CoV sequence showing this high identity is available, and it was deposited after the outbreak

241

started (27th January), the possibility of RNA contamination during genome sequencing should be

242

ruled-out before take further conclusions. During the design of the GPS™ kit, a purpose of present

243

study was the comparison in silico (Table 1) with designed primers and probes so far published

244

[12-19]. In overall, all qPCR designs were inclusive for SARS-CoV-2 as primers and probes

245

showed a good matching. Only the probe for N gene designed by Chu et al., 2020 [17] showed 4

246

mismatches which may affect to its binding, particularly considering its short primary structure. In

247

some cases, single nucleotide mismatching was observed in some primers, but none of them were

248

located close to primer 3’-end. Considering all updated alignments, only the Australia/VIC01/2020

249

sequence showed a unique mismatch to the GPS™ probe. Therefore, a full calibration was run

250

using synthetic RNA-genomes from Australia/VIC01/2020 isolate and the resulting Ct values

251

correlated with this obtained from Wuhan-Hu-1 synthetic RNA-genome (Figure 3), indicating that

252

mismatch in the probe is tolerated.

253
254

The in silico analysis for exclusivity was more complex, showing a wide range of discriminative

255

power for the methods subjected to analysis (Table 1). For instance, the two RT-qPCR designs

256

IP2 and IP4 developed by Institut Pasteur seems to discriminate well between SARS-CoV-2 and

257

other respiratory virus as confirmed for a panel of specimens [14]. The CDC from Atlanta (USA)

8

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.065383; this version posted May 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

258

designed 3 different primer/probes sets named N1, N2 and N3 [15]. We found a low exclusivity in

259

the N3 primer/probe, but a few weeks ago, this set was removed from the panel

260

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-

261

guidance/laboratory-guidance). Both N1 and N2 showed a good level of mismatching with most

262

coronaviruses except for some Pangolin-CoV sequences which showed very few nucleotide

263

differences. The RT-qPCR proposed by Corman et al., 2020, designed to detect SARS-CoV-2,

264

SARS-CoV and Bat SARS-like-CoV [12], is probably the most used worldwide. They suugested

265

the use of E gene assay as the first-line screening tool, followed by confirmatory testing with the

266

two probes P1 and P2 in the RdRp gene assay. While P1 probe should react with both SARS-

267

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, P2 probe was considered specific for SARS-CoV-2. Although our in silico

268

results confirmed that purpose for P1 (Table 1), the RdRp_P2 assay may also react with some

269

other coronaviruses. The CDC in China developed two RT-qPCR assays for ORF1ab and N genes

270

[16]. Both showed a good overall mismatching to consider they are exclusive, except for some

271

Pangolin-CoV sequences. A similar conclusion may be taken for the N-gene RT-qPCR at the

272

Ministry of Public Health of Thailand [18]. Data of Table 1 indicated that primer/probe of Chu et

273

al., 2020 [17], may be reactive with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and Bat SARS-like-CoV. The

274

exclusivity of the RT-qPCR design developed by Shirato et al., 2020 [19] clearly resided in the

275

reverse primer as showed 7 mismatches with all SARS related coronaviruses. Finally, Chan et al.,

276

2020 [13] developed three RT-qPCR assays targeting RdRp/Hel, S and N genes of SARS-CoV-

277

2. They selected the RdRp/Hel assay as considered to give the best amplification performance

278

and was tested in parallel with the RdRp-P2 from Charité-Berlin [12]. All positive patients with the

279

RdRp-P2 assay were positive with the RdRp/Hel design. However, 42 patients negative for the

280

RdRp-P2 assay were positive with RdRp/Hel and they found that only RdRp-P2 assay, but not

281

RdRp/Hel, cross-reacted with SARS-CoV culture lysates [13]. Above findings agreed with

282

expected exclusivity derived from the present study. Additional comparative in vitro analysis [31]

283

have indicated that primer/probes of ORF1ab from the CDC-China [16] seems the most sensitive,

284

the N2 and N3 assays from the CDC-Atlanta were the most recommended [31]. This partially

285

disagrees our findings as the N3 design may react with other coronaviruses than SARS-CoV-2

286

(recently removed for the CDC panel). In the study by Arun et al., 2020 [32], the specificity of

287

methods from Charité-Berlin and CDC-Atlanta were tested finding no false positive results but

288

differences in the sensitivity. The most sensitive were N2 (CDC-Atlanta) and E (Charité-Berlin).

289

However, the present study indicates the RT-qPCR for E target may react with different SARS

290

coronavirus. Finally, the kit GPS™ COVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test have shown the highest

291

number of mismatches (i.e., 19-48) for all CoV sequences described so far, including these of

292

Pangolin-CoV which showed a range of 19-31 mismatches. In addition, considerable indels were

293

discerned which enlarge even more the exclusivity of this design.

294
295

The GPS™ kit passed the analytical and diagnostic validation according to criteria of the UNE/EN

296

ISO/IEC 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189 (Table 2). The analysis standard curve was repeated a

297

minimum of ten times and average value for all parameters were optimum according to standard

298

limits. For reliability, the coefficient of variation (CV) obtained in all cases for both, repeatability

299

and reproducibility, was always much lower than 10%. The LOD was tested with the usual protocol

300

for 10 copies repeated 15 times with a positive result in all cases (100%). LOQ assays were

301

performed in two sets of 15 tests for both 10 copies of standard templates. The LOQ measurement

302

in both cases was validated with a t-Student test with a confidence interval of 95%. The kit received

303

diagnostic validation at two different reference laboratories (ISCIII, Madrid; and PHE, London).

304

The results shown in Table 3 indicated 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and 100% of diagnostic

305

specificity was assigned. Currently, the kit is being used in several Spanish hospitals and

306

diagnostic laboratories.

307
308

Obviously, at the time of designing the RT-qPCR published [12-19], a lack of SARS-CoV-2

309

genomes available may explain the relatively scarce exclusivity found in some cases. Despite the

310

greater or lesser in silico specificity of these primers and probes, due to host specificity of Bat-

311

CoV, Bat SARS-like, Pangolin-CoV, together with the fact of that no human-SARS have been

312

reported since 2004, all positive results obtained would be considered as SARS-CoV-2 infections

313

[17, 33]. However, RNA viruses may exhibit substantial genetic variability. Although efforts were

314

made to design RT-qPCR assays in conserved regions of the viral genomes, variability resulting

315

in mismatches between the primers and probes and the target sequences can result in diminished

316
