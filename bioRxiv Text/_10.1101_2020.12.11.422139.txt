Abstract
In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, two genetic regions derived from Neandertals have been
shown to increase and decrease, respectively, the risk of falling severely ill upon infection. Here, we
show that 2-8% of people in Eurasia carry a variant promoter region of the DPP4 gene inherited from
Neandertals. This gene encodes an enzyme that serves as a receptor for the coronavirus MERS-CoV
and is currently not believed to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. However, the Neandertal DPP4
variant doubles the risk to become critically ill in COVID-19.

Main text
It was recently shown that the major genetic risk factor for falling severely ill when infected with the
novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is inherited from Neandertals (Zeberg and Pääbo, 2020a). Furthermore, a
protective genetic variant for severe COVID-19 located on chromosome 12 has been shown to be
inherited from Neandertals (Zeberg and Pääbo, 2020b). In light of these findings, Neandertals
haplotypes might be of particular importance in attempts to reveal the genetic factors that predispose
individuals to severe COVID-19.
Early in the pandemic, the membrane-bound enzyme ACE2 was identified as a receptor
for SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al. 2020). ACE2 has previously been shown to be a functional
receptor for other coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-1. The facts that males are
more at risk for severe COVID-19 and that ACE2 is located on the X chromosome suggest that the
ACE2 would emerge as a risk locus for severe COVID-19 in genetic association studies. However,
to date we are not aware of that any association between ACE2 and severity of COVID-19 have been
described. MERS-CoV, a coronavirus that was discovered in 2012 and have caused outbreaks in
several countries (de Groot et al. 2013), utilizes DPP4 as a receptor (Wang et al. 2013; Stalin Raj et
al. 2013). DPP4 is a membrane-bound enzyme that degrades a number of biologically active peptides.
It is involved in several physiological systems, including the regulation of glucose metabolism
(Mentlein, 1999). Inhibitors of DPP4 are used to treat diabetes and have been suggested to affect
COVID-19 outcomes in preliminary studies (reviewed in Lim et al. 2021).
We looked for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that carry Neandertal-like
alleles at the ACE2 and DPP4 loci in the 1000 Genomes Project (Auton et al. 2015) (Supplementary
Material). In a region encompassing the entire ACE2 gene and 50,000 base pairs up- and down-stream
(chrX:15529156-15670192, hg19) we find two such SNPs. However, these SNPs are not in linkage
disequilibrium (LD) (r2 = 4e-4) and thus do not form a contiguous haplotype. For DPP4, we find 39
such SNPs in the corresponding region (chr2:162798751-162981052, hg19). They form several
haplotypes (r2>0.9) in and around the DPP4 gene (Fig. 1A).
To investigate if the Neandertal haplotypes in DPP4 are associated with severe COVID19 we used the latest release of the COVID-19 Host Genetics initiative (HGI) (The COVID-19 HGI,

2020). We find that under the rare disease assumption, the Neandertal-like alleles are associated with
~80% increased risk per allele of being hospitalized upon infection with SARS-CoV-2
(Supplementary Table S1). The most strongly associated SNP (rs117888248) has an odds ratio of
1.84 (95% CI: 1.41-2.41, p = 7.7e-6). The risk for carriers of this allele of requiring mechanical
ventilation is increased by ~109% (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.44-3.03, p = 1.2e-4). The Neandertal-like
alleles form a ~26.3 kb-haplotype (r2>0.8). Of the 15 SNP defining the haplotype (Supplementary
Table S1), 14 carry alleles seen in hetero- or homozygous forms in a Neandertal genome (Prüfer et
al. 2017). This haplotype is derived from Neandertals (p = 0.023) according to a published formula
(Huerta-Sanchez et al. 2014) and using parameters as previously described (Zeberg and Pääbo,
2020a) (Supplementary Materials). It covers the extended promoter region of DPP4.
Thus, the risk of becoming severely ill in COVID-19 when carrying the Neandertal
haplotype at the DPP4 locus is of similar magnitude as the ~100% increase in risk associated with
the previously described Neandertal haplotype on chromosome 3 (Zeberg and Pääbo 2020a) (Fig.
1B). Both these risk haplotypes have stronger effect sizes than the protective Neandertal haplotype
on chromosome 12, which decreases the risk of becoming severely ill by ~23% (Zeberg and Pääbo
2020b). The Neandertal DPP4 haplotype is present in ~1% of Europeans, ~2.5% in South Asians
~4% in East Asians, and ~0.7% in admixed Americans (Fig. 1C). It is absent among Africans south
of the Sahara.
We calculated the statistical significance of the association between the Neandertal
DPP4 haplotype and severe COVID-19 under the null-hypothesis that Neandertal haplotypes have
no impact on COVID-19. Because only a fraction of the Neandertal genome is found among presentday humans, and because Neandertal haplotypes are on average longer than other haplotypes, the
statistical power to detect associations with Neandertal haplotypes is better than for genome-wide
analyses. When we consider Neandertal haplotypes that are present in a frequency of >1% among
Europeans in the 1000 Genomes Project and are identified in previously published maps of
Neandertal contributions, we find that the effective number of hypotheses is 5,761, yielding an
'introgression wide' significance threshold of 8.7e-6 (Supplementary Material). Thus, under the nullhypothesis that Neandertal gene variants has no impact on COVID-19, the association of the DPP4
haplotype with severe disease is significant.
It was recently shown that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to DPP4 (Li et al.
2020) and that DPP4 is a functional receptor for HIV (Li et al. 2020). Moreover, DPP9, a homolog
of DPP4, is associated with severe COVID-19 (Pairo-Castineira et al. 2020). However, one report
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 does not use DPP4 as a receptor (Zhou et al. 2020). Nevertheless, the
current findings suggest that the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with membrane-bound and secreted
forms of DPP4 deserves further investigation. Inhibitors of DPP4, which can be administered orally
and are used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, may also deserve attention with respect to possible
effects on viral interactions with the its host cells, as recently pointed out (Scheen 2020, Lim et al.
2021).

It is striking that among eight genetic loci that affect the risk to contract severe COVID19 when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Pairo-Castineira et al. 2020), three carry allelic variants derived
from Neandertals. This suggests that the genetic inheritance from Neandertals may have a larger
impact on this disease than would naïvely be expected. However, local adaptation to infectious
diseases often differs among human populations that have been separated by a few tens of thousands
of years (Rees et al. 2020). Neandertals evolved largely independently from modern humans for about
half a million years (Prüfer et al. 2014), even if rare genetic contacts occurred (Kuhlwilm et al. 2016;
Meyer et al. 2016, Posth et al. 2017, Petr et al. 2020). Given the long time of separation, Neandertal
adaptation to infectious diseases may therefore have differed drastically from that of modern humans.
The combination of large effect sizes and small number of Neanderal loci (and
correspondingly smaller number of the multiple tests requiring correction) may allow associations
with infection disease susceptibility to be detected in smaller cohorts than if all variants across the
genome are considered. For the DPP4 locus, we estimate that approximately two times more patients
than currently available in HGI will be needed to achieve a 80% probability to detect the association
between DPP4 and severe COVID-19 with the standard genome-wide significance threshold (p<5e8) (Supplementary Materials).
The three Neandertal genomes available to date, which vary in age between ~120,000
years and ~50,000 years and come from Europe and southern Siberia, are all homozygous for the risk
variants on chromosome 2. Furthermore, the late Neandertal genome in Europe, which is most closely
related to the Neandertals that mixed with modern humans, was homozygous also for the risk variants
on chromosome 3 (Prüfer et al. 2017). It is thus likely that the risk variants at both these loci were at
high frequency among late Neandertals. Barring other factors that may affect disease outcome, this
means that, if alive today, a late Neandertal individual would have ~4-16 times higher risk of
becoming critically ill if infected by SARS-CoV-2. This may support speculations that epidemic
diseases could have played a role in the demise of Neandertals.

Neandertal gene-flow at the DPP4 locus
To detect introgression we first looked at alleles homozygously found in three high-coverage
Neandertal genomes (Prüfer et al. 2014, Prüfer et al. 2017, Mafessoni et al. 2020) and absent in 108
Yoruba individuals, yielding two SNPs at ACE2 and 39 and at DPP4. To further study the DPP4
locus, we investigated all SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs117888248 (Supplementary Table
S1) in the Neandertal genome (https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/jbrowse/) most closely related to the
Neandertal population that contributed genetically to present-day human (Prüfer et al. 2017). We
demonstrated gene flow from Neandertals at the DPP4 locus as previously described for the
chromosome 3 locus (Zeberg and Pääbo, 2020a); using sites carrying alleles fixed among Neandertals
and absent among Yoruba, phylogenetic trees, and the equation derived by Huerta-Sanchez et al.
(2014). Previous genome-wide analyses have also found gene-flow at this locus (Vernot et al. 2014,
Sankararam et al. 2012, Steinrücken et al. 2018, Chen et al. 2020, Skov et al. 2020).
Introgression-wide significance
The three hitherto described Neandertal genetic risk factors for severe COVID-19 are all present at
allele frequencies of ≥1% in European genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project and the COVID-19
HGI cohort. None of them are present in the three African populations in the 1000 Genomes Project
with lowest amount of Neandertal admixture (Chen et al. 2020), i.e., Mende in Sierra Leone (MSL),
Esan in Nigeria (ESN) and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI). All three haplotypes carry derived
alleles homozygously present in the three high-coverage Neandertal genomes (Prüfer et al. 2014,
Prüfer et al. 2017, Mafessoni et al. 2020). We filtered SNPs fulfilling these criteria using a set of
high-confidence Neandertal haplotypes defined by the intersection of previously published genomewide maps of gene-flow from Neandertals (Vernot et al. 2014, Sankararam et al. 2012, Steinrücken
et al. 2018, Chen et al. 2020, Skov et al. 2020). To exclude Neandertal-like variants due to incomplete
lineage sorting, we further required the resulting haplotypes to have a length of at least 10 kb. Using
these criteria, we identify 40,055 SNPs. We use these SNPs to estimate the effective number of
hypotheses in European genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project using the Genetic Type I Error
Calculator (Li et al. 2011). This yields a significance threshold of 8.7e-6 and a suggestive threshold
of 1.7e-4, for a Neandertal “introgression-wide association study” ("IWAS").
Sample size needed to detect the DPP4 haplotype
As shown above, the power to detect a variant is improved if only introgressed Neandertal haplotypes
are considered, although under different null-hypotheses. We calculated the sample size needed to
achieve genome-wide significance (p<5e-8), using standard techniques (Pirinen et al. 2020). If there
is a non-zero effect, i.e., β≠0, then the z-score is distributed as z∼N(β/SE,1) and z2∼χ21((β/SE)2). The
parameter (β/SE)2 is known as the non-centrality parameter and scales linearly with sample size. The

non-central chi-squared distribution was used to calculated the probability of observing a sufficiently
strong association, i.e. statistical power. To reach 80% power to detect the Neandertal DPP4
haplotype we find that we need approximately twice the sample size. For 99% detection probability
the sample size needs to tripple.
