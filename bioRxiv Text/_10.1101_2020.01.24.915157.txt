Abstract
There is concern about a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, as a global public health threat. In
this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this
new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of
2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5
from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that
the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while
homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the
viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like
Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and
nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct
from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it
the ability to infect humans.

The family Coronaviridae comprises large, single, plus-stranded RNA viruses isolated from several
species and previously known to cause common colds and diarrheal illnesses in humans [1]. A
previously unknown severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was observed in 2002 and later in
2003, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was associated with the SARS outbreak [1]. Recently, a new
coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has emerged in the region of Wuhan (China) as a cause of severe
respiratory infection in humans. A total of 440 pneumonia cases have been confirmed in China up
today (the State Council Information Office in Beijing, capital of China, Jan. 22, 2020). Animal to
human transmission is considered the origin of epidemics as many patients declared to have visited
a local fish and wild animal market in Wuhan in November. Quite recently, evidence has been
gathered for animal to human and inter-human transmission of the virus [2][3].
While prompt diagnosis and patient isolation are the hallmarks for an initial control of this new
epidemic, molecular epidemiology, evolutionary models and phylogenetic analysis can help
estimate genetic variability and the evolutionary rate that in turn have important implications for
disease progression as well as for drug and vaccine development. In this short report, we provide a
phylogenetic three of the 2019 nCoV and identify sites of positive or negative selection pressure in
distinct regions of the virus.
The complete genomes of 15 2019-nCoV sequences have been downloaded from GISAID
(https://www.gisaid.org/) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). A dataset have
been built using 5 Highly similar sequences for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus (SARS),
2 sequences for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and 5 Highly similar sequences for Bat
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus respectively. The percentage of similarity has been
identified

using

(BLAST;

the datasets. The Dataset including 27 sequences has been aligned using multiple sequence
alignment (MAFFT) online tool [4] and manually edited using Bioedit program v7.0.5 [5].
Maximum likelihood (ML) methods were employed for the analyses because they allow for testing

different phylogenetic hypotheses by calculating the probability of a given model of evolution
generating the observed data and by comparing the probabilities of nested models by the likelihood
ratio test. The best-fitting nucleotide substitution model was chosen by JModeltest software [6]. ML
tree was reconstructed using Generalised time reversible (GTR) plus Gamma distribution and
invariant sites (+G +I) as evolutionary model using MEGA-X. [7]
Adaptive Evolution Server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) was used to find eventual sites of positive
or negative selection. At this purpose the following tests has been used: fast-unconstrained Bayesian
approximation (FUBAR) [8]. These tests allowed to infer the site-specific pervasive selection, the
episodic diversifying selection across the region of interest and to identify episodic selection at
individual sites [9]. Statistically significant positive or negative selection was based on p value <
0.05 [9].
Homology models have been built relying on the website SwissModel [10]. Structural templates
have been searched and validated using the software available within the SwissModel environment
and HHPred [11]. Homology models have been validated using the QMEAN tool [12]. Threedimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL [13]. To map the structural
variability of the N, E, S and M regions of the virus and their sites under selection pressure,
homology modelling has been applied on the sequence of 2019-nCoV.
The ML phylogenetic tree, performed on whole genome sequences, is represented in Figure 1. In
the tree, MERS virus sequences formed a distinct clade (clade I) from Bat SARS-like coronavirus,
SARS virus and the 2019-nCoV clustering together in clade II. This clade includes two different
clusters, the cluster IIa with Bat SARS-like coronavirus and the 2019-nCoV sequences whereas the
cluster IIb with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus and the SARS virus sequences. The 2019-nCoV is
significantly closely related only to the specific Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolated from
Rhinolophus sinicus in 2015 in China (MG772934.1) (Figure 1).
Regarding the FUBAR analysis performed on the N Region, significant (p-value<0.05) pervasive
episodic selection was found in 2 different sites (380th and 409th nucleotide position using the

reference sequence; Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan-Hu-1
MN908947.3). Concerning the sequences in clade II, on the 409th aminoacidic position in Wuhan
coronavirus sequence there is a glutamine instead of an asparagine residue while on the 380th
aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence there is a threonine residue instead of an
alanine.. Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive negative selection in 6 sites (14%) has been evidenced and
confirmed by FUBAR analysis.
On the S Region, significant (p-value < 0.05) pervasive episodic selection was found in 2 different
sites (536th and 644th nucleotide position using the reference sequence; Wuhan seafood market
pneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan-Hu-1 MN908947.3). For the sequences in clade II, on the
536th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence there is a asparagine residue instead of
an aspartic acid residue while on the 644th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence
there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue. Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive negative
selection in 1065 sites (87%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis, suggesting
that S Region could be highly conserved.
No sites under positive selection sites have been found in the E and M region.
The N region of the 2019-nCoV homology model has been built using a SARS coronavirus
nucleocapsid protein structure (2jw8.1) since the statistical test have shown that this is the most
stable and similar model among the other possible structures (Ramachandran Favoured 90.52%,
GMQE 0.17, QMEAN -2.43), while for the S region the 2019-nCoV homology model has been
built using a SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein (6acc.1) for the same reasons (Ramachandran
Favoured 87.87%, GMQE 0.83, QMEAN -3.14)
The further structural and molecular analysis of the Nucleocapsid region of the 2019-nCoV
(MN908947.3) has highlighted that 2019-nCoV and the Bat SARS-like coronavirus (MG772934.)
share the same aminoacidic sequence near the 309th position (SKQLQQ) while the SARS reference
genome has a different aminoacidic sequence (SRQLQN). The same results have been found in the
380th aminoacidic position (KADET for 2019-nCoV and Bat SARS-like coronavirus and KTDEA

for the SARS reference genome), in particular, in this case, the 2019-nCoV has a polar amino acid
while the SARS has a non-polar amino acid (Figure 2).
Regarding the sites under positive selective pressure found on the Spike Glycoprotein, the results
have shown that the 536th aminoacidic position in 2019-nCoV has an asparagine residue while the
Bat SARS-like coronavirus has a glutamine residue, the SARS virus, instead, has an aspartic acid
residue. On the 644th aminoacidic position in 2019-nCoV sequence there is a threonine residue
while the Bat SARS-like virus has a serine residue, instead the SARS virus has an alanine residue
The data reported above show that the new 2019-nCoV significantly clustered with a sequence from
the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus isolated in 2015. Moreover, in the phylogenetic tree, these two
sequences are separated from the other Bat SARS-like coronavirus sequences, suggesting that this
Bat SARS-like coronavirus is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019-nCoV than to
the other sequences of Bat SARS-like coronavirus. This supports the

hypothesis that

the

transmission chain began from bat and reached the human. All other genomic sequences
represented in the phylogenetic tree, also including SARS and MERS coronavirus, clustered
separately thus excluding that the virus involved in the actual epidemic could belong to these subgenuses. The structural analysis of two important viral protein, the nucleocapsid and the spike-like
nucleoprotein (protein S), confirmed the significant similarity the new coronavirus with the batlike SARS coronavirus and its difference from SARS coronavirus.
From the selective pressure and structural analysis, mutations of surface proteins, as the spike
protein S, and of nucleocapsid N protein conferring stability to the viral particle have been shown.
The viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell after by binding to a cell receptor
and membrane fusion, two key roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. The N protein is a
structural protein involved in virion assembly, playing a pivotal role in virus transcription and
assembly efficiency. Mutation of these proteins could determine two important characteristics of the
coronavirus isolated during the 2019nCoV epidemic, a higher stability than the bat-like SARS
coronavirus and a lower pathogenicity than SARS coronavirus. These features can explain the

2019-nCoV zoonotic transmission and

its initial lower severity than SARS epidemic. These

results doesn’t exclude that further mutation due to positive selective pressure, lead by the epidemic
evolution, could favor an ehancement of pathogenicity and transmission of this novel virus.
Recently, Ji et al. described homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of 2019nCoV
favoring cross-species transmission and suggested snake as probable virus reservoir for human
infection because its Resampling Similarity Codon Usage (RSCU) bias is more similar to Bungarus
multicinctus snake compared to other animals and humans[3]. In a previous article has been proven
that compositional properties, mutation pressure, natural selection, gene expression and
dinucleotides affect the codon usage bias of Bungarus species [14].
These data along with data from our study, enforcing bat origin of infection, could clarify the
transmission dynamic of the 2019-nCoV supporting infection control policy during the ongoing
epidemic.
