Abstract
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus SARSCoV-2 (CoV2-S) binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
representing the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an
automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with
CoV2-S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2-S and does not block the
interaction of CoV2-S with ACE2. Notwithstanding, infection studies revealed potent and
specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up
new vistas in developing SARS-CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the
ACE2 interaction of the virus and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and
tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular
interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being
reported.

Introduction
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 binds via its spike protein (CoV2-S) to the extracellular domain
of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) initiating the entry process into target
cells. CoV2-S is a trimeric, highly glycosylated class I fusion protein. It binds to ACE2 via the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of its S1 subunit.1 The trimeric spike exists in a closed form
which does not interact with ACE2 and in an open form where one RBD is in the so-called ‘up’
conformation exposing the ACE2 binding site.2,3 Upon RBD binding to ACE2 the interaction
between the S1 and S2 subunits is weakened allowing S2 to undergo substantial structural
rearrangements to finally fuse the virus with the host cell membrane.2,3 The important role of
the RBD for viral infectivity is underlined by the analyses of neutralizing antibodies from sera

of human re-convalescents, which reveal binding of these antibodies to RBD.4,5 Consequently,
almost all published neutralizing antibodies developed for therapeutic use target RBD,
including humanized monoclonal antibodies6, antibodies cloned from human B cells7-9 and
single-chain camelid antibodies.10,11 However, mutations in RBD of CoV2-S can cause RBDtargeted antibodies ineffectual while the virus’s interaction with ACE2 remains unchanged or
even found improved.12 To address this limitation, additional inhibitors of viral infection and a
different mode of action, e.g., by targeting other domains of CoV2-S are highly desired but of
limited availability.
Against this backdrop, we here report on a DNA aptamer with a different modality of inhibiting
viral infection. As the aptamer does not interact with RBD, it does not interfere with the binding
of CoV2-S to ACE2. Regardless, the aptamer inhibits viral infection, exemplified by employing
a CoV2-S pseudotyped virus and an ACE2 expressing cell line. These findings demonstrate
that viral infection can be inhibited independent of targeting RBD and suggest that inhibition
could be possible despite the virus has already bound to cells. The results open the path to
inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection with hitherto inaccessible modes of action.

RESULTS
Selection and characterization of CoV2-S binding aptamers
To identify single-stranded (ss)DNA aptamers that bind to CoV2-S we employed an automated
selection procedure13. The trimerized His-tagged extracellular domain of CoV2-S, stabilized in
the prefusion conformation, was expressed and purified from HEK293 cells14,15 and
immobilized for the selection on magnetic beads. After twelve selection cycles (Supporting
Fig. 1a) the enriched ssDNA libraries were analyzed for improved CoV2-S binding by flow
cytometry using cy5-labelled ssDNA and CoV2-S immobilized on magnetic particles (Fig. 1a).
These experiments revealed an increased fluorescence signal of the ssDNA from selection cycle
12 in the presence of CoV2-S (Fig. 1a). No interaction was observed when particles without
CoV2-S or particles modified with His6-Erk2 or His6-dectin-1 were used, indicating specificity
of the enriched ssDNA library. In contrast, the ssDNA library from selection cycle 1 did not
show interaction with the particles, independent of their modification state (Fig. 1a). The
enriched DNA populations were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS), in which 106
to107 sequences were analyzed per selection cycle (Supporting Fig. 1b). This analysis revealed
a strong decrease in the number of unique DNA sequences, starting from selection cycle 4 and
levelling between 10% to 5% of unique DNA sequences in selection cycle 7 to 12 (Fig. 1b).
Likewise, the distribution of nucleotides within the initial random region changed significantly

throughout the course of selection, in which guanine is the most frequently enriched nucleotide
(Supporting Fig. 1c). These data reveal a strong enrichment of DNA sequences, which is
further supported by the occurrence of sequences with high copy numbers, e.g., > 100.000 per
sequence starting from the DNA populations from selection cycle 5 onwards (Fig. 1c). Further
in-depth population analysis revealed the occurrence of sequence families, termed family 8, 13,
22, 29, and 30 (Fig. 1d, Supporting Fig. 1d, Supporting Table 1). Whereas the frequency of
sequences belonging to family 8 started to enrich from cycle 8 onwards, all other families were
observed in the DNA populations from selection cycles 4 to 6, having maximum frequency
between selection cycles 7 to 10 and declined afterwards (Fig. 1d). We chose representative
monoclonal sequences within each family that reflect the enrichment patterns (SP1-7, Fig. 1e)
and tested them regarding interaction with CoV2-S using flow cytometry. These studies
revealed interaction of the family 8 sequences SP5, SP6, SP7 with CoV2-S (Fig. 1f,g). All other
sequences and a scrambled version of SP5 (SP5sc) as putative non-binding negative control
sequence did not interact with the target protein (Fig. 1f). SP5, SP6, and SP7 bind with high
specificity to CoV2-S; no binding to the isolated RBD, ACE2 or to the spike protein of SARSCoV (CoV-S) was observed (Fig. 1h). Kinetic analysis by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of
the interaction of CoV2-S with 5’-biotinylated aptamer variants immobilized on streptavidin
coated sensor surfaces show high affinity binding to CoV2-S, with dissociation constants (KD)
between 9 and 21 nanomolar (Tab. 1, Supporting Fig. 2a,b). All aptamers revealed
comparable KD values at 37°C vs. 25°C (Tab. 1). A qualitative assay16 to determine the impact
of the 5’-modifications on the aptamers CoV2-S binding properties revealed only minor
influence of the 5’-cy5-, 5’-biotin-, or 5’-hydroxyl labels (Supporting Fig. 2c). SP5 showed a
slightly decreased binding in the hydroxyl state whereas binding of SP6 to CoV2-S was found
to increase by ~50% in the unmodified state as compared to the 5’-cy5-modified version
(Supporting Fig. 2c). The interaction properties of SP7 appeared to be independent of 5’modifications (Supporting Fig. 2c).
SP6 as a representative of the family 8 was chosen for further analysis (Fig. 1g). Based on
secondary structure predictions (Supporting Fig. 2d), the aptamer was initially truncated,
yielding SP6.51, and analyzed by flow cytometry for CoV2-S binding. Interestingly, SP6.51
showed strongly improved binding compared to the parental SP6 aptamer (Fig. 1i). Further
truncation of SP6, yielding variants with 45 nucleotides (nt, SP6.45), 41 nt (SP6.41), or 34 nt
(SP6.34) maintained the elevated binding properties. When SP6 was truncated to 30 nt (SP6.30)
binding fell back to the level of the original SP6 aptamer whereas the interaction with CoV2-S
was entirely lost by removing additional 11nt (SP6.19, Fig. 1i, Supporting Fig. 2d). Moreover,

based on the secondary structure prediction of SP6.34, we investigated the interaction of the
point mutants of the minimal aptamer variant SP6.34, namely SP6.34A, SP6.34G and SP6.34C
with CoV2-S by flow cytometry. These point mutants were chosen to either stabilize (SP6.34C)
or destabilize (SP6.34A, SP6.34G) the putative apical stem structure (Fig. 1j). However, all
point mutants revealed severely diminished binding to CoV2-S, whereas binding of SP6.34A
was still detectable (Fig. 1i), albeit to a much lesser extent than SP6. Mutating the positions
equivalent to SP6.34C in the parental aptamer SP6, yielding SP6C, also abolishes CoV2-S
binding (Fig. 1k). To conclude the characterization of SP6, the impact of mono- and divalent
ions on CoV2-S binding was assessed by flow cytometry of both, the parental and minimal
variant of the aptamer. These studies reveal that the binding of SP6 to CoV2-S is sensitive
towards the presence of K+ and strongly depends on Mg2+-ions (Fig. 1k). The binding of the
parental aptamer SP6 to CoV2-S was maintained in the absence of K+-ions, whereas the
interaction of the minimal variant SP6.34 was found to be reduced by about 50% compared to
its level obtained in PBS (Fig. 1k). These data indicate that K+-ions are most likely required for
supporting structure formation of the aptamer, which is more pronounced in the truncated
variant than in the parental full-length aptamer, but not essential for CoV2-S binding.

Aptamers selected for the RBD do not interact with CoV2-S
We also performed automated selection procedures to target the isolated RBD of Cov2-S
(Supporting Fig. 3). Conventional automated selection conditions, as applied targeting CoV2S (Fig. 1), resulted in strong overamplification during the PCR step (Supporting Fig. 3a),
which could be decreased by reducing the amount of target (10% compared to the conventional
approach, Supporting Fig. 3b) or by adding heparin as a competitor during the incubation step
of the selection procedure (Supporting Fig. 3c). Interaction analysis of the obtained DNA
libraries from the selection cycles in which no or very low overamplification was observed, i.e.
cycle 6 of the conventional procedure (Supporting Fig. 3a), cycle 9 when less target was used
(Supporting Fig. 3b), and cycle 8 when heparin was added (Supporting Fig. 3c), revealed
enrichment of RBD binding species in all selections (Supporting Fig. 3d). However, none of
the enriched RBD-binding libraries interacted with full-length CoV2-S comprising the
complete extracellular domain (Supporting Fig. 3d). The starting library, used as negative
control, neither bound to RBD nor to CoV2-S, whereas the library enriched for CoV2-S (R12
CoV2-S, Fig. 1a), used as positive control, showed binding to CoV2-S as expected
(Supporting Fig. 3d). Of note, library R12 CoV2-S also revealed interaction with RBD,
although to a lesser extent than to CoV2-S (Supporting Fig. 3d). Therefore, we decided to use
the library R12 CoV2-S to conduct three additional selection cycles (cycles 13-15) enriching
for those species that bind predominantly to RBD instead of other domains of CoV2-S, that are
presumably targeted by SP5, SP6, and SP7 (Fig. 1h). We again used the conventional selection
approach (cycles 13-15, Supporting Fig. 3e) and a selection variant with less (10%) RBD than
in the preceding selection (cycles 13*-15*, Supporting Fig. 3e). In both cases
overamplification was observed from cycle 13/13* on, although less pronounced as during the
de novo selection targeting RBD under previously applied selection conditions (Supporting
Fig. 3a). Both enriched libraries (R15/R15*) showed binding to RBD but no interaction with
CoV2-S (Supporting Fig. 3f). Next-generation sequencing of the obtained libraries revealed
two strongly enriched distinct families (Supporting Fig. 3g-i, Supporting Tables 2,3). We
chose four representative sequences, RBD1-4, and performed interaction analysis. These
experiments were found to be in-line with the observations obtained with the enriched libraries,
i.e. the sequences bound to RBD (Supporting Fig. 3j) but not CoV2-S (Supporting Fig. 3k).

targeting CoV2-S but declining thereafter, all RBD binding sequences only increased in copy
numbers when the target changed from CoV2-S to RBD in selection cycles 13-15 (Supporting
Fig. 3l) and 13* to 15* (Supporting Fig. 3m). These data indicate that targeting RBD of CoV2S with DNA libraries, in our hands, was not productive in yielding aptamers interacting with
the full-length extracellular domain of CoV2-S protein in vitro.

SP6 inhibits viral infection independent of the interaction of CoV2-S with ACE2
We next performed pulldown experiments to further characterize and verify the interaction of
SP6 with CoV2-S (Fig 2a). In these experiments, biotinylated SP6 or SP6C were incubated
with the respective protein and the complexes were collected by adding streptavidin coated
magnetic beads. After washing, the remaining proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
Coomassie staining of the gel. Aliquots were taken and analyzed prior to the incubation with
the magnetic beads (input, Fig. 2a), from the supernatant after incubation with the magnetic
beads (unbound, Fig. 2a) and from the bead/aptamer bound fraction (eluate, Fig. 2a). SP6
revealed binding to CoV2-S (Fig. 2a, eluate, lane 2) but not to CoV-S (eluate, lane 6) nor to
ACE2 (eluate, lane 4) or the unrelated control protein Nek7 (eluate, lane 5). In this experiment,
SP6C showed weak binding to CoV2-S (Fig. 2a, eluate, lane 1). In agreement with the results
obtained by flow cytometry (Fig. 1h) binding of SP6 to CoV2-S was not reduced even in the
presence of a fivefold molar excess of RBD (Fig.2a, eluate, lane 3).
As SP6 appears not to interact with the RBD of CoV2-S, we investigated whether SP6 has an
impact on the interaction of CoV2-S and ACE2. To this end, His-tagged CoV2-S was pulled
by Ni-NTA magnetic beads and the co-pulldown of untagged ACE2 (ACE2∆His) was analyzed
in the presence or absence of SP6 (Fig. 2b). As before, input, unbound and eluate fractions were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Whereas the interaction between CoV2-S and
ACE2 was abolished by the RBD-binding control nanobody VHH E (Fig. 2b, eluate, lane 4),
SP6 did not affect this interaction (eluate, lane 3). Densitometric analysis of the respective
bands resulted in ACE2:Cov2-S ratios of 0.18 and 0.16 in the absence (eluate, lane 1) or
presence (eluate, lane 3) of SP6, respectively.
Having shown SP6 interacts with CoV2-S without interfering with complex formation with its
cellular receptor ACE2, we next studied the impact of SP6 on viral infection. To address this
question, we used the established VSV-∆G*-based pseudotype system17,18 and generated Cov2S and VSV-G pseudotyped virus particles. The interaction of SP6 with the CoV2-S pseudotyped
virus was verified by an enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA).19 In this experiment,
the CoV2-S protein or the CoV2-S pseudotyped virus were captured by a nanobody binding to

the RBD of CoV2-S and after washing the bound protein or pseudovirus particles were detected
by adding biotinylated SP6, streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugates and its
substrate 2,2′-Azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) (Supporting Fig. 4).
We observed a concentration dependent increase in signal when SP6 and SP6.34 were used for
detection, but not when employing SP6C and SP6.34C (Supporting Fig. 4a). Likewise, SP6
but not SPC6C detected the CoV2-S pseudotyped virus. The VSV-G pseudotype was not
detected demonstrating the specificity of the assay (Fig 2c). Next, ACE2-expressing Vero E6
cells were infected with Cov2-S or VSV-G pseudotyped virus particles, which had been preincubated with SP6 or SP6C (Fig. 2c). Pseudotype particle numbers were adjusted to result in
infection rates between 8 % and 10 % for the aptamer-untreated pseudotypes (Supporting Fig.
4b,c). This infection rate was chosen to prevent multiple infections of a single cell precluding
reliable measurements. SP6 showed a concentration-dependent reduction of infection of Vero
E6 cells by the CoV2-S pseudotype virus (Fig. 2d, Supporting Fig. 4b,c). In contrast, the
infection of the VSV-G pseudotype was not affected (Fig. 2d). These results demonstrate the
dependence of the inhibitory effect of SP6 on the presence of CoV2-S on the viral particles and
exclude unspecific effects on the infection process of the VSV-G vector. The presence of SP6C
also led to some reduction of infection which, however, did not reach statistical significance.
The seeming discrepancy to the lack of binding of SP6C to CoV2-S in the binding assay (Fig.
1k) or the ELONA (Fig. 2c) is explained by the higher concentrations of SP6C used in the
infection assay. In addition, unmodified SP6 (as used in the infection assay) shows stronger
binding to CoV2-S than the 5´-modified versions (Supporting Fig. 2c) and this can also be
assumed for SP6C. The slight inhibitory effect of SP6C is in-line with its observed weak
interaction with CoV2-S in the pulldown assay (Fig. 2a).
Whereas ACE2 is the most important receptor for CoV2-S, at least two co-receptors are known
to contribute to CoV2-S binding to target cells, heparan sulfate and neuropilin-1.20,21 Therefore,
we investigated whether SP6 affected binding of CoV2-S pseudotyped particles to cells even if
it did not inhibit CoV2-S binding to ACE2. For this purpose, VSV-∆G* was pseudotyped with
CoV2-S carrying a HiBiT tag at the C-terminus. Vero E6 cells were incubated with these
particles and bound virus was quantified by NanoBiT reconstitution (Fig 2e). Whereas the
known inhibitor heparin22 reduced binding of CoV2-S pseudotyped particles, neither SP6 nor
SP6C had an effect on binding. These data show that SP6 reduces pseudovirus infection by
interfering with a process occurring after binding of the pseudovirus to cells.

Discussion
In conclusion, we describe the DNA aptamer SP6 binding to CoV2-S and with the potential to
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. A remarkable and unexpected feature of SP6 is that its
inhibitory effect does not result from interfering with the interaction of CoV2-S with ACE2.
This feature distinguishes the mode of action of SP6 from that of CoV2-S targeting antibodies.
Currently, the overwhelming majority of these antibodies bind to the RBD of CoV2-S6-11 and
prevent ACE2 interaction by either directly competing with ACE2 for binding6-10 or by
stabilizing an ACE2 binding-incompetent conformation11. Antibodies not binding to RBD but
to the N-terminal domain of CoV2-S have also been shown to prevent interaction of CoV2-S
with ACE2 although by an yet unknown mechanism.10 To our knowledge, neutralizing
antibodies targeting the S2 domain have not yet been described. At present, the molecular
mechanism by which SP6 inhibits viral infection is unknown. As the binding of CoV2-S
pseudotypes to cells is not affected, we conclude that a step occurring after binding must be
impeded. This could involve preventing S2´ cleavage or destabilizing the prefusion
conformation of the spike protein. The latter mechanism has been shown to lead to viruses
bearing spike proteins in the postfusion conformation and has been reported for an antibody
neutralizing SARS-CoV.23 This antibody, however, binds to the RBD. We anticipate that the
elucidation of the mechanism by which SP6 inhibits infection will provide insight into how
CoV2-S triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes.
There is an increasing number of currently reported mutations in SARS-CoV-29, among which
the most recent example is the apparently faster spreading lineage VUI-202012/01, also named
B.1.1.7.24 This variant shows several mutations in the RBD resulting in escape of binding to
some antibodies. Since more escape mutations in the RBD can be expected to further arise in
the future, RBD-independent modalities to prevent infection, as revealed by SP6, are of
relevance and need to be investigated.
SP6 might be further optimized to increase potency. For example, homo- or heterovalent
multimers could be engineered by combining SP6 with itself or aptamers (or other ligands)
binding to different CoV2-S domains, a strategy employed previously to gain very potent
thrombin inhibitors.25,26 Indeed, di- or trimerization of CoV2-S antibodies has been shown to

increase their potency.11,27 The automated selection process enables the rapid generation of
aptamers, for example for mutated proteins of SARS-CoV-2 lineages that escape treatment
regimens by aptamers, antibodies, or other active pharmaceutical ingredients. Likewise, reselection strategies to adapt SP6 towards mutations are also possible. In addition to these
features, aptamers provide means to develop antigen tests, exemplified by the presented SP6based ELONA data. The ease by which aptamers can be synthesized, their low batch-to-batch
variations and long shelf lives predestines SP6 for various diagnostic and treatment options,
e.g., as inhalation spray.

Material and Methods
Coupling of SARS-CoV-proteins to Dynabeads His-Tag isolation & pulldown
For immobilization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, Dynabeads His-Tag Isolation & Pulldown
(ThermoFisher) were used. For this purpose, 9.6 nmol of SARS-CoV-proteins, prepared in
1 mL wash/binding buffer (50 mM Sodium-Phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween®20) were coupled to 100 µL of bead solution (40 mg beads/mL), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The provided buffer, by the manufacturer, of the bead solution was
discarded by separation before coupling, using a DynaMag™-2 Magnet (ThermoFisher). For
the coupling reaction, the solution was incubated for 30 min on 4°C, using a Tube Revolver
Model D-6050 (neoLab) rotating at a speed of 20 rpm. According to the manufacturer’s
protocol, three washing steps with 1 mL wash/binding buffer were carried out, followed by one
additional washing step with storing buffer (ssDNA selection = 1.25× PBS; 171.25 mM NaCl
(Fisher Scientific), 3.38 mM KCl (Roth), 12.5 mM Na 2HPO4 (Roth), 2.2 mM KH2PO4 (Roth), pH
7.4; 1 mg/mL Albumin (BSA) Fraction V (pH 7.0) (AppliChem); 3.25 mM MgCl 2 // 2’fRNA
selection = 1.25× PBS; 171.25 mM NaCl (Fisher Scientific), 3.38 mM KCl (Roth), 12.5 mM
Na2HPO4 (Roth), 2.2 mM KH2PO4 (Roth), pH 7.4; 1 mg/mL Albumin (BSA) Fraction V (pH 7.0)
(AppliChem), before resuspending SARS-CoV-2-protein beads in 1 mL of storing buffer. In the
particular case of competitor, 0.125 mg/mL Heparin was added to the storing buffer.
Automated selection of ssDNA aptamers
For the selection of ssDNA aptamers, the D2 DNA library (5′ – GGG AGA GGA GGG AGA
TAG ATA TCA A – N40 – T TTC GTG GAT GCC ACA GGA C − 3′) was used (Ella Biotech
GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). For amplifying the library, the following primers were used:
forward primer (Cy5-D2 fw) 5′ Cy5 –GGG AGA GGA GGG AGA TAG ATA TCA A – 3′ and
reverse primer (Phos-D2 rv) 5′ P – GTC CTG TGG CAT CCA CGA AA – 3′. PCR master mix
for amplification reaction (colorless GoTaq® Flexi Buffer (Promega), 2 mM MgCl 2 (Roth),
0.2 mM dNTP (Genaxxon)). The PCR reaction was performed by using GoTaq® G2 Flexi DNA
Polymerase (Promega), including 1 µM of Cy5-D2 fw and Phos-D2 rv primers, in a total
reaction volume of 100 µL and the cycling program 30 s 95 °C, 30 s 62 °C, and 30 s 72 °C in a
TRobot thermal cycler (Biometra). In the first four selection cycles 18 PCR cycles were used
and in all following selection cycles 16. For all steps performed on the TRobot, an arched autosealing lid (Bio-Rad) was used to seal the reaction plate. 1 µL GoTaq® G2 Flexi DNA
Polymerase (5u/µL, Promega) was added to start the PCR reaction. The automated pipetting
steps were performed by a Biomek NXP (Beckman Coulter). The automated selection was
started by 0.5 nmol of D2 ssDNA library pipetted to the SARS-CoV-proteins immobilized on
Dynabeads His-Tag Isolation & Pulldown (ThermoFisher) and an incubation for 30 min at 37 °C
while shaking at a speed of 700 rpm; pipetting up and down every 5 min during incubation.
Selection buffer was PBS/3 mM MgCl2/0.8 mg/mL BSA (PBS: 137 mM NaCl (Fisher Scientific),
2.7 mM KCl (Roth), 10 mM Na 2HPO4 (Roth), 1.76 mM KH2PO4 (Roth), pH 7.4). After
incubation, the samples were washed two times with 100µL wash buffer (PBS/3 mM MgCl2).
Washing steps were increased every selection cycle by two more washes until a total of eight
washes per selection cycle was reached. Prior to PCR, the bound ssDNA molecules were
recovered by incubation in ddH2O (TKA Wasseraufbereitungssysteme GmbH) for 5 min at
15

80 °C. After PCR, a lambda exonuclease (final 20u, ThermoFisher) digestion was performed
for 60 min at 37°C to generate ssDNA for the next selection cycle.
Agarose gel analysis
Agarose LE (Genaxxon) was used to prepare 4% agarose gels pre-stained with ethidium
bromide (Roth). 1 µL 6x DNA Loading Dye (Thermo Scientific) was mixed with 5 µL of dsDNA
products and loaded on the gel. As reference, 4 µL of GeneRuler Ultra Low Range DNA Ladder
(Thermo Scientific) were loaded. A Genoplex system (VWR) was used for visualization of the
stained dsDNA.
DNA interaction analysis
For interaction studies of the selected libraries and individual sequences CoV2-S, RBD, CoVS or ACE2 were immobilized on magnetic particles (ThermoFisher) via a His-tag according to
manufacturer’s instructions and stored in 1.25× PBS with 1 mg/ml BSA at 4°C. 4 µl of the bead
suspension were incubated with 500 nM DNA in a final volume of 10 µl in PBS with 3 mM
MgCl2 and 0.8 mg/ml BSA at 37°C in a thermomixer (Eppendorf) and 650 rpm. After incubation,
the beads were washed three times with 100 µl PBS/3 mM MgCl2. Bound Cy5-labeled
sequences were analyzed by flow cytometry counting approximately 20.000 events.
Unmodified sequences were analyzed via OliGreen (ThermoFisher) fluorescence. Therefore,
bound DNA sequences were recovered in 100 µl ddH 2O for 5 min at 95°C, cooled down to 4°C
and incubated in 200 µl TE buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid) with a 1:500 dilution of OliGreen. Fluorescence intensity was measured on a Tecan Ultra
plate reader (Tecan) at excitation and emission wavelengths of  = 500 nm and  = 525 nm,
respectively.
NGS
The starting library and all enriched libraries were analyzed by NGS using the Illumina
HiSeq1500 platform. Samples were prepared according to. 28 Briefly, 12 different index primers
were attached to the different libraries via PCR, allowing the analysis of 12 samples in parallel
on one lane. PCR products were purified using the NucleoSpin Clean-Up kit (Macherey Nagel),
and equal amounts of PCR product of each library were mixed to a final amount of 2 μg DNA.
For the hybridization to the flow cell a subsequent adapter ligation step was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit
LT, Illumina). Samples were purified by agarose gel purification. The NGS data was analyzed
using the inhouse AptaNext software and MEME suite. 16 Five families from cycle 12 were
identified and the most abundant sequences were tested in a FACS binding assay. Secondary
structures of the aptamers were predicted with Mfold.29
SPR
Binding affinities of the full-length sequences were assessed by surface plasmon resonance
on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare Europe). All buffers were filtered and degassed
prior to use. 50 nM of biotinylated aptamers SP5, SP6 and SP7 (flow cells 2-4) and the control
SP5sc (flow cell 1) were immobilized on XanTec SAD chips (XanTec Bioanalytics) with a flow
rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C in 0.5 M NaCl until values of ~200 response units were reached. The
CoV2-S protein (PBS/3 mM MgCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA) was injected at different concentrations
of 1, 3.2,10, 32, 100, 200, 316, 700 and 1000 nM for 180 s at 25 °C and 37°C. The dissociation

evaluated using the BIAevaluation 4.1 (Biacore) software: 1:1 binding with drifting baseline.
ELONA
33 ng/ml of the RBD-nanobody (kindly provided by P.-A. Albert and F.-I. Schmidt, Core Facility
Nanobodies, Medical Faculty, University of Bonn) was immobilized in 20 µl
bicarbonate/carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) on 96 halve-well microtiter plates (MICROLON® 600,
VWR) at 4°C overnight followed by two washing steps with 100 µl PBS with 0.05% Tween 20.
Wells were blocked with PBS including 5% BSA for 1 hour at RT, followed by two washing
steps with 100 µl PBS/3 mM MgCl 2. Afterwards the CoV2-S protein or the pseudovirus
(~15,000 particles) were added in PBS with 3 mM MgCl 2 and 0.8 mg/ml BSA and incubated in
a final volume of 20 µl at RT, followed by two washing steps with PBS/3 mM MgCl 2. Next,
biotinylated DNA aptamers [500 nM] and controls in PBS/3 mM MgCl2 and 0.8 mg/ml BSA
were added in a final volume of 20 µl at RT, followed by two washing steps with PBS/3 mM
MgCl2. Streptavidin-HRP (GE Healthcare) in a 1:1000 dilution in PBS/3 mM MgCl 2 was added
(20 µl) at RT, followed by two washing steps with PBS/3 mM MgCl 2. Finally, 100 µl ABTS
(ThermoFisher) were added per well, incubated at RT for 40 min and the absorbance at  =
405 nm was measured on a Tecan Nanoquant (Tecan).
Constructs and plasmids
Plasmids for SARS-CoV-2-Se, SARS-CoV-2-S-HexaPro and SARS-CoV-Se (kindly provided
by Jason McLellan, The University of Texas at Austin, USA) code for the prefusion-stabilized
ectodomains of the S proteins and carry on the C-terminus a trimerization motif, a HRV 3C
cleavage site, 8xHis and TwinStrep tags. 14 SARS-CoV-2-S(D614G)-∆19 codes for the S
protein (GenBank NC_045512) containing the D614G mutation and lacking the C-terminal 19
amino acids thus deleting the ER-retention motif and enhancing transport to the plasma
membrane. SARS-CoV-2-S(D614G)-∆19-HiBiT contains the HiBiT tag (Promega) at the very
C-terminus. SARSCoV-2-S-RBD codes for amino acids 319 - 591 of the S protein and contains
the signal peptide of the S protein on the N-terminus to allow secretion and an HRV 3C
cleavage site, 8xHis and TwinStrep tags on the C-terminus. Proteins denoted by ∆His or ∆ST
do not contain the respective tag but are otherwise identical to their tag-containing
counterparts. ACE2e contains, after cleavage of the signal peptide, amino acids 19 - 615 of
human ACE2 (UniProt Q9BYF1), an N-terminal myc tag and a C-terminal HRV 3C cleavage
site followed by an 8xHis tag. The myc and ACE2 coding sequence was amplified form pCEP4myc-ACE2 (addgene #141185).30 With the exception of SARS-CoV-2-S(D614G)-∆19-HiBiT
which was cloned into pmCherry-N1 (Takara) replacing mCherry all these proteins were cloned
into pCAG which is based on pCAGGS only lacking the SV40 ori of the latter. pET-Sumo-Nek7
contains the full-length human Nek7 (UniProt Q8TDX7) cloned into pET-Sumo (Thermo). All
constructs were assembled from PCR-amplified fragments using Q5 DNA Polymerase (NEB)
or synthetic genes (Eurofins) except for the pCAG backbone which was linearized by restriction
digestion. For assembly the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix was used (NEB).
Coding sequences of all constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins).
Protein expression and purification
With the exception of Nek7 which was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) proteins were expressed
in FreeStyle 293F cells (Thermo). 293F cells at 1x10 6 cells / ml in FreeStyle 293 Expression

liter of cells. 3 - 5 days after transfection proteins were purified from the culture medium after
removing cells and debris by centrifugation (10 min, 800 g, rt, followed by 30 min, 10000 g, 4
°C). The cleared medium was adjusted to 50 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.8 / 300 mM NaCl / 25
mM imidazole and loaded overnight onto a column containing 2 ml Protino Ni-NTA Agarose
(Macherey-Nagel) per liter of medium. After washing with 50 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.8 / 300
mM NaCl / 25 mM imidazole proteins were eluted in the same buffer containing 1 M imidazole.
Eluted proteins were concentrated using Vivaspin Turbo concentrators (Sartorius) and loaded
on a Superose 6 column (Cytiva) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.8 / 150 mM NaCl
to remove aggregated material. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Purification of proteins lacking the 8xHis tag was done by
replacing the Ni-NTA column by a StrepTactin column (IBA). Elution was achieved by 30 mM
desthiobiotin. To remove the 8xHis TwinStrep tags from SARSCoV-2-S-RBD and SARS-CoVSe the proteins were incubated overnight with HRV 3C protease (Thermo) and passed over a
Ni-NTA agarose column. The flow-through was concentrated and further purified by size
exclusion chromatography as above.
Pulldown assays
For aptamer pulldowns 1 µM 5´-biotinylated SP6 or SP6C, respectively, were incubated with
0.5 µM of the indicated proteins (without TwinStrep tag) for 30 min at rt in buffer PB (PBS / 4
mM MgCl2 / 2.5 µM BSA). For the RBD competition, 0.5 µM S protein together with 2.5 µM
RBD (without 8xHis and TwinStrep tags) were used. An aliquot was removed (input) and 100
µl pre-equilibrated Hydrophilic Streptavidin Magnetic Beads (NEB) were added. After 30 min
incubation at rt on an overhead rotator beads were collected on a magnet and an aliquot was
removed from the supernatant (unbound). After washing two times with 500 µl PBS / 3 mM
MgCl2 proteins were eluted by boiling in Lämmli sample buffer (eluate). For spike-ACE2
complex pulldowns 1 µM SARS-CoV2-S-HexaPro and ACE2 (without 8xHis tag) were
incubated in the presence of 3 µM SP6 or VHH E, as indicated, in buffer PB. An aliquot was
removed (input) and 20 µl pre-equilibrated HisPur Ni-NTA Magnetic Beads (Thermo) were
added. After 30 min incubation at rt on an overhead rotator beads were collected on a magnet
and an aliquot was removed from the supernatant (unbound). After washing two times with
250 µl buffer PW proteins were eluted with 25 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.8 / 150 mM NaCl / 1 M
imidazole (eluate). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained gels were
scanned on an Odyssey Sa (Licor).
Pseudovirus generation
VSV pseudotypes were generated as published. 31 Briefly, Hek293T cells transfected with
pCAG-SARS-CoV-2-S(D614G)-∆19 or pcDNA3.1-VSV-G, respectively, were inoculated with
VSV-∆G* (kindly provided by Gert Zimmer, Institute of Virology and Immunology,
Mittelhäusern, Switzerland). In VSV-∆G* the VSV-G open reading frame is replaced by an
expression cassette for GFP and firefly luciferase17 allowing infected cells to be detected by
GFP fluorescence or luciferase activity. After 1 h incubation at 37 °C the inoculum was
removed, the cells were washed with DMEM and cultivated for 16 - 18 h in DMEM / 2 % FBS
/ 30 mM Hepes at 34 °C. The culture medium containing the pseudotyped particles was
clarified from cellular debris by centrifugation (800 g, 5 min, rt). Aliquots were flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.

Vero E6 cells were cultivated in DMEM (Thermo) / 10 % FBS (PAN) at 37 °C and 8 % CO2.
The day before infection 5x10 4 cells were plated per well of a 24well plate. Virus particles
pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2-S(D614G)-∆19 or VSV-G were pre-incubated for 20 min at rt
with the indicated agent in DMEM / 3 mM MgCl 2. The culture medium was removed from the
cells and replaced by 150 µl pre-incubated virus (MOI ≈ 0.1). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C
0.5 ml DMEM / 10 % FBS / 3 mM MgCl2 was added and the cells were cultivated for 16 - 18 h.
Cells were detached with trypsin, fixed for 20 min at rt with 4 % formaldehyde, pelleted (800 g,
5 min, rt) and resuspended in PBS. Infection rate was determined as percentage of GFPpositive cells by flow cytometry (BectonDickinson). Data analysis was done with FlowJow
10.7.1 (BectonDickinson). Doublets were excluded (for gating see Supporting Fig. 4c). For
statistical analysis the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn´s multiple comparison
post-test was used because due to the small sample size of n=5 Gaussian distribution for the
values could not be tested. Analysis was performed with Prism 5.0f (GraphPad).
Binding
1x104 Vero E6 cells were plated per well of two 96well plates the day before. Virus particles
pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2-S(D614G)-∆19-HiBiT were pre-incubated for 20 min at rt with
the indicated agent in DMEM / 3 mM MgCl 2. The culture medium was removed from the cells,
replaced by 100 µl pre-incubated virus, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The
inoculum was completely removed and 50 µl of Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Reagent (Promega),
beforehand diluted with an equal volume of PBS, was added. After 15 min incubation at rt
luminescence was measured with an Infinite M1000 Pro (Tecan). Statistical analysis was done
as above, n=8, each with 3 technical replicates.
