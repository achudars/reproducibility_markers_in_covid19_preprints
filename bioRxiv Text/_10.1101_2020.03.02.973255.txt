Abstract:
The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global health risk and understanding the response of the host to
the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help to contrast the disease. Editing by host deaminases is an innate
restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against Coronaviruses.
Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from infected patients. We
identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from
ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of
genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals mutational patterns compatible
to those observed in the transcriptomic data. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs
are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.
For the casual Reader
Just to make a few things clear:
- RNA editing and DNA editing are PHYSIOLOGICAL processes. Organisms uses them to (a) try to
fight viruses, (b) increase heterogeneity inside cells (on many levels), (c) recognise their own RNA.
- our work suggests that: (a) cells use RNA editing in trying to deal with Coronaviruses. We don't know
to what extent they succeed (and it would be nice if we could help them). (b) Whatever happens,
mutations inserted by RNA editing fuel viral evolution. We don't know whether viruses actively exploit
this.
- If you (scientist or not) think our work suggests ANYTHING ELSE, contact us. It can be a first step
to help fight these !@#$ coronavirus, or towards a Nobel prize - but we need to discuss it thoroughly.
- If you think these cellular processes are fascinating, join the club and contact us. We can have a nice
cup of tea while chatting how wondrous nature is at coming up with extraordinary solutions...

Introduction
Emerging viral infections represent a threat to global health, and the recent outbreak of Novel
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2, Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) exemplifies the risks (1, 2). As viruses are obligate
intracellular parasites, organisms have evolved innate immune processes to sense and counter the viruses.
Among these, RNA and DNA editing mediated by endogenous deaminases can provide a potent
restriction against specific viruses. Two deaminase families are present in mammalian species: the
ADARs target double stranded RNA (dsRNA) for deamination of Adenines into Inosines (A-to-I) (3, 4),
and the APOBECs deaminate Cytosines into Uracils (C-to-U) on single-stranded nucleic acids (ssDNA
and ssRNA) (5, 6). During viral infections ADARs act either directly, through hypermutation of the viral
RNA, or indirectly, through editing of host transcripts that modulate the cellular response (7–18). On the
other hand, APOBECs target the viral genome, typically DNA intermediates (19–26), either through Cto-U hypermutation or through a non-enzymatic path that interferes with reverse transcription (27, 28).
Some APOBEC3 proteins can interfere in vitro with Coronaviridae replication, yet it is not clear whether
their enzymatic activity is involved (29). Eventually though, these restriction systems can also be
exploited by the viruses to support their infectivity and increase their evolutionary potential (9, 11–15,
30–32).

Results
To assess whether RNA editing could be involved in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infections, we started
from publicly available RNA sequencing datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) obtained
from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 . While transcriptomic data for all samples could be aligned to
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, the quality of the sequencing varied and only eight samples had
coverage and error rates suitable for the identification of potentially edited sites (Data S1). We called
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on these eight samples (33, 34) using REDItools 2 (35–37) and

JACUSA (38) using the following thresholds: reads supporting the SNV ≥4, allelic fraction ≥0.5%,
coverage ≥20, quality of the reads >25, base quality >35 (Fig. S1A). The two pipelines gave comparable
results with ~50% of the SNV positions called by both (Fig. S1B, Fig S2). We identified 910 SNVs
common to REDItools 2 and JACUSA, ranging from 24 to 238 SNVs per sample (Fig. 1, Data S3).
Given the thresholds used to call the SNV, samples with lower sequencing depths displayed lower
numbers of SNVs.
While the weight of each SNV type varies across samples (Fig. 1), a bias towards transitions is always
present, which is even more evident when all mutational data are pooled (Fig. 2A, B). This holds true
even when only SNVs recurring in more samples are considered (Fig. 2C).
SNV frequency and number of transversions are compatible with mutation rates observed in
Coronaviruses (10-6/-7, (39) and commonly associated to the RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp).
RdRp are error-prone and are considered the main source of mutations in RNA viruses. However, the
Coronavirus nsp14-ExoN gene provides a form of error correction (40), which is probably the reason
mutation rates in Coronaviruses are lower than those observed in RNA viruses with smaller genomes.
The mutational spectrum in SARS quasispecies presents a very weak bias towards U-to-G. Inactivation
of nsp14-ExoN error correction reveals the mutational spectrum of the RdRp, which is quite different
from the pattern we observe (i.e. main changes are C-to-A, followed by U-to-C, G-to-U, A-to-C and Uto-G) (41). As such we would consider that SNVs deriving from RdRp errors represent a marginal
fraction of the SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 samples.
The bias towards transitions -mainly A>G/T>C changes- resembles the pattern of SNVs observed in
human transcriptomes (42) or in viruses (8, 10, 18), where A>G changes derive from deamination of Ato-I mediated by the ADARs. It is thus likely that also in the case of SARS-CoV-2 these A>G/T>C
changes are due to the action of the ADARs.
C>T and G>A SNVs are the second main group of changes and could derive from APOBEC-mediated
C-to-U deamination. Contrary to A-to-I, C-to-U editing is a relatively rare phenomenon in the human

transcriptome (42) and, with regard to viruses, it has been associated only to positive-sense ssRNA
Rubella virus (32), where C>T changes represent the predominant SNV type. The observation that only
A-to-I editing is present in RNA viruses that infect non-vertebrate animals, where RNA-targeting
APOBECs are not present (10, 18), supports the hypothesis that APOBECs are involved in the RNA
editing of this human-targeting virus.
A third group of SNVs, A>T/T>A transversions, is also present. While this type of SNVs has been
described (43), its origin is yet unknown.
A>G and T>C changes are evenly represented for SNV frequency (Fig. 2A), for number of unique SNVs
(Fig. 2B, C), and for distribution on the viral genome (Fig. 2D). As ADARs target dsRNA, this suggests
that dsRNA encompasses the entire genome. While dsRNA in human transcripts are often driven by
inverted repeats, the most likely source of dsRNA in the viral transcripts is the replication, where both
positive and negative strands are present and can result in wide regions of double-stranded RNA.
Contrary to A-to-I changes, C-to-U changes are biased towards the positive-sense strand (Fig. 2B, C, D,
p < 0.0001). Since ADARs and APOBECs target selectively dsRNA and ssRNA, such distribution could
derive from the presence at all times of RNA in a dynamic equilibrium between double-strandedness when negative-sense RNA is being transcribed- and single-strandedness -when nascent RNA is released.
Some areas seem to bear less SNVs, but this might be related to lower sequencing depth in those regions.
As APOBEC deaminases preferentially target cytosines within specific sequence contexts, we analyzed
the nucleotide context of A-to-I and C-to-U SNVs in the viral genome (Fig. 3A, B). A slight depletion
of G bases in position -1 is present at A-to-I edited positions. The depletion is not as strong as the signal
previously reported in human transcripts (44–47). The low editing frequencies we observe resembles the
editing present on human transcripts containing Alu sequences, which were in a limited number in those
early datasets. Indeed, there is no evidence of a sequence context preference if we use a larger dataset
such as REDIportal (48), which includes >1.5 M sites in Alu repeats (Fig. S3).

On the other hand, C-to-U changes preferentially occur 3’ to thymines and adenines, a sequence context
that resembles the one observed for APOBEC1-mediated deamination ([AU]C[AU]) (49, 50).
We then aligned available genomes from SARS-CoV-2, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome-related
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to
test whether RNA editing could be responsible for some of the mutations acquired through evolution.
Indeed, the genomic alignments reveal that a substantial fraction of the mutations in all strains could
derive from enzymatic deaminations (Fig. 4A, B, C), with a prevalence of C-to-U mutations, and a
sequence context compatible with APOBEC-mediated editing exists also in the genomic C-to-U SNVs
(Fig. 4D, E, F).

Discussion
Considering the source of our analysis -metagenomic sequencing-, we wonder whether the low-level
editing we observe (~1%) reflects the levels of editing of the viral transcripts inside the cells. Indeed,
beside a small fraction of cellular transcripts edited at high-frequency, most ADAR-edited sites in the
human transcriptome (typically inside Alu sequences) present editing levels of ~1% (4, 42, 51). It has
been shown that a fraction of the cellular transcripts are hyperedited by ADARs (52–54). While we were
unable to observe hyperedited reads in the metagenomic samples, it is possible that hyperedited
transcripts fail to be packaged into the virus.
With regard to APOBEC-mediated RNA editing, its detection in the viral transcriptomes is already
indicative, as this type of editing is almost undetectable in human tissues (42). Such enrichment points
either towards an induction of the APOBECs triggered by the infection, or to specific targeting of the
APOBECs onto the viral transcripts. The APOBECs have been proved effective against many viral
species in experimental conditions, yet, until now their mutational activity in clinical settings has been
shown only in a handful of viral infections (19–26) through DNA editing- and in Rubella virus, on RNA
(32).

As in Rubella virus, we observe a bias in APOBEC editing towards the positive-sense strand. This bias
and the low editing frequencies might be indicative of the dynamics of the virus, from transcription to
selection of viable genomes. It is reasonable to assume that sites edited on the negative-sense strand will
result in a mid-level editing frequency, as not all negative-sense transcripts will be edited (Fig. 5A). On
the other hand, editing of the positive-sense strand can occur upon entry of the viral genome, thus yielding
high-frequency editing (Fig. 5B), or after viral genome replication, resulting in low-frequency editing
(Fig. 5C). Indeed, lack of a sizable fraction of highly edited C>T SNVs suggests that APOBEC editing
occurs late in the viral life-cycle (Fig. 5C). Yet, since they occur earlier, G>A SNVs should be closer in
number to C>T ones and with higher levels of editing, which is not what we observe (Fig. 2A, B, C).
The overrepresentation of C>T SNVs could be due to an imbalance towards positive-sense transcripts,
as these are continuously generated from the negative-sense ones (and double-stranded hybrid RNAs are
lost). However, the editing frequencies of G>A SNVs should be much higher as G>A SNVs are generated
upstream to the C>T ones. A more fitting explanation is that editing of the negative-sense transcripts
results in loss of the edited transcript (Fig. 5D), possibly because editing triggers nonsense mediated
decay (55), thus lowering the chances of the edited site to be transmitted.
Since most of the APOBECs are unable to target RNA, the only well characterized cytidine-targeting
deaminase is APOBEC1, mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, and APOBEC3A (56), whose
physiological role is not clear. As with A-to-I editing, it will be important to assess the true extent of
APOBEC RNA editing in infected cells.
The functional meaning of RNA editing in SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be understood: in other contexts,
editing of the viral genome determines its demise or fuels its evolution. For DNA viruses, the selection
is indirect, as genomes evolve to reduce potentially harmful editable sites (e.g. (18), but for RNA viruses
this pressure is even stronger, as RNA editing directly affects the genetic information and efficiently
edited sites disappear.

A comparison of the SNV datasets from the transcriptomic and from the genomic analyses reveals a
different weight of A-to-I and C-to-U changes (Fig. 2B, Fig. 4A), with an underrepresentation of A-to-I
in the viral genomes. As our analysis underestimates the amount of editing due to strict parameters used,
it could be possible that A-to-I SNVs are not fixed in the viral population when ADAR editing is such
that impairs the viral genome.
An analysis of the outcomes of the mutations is difficult due to the low numbers of events collected so
far, but there are some trends that might be suggestive (Data S2). C-to-U changes leading to Stop codons
are overrepresented in the transcriptomic data but -as expected- disappear in the genomic dataset. This
might point -again- to an antiviral role for these editing enzymes. There is also an underrepresentation of
C>T missense mutations, but its meaning is difficult to interpret.
Finally, this analysis is a first step in understanding the involvement of RNA editing in viral replication,
and it could lead to clinically relevant outcomes: (a) if these enzymes are relevant in the host response to
Coronavirus infection, a deletion polymorphism quite common in the Chinese population, encompassing
the end of APOBEC3A and most of APOBEC3B (57, 58) could play a role in the spread of the infection.
(b) Since RNA editing and selection act orthogonally in the evolution of the viruses, comparing genomic
sites that are edited with those that are mutated could lead to the selection of viral regions potentially
exploitable for therapeutic uses.

Materials and Methods
Sequencing Data
RNA sequencing data available from projects PRJNA601736, PRJNA603194 and PRJNA605907 were
downloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) using the FASTQ-dump utilities from the
SRA-toolkit with the command line:
prefetch -v SRR* && fastq-dump --outdir /path_dir/ | --split-files
/path_dir/SRR*.sra
Since most of the reads of samples from PRJNA605907 were missing their mate, forward-reads and
reverse-reads from these samples have been merged in a single FASTQ, which is treated as a single-end
experiment. Details of the sequencing runs are summarized in Data S1.
Data pre-processing
SRR11059940, SRR11059941, SRR11059942 and SRR11059945 showed a reduced quality of the
sequencing in the terminal part of the reads.
We used TRIMMOMATIC (59) to trim the reads of those samples to 100 bp, with the following
command line:
trimmomatic SE SRR*.fastq SRR*.trimmed.fastq CROP:100
We aligned the FASTQ files using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (60) using the official sequence of
SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512. 2) as reference genome. After the alignments BAM files were sorted them
using SAMtools (61).
Command line used for paired-end samples:
bwa mem NC_045512.2.fa SRR*_1.fastq SRR*_2.fastq | samtools sort –O
BAM -o SRR*_.bam
Command line used for single-end samples:

The aligned bams have been analysed with QUALIMAP (62). Due to a high error rate reported by
QUALIMAP, samples SRR11059943 and SRR10971381 have been removed from the analysis.
Single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling
A diagram of the entire pipeline is shown in Fig. S1A. We used RediTools 2 (35, 37) and JACUSA (38)
to call the SNVs using the command line:

SRR*.srt.bam
With regard to REDItools 2, we removed all SNVs within 15 nucleotides from the beginning or the end
of the reads to avoid artifacts due to misalignments.
To avoid potential artifacts due to strand bias, we used the AS_StrandOddsRatio parameter calculated
following

guidelines

((https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360040507111-AS-

StrandOddsRatio), and any mutation with a AS_StrandOddsRatio > 4 has been removed from the
dataset.
Bcftools (61) has been used to calculate total allelic depths on the forward and reverse strand (ADF,

number of supporting reads (at least 4 mutated reads), allelic fraction (0.5%), quality of the mapped reads
(> 25), and base quality (>35). In the dataset there were only 6 SNVs with allelic fractions in the range
30-85% (C>T, 1; T>C, 3; G>T, 2). Since there were no SNVs with higher allelic fractions, we presume
that all samples originated from the same viral strain.
Recurring SNVs have been defined as the SNVs present in at least two samples. In order to overcome
the problem of samples with lower sequencing depth, we used the positions of the SNVs common to both
REDItools 2 and JACUSA to call again the SNVs irrespectively of the number of supporting reads.
Data manipulation
R packages (Biostrings, rsamtools, ggseqlogo ggplot2, splitstackshape) and custom Perl scripts were
used to handle the data.
Sequence context analysis
Logo alignments were calculated using ggseqlogo, using either the pooled dataset of the dataset of
recurring SNVs. Logo alignments the human edited sites were performed using ADAR sites from
REDIportal (48) that were shared by at least 4 samples. SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS genomic data
were prepared for the Logi alignment using the GenomicRanges R package (63).
SNV calling in genomic data from SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS
The viral genomic sequences of MERS (taxid:1335626) and SARS (taxid:694009) were selected on
NCBI Virus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) using the query: Host : Homo Sapiens
(human), taxid:9606; -Nucleotide Sequence Type: Complete. They were aligned using the “Align”
utility. Consensus sequences of SARS and MERS genomes were built using the “cons” tool from the
EMBOSS suite (http://bioinfo.nhri.org.tw/gui/) with default settings.
SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) and aligned
with MUSCLE (64).
SNVs have been called with a custom R script, by comparing viral genome sequences to the respective
consensus sequence or, for SARS-CoV-2, to the NC_045512.2 reference sequence. SNVs, viral
