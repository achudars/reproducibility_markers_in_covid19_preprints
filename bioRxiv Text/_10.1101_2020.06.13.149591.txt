ABSTRACT
Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 regularly infect host tissues that express antiviral proteins
(AVPs) in abundance. Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune
responses is important in the effort to control the spread of COVID-19. Two AVPs that may
shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNAediting enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 protein (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG
dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter deaminates C into
U residues leading to dysfunctional transcripts. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3
and ZAP may act as primary selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting
coronavirus by considering a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven
coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, Bovine CoV, Murine MHV, Porcine HEV, and
Canine CoV). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have
CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas viruses that do not infect tissues with abundant
AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. In SARS-CoV-2, CpG is most deficient in the S
protein region to evaded ZAP-mediated antiviral defense during cell entry. Furthermore, over
four months of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history, we observed a marked increase in C to U
substitutions in the 5’ UTR and ORF1ab regions. This suggests that the two regions could be
under constant C to U deamination by APOBEC3. The evolutionary pressures exerted by host
immune systems onto viral genomes may motivate novel strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
development.

INTRODUCTION

35

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses a serious global health emergency.
Understanding how coronaviruses adapt or evade tissue-specific host immune responses is,
therefore, important in the effort to control the spread of COVID-19 and to facilitate vaccinedevelopment strategies. As obligate parasites, coronaviruses evolve in mammalian hosts and
carry genomic signatures shaped by their host-specific environments. At the tissue level,
mammalian species provide different cellular environments with varying levels of antiviral and
RNA modification activity. Two antiviral proteins (AVPs) that may contribute to the modification
of viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP, gene name ZC3HAV1 in mammals)
and the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3), both of
which exhibit tissue-specific expression (FAGERBERG et al. 2014).

ZAP is a key component in the mammalian interferon-mediated immune response that
specifically targets CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA genomes (MEAGHER et al. 2019) to inhibit viral
replication and signal for viral genome degradation (FICARELLI et al. 2020; GUO et al. 2007;
MEAGHER et al. 2019; TAKATA et al. 2017). This host immune response acts against not only
retroviruses such as HIV-1 (FICARELLI et al. 2020; ZHU et al. 2011), but also single-stranded RNA
viruses such as Ecovirus 7 (ODON et al. 2019), Zika virus (TRUS et al. 2020), and Influenza virus
(GREENBAUM et al. 2008). It follows that cytoplasmic ZAP activity should impose a strong
avoidance of CpG dinucleotides in RNA viruses that target host tissues abundant in ZAP. For
instance, while HIV-1 infects lymph organs where ZAP is abundant (FAGERBERG et al. 2014), its
genome is also strongly CpG-deficient. Notably, the viral fitness of HIV-1 has been shown to
diminish as its genomic CpG content increases within a sample of patients (THEYS et al. 2018).
Many other pathogenic single-stranded RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, also exhibit
strong CpG deficiency (ATKINSON et al. 2014; GREENBAUM et al. 2008; GREENBAUM et al. 2009;
TAKATA et al. 2017; YAP et al. 2003), but selection for CpG deficiency disappears in ZAP-deficient
cells (TAKATA et al. 2017).
The ZAP-mediated RNA degradation is cumulative (TAKATA et al. 2017). When CpG dinucleotides
are added to individual viral segment 1 or 2 in HIV-1, the inhibitory effect of ZAP is weak.
However, when the same CpG dinucleotides are added to both segments 1 and 2, the ZAP
inhibition effect is strong (TAKATA et al. 2017). This implies that only RNA sequences of sufficient
length would be targeted by ZAP. Thus, although SARS-CoV-2 has the lowest genomic CpG
contents found in Betacoronaviruses (XIA 2020), only ORF1aband spike (S) mRNAs are likely
targets by ZAP. It is therefore not surprising that these mRNAs, especially the S mRNA, exhibit
lower CpG than other shorter genes (DI GIOACCHINO et al. 2020; KIM et al. 2020).
Aside from ZAP, the APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase enzymes have garnered substantial attention
for their role in the antiviral immune response (CULLEN 2006; HARRIS and DUDLEY 2015). Through

a mechanism largely derived from HIV-1 studies, APOBEC3 enzymes have been prominently
reported to disrupt the structure and function of HIV-1 viruses by hypermutating minus strand
viral cDNA, causing defects in the viral transcript and inhibiting reverse transcription (CHIU and
GREENE 2008; HARRIS and DUDLEY 2015; HAYWARD et al. 2018; NABEL et al. 2013; RODRIGUEZ-FRIAS et
al. 2013). For instance, APOBEC3G (HARRIS et al. 2003; MANGEAT et al. 2003) and 3F (ZHENG et al.
2004) catalyzes C to U deamination at the HIV-1 minus-strand DNA during reverse transcription,
this triggers G to A hypermutation in the nascent retroviral DNA. HIV-1 avoids these deleterious
effects by expressing Vif, a protein which targets and degrades APOBEC3 enzymes (SHEEHY et al.
2002; WANG and WANG 2009). Despite these findings, the possibility that APOBEC3 paralogues
may act directly to edit ssRNA viruses has not been widely explored but the potential should
not be excluded, especially for viruses that do not encode a Vif analogue such as SARS-CoV-2.
Indeed, APOBEC3 is now known to modify a variety of RNA sequences. For instance, RNA
binding activity facilitates the packaging of APOBEC3 into virions (BOGERD and CULLEN 2008;
ZHANG et al. 2010). Furthermore, C to U RNA editing has been demonstrated in macrophages,
monocytes, and lymphocytes by both APOBEC3A and 3G (SHARMA et al. 2016; SHARMA et al.
2015; SHARMA et al. 2019). Additionally, APOBEC3C, 3F, and 3H may inhibit HCoV-NL63
coronavirus infection in humans, yet it remains unclear whether C to U RNA editing was
involved (MILEWSKA et al. 2018). More recently, studies have shown evidence that SARS-CoV-2
genomes are driven towards increasing U content and decreasing C content (DI GIORGIO et al.
2020; JIANG 2020; SIMMONDS 2020; VICTOROVICH et al. 2020). Resultantly, the possibility of C-U
editing by APOBEC3 at the RNA level could effectively disrupt the structure and protein function
of positive single-stranded RNA viruses.
We hypothesize that both APOBEC3 and ZAP act in concert as the primary selective pressure
driving the adaptation of an infecting coronavirus over the course of its evolutionary history in
specific host tissues. To test this hypothesis, we examined which antiviral proteins are effective
against coronaviruses and how the immune response is subverted. We predict that when a
virus regularly infects host tissues that are deficient in AVPs, there will be no strong directional
substitutions resulting in decreased CpG dinucleotides or elevated U residues, as these
evolutionary forces will be weak when ZAP and APOBEC3 are lowly expressed. Conversely,
when a virus regularly infects host tissues that are abundant in AVPs, these antiviral responses
will exert their influence on viral genomes. Consequently, viral genomes should tend towards
reduced CpG dinucleotides to elude ZAP-mediated cellular antiviral defense, and increased U
residues because of RNA editing by APOBEC3 proteins.
Our investigation considers a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven
coronaviruses (the Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, Bovine CoV, Murine MHV,
and Porcine HEV, and the Alphacoronavirus Canine CoV,) as well as studies with tissue-specific

ZAP and APOBEC3 gene expressions in five host species (human, cattle, dog, mice, and pig). We
found that all surveyed coronaviruses regularly infect tissues with high mRNA expressions of
both ZAP and APOBEC3, except Murine MHV. Expectedly, all surveyed coronaviruses, except
Murine MHV, have high global CpG deficiency, with SARS-CoV-2 genomes having the lowest
CpG content. More specifically, we observed a nonuniform distribution of CpG content across
12 SARS-CoV-2 viral regions and noted that CpG is most deficient in the region encoding the S
protein that mediates cell entry by ACE2 binding. Taken together, these observations suggest
SARS-CoV-2 has evolved in a tissue with high ZAP expression, and its persistence indicates that
it has successfully evaded the ZAP-mediated antiviral defense during cell entry.
In line with evidence of RNA-level C to U deamination by APOBEC3 enzymes (BISHOP et al. 2004;
SHARMA et al. 2016; SHARMA et al. 2015; SHARMA et al. 2019), Bovine CoV, Canine CoV, and
Porcine HEV all exhibit high global U content and low global C content whereas the genomes of
Murine MHV and the much more recent human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and
MERS) exhibit notably lower U content and higher C content. To elucidate the early stages of
SARS-CoV-2 genomic evolution, we analyzed the patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in local viral regions of complete genomes that were collected in the span of four
months (from December 31, 2019 to May 6, 2020) since SARS-CoV-2 was initially isolated. We
observed that the occurrence of C to U substitutions is strikingly more prevalent than any other
SNPs, especially in the 5’ UTR and ORF1ab regions. This suggests that the 5’ UTR and ORF1ab
regions are under constraint by these enzymes. Indeed, both APOBEC3 and ZAP exert selective
pressure on the RNA genome compositions of coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues
expressing the two antiviral genes in abundance, but they do not affect the RNA genomes of
viruses that avoid infecting tissues with high antiviral gene expression.

sequence region of APOBEC3 and ZC3HAV1 isoforms were extracted in FASTA format along with
their ENSEMBL Accession IDs.
To compare gene expressions of APOBEC3 and ZC3HAV1L among tissues, we retrieved publicly
available RNA Sequencing and Microarray studies that each sampled at least 10 mammalian
tissues. The five mammalian species that have extensive tissue-specific mRNA expressions are
Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Canis lupus familiaris, Mus musculus, and Sus scrofa. For Homo
sapiens, tissue-specific mRNA expressions were retrieved in averaged FPKM values from all 171
RNA-Seq datasets in BioProject PRJEB4337(FAGERBERG et al. 2014), 48 RNA-Seq datasets in
BioProject PRJEB2445, 20 RNA-Seq datasets in BioProject PRJNA280600 (DUFF et al. 2015), and
in median TPM values from all RNA-Seq datasets available in the GTEx Portal (LONSDALE et al.
2013). For Mus musculus, tissue-specific mRNA expressions were retrieved in averaged FPKM
values from all 741 RNA-Seq datasets in BioProject PRJNA66167 (mouse ENCODE consortium)
(YUE et al. 2014) and in average TPM values from all 79 RNA-Seq datasets in BioProject
PRJNA516470 (NAQVI et al. 2019). For Sus scrofa, tissue-specific mRNA expressions were
retrieved in averaged FPKM values from TISSUE 2.0 integrated datasets (PALASCA et al. 2018).
For Canis lupus familiaris, tissue-specific gene expressions were retrieved in averaged
fluorescence intensity units (FIU) from all 39 microarray datasets in BioProject PRJNA124245
(BRIGGS et al. 2011), and in averaged TPM values from all 75 RNA-Seq datasets in BioProject
PRJNA516470 (NAQVI et al. 2019). Lastly, for Bos taurus, tissue-specific mRNA expressions were
retrieved in averaged FPKM values from 42 RNA-Seq datasets in the Bovine Genome Database
(SHAMIMUZZAMAN et al. 2019).
Given that the data extracted were from multiple independent sources, thus not directly
comparable, the relative mRNA expression level designations (high or low) for APOBEC3 and
ZAP isoforms in a given tissue were derived from comparisons among AVP expressions in all
tissues in each independent source. Specifically, we calculated the proportion of mRNA
expression (PME) as:
𝑃𝑀𝐸 =

mRNA expression value in a specific tissue
summed mRNA expression values in all tissues

(1)

PME values were calculated from averaged TPM values in 24 human tissues using all RNA-Seq
datasets available in the GTEx Portal (LONSDALE et al. 2013), from averaged FPKM values in 26
cattle tissues using the Bovine Genome Database (SHAMIMUZZAMAN et al. 2019), from averaged
FPKM values in 33 pig tissues using TISSUE 2.0 integrated datasets (PALASCA et al. 2018), from
averaged FPKM values in 17 mice tissues using all 741 RNA-Seq datasets in mouse ENCODE
consortium (YUE et al. 2014), from averaged FPKM values in 12 mice tissues using 79 RNA-Seq
datasets in BioProject PRJNA516470 (NAQVI et al. 2019), and from averaged fluorescence
intensity units in 10 dog tissues using all 39 microarray datasets in BioProject PRJNA124245

(BRIGGS et al. 2011). Next, we calculated the averaged PME value by considering all tissuespecific PME values in each independent source. Finally, for each AVP, tissue-specific PMEs
were designated as high if they are greater than the averaged PME value and low if they are
less than the averaged PME. In addition, each column in Supplemental figures S1 and S2 with
column title designations “APOBEC3” or “ZC3HAV1” contains the tissue-specific AVP
expressions from an individual source, where darkest blue represents the tissue with the
highest mRNA expression and darkest red represents the lowest mRNA expression.
Retrieving and processing the genomes and regular habitats of coronaviruses infecting five
mammalian species
The genome, Accession ID, and Sample Collection Date of 28475 SARS-CoV-2 samples were
retrieved from the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB)
(https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/variation/statistics?lang=en, last accessed May 16, 2020), among
which 2666 strains were selected because they were annotated as having complete genome
sequences and high sequencing quality. Additionally, the complete genomic sequences of 403
MERS strains, 134 SARS-CoV strains, 20 Bovine CoV strains, 2 Canine CoV strains, 26 Murine
HEV strains, and 10 Porcine HEV strains were downloaded from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Nucleotide Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
We computed the nucleotide and di-nucleotide frequencies in each viral genome. Among
strains of the same coronavirus, some genomic sequences have long poly-A tails that are
missing in other sequences. Some also have a longer 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) than
others. To make a fair comparison between strains, the genomes were aligned with MAFFT
version 7 (KATOH and STANDLEY 2013), with the slow but accurate G-INS-1 option for 134 SARSCoV, 20 Bovine CoV, 2 Canine CoV, 26 Murine MHV, and 10 Porcine HEV strains, and with the
fast FFT-NS-2 option for large alignments for 2666 SARS-CoV-2 and 403 MERS strains. Next,
using the ‘Sequence Manipulation’ tool in DAMBE7 (XIA 2018), the 5’ UTR sequences were
trimmed away until the first fully conserved nucleotide position. Similarly, the 3’ UTR sequences
were trimmed out up to the last fully conserved nucleotide position. Then, gaps were removed
from each trimmed genome, and the global nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies as well as
their respective proportions (denoted as PNucleotide and PDinucleotide, respectively) were computed
in DAMBE under “Seq. Analysis|Nucelotide & di-nuc Frequency”. Additionally, nucleotide and
di-nucleotide frequencies were similarly computed for whole, untrimmed, genomes. Finally, the
conventional index of CpG deficiency (CARDON et al. 1994; KARLIN et al. 1997) was calculated as:
𝐼𝐶𝑝𝐺 =

𝑃𝐶𝐺
𝑃𝐶 𝑃𝐺

(2)

The index is expected to be 1 with no CpG deficiency or excess, smaller than 1 if CpG is deficient
and greater than 1 if CpG is in excess.

Next, among 2666 high sequence quality and complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from CNCB, we
randomly selected one genome from each collection date, inclusively between December 31,
2019 (first isolate) and May 6, 2020 (most recent isolate, database last accessed on May 16,
2020), that have complete records of local region annotations and nucleotide sequences in
NCBI. A total of 99 variants (or samples) were retrieved across 127 days since SARS-CoV-2
(strain Wuhan-Hu-1, MN908947) was first sequenced. For each of the 99 samples, the
nucleotide sequence of 12 out of 13 viral regions (5’ UTR, ORF1ab, S, ORF3, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a,
ORF8, N, ORF10, and 3’ UTR) were extracted from DAMBE in FASTA format, and local nucleotide
and dinucleotide frequencies and their proportions were computed for each region. ORF7b was
omitted from the analysis because it was not annotated in 30 out of 99 samples, including the
reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947). To determine the sequence mutation patterns
over time at each viral region, the nucleotide sequences from our 99 genomes were first
aligned with MAFFT with the slow but accurate G-INS-1 option; then each aligned sequence was
pair-wise assessed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using DAMBE’s “Seq.
Analysis|Nucleotide substitution pattern” with reference genome = Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947,
first sequenced) and Default genetic distance = F84.
Host tissues that are infected by SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS-CoV in human, Bovine CoV in
cattle, Canine CoV in dog, Murine HEV in mice, and Porcine HEV in pig were identified through
an exhaustive large-scale manual search on relevant evidence-based primary source studies.
The studies considered included clinical course, autopsy, and experimental infections, but
cross-host studies were excluded. In total, tissue infections were determined from 25 SARS-CoV
studies, 11 SARS-CoV-2 studies, 8 MERS studies, 15 Murine CoV (MHV) studies, 9 Porcine HEV
studies, 18 Canine CoV studies, and 10 Bovine CoV studies (Supplemental File S1). Resultantly,
the regular tissue habitats of viruses were determined based on the prevalence of virus
detection in host tissues across studies. For example, among studies on SARS-CoV-2, some
tissue infections (e.g., infections in the lung and intestine) are frequently recorded while others
are rarely recorded (e.g., stomach). To compare the relative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
infection, in the lung vs. in other tissues for instance, we calculated commonness of detection
(COD) as:

number of times lung infection is recorded

The tissue-specific mRNA expressions of 7 human APOBEC3 gene isoforms (A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D,
A3F, A3G, and A3H) and 2 human ZAP isoforms (ZC3HAV1 and ZC3HAV1L) were retrieved from
publicly available RNA-Seq datasets (see Materials and Methods) and averaged FPKM values
were compared within study. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows that all 3 human coronaviruses infect
the lung, heart, liver, kidney, and stomach; SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 additionally infect the
intestines; SARS-CoV and MERS additionally infect the skeletal muscle; but only SARS-CoV has
been reported to infect the lymph node and the spleen (Supplemental Fig. S1; references with
records of tissue infection are located in Supplemental File S1).
We determined which human tissues are commonly infected by coronaviruses and whether
these tissues express AVPs in abundance. Figure 1 shows the commonness of detection of
SARS-COV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS (CODs) (see Equation 3, Materials and Methods) in human
tissues and the relative proportions of mRNA expression (PME) of APOBEC3 and ZAP isoforms
(see Equation 1, Materials and Methods) in each tissue that is susceptible to infection.
Furthermore, in each susceptible tissue, the relative mRNA expressions of AVPs (in PME values)
were determined as high (in green) or low (in red) (see Materials and Methods). Out of the 6
tissues with records of infection, the lung and the intestine are regular habitats of SARS-CoV-2
with the highest CODs. Furthermore, both tissues contain high PMEs for some APOBEC3
isoforms (Fig. 1a: A3A, A3B, A3D, A3G, A3H in the lung, and A3B, A3D, A3G, and A3H in the
intestine) and for ZC3HAV1 (Fig. 1b). In the 4 tissues (liver, heart, kidney, and stomach ) where
infection is less frequently observed (less COD values), APOBEC3 and ZAP PMEs are also low
(Fig. 1a, 1b). Similarly, some regular habitats of SARS-CoV-2 (lung, kidney, intestine, spleen,
liver) and of MERS (lung, kidney, and liver) also host high PMEs for some APOBEC3 isoforms
(Fig. 1c) and for some ZAP isoforms(Fig. 1d). Hence, all 3 human coronaviruses can regularly
infect host tissues that express relatively high AVP expressions and display no strong preference
for tissues with AVP deficiency.
Similarly, we retrieved averaged mRNA expression levels of AVP isoforms in four other
mammalian species (cattle, dog, pig, mice) and reference records of tissue-specific infections of
their coronaviruses (Supplemental File S1, Supplemental Fig. S2). We determined the regular
habitats (by COD) for Porcine HEV in pig (Fig. 2a), Canine CoV in dog (Fig. 2b), Bovine CoV in

cattle (Fig. 2c), and Murine MHV in mice (Fig. 2d), as well as the relative mRNA expressions
(PMEs) for AVP isoforms in infected tissues. Like human coronaviruses, other mammalian
coronavirus can regularly infect tissues that exhibit both high APOBEC3 and ZAP mRNA
expressions, such as Porcine HEV infecting pig liver (Fig. 2a), Canine CoV infecting dog intestine
and lung (Fig. 2b), and Bovine CoV infecting cattle intestine (Fig. 2c). All three of these
coronaviruses do not avoid tissues with high AVP expressions, nor do they display a compelling
preference for tissues with low AVP expressions. Lastly, Murine MHV regularly infects mice
brain and liver but rarely infects the lung; however, mice brain and liver express low levels of
both APOBEC3 and ZAP PMEs, whereas the lung expresses high levels of both AVP PMEs (Fig.
2d). Hence, unlike the other coronaviruses, Murine MHV seems to avoid tissues with high AVP
expressions and prefers to infect tissues with low AVP expressions.
In principle, there are three possible classes of AVP expression a given tissue may conform to:
1) overall AVP abundance, 2) overall AVP deficiency, and 3) selective expression of AVPs. The
first two classes describe tissues for which both ZAP and APOBEC3 are expressed highly and
lowly, respectively. The third pattern can be divided into two subsets: one in which APOBEC3
enzymes are highly expressed and ZAP is lowly expressed, and the inverse to this pattern.
Figures 1 and 2 suggest that tissue-specific APOBEC3 and ZAP expressions may be correlated in
some species but not in others. Indeed, based on 24 human tissue, PME values of human
APOBEC3 and ZAP are significantly positively correlated (e.g., A3H vs ZC3HAV1: R2 = 0.43, P =
0.00035). Similarly, we found significant positive correlation between the two AVPs in PME
values based on 17 mice tissues (Apobec3 vs ZC3HAV1: R2 = 0.49, P = 0.0017) and based on 10
dog tissues (APOBEC3Z3 vs ZC3HAV1: R2 = 0.56, P = 0.021). However, there are no significant
correlation between the two AVPs in PME values based on 26 cattle tissues (APOBEC3H vs
ZC3HAV1: R2 = 0.22, P = 0.34) or based on 33 pig tissues (APOBEC3H vs ZC3HAV1: R2 = 0.11, P =
0.065).

Only coronaviruses targeting tissues with high AVP expressions exhibit decreased CpG and
increased U content
In the previous section, we demonstrated that many surveyed host-specific coronaviruses
commonly infect tissues that exhibit high levels of AVPs (Fig. 1, 2; supplemental Fig. S1, S2), but
MHV does not conform to this observation (Fig. 2d). Here we compared the CpG and U content
of these coronaviruses and found that viruses that regularly infect AVP-rich tissues tend to
exhibit diminished CpG content in tandem with elevated U content. Conversely, MHV neither
targets AVP-rich tissues, nor does its genome indicate directional mutation with respect to CpG
or U content. Both trimmed genomes (Fig. 3a, see Materials and Methods) and whole genomes
(Supplemental Fig. S3a) shows that MHV has the highest ICpG (about 0.6 or higher) while SARSCoV-2 has the lowest ICpG (below 0.43 in all but two genomes). As for all other coronaviruses
surveyed, they also exhibit low ICpG < 0.5 except for MERS being slightly higher. It should be
noted that among the 7 coronaviruses surveyed, ICpG values also show the greatest variation
among Murine MHV genomes whereas ICpG values are relatively much more constrained among
genomes of the other 6 (Supplemental Fig. S4a). Indeed, CpG content is weakly constrained in
Murine MHV.
Figure panels 3b, 3c, and 3d show that the proportion of U nucleotides (PU) decreases with the
proportion of C nucleotides (PC), but PU does not correlate with PA or PG. This global relationship
in the trimmed genomes may suggest a hallmark of C to U deamination in coronaviruses, that
single stranded RNA genomes could indeed be subjected to editing by APOBEC3 proteins.
Specifically, Bovine CoV, Canine CoV, and Porcine HEV all have very high PU and conversely very
low PC. In comparison, since Murine MHV does not infect host tissues with high APOBEC3
expression, it may have been subjected to less C to U deamination and therefore it has notably
reduced PU and increased PC. Additionally, similar to ICpG, PU is least constrained in Murine MHV
in comparison to any other coronavirus (Supplemental Fig. S4b). As for human coronaviruses,
figure 3b shows that PU is comparably low in SARS-CoV-2 and in MERS, like in Murine MHV, and
even lower in SARS-CoV. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the emergence of all three
human coronaviruses are much more recent in comparison to coronaviruses of other mammals;
their genomes had short evolutionary time to be shaped by host AVPs. Lastly, the same
patterns were observed when PU was re-analyzed using whole, untrimmed, genomes
(Supplemental Fig. S3).

Strong evidence of directional mutation shaped by AVPs in local SARS-CoV-2 viral regions

367

In the above results, we demonstrated that viral genomes show more pronounced shifts
towards CpG deficiency and elevated U content when the virus regularly infect host tissues with
high expression of the two AVPs. However, two limitations of figure 3 are 1) it does not show
the substitution patterns within local viral regions (such as the ORF1ab region), and 2) because
human viruses share similar or lower global PU in comparison to Murine MHV which
predominantly infects AVP-deficient tissues, we cannot suggest that APOBEC3 would shape
human coronavirus genomes over time. To resolve these limitations, we examined whether

there has been an evolutionary history of PU elevation in local SARS-CoV-2 regions over the span
of 4 months since the virus was first isolated.
To resolve the first limitation, figure 4 shows single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between
28475 aligned SARS-CoV-2 sequences (including complete and incomplete sequences)
(retrieved from https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/variation/statistics, last accessed May 16, 2020),
and the comparison was made against the first identified Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (MN908947).
Based on global sequence comparison, figure 4a shows that most SNPs are C->U substitutions.
More specifically, local mutation patterns (Fig. 4b) show that among 28475 sequence samples,
C->U substitutions are most prevalent at the 5’ UTR region and the ORF1ab region (normalized
by region length), but not at any other viral regions. To resolve the second limitation, figure 5
and supplemental figure S5 show the local mutation patterns over time in a sample of 99
complete and high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes with complete NCBI annotations. Each
retrieved sample had been collected on a different day, since first isolation (Wuhan-Hu-1,
MN908947, December 31, 2019) to the most recently isolated sample (mink/NED/NB04,
MT457401, May 6, 2020) (see Materials and Methods), and each sample was grouped into one
of six time ranges. Indeed, with reference to strain Wuhan-Hu-1, aligned sequences show an
excessive number of C->U substitutions, and that the total number of C->U substitutions
increases over time, but only at the 5’ UTR region (Fig. 5a) and ORF1ab region (Fig. 5b) and not
in other regions (Fig. 5c, 5d, Supplemental Fig. S5). It is noteworthy that in the S region,
directional mutation over time favours A->G substitutions; whereas in the ORF3a region,
directional mutation over time seems to favour G->U, but the number of G->U mutations have
decreased in the latest group of genome samples. Together, figures 4 and 5 suggest that
APOBEC3 may indeed edit single-stranded RNA genomes, specifically the 5’UTR and ORF1ab
regions in SARS-CoV-2. Whereas in the S region specifically, A->G directional mutation may be
the result of deamination by the mammalian adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 1
(ADAR1) enzyme (JIANG 2020; SAMUEL 2011; ZHAO et al. 2004).
Lastly, we compared differences in ICpG between viral regions over time among the 99 SARSCoV-2 samples. Figure 6 shows no difference in ICpG between sequences sampled at different
time (Since December 31, 2019 to May 6, 2020). This suggests that ICpG changes slowly over
time. However, there are notable differences in ICpG among specific viral regions. In particular,
ORF1ab, S, and ORF6 regions have the lowest ICpG values, whereas the 5’ UTR, E, and ORF10
regions have the highest ICpG values at above 1. The selective pressure for CpG deficiency to
evade ZAP is not uniform across different SARS-CoV-2 viral regions.

DISCUSSION

428

SARS-CoV-2 poses a serious global health emergency. Since its outset in Wuhan City, Hubei
province of China in December 2019, the viral outbreak has resulted in over 7 million confirmed
cases around the world (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,
last accessed June 11, 2020). The pandemic has prompted an immediate global effort to
sequence the genome of SARS-CoV-2, and over 28000 genome samples have been publicly
deposited over the course of just four months to facilitate vaccine development strategies.
With a wealth of sequence data, we performed a comprehensive comparative genome study on
SARS-CoV-2 and six other coronaviruses across five mammalian species, with the aim to
understand how coronaviruses evolve in response to tissue-specific host immune systems.

We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP immune responses act as primary
selective pressures to shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus over the course of its
evolutionary history within host tissues. Specifically, viral genomes are driven towards reduced
CpG dinucleotides to elude ZAP-mediated cellular antiviral defense, and increased U residues
because of RNA editing by APOBEC3 proteins. In line with our expectations, we found
compelling hallmarks of CpG deficiency and C to U deamination globally in mammalian
coronaviruses (i.e., Fig. 3: Bovine CoV, Canine CoV, and Porcine HEV) that regularly infect host
tissues expressing both AVPs in abundance (Fig. 2a, 2b, and 2c). Unsurprisingly, these global
trends were absent from Murine MHV genomes (Fig. 3) as this virus does not regularly infect
tissues that highly express AVPs (Fig. 2d). Corroborating this observation, both ICpG and PU
values show the greatest variation among Murine MHV genomes (Supplemental Fig. S4),
suggesting that MHV is not functionally constrained by either AVP. This aligns with our
prediction that for a virus regularly infecting host tissues that are deficient in AVPs, there will be
no strong directional mutations resulting in decreased CpG dinucleotides or elevated U
residues. Conversely, when a virus regularly infects host tissues that are abundant in ZAP and
APOBEC3, these AVPs shape the molecular evolution of viral genomes in two ways: CpG
deficiency contributes to the survival of the virus by evading ZAP-mediated antiviral defense
through CG dinucleotide recognition, and elevated U content as the result of genome editing by
APOBEC3.
In comparison to other mammalian coronaviruses, human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARSCOV, MERS) have been circulating in the human hosts for a much shorter time, particularly
SARS-CoV-2. Among the three, SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows extreme CpG deficiency (Fig. 3a); its
ICpG values are comparable to that of the Bat CoV RaTG13 coronavirus infecting the bat species
Rhinolophus affinis (XIA 2020) but lower than that of all other coronaviruses studied herein as
well as all other mammalian specific coronaviruses (XIA 2020). Indeed, many recently published
studies point to Bat CoV RaTG13 as the most closely related known relative of SARS-CoV-2
when the whole genome is considered (ANDERSEN et al. 2020; LAI et al. 2020; SHANG et al. 2020;

TANG et al. 2020), and to Rhinolophus affinis as a potential intermediate host or reservoir for
SARS-CoV-2 (LIU et al. 2020). Moreover, local comparative analyses on CpG content have two
implications. First, SARS-CoV-2 has acquired CpG deficiency in an intermediate reservoir prior to
zoonotic transmission to humans, as CpG deficiency may be acquired slowly since there is no
notable change in ICpG across all 12 viral regions in the span of four months since SARS-CoV-2
was initially isolated. In this context, it is regrettable that the Bat CoV RaTG13 was not
sequenced when it was initially sampled in 2013. The downshifting in ICpG in RaTG13 would have
served as a warning that the virus will likely infect tissues with high ZAP expression, because the
viral genome has successfully evolved to evade ZAP-mediated antiviral defense in humans.
Second, the evolutionary pressure for CpG deficiency may be region specific. The S, ORF1ab,
and ORF6 regions have the most severe CpG deficiencies (Fig. 6, ICpG < 0.4), whereas the 5’ UTR,
E, and ORF10 regions have the highest CpG content with no signs of CpG deficiency (Fig. 6, ICpG >
1). While evolution has allowed the Spike protein to elude ZAP because it is crucial for host cell
recognition and entry, structural genes such as the Envelope and Membrane protein are
subjected to less selective pressure to evade ZAP.
A current survey of SARS-CoV-2 genomes does not indicate drastically increased U and
decreased C contents. A global sequence comparison shows that SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV
and MERS) have comparable U and C contents as Murine MHV, but higher U and lower C
contents in comparison to Bovine CoV, Canine CoV, and Porcine HEV (Fig. 3b). This is because
while a coronavirus infecting a specific host tissue for a long time would experience the same
cellular antiviral environment and is consequently expected to have undergone significant RNA
editing; newly emerging coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 would not have enough time to
accumulate a high number of RNA modifications. Nevertheless, global nucleotide substitution
patterns (Fig. 4a) show that C to U substitution is still the most prevalent among SARS-CoV-2
genomes collected to date. This prevalence in genome wide C to U substitutions in SARS-CoV-2
has been similarly reported by DI GIORGIO et al. (2020), who also observed the same trends in
SARS-CoV and to a lesser degree in MERS.
More importantly, local sequence comparisons among SARS-CoV-2 samples indeed show that
there is an evolutionary history of PU elevation in specific SARS-CoV-2 viral regions over the
span of 4 months since the virus was first isolated. There is an excessive number of C to U
substitutions, and the prevalence of C to U mutations is increasing over time, specifically in the
5’ UTR and ORF1ab regions (Fig. 4b, 5a, 5b). This implies that these two specific viral regions are
under constant C to U deamination by the APOBEC3 gene family, at least in the short term so
far. Another noteworthy observation is that G to A substitution is preferred in the S region and
the numbers of G to A substitutions are increasing over time (Fig. 5c). The preference for this
mutation may be caused by deamination by the mammalian adenosine deaminase acting on
RNA type 1 (ADAR1) enzyme (DI GIORGIO et al. 2020; JIANG 2020), which edits A into I, and

subsequently into G. Although, ADAR1 was known for targeting double-stranded RNAs, not
single-stranded RNA sequences (EISENBERG and LEVANON 2018; O'CONNELL et al. 2015; SIMMONDS
2020; ZHAO et al. 2004). Regardless, these results suggest that RNA editing by host deaminase
systems may indeed act on coronaviruses.

523

While it is important to determine the evolution of coronavirus genomes to understand its host
adaptation and specificity, this study focuses more on the evolutionary pressure and RNA
editing process that host immune systems exert onto viral genomes. Our aim is to prompt
motivations for vaccine designs in the development of attenuated pathogenic RNA viruses.
Previous experimental works have shown that increasing CpG dinucleotides in CpG-deficient
viral genomes leads to drastic decrease in viral replication and virulence (ANTZIN-ANDUETZA et al.
2017; BURNS et al. 2009; FROS et al. 2017; TRUS et al. 2020; TULLOCH et al. 2014; WASSON et al.
2017), and in recent years several studies have proposed vaccine development strategies
involving increased CpG to attenuate pathogenic RNA viruses (BURNS et al. 2009; FICARELLI et al.
2020; TRUS et al. 2020; TULLOCH et al. 2014). Among coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has the most
extreme CpG deficiency (XIA 2020), particularly in the S protein coding region (Fig. 6). Increasing
CpG content at the S protein may provide a good starting point for strategies to inhibit SARSCoV-2’s ability to recognize and enter host cells. On the other hand, because C to U
deamination cannot be proof-read by viral exonuclease Nsp14-ExoN (ECKERLE et al. 2010; SMITH
et al. 2013; VICTOROVICH et al. 2020), host innate deaminases may drive up the rate of evolution
in viral genomes (DI GIORGIO et al. 2020) or modify CpG into UpG to further increase CpG
deficiency and reduce viral susceptibility by ZAP. The possibility of APOBEC3 editing activity
acting on RNA viruses and its potential exploits by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the long term
require further investigation and scrutiny.
