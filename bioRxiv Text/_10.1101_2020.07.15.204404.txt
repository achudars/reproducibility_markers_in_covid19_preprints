ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 infections pose a global threat to human health and an unprecedented
research challenge. Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of
the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense
mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation
and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the host cell proteome in direct contact
with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass
spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human
proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover
known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and
host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARSCoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome
dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of
SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of
proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the
functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein
RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2
RNA interactome provides an unprecedented molecular perspective on SARS-CoV-2
infections and enables the systematic dissection of host dependency factors and host
defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic strategies.

INTRODUCTION
At the end of 2019, the rapid spread of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) around the globe has led to a worldwide spike in a SARS-like
respiratory illness termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. Due to the absence of
effective antiviral therapy, COVID-19 has taken hundreds of thousands of lives to date and
resulted in unprecedented socioeconomic disruptions.
A prerequisite for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infections and enabling novel
therapeutic strategies is obtaining a detailed map of the molecular events and perturbations
occurring as SARS-CoV-2 infects human host cells. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positivesense, single-stranded RNA virus that, upon infection of a host cell, deploys a ‘translationready’ RNA molecule, which engages the protein synthesis machinery of the host in order to
express a limited number of viral proteins critical for its replication2. Thus, similar to other
RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is inherently dependent on recruiting host cell factors and
machinery, including regulators of RNA stability, localization, and translation, to facilitate
virus replication and the production of viral progeny. For the host cell, on the other hand, it is
crucial to detect the presence of a viral pathogen and activate appropriate innate immune
response pathways3,4. To understand this interplay between virus and host, it is essential to
characterize with molecular detail which host proteins make direct contact with viral RNA and
may function as host dependency factors or antiviral regulators. To date, studies on SARSCoV-2 infected human cells have primarily focused on characterizing expression or
modification changes in the host cell transcriptome5–7 or proteome8–10. While several studies
described protein-protein interactions of recombinantly expressed viral proteins in uninfected
cells10,11, no study has comprehensively identified direct interactions between viral RNA and
the host cell proteome in infected human cells.
To improve our understanding of the host factors that contribute to the regulation of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA during infection, we sought to obtain an unbiased picture of the cellular
proteins that directly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. Recent advances
in RNA capture and quantitative mass spectrometry approaches12–14 have made this
endeavor highly tractable. Among the available technologies, we focused on those that use
ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking to create covalent bonds between RNA and directly bound
proteins, as opposed to chemical crosslinkers that also stabilize indirect interactions15.
Further, we wanted to ensure that the identified proteins bind directly to the SARS-CoV-2
RNA, excluding approaches that assess differential interactions across all cellular RNAs in
response to infection. To satisfy these requirements, we selected RNA antisense purification
and quantitative mass spectrometry (RAP-MS)12,13, which implements a denaturing
purification procedure to capture and identify proteins that crosslink directly to the SARSCoV-2 RNA.

Using RAP-MS, we globally identify host cell proteins that directly bind to the SARSCoV-2 RNA in infected human cells and integrate these binding events with proteome
abundance changes induced by viral infection. Our work highlights the molecular interactions
that underlie both virus replication and host defense mechanisms and further establishes that
therapeutic inhibition of direct RNA binders can modulate SARS-CoV-2 replication.

RESULTS
Capturing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and its protein binding partners in human cells
To purify the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the complement of directly crosslinked cellular proteins
from virally infected human cells, we designed a pool of biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides
antisense to the positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA, such that one probe binding site occurs
roughly every 400 bases in the ∼30 kb SARS-CoV-2 genome. As a cellular system, we
selected the human HuH-7 cell line. In addition to being permissive to both SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 replication16,17, the cellular proteins bound to all polyadenylated RNAs (poly(A)RNA) have been identified in these cells18. Further, a previous study employed chemical
crosslinking and RNA antisense purification in a HuH-7-derived cell line to identify proteins
that directly or indirectly associate with the genomic RNAs of Dengue and Zika viruses19, two
unrelated positive-sense RNA viruses.
To test if our pool of antisense capture probes was suitable for the purification of the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from infected HuH-7 cells, we performed RAP-MS 24 hours after infection.
Expanding upon the established RAP-MS procedure13, we implemented a covalent protein
capture step following the release of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins, which allowed us to
identify the RNA sequences crosslinked to purified proteins (Figure 1a, see Methods). While
this approach yielded near-complete sequence coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in
RNA antisense purifications, most of the signal was observed near probe binding sites
(Supplementary Figure 1a). Importantly, sequencing reads originating from SARS-CoV-2
RNA made up 93% and 92% of all mapped reads in two replicate experiments
(Supplementary Figure 1b).
To identify proteins that specifically interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, we compared the
protein content of SARS-CoV-2 purifications to that of an unrelated control ribonucleoprotein
complex of known composition. As the control, we selected the human RNA Component of
Mitochondrial RNA Processing Endoribonuclease (RMRP) RNA and purified both SARSCoV-2 and RMRP from HuH-7 cells 24 hours after infection. Covalent capture of purified
proteins and sequencing of crosslinked RNA fragments confirmed that on average 90% of all
mapped sequence reads originated from the SARS-CoV-2 genome in SARS-CoV-2
purifications (Supplementary Figure 1c). In RMRP purifications, on the other hand, more than
99% of crosslinked RNA fragments mapped to the human genome (Supplementary Figure

1c). We next analyzed the proteins purified in RAP-MS experiments by Western blot and
detected the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N) only in SARS-CoV-2 purified samples
(Supplementary Figure 1d). In contrast, the human RMRP component POP1 was discovered
only in RMRP purifications (Supplementary Figure 1d). Together, these experiments
demonstrate the specificity of the RAP approach for capturing the desired RNAs and their
known direct protein binding partners.

An unbiased atlas of direct SARS-CoV-2 RNA-protein interactions in human cells
Encouraged by the above results, we subjected proteins purified with both RMRP and SARSCoV-2 RNAs to tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and relative quantification by liquid
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In two biological
replicate experiments, we identified 699 proteins, of which 583 were detected with two or
more unique peptides (Supplementary Table 1). As shown in Figure 1b, we found five known
RMRP components among the 10 most significantly enriched proteins in RMRP purifications
(Supplementary Table 1). This is consistent with our previous results13, noting overall
reduced RMRP expression levels in HuH-7 cells20.
Next, we quantified proteins enriched in SARS-CoV-2 purifications relative to RMRP
purifications and found a total of 15 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, six of which were among the 20
most significantly enriched proteins (Figure 1b, c; Supplementary Table 1). In addition to five
viral proteins translated from distinct open reading frames (ORFs), 10 of the 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which are derived from a precursor polyprotein21, were detected
in RAP-MS experiments.
As expected, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, which is thought to occupy the majority of
the viral RNA, was one of the two most strongly enriched viral proteins, followed by several
known viral RNA-binders, such as the endoribonuclease NSP1522, the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP) NSP1223, the methyltransferase NSP1624, the single-stranded RNAbinding protein NSP925, the capping factor NSP1024, the primase NSP823, and the
multifunctional protein NSP326. In addition to NSPs, we also found ORF3A, which binds the
5’-end of the SARS-CoV-1 genomic RNA27, as well as the Spike protein (S), and the
Membrane protein (M) among strongly enriched proteins.
While the M protein is known to interact with the RNA-binding protein N, a model for
packaging of the coronavirus genomic RNA further suggests a possible direct RNA-binding
function for M28. An RNA-binding activity of the S protein was not previously reported. While
S covers the surface of the viral envelope, it has a transmembrane domain and an
intracellular tail,29 making it conceivable that S may indeed contact viral RNA. Similarly,
NSP3 and NSP6 are thought to be necessary for the formation of cytoplasmic double-

membrane vesicles30, which contribute to viral replication or virion assembly and may contact
RNA as part of these functions.
Finally, we also detected a protein corresponding to a newly annotated out-of-frame
internal ORF (iORF) within the ORF of the N protein (N.iORF1)31. N.iORF1 shares 72% of its
amino acids with ORF9b of SARS-CoV-1, making it likely that both proteins are homologous.
N.iORF1 was moderately enriched in SARS-CoV-2 purifications (Figure 1b, c), suggesting
that it may interact with viral RNA, which raises the possibility that at least two different RNAbinding proteins are translated from overlapping ORFs within the sequence of the viral N
gene.

Discovery of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2-bound human proteins
We next focused on the human proteins enriched in SARS-CoV-2 purifications. In total, we
identified 276 proteins with a positive log2 fold-change in SARS-CoV-2 purified samples,
relative to RMRP purified samples (Supplementary Table 1). Of these, 57 proteins were
enriched with high statistical significance (P < 0.05, two-tailed moderated t-test), which we
subsequently defined as the set of core SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins (Figure 1c).
Additionally, we also defined an expanded SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome using a relaxed
false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 20% (Figure 1c).
The expanded SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome encompasses 104 human proteins and
includes 13 SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins. The vast majority of the human RNA
interactome proteins (96 proteins, 92%) have previously been identified in high-throughput
studies aimed at capturing proteins that crosslink to RNA32 (Supplementary Table 2).
Comparing this expanded SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with the experimentally determined
poly(A)-RNA interactome in HuH-7 cells18, revealed high overlap between both datasets (69
proteins, 66%) (Figure 2a; Supplementary Table 2). Next, we compared our direct SARSCoV-2 RNA interactome with the group of proteins found to directly or indirectly associate
with the RNA genomes of Dengue and Zika viruses19. Sixty-six proteins (63%) of the
expanded SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome were also found to associate with the Dengue and
Zika virus RNAs, while 35 proteins (34%) were unique SARS-CoV-2 binders (Figure 2a).
Since coronaviruses are known to form replication/transcription complexes (RTCs), we also
compared the expanded SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome to the protein content of murine
coronavirus RTCs33 and found 64 shared proteins (Supplementary Table 2).
Finally, a recent study identified protein-protein interactors of recombinant SARSCoV-2 proteins expressed in uninfected human cells11. Only 10 of the 334 human proteins
that were found to interact with viral proteins in uninfected cells, also bound directly to viral
RNA in infected cells (Supplementary Table 2). Beyond the well-documented impact of viral
infection on host cell gene expression5–7, which may lead to remodeling of observed

interactions, these results further highlight the importance of discriminating between proteinprotein and RNA-protein interactions when dissecting the biology of SARS-CoV-2.
While our SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome captured RNA-protein interactions not
found in other RNA viruses or uninfected cells, many identified proteins were shared among
these datasets, confirming the validity of our experimental approach. Further, the RNAprotein interactions only observed in SARS-CoV-2 RAP-MS experiments, may point towards
unique aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology.

Biological functions of human SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins
To gain insights into the biological functions of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins, we performed a
hypergeometric gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis34 on the expanded SARS-CoV-2
RNA interactome (see Methods). We observed strong enrichment for GO-terms linked to
translational initiation (GO:0006413), nonsense-mediated decay (GO:0000184), SRPdependent co-translational protein targeting to the membrane (GO:000661), and viral
transcription (GO:0019083) (Figure 2b; Supplementary Table 3). Consistent with the
enrichment of these GO-terms, the importance of mRNA translation at the endoplasmatic
reticulum (ER) membrane is well-established for the replicative cycle of coronaviruses35,36.
Further, nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) was recently described as an intrinsic
antiviral mechanism targeting coronavirus RNAs37.
In agreement with the crucial role of mRNA translation and its regulation, the
expanded SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome included 19 ribosomal proteins and 12 translation
factors. Among translation factors, EIF4G1, which together with EIF4A and EIF4E, makes up
the EIF4F complex, and EIF4B have been reported as targets of mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling38–40. EIF4B plays a critical role in recruiting the 40S ribosomal
subunit to mRNA, and both the PI3K/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathways target EIF4B to control its phosphorylation status and activity40. PI3K/mTOR
inhibition has further been demonstrated to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in human
cells8,10.
In order to systematically examine the connectivity of the identified SARS-CoV-2
binding proteins and their potential relationship to virus-associated biological processes, we
constructed a protein-protein association network of SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins
(Figure 2c; Supplementary Table 4; see Methods). Consistent with the crucial role of mRNA
translation, ribosomal proteins and translation factors are prominently represented in this
interaction network, along with previously published virus-associated RNA-binding proteins
(Figure 2c) and proteins linked to the host response to viruses (Figure 2d).
We next integrated known drug-target interactions within this network and identified
23 SARS-CoV-2-bound human proteins that can be targeted with existing compounds,

including PPIA, ANXA1, CFL1, and EGFR (Figure 2e). Notably, the core SARS-CoV-2 RNA
interactome member ANXA1 plays an essential role as an effector of glucocorticoid-mediated
regulation of the innate immune response. ANXA1 is a known target of dexamethasone,
which according to newly emerging clinical trial data appears to show efficacy as a treatment
for COVID-1941.

The SARS-CoV-2 regulated proteome uncovers activated host response pathways
To complement our RNA-protein interactome and gain deeper insights into host response
pathways activated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, we globally measured protein abundance
changes in infected cells. To this end, we performed triplicate MS experiments on SARSCoV-2 infected and uninfected HuH-7 cells and identified 10,956 proteins with more than 2
unique peptides (Figure 3a; Supplementary Table 5). Among the detected proteins, 4,578
proteins were regulated (P < 0.05, moderated two-sample t-test) following 24 hours of SARSCoV-2 infection, which is consistent with wide-spread proteome regulation upon SARS-CoV2 infection8. As expected, proteome samples clustered according to their infection status in a
principal component analysis (Supplementary Figure 2a). Among differentially expressed
proteins, we detected 13 viral proteins (S, N, NSP3, N.iORF1, NSP2, NSP4, ORF3A, NSP1,
ORF7A, M, ORF8, NSP8, and NSP10) and 56 proteins from our expanded SARS-CoV-2
RNA interactome (Figure 3a; Supplementary Table 5).
To identify cellular pathways modulated upon infection, we performed gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) using our proteome abundance measurements (see Methods).
Among the most significantly enriched hallmark gene sets were “TGFβ signaling” (adj. p =
0.0048), “TNFα signaling via NFκB” (adj. p = 0.0018), “Interferon (IFN)- γ response” (adj. p =
0.0048), “IL-6 JAK STAT3 signaling” (adj. p = 0.0054), and “IFN-α response” (adj. p = 0.0077;
Figure 3b), suggesting a broad pro-inflammatory and antiviral response in infected cells.
Further, we observed significant enrichment of the gene sets “GO Regulation of MAPK
cascade” (adj. p = 0.00033), “GO Positive regulation of MAP Kinase activity” (adj. p = 0.011),
and “GO Response to type I Interferon” (adj. p = 0.045; Supplementary Table 6). Newly
emerging evidence indicates that these pathways are indeed highly relevant in the context of
SARS-CoV-2 infections5,7–10,42. Notably, inhibition of growth factor signaling through the
MAPK pathway, which responds to and controls the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
including TNFα and IL-6, was recently shown to modulate SARS-CoV-2 replication in
infected cells8–10.
In agreement with recent transcriptome studies5–7, our proteome data suggest
activation of interferon signaling upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among interferon-related
genes, we observed significant upregulation of several major components of IFN signaling
pathways, including STAT1 and IRF9, which together with STAT2 make up the ISGF3

complex, their upstream components TYK2 and JAK1, as well as their downstream targets
IFIT1, IFIT3, IFITM3, OAS2, and ISG15 (Figure 3a). Other strongly upregulated IFN-related
genes include BST2, SP110, UBE2L6, ADAR, TGIF1, BRD3, and IFI30 (Supplementary
Table 5). Notably, many SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome members are directly or indirectly
linked to the IFN response. These include PUM143,44, YBX144,45, SYNCRIP46, G3BP147–50,
G3BP247,48, EIF4B51, MOV1052–54, CAPRIN148, DDX3X55–58, LSM14A59,60, RYDEN61,62,
STRAP63, ANXA164,65, DDX166–68, PCBP269,70, HNRNPA2B171, and YWHAZ72. In conclusion,
our global protein abundance measurements verify the induction of an appropriate host
response in SARS-CoV-2 infected HuH-7 cells and further support an essential role for IFN
and MAPK signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Connectivity map of SARS-CoV-2 RNA binders and regulated host cell proteins
highlights regulators of emerging SARS-CoV-2 biology
To examine the connectivity between SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome proteins and proteins
that are differentially regulated in host cells upon viral infection, we used curated proteinprotein interaction data to build a network that visualizes interactions between SARS-CoV-2
RNA binders and regulated host proteins (Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure 2c;
Supplementary Table 7; see Methods). In addition to a cluster of ribosomal proteins and
translation factors, we observed many connections between canonical RNA-binding proteins
linked to viral infections (including MOV10, YBX1, HNRNPA1, PUM1, DDX3X, HDLBP,
SND1, and CFL1)73 and regulated host factors in this network. Notably, we also observed
non-classical RNA-binding proteins such as ANXA1 or ACTR2 among highly-connected
proteins in this network. ACTR2 has been identified as a host factor for respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) infection and is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and filipodia formation,
which is thought to promote virus spreading74,75. This observation is consistent with recent
work that demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a dramatic increase in filopodia,
and viral particles localized to and emerged from these protrusions9.
Taken together, this network analysis suggests extensive connectivity between
SARS-CoV-2-binders and dynamically regulated host cell proteins, which connect
interactome proteins to emerging SARS-CoV-2 biology and may provide a map for identifying
regulatory hubs in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

The transcriptional regulator CNBP directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA
We next focused our analysis on SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome members that were strongly
upregulated in our proteome dataset following viral infection. Among the 104 proteins in the
expanded SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome, 22 human proteins were significantly induced
upon infection. In this group, PPIA, RAB6D, MSI2, SCFD1, and CNBP were the most

9

strongly upregulated candidates (log2 fold-change > 2.5) and all of these proteins also
showed robust enrichment in RAP-MS experiments (log2 fold-change > 1, P <0.1). Notably,
PPIA was previously shown to be essential for SARS-CoV-1 replication76,77, suggesting that
the group of virally induced human SARS-CoV-2 interactors may constitute important
candidates for a functional investigation.
To further dissect these candidates and validate our RAP-MS results, we first focused
on CNBP, which represents the most significantly enriched protein in SARS-CoV-2
purifications and was also induced upon infection. CNBP translocates to the nucleus upon
immune stimulation and associates with an immune stimulatory DNA oligonucleotide,
suggesting that it may be involved in foreign nucleic acid-sensing pathways78. Two recent
studies showed that CNBP activates the innate immune response and induces the
expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including Il-6 and Cxcl10 in vivo78,79. While
our proteomics experiments did not yield peptides for these two CNBP-regulated cytokines,
recent transcriptome studies demonstrated that IL-6 and CXCL10 were indeed induced in
SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells5–7. In light of these results, we speculated that in addition
to its previously described role in foreign DNA sensing, CNBP might recognize the SARSCoV-2 RNA through direct binding, which may be linked to its role in transcriptionally
activating specific innate immune genes.
To corroborate the physical engagement of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA by CNBP in
infected human cells, we combined RNA antisense purification (RAP) with enhanced
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP)80. Briefly, following the purification of SARSCoV-2-bound proteins from infected HuH-7 cells using RAP, we incubated eluted proteins
with an antibody recognizing CNBP, or an IgG antibody as

negative control.

Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were subjected to denaturing purification using SDS-PAGE, and
size-matched RNA populations were extracted from CNBP and IgG samples and converted
into cDNA libraries. As shown in Figure 4a, we observed strong binding of CNBP to the viral
RNA genome, while only minimal signal was observed in size-matched IgG libraries,
suggesting specific binding of CNBP to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These data provide strong
evidence for a direct interaction between CNBP and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected
human cells and validate that RAP-MS indeed recovers direct SARS-CoV-2 binders.

RYDEN suppresses ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the SARS-CoV-2
RNA
Following CNBP, the second most significantly enriched human protein in our SARS-CoV-2
RNA interactome was LARP4, a known regulator of mRNA stability and translation81. LARP4
and LARP1 interact with PABPC181, and both LARP1 and PABPC1 have been proposed to
reside in the same ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with RYDEN61, all of which were

enriched in RAP-MS experiments. RYDEN, in particular, attracted our attention. Similar to
CNBP, RYDEN was among the most significantly enriched proteins in SARS-CoV-2
purifications and was also significantly upregulated upon infection. In addition to being an
IFN-induced gene, RYDEN was previously shown to suppress virus production in dengue
virus (DENV) infected cells61, and has further been demonstrated to inhibit programmed –1
ribosomal frameshifting (−1FS) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections62. To
execute this function, RYDEN requires the eukaryotic peptide chain release factor GSPT162,
which was detected in our expanded RNA interactome as well (Figure 1b, c).
To dissect if RYDEN can modulate the frequency of −1FS in SARS-CoV-2, we
generated a dual-color fluorescence reporter system that allowed us to quantify frameshifting
efficiency in the presence or absence of RYDEN. In brief, cells transfected with this reporter
express a single fluorescent protein (EGFP) when the 0 reading frame is translated
(Supplementary Figure 3a). Expression of a second fluorescent protein (mCherry)
downstream of EGFP is dependent on −1FS, which prevents translation of an in-frame stop
codon. Thus, the ratio between mCherry and EGFP directly correlates to −1FS efficiency. As
a normalization control, we used a construct lacking a stop codon in the 0 reading frame,
leading to the expression of EGFP and mCherry in equal ratios (Supplementary Figure 3a).
Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting is very efficient, reaching 33% in
human HEK293 cells. Using a reporter containing the HIV frameshift element (FSE) as a
positive control, we first confirmed that overexpression of a RYDEN-ECFP fusion protein
suppressed −1FS when compared to ECFP expression alone (Figure 4b). Strikingly,
overexpression of RYDEN also led to a significant reduction of ribosomal frameshifting
efficiency, when a reporter containing the SARS-CoV-2 FSE was used (Figure 4b). Together,
these results show that RYDEN (i) is induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) associates
with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected cells, and (ii) inhibits programmed ribosome
frameshifting of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE.

Inhibiting components of the human SARS-CoV-2 RNA-protein interactome modulates
viral replication
Finally, we set out to test if targeting components of our SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome and
its associated pathways with known inhibitors proved effective in manipulating intracellular
viral replication. To this end, we treated HuH-7 cells with the PPIA inhibitor Cyclosporin A
(CsA) and observed a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of intracellular viral RNA
(Figure 4c). The treatment with CsA had no apparent effect on cell viability (Supplementary
Figure 3b). PPIA is involved in the folding of proteins and has a well-documented impact on
different viruses82. Yet, its direct interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome has not

been demonstrated and expands these previously described functions. Notably, PPIA
represents the most strongly induced interactome member in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.
Given the enrichment of various proteins linked to the IFN response in our SARSCoV-2 RNA interactome, we speculated that inhibiting a central regulator of antiviral RNA
sensing might make HuH-7 cells more permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication. We noticed
that several SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins engage in well-documented physical
interactions with TANK-binding kinase (TBK1). Of particular note, DDX3X is a TBK1
substrate and direct binding partner that synergizes with TBK1 in regulating IFN production57.
Similarly, ANXA1 regulates type I IFN signaling through its physical association with TBK165,
while STRAP interacts with TBK1 and IRF3 to promote IFN-β production63. Indeed, treatment
of HuH-7 cells with the TBK1 inhibitor BX-795 increased intracellular virus replication by a
factor of several hundred-fold, suggesting a diminished host-response. Inhibitor treatment
only had a small effect on cell viability at the tested concentrations (Supplementary Figure
3b). These results demonstrate that proteins and pathways linked to the direct SARS-CoV-2
RNA interactome identified in this work, represent viable targets for inhibiting coronavirus
replication or modulating the host cell response to viral infections. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA
interactome provides valuable starting points for mechanistic studies of viral infection and
may further be explored for evaluating treatment options for COVID-19.

DISCUSSION
Decoding the RNA-protein interactomes of pathogenic RNA viruses has been a longstanding challenge. In the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the task of addressing
this challenge has gained considerable attention and urgency. In this study, we provide
detailed molecular insights into the identity of host factors and machinery that directly engage
the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during infection of human cells. Using RAP-MS, we have obtained an
unbiased and quantitative picture of direct contacts between the host cell proteome and viral
RNA. Combining this global RNA-protein interaction atlas with proteome-wide measurements
of protein abundance changes that occur upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowed us to chart
the RNA-protein interaction landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells, and
illuminate how these interactions intersect with host cell perturbations and host defense
pathways.
In addition to the induction of an IFN response, we provide evidence for the activation
of MAPK and TNFα signaling pathways upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, which adds to growing
evidence that these pathways are regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be
exploited to manipulate viral replication8–10. In the context of EGF/MAPK signaling, it is
intriguing that we detected EGFR together with several RAS-related proteins, including
RAB6D, RAB6A and RAB7A in our expanded RNA interactome. RAS-related proteins were

also identified as protein-protein interaction partners of viral proteins in human cells,
including RAB7A, which we find to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in this study. Together,
these data may point at physical interactions between SARS-CoV-2 components and cellular
pathways that are perturbed upon viral infection.
Beyond characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome, our work uncovered a
subset of SARS-CoV-2 binders that are induced upon viral infection. Importantly, this group
of proteins includes a previously identified host dependency factor essential for coronavirus
replication (PPIA), suggesting that our approach indeed recovers relevant regulators of
coronavirus biology. We characterized two of these proteins in greater detail. First, we
demonstrated that CNBP directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which expands its
previously known role in the context of foreign DNA sensing. It is tempting to speculate that
recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA by CNBP might contribute to establishing a specific
cytokine response in infected cells. Intriguingly, the known CNBP-dependent cytokine
expression signature78,79 bears similarity to gene expression changes in SARS-CoV-2
infected cells5–7, which warrants future investigations. In addition to CNBP, we provide
evidence that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN interacts with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and
suppresses programmed ribosome frameshifting in a SARS-CoV-2 translational reporter.
Together, these insights illuminate how host cell proteins directly engage foreign RNA
molecules during infection and contribute to different host defense strategies.
Various additional host cell proteins can act as effector molecules in such defense
mechanisms. RNA editing by host deaminases for instance is an innate restriction process to
counter virus infection. Recent work revealed evidence for host-dependent RNA editing in
SARS-CoV-283. Consistent with these reports we find the APOBEC1 complementation factor
(A1CF) among the most significantly enriched SARS-CoV-2 interactors. Further, the
functionally related adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) is an interferon-induced
gene that was strongly upregulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in our proteome
analysis.
Another notable group of human SARS-CoV-2 interactors are proteins associated
with various vesicle trafficking functions, including SCFD1, USO1, RAB1A, RAB6D, RAB6A,
and GDI2. The significant enrichment of these proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome
is particularly interesting, given the crucial roles of membranes and vesicles for the formation
of RTCs and virion assembly. We further detect two viral proteins involved in doublemembrane vesicle formation (NSP3 and NSP6) in our RNA interactome. This highlights the
possibility that an RNA-binding activity of various membrane or vesicle-associated proteins
may promote packaging of the viral RNA into newly assembling virions or membrane
vesicles.

Our characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome is a valuable resource that
provides an RNA-centric perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and will help to decode both
viral RNA metabolism as well as host defense mechanisms. As demonstrated in our study,
the identified interactions recover known coronavirus biology and uncover opportunities for
targeting proteins or pathways linked to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome in order to control
viral replication. We believe that our findings and strategies provide a general roadmap for
dissecting the biology of RNA viruses and the interactions between hosts and pathogens at
the molecular level.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue culture
We maintained HuH-7 cells in DMEM media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 100 units/ml streptomycin and 100
mg/ml penicillin. Cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Virus production
We used a previously described patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 isolate84 that was propagated
on HuH-7 cells and characterized by RNA sequencing. Viral loads were frequently
determined by RT-qPCR. In brief: viral RNA was extracted with a MagNA Pure 24 system
(Roche, Germany) and quantified with the LightMix Assay SARS-CoV-2 RdRP RTqPCR
assay kit (TIB MOLBIOL, Germany) and the RNA Process Control kit (Roche). Viral titers
were determined by immunofluorescence.

RAP-MS
RAP-MS was carried out as previously described13 with the following modifications: To
capture endogenous SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, we designed and synthesized 5’ biotinylated
90-mer DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) antisense to the
complementary target RNA sequence. We used 67 probes such that one probe binding site
occurs roughly every 400 bases in the ∼30 kb SARS-CoV-2 genome and excluded regions
that matched to human transcripts or genomic regions as previously described85,86. For
SARS-CoV-2 and RMRP antisense purifications, we grew ten 10 cm tissue culture plates of
HuH-7 cells per replicate. We prepared two replicates of each of the SARS-CoV-2 and
RMRP samples and included two non-crosslinked control samples that were used for RMRP
purifications. SARS-CoV-2 infection was carried out with an MOI of 10 for 24 hours. Cells
were washed once with PBS and then crosslinked on ice using 0.8 J/cm2 of 254 nm UV light
in a GS Gene Linker (Bio-Rad). Cells were then lysed on the tissue culture plate by adding 1
ml of RAP lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 0.5% dodecyl maltoside (DDM), 0.2%
sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Murine RNase Inhibitor (New England Biolabs)).
Lysates were then collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80°C. All
subsequent steps were carried out at previously described13.

RAP-MS protein digestion and TMT labeling
RAP-captured proteins were resuspended in 40 μL of 8 M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl, followed
by reduction with 4 mM DTT for 30 minutes at room temperature and alkylation with 10 mM
IAA for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark. All six samples were then digested with
15

0.1 μg Lys-C for 2 hours, followed by a reduction of the urea concentration to <2 M and
continued digestion with 0.5 μg trypsin overnight. Reactions were quenched with formic acid
at a final concentration of 5% and then desalted by reverse phase C18 stage tips as
described previously87 and dried down. Peptides were then resuspended in 50 μL of 50 mM
HEPES buffer and isobarically labeled using 400 μg of Tandem Mass Tag 6-plex (TMT6)
isobaric labeling reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The labeling reactions were then
quenched with 4 μL of 5% hydroxylamine, samples were mixed together, and dried. The
sample was fractionated by SCX stage tip strategy using three pH cuts at 5.15, 8.25, and
10.3 as described previously87.

Proteome analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells
For proteome measurements, we expanded HuH-7 cells to two 10cm tissue culture plates
per replicate. Cells were infected with an MOI of 10 and incubated for 24 hours before
harvesting. Three process replicates of infected and non-infected cell line samples were
generated. Cells were lysed in 8 M Urea, 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 2
µg/ml Aprotinin, 10 μg/ml Leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM NaF, PIC2 (Sigma Aldrich), PIC3
(Sigma Aldrich) and 10mM Sodium Butyrate. Benzonase was added to digest nucleic acids
and DNA was sheared using a probe sonicator (10% amplitude, 0.7s on, 2.3s off, 6 min 15s
total). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and lysates were flash-frozen for storage.
All samples were prepared for MS analysis using an optimized workflow as described
previously88. Briefly, lysed samples were reduced, alkylated, and digested by LysC for 2
hours, followed by overnight digestion with trypsin. Digestions were quenched with formic
acid and all peptide samples were desalted using reverse phase C18 SepPak cartridges.
Samples were then quantified by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay and measured into 500 μg
aliquots for isobaric labeling. Peptides were isobarically labeled with TMT6 following the
reduced TMT protocol89. After confirming 98% or greater label incorporation, the samples
were mixed together and desalted. Sample was then fractionated by offline high pH reversed
phase chromatography and concatenated into 24 fractions for the analysis by on-line LCMS/MS88.

LC-MS/MS analysis (RAP-MS and proteome)
All the samples were analyzed either on an Orbitrap ExplorisTM 480 (RAP-MS fractions) or Q
Exactive TM Plus (proteome fractions) mass spectrometer coupled with Easy-nLC 1200 ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Thermo Fisher) with solvent A of 0.1%
formic acid (FA)/3% acetonitrile and solvent B of 0.1% FA/90% acetonitrile. One μg of each
of the proteome fractions and half of each of the RAP-MS fractions were injected on a 75μm
ID Picofrit column packed in-house to approximately 28 cm length with Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ

1.9 μn beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH). Samples were separated at 200 nL/min flow rate with a
gradient of 2-6% solvent B for 1min, 6-30% B in 84 min, 30-60% B in 9 min, 60-90% B in 1
min, followed by a hold at 90% B for 5 min. Both mass spectrometers were operated in data
dependent acquisition mode. On Exploris 480 MS1 scan (r = 50,000) was followed by MS2
scans (r = 15,000) for top 20 most abundant ions using normalized automatic gain control
(AGC) of 100% for MS1 and 200% for MS2, MS2 maximum inject time of 150ms, normalized
collision energy of 34 and fit filter of 50%. On Q Exative Plus MS parameters were set as
follows: MS1 r = 70,000; MS2 r = 17,500; MS1 AGC target of 3e6, MS2 for 12 most abundant
ions using AGC target of 5e4 and maximum inject time of 120ms, and normalized collision
energy of 29.

Quantification and identification of peptides and proteins (RAP-MS and proteome)
MS/MS spectra were searched on the Spectrum Mill MS Proteomics Workbench against a
RefSeq-based sequence database containing 41,457 proteins mapped to the human
reference genome (hg38) obtained via the UCSC Table Browser
(https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) on June 29, 2018, with the addition of 13
proteins encoded in the human mitochondrial genome, 264 common laboratory contaminant
proteins, 553 human non-canonical small open reading frames, 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins
obtained from RefSeq derived from the original Wuhan-Hu-1 China isolate NC_045512.290,
and 23 novel unannotated SARS-CoV-2 ORFs whose translation is supported by ribosome
profiling31, yielding a total of 42,337 proteins. Amongst the 28 annotated SARS-CoV-2
proteins we opted to omit the full length ORF 1ab, to simplify peptide-to-protein assignment,
and instead represented ORF1a and ORF1ab as the mature 16 individual non-structural
proteins that result from proteolytic processing of the 1a and 1ab polyprotein. We further
added the D614G variant of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein that is commonly observed in
European and American virus isolates. Spectrum Mill search parameters included:
instrument setting of ESI-QEXACTIVE-HCD-v4-35-20, parent and fragment mass tolerance
of 20ppm, trypsin allow P enzyme setting and up to 4 missed cleavages.
Carbamidomethylation and TMT labeling at Lysine (with and without labeling at N-terminus)
were set as fixed modifications, while variable modifications included acetylation of protein Ntermini, oxidized methionine, deamidation of asparagine, and pyro-glutamic acid at peptide
N-terminal glutamine. Peptide spectrum match score thresholding was optimized to achieve
a target-decoy false discovery rate (FDR) of 1.2% for validation of spectra. Peptide level
auto-validation was followed by protein polishing with FDR of 0% at protein level and
minimum score of 13.
The Spectrum Mill generated proteome level export from the RAP-MS and proteome
datasets filtered for human proteins identified by two or more distinct peptides, SARS-CoV-2

proteins and unannotated virus ORFs were used for further statistical analyses. Five of the
SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (NSP6, NSP15, NSP16, NSP9, and NSP1) identified by
a single, highly scoring distinct peptide were kept in the dataset. Keratins were excluded from
RAP-MS data. Protein quantification was achieved by taking the ratio of TMT reporter ion for
each sample/channel over the median of all 6 channels. Moderated two-sample t-test was
applied to compare SARS-CoV-2 and RMRP samples after mean normalization and SARSCoV-2 infected and non-infected samples after median-MAD normalization of RAP-MS and
proteome datasets, respectively. Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value threshold of 0.05
was used to asses significantly regulated proteins in each of the datasets.

Western blot of RAP-MS samples
Following the described RAP-MS procedure, we saved 5% of benzonase eluted proteins for
western blot analysis. We added NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientifc) and
incubated samples for 3 min incubation at 95°C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using
NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris-HCl Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 200 V for 1 h, followed by
transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot Dry Blotting System (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Western blots were performed using the iBind Western System (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). For protein detection, we used the following primary antibodies: Nucleoprotein –
Abcam #ab272852, POP1 – Proteintech #12029-1-AP. We used the following secondary
antibodies: IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (LI-COR), IRDye 800CW Donkey
anti-Goat IgG (H + L) (LI-COR). For visualization of bands, we used the Odyssey Clx infrared
imager system (LI-COR).

Covalent protein capture and sequencing of crosslinked RNA
To capture RNA sequences covalently crosslinked to proteins purified with RAP-MS, we
carried out RNA antisense purifications as described above. Following our pilot RAP-MS
experiment (see Supplementary Figure 1a, b), SARS-CoV-2 bound proteins were eluted from
streptavidin beads by heat fragmentation of RNA (3 minutes at 91°C in 100 mM HEPES pH
7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 0.02% Triton X-100). For subsequent RAP-MS experiments
we replaced heat fragmentation with RNase H digestion, using 7.5 μl RNase H (NEB), 2 μl
TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 55.5 μl RNase H buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
75 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.125% NLS, 0.025% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mM TCEP) and
incubating 30 minutes at 37°C. Following elution of proteins, supernatants were transferred
into new tubes and beads were washed once with RNase H buffer. Wash fractions were
pooled with eluates and stored on ice. The next steps were previously described in similar
form by Quinodoz et al91. We separated 100μl of NHS magnetic beads (Thermo Fischer) on
a magnet and discarded the supernatant. We then washed with 1 ml 1 mM ice cold HCl,

followed by a quick rinse in 1 ml ice-cold PBS. After removing PBS, we immediately added
the stored eluates to the prepared beads. Binding was carried out overnight at 4°C on a
rotating wheel. The next day, we quenched NHS beads by adding 1 ml of 0.5 M Tris pH 8.0
and incubating for 1h at 4°C. We then washed beads four times in 1 ml of Modified RLT
buffer (RLT buffer supplied by Qiagen with added 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, 0.2% NLS, 0.1% Triton-X, and 0.1% NP-40). Next, we washed beads two more times
in 1 ml 1X PBS, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.2% Triton-X, 0.2% NP-40, 0.2%
sodium deoxycholate and incubated each washing step 5 minutes at 55°C. These heated
washing steps were followed by two additional washed in the same buffer at room
temperature. Subsequently, beads were rinsed on the magnet in 1x FastAP buffer (10 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 0.02% Triton X-100). Next, end repair was carried out
by resuspending beads in 50 μl FastAP mix (39 μl H2O, 5 μl 10x FastAP buffer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), 1 μl Murine RNase Inhibitor (NEB), 5 μl FastAP enzyme (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and incubating 20 minutes at 37°C. In the meantime, we prepared 150 μl of T4
PNK mix (120 μl H2O, 20 μl 10x T4 PNK buffer (NEB), 1 μl Murine RNase Inhibitor (NEB),
7μl T4 PNK (NEB), 1 μl TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific)), which was added to the
FastAP reaction and incubated for another 20 minutes at 37°C. Following end repair, we
washed beads once in Modified RLT buffer, and two times in Detergent Wash Buffer (20 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton-X, 0.2% NP-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate). We then
rinsed beads on the magnet twice with 1X T4 RNA ligase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10
mM MgCl2), before resuspending the beads in 25 μl RNA ligation mix (9 μl H2O, 3 μl 10x T4
RNA ligase buffer (NEB), 0.3 μl 0.1M ATP, 0.8 μl DMSO, 0.4 μl Murine RNase Inhibitor
(NEB), 9 μl PEG 8000, 2.5 μl T4 RNA ligase I High Concentration (NEB). Next, we added 5
μl 20 nM RiL19 (/5phos/rArGrArUrCrGrGrArArGrArGrCrGrUrCrGrUrG/3SpC3/; IDT) and
incubated samples for 75 minutes at 23°C. Following 3’-ligation, we washed the beads once
in 1ml Modified RLT Buffer, followed by two washes in Detergent Wash Buffer. Next, we
resuspended beads in 250 μl Proteinase K mix containing 200 μl NLS RNA Elution buffer (20
mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 2% NLS, 2.5 mM TCEP), 12.5 μl 5 M NaCl, 1 μl 500 mM
TCEP, 12.5 μl Proteinase K (NEB), and 24 μl H2O and incubated samples for 1.5 hours at
55°C. Following Proteinase K digestion, we separated beads on a magnet, transferred the
supernatant into a new tube and extracted RNA using Phenol/Chloroform extraction. All
subsequent manipulation steps were carried out as described in the eCLIP library
preparation protocol80, starting with the reverse transcription of recovered RNA fragments.

eCLIP
To facilitate eCLIP experiments in SARS-CoV-2 infected HuH-7 cells, we applied the
previously described RAP-MS approach to purify all SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins prior to
19

immunoprecipitating individual proteins from this pool. Similar strategies were previously
applied to facilitate eCLIP experiments92.
Following RAP-MS, SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins were eluted by adding 7.5 μl RNase
H (NEB), 2 μl TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to 55.5 μl RNase H buffer (100 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.125% NLS, 0.025% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5
mM TCEP) and incubating 30 minutes at 37°C. Subsequently, we adjusted the volume of
eluates to 250 μl with H2O and added an equal volume of 2x CLIP lysis buffer (100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2% (v/v) NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mM
DTT). In the meantime, we coupled 100 μl Protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
with 10 μg CNBP antibody (Proteintech, 14717-1-AP) or 10 μg IgG antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, 2729) by incubating antibody-bead suspensions 45 minutes at room
temperature. We removed unbound antibody and added the stored eluates to antibodycoupled beads and incubated the beads for 4 hours at 4 °C. Following incubation,
immunoprecipitates were washed two times in 1 ml CLIP lysis buffer, two times in IP wash
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) NP40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.25 mM DTT), followed by two washes in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) NP40. All subsequent manipulation steps were carried out according to the
eCLIP protocol80.

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR.
At 72 h post-infection, cells were lysed in 3 volumes RLT buffer (Qiagen) and RNA was
extracted using Dynabeads MyOne Silane (Life technologies). RNA was bound to the beads
by adding 4.5 volumes isopropanol, washed twice with 70% EtOH, DNase treated (TURBO
DNase, Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed again with 70% Et-OH and eluted in H20. RNA
was reversely transcribed into cDNA (SmartScribe RT, Takara Bio) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA was quantified by qPCR using PowerUp SYBR Green
master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and primers specific to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP gene
(fwd: GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG , rev: CARATGTTAAASACACTATTAGCATA) and
18S rRNA (fwd: ATGGCCGTTCTTAGTTGGTG, rev: GAACGCCACTTGTCCCTC TA). We
calculated differences in RNA expression using the ΔΔCT method versus 18S. To achieve
power to detect small effects in gene expression, we performed 4 technical qPCR replicates
(from the same cDNA) and took the median value for further analysis.

Inhibitor treatment and infection assay
We seeded 105 HuH-7 cells per well of a 24-well plate. The next day, growth medium was
replaced by medium containing Cyclosporin A (Sigma-Aldrich, SML1018) or BX-795
hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, SML0694) at indicated concentrations 2h prior to infection.

Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.5 PFU/cell by adding virus on top of the
inhibitor-containing media.

Cell viability assay
We seeded 2*104 HuH-7 cells per well of a 96-well plate. The next day, the growth medium
was replaced by medium containing Cyclosporin A (Sigma-Aldrich, SML1018) or BX-795
hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, SML0694) at indicated concentrations. Cells were incubated
for 72 h, and cell viability was assessed using the Cell-Titer-Glo reagent (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Quantification of ribosomal frameshifting
HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either the control construct or the
frameshifting construct of our dual-color EGFP-mCherry translation reporter outlined in
Supplementary Figure 3a. RYDEN was expressed as fusion proteins with ECFP. In control
experiments a plasmid only carrying ECFP was used. Using flow cytometry (Novocyte
Quanteon), ECFP-positive cells were analyzed for the ratio between mCherry and EGFP,
providing a direct readout of ribosomal frameshifting efficiency. Accordingly, frameshifting
efficiency was calculated using the ratio of mCherry to EGFP observed with the frameshifting
reporter construct (Supplementary Figure 3a), relative to the mCherry/EGFP ratio observed
with the control construct (Supplementary Figure 3a).

Computational analyses
Protein-protein interaction network
To establish protein-protein interactions for the proteins identified from the MS experiments,
we utilized STRING v1193. Specifically, for the RAP-MS network (Figure 2), we seeded all
proteins detected with an adj. P < 0.2 and positive logFC from the moderated t-test between
SARS-CoV2 purifications and RMRP purifications. Edges between interacting proteins were
included for those above a combined interaction score of 550. To generate the combined
RAP-MS and proteome MS network, we seeded nodes where the adj. P < 0.05 for either of
the assays. Edges between RAP-MS nodes and proteome MS nodes were included for
combined interaction scores exceeding 700.

Gene set and pathway enrichment analysis
We performed a hypergeometric Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the expanded
SARS-CoV-2 interactome proteins using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp) and applying default
settings.

We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for proteome experiments with
the clusterProfilter R package94 utilizing the Hallmark and C5-Biological Processes gene sets
available through MSigDB95. Genes were ranked based on the product of the log2 fold
change and the log10 moderated t-test P value between the SARS-CoV2 treatment and
mock treatments.

eCLIP and RNA sequencing analysis
Paired-end sequencing reads from (i) eCLIP experiments, or (ii) sequencing of crosslinked
RNA fragments following RAP-MS, were trimmed using a custom python script that
simultaneously identified the umi-molecular identifier (UMI) associated with each read. These
trimmed reads were then aligned to the SARS-Cov2 reference genome (NC_045512.2 contig)
using bwa96. Next, we removed PCR duplicates using the UMI-aware deduplication
functionality in Picard’s MarkDuplicates. Finally, enriched regions of binding were identified
using the MACS297 to model the fold change between per-million fragment normalized
counts (--SPMR) of the treated and control. Visualizations of the region were rendered from
the PCR-deduplicated .bam files using the Integrative Genome Visualization (IGV) Browser.

network of SARS-CoV-2 RNA interacting proteins is publicly accessibly at:
