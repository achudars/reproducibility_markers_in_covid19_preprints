Abstract We present an analysis on the uptake of open access on COVID19 related literature as well as the social media attention they gather when
compared with non OA papers. We use a dataset of publications curated by
Dimensions and analyze articles and preprints. Our sample includes 11,686
publications of which 67.5% are openly accessible. OA publications tend to receive the largest share of social media attention as measured by the Altmetric
Attention Score. 37.6% of OA publications are bronze, which means toll journals are providing free access. MedRxiv contributes to 36.3% of documents in
repositories but papers in BiorXiv exhibit on average higher AAS. We predict
the growth of COVID-19 literature in the following 30 days estimating ARIMA
models for the overall publications set, OA vs. non OA and by location of the
document (repository vs. journal). We estimate that COVID-19 publications
will double in the next 20 days, but non OA publications will grow at a higher
rate than OA publications. We conclude by discussing the implications of such
findings on the dissemination and communication of research findings to mitigate the coronavirus outbreak.

1 Introduction
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
COVID-19 a world pandemic (Organization et al., 2020). Since then, the
spread of the disease has expanded, forcing governments to confine their population and enforce social distancing to reduce the spread of the virus. The
gravity of the situation has led to an unprecedented scientific race to mitigate
the effects of the pandemic (Torres-Salinas et al., 2020) which is has overflowed the scientific scholarly communication system (Larrivière et al., 2020).
The normal pace of scholarly communication has proven to be too slow and
inefficient, leading to a complete transformation in the way new findings are
reported and consumed. Traditional bibliometric databases such as Web of Science or Scopus, which index mainly published journal literature, have become
almost instantly obsolete while journals are accelerating to an unprecedented
rate their publication track for any COVID-related study. This has led scientists’ attention to unexpected sources such as ad hoc compilations of scientific
literature openly accessible and curated by the scientific community. Examples
of such compilations are the CORD-19 dataset1 , a global community effort,
the COVID-19 Database maintained by the WHO2 , or some publisher curated
lists. These topic-specific databases are characterized by their daily update as
well as including both, peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed literature literature.
The COVID-19 pandemic has confronted scientists to an unprecedented
challenge in which time and efficiency are critical. The exponential growth of
scientific literature on the coronavirus outbreak and the means by which new
findings are disseminated, disregarding the traditional status of journals for
the sake of speed and efficiency (Larrivière et al., 2020), confront scientists to
additional obstacles. They need to keep up with new scientific literature, be
more critical than ever with non-peer-reviewed literature and respond to the
the expectations of society. As a consequence, scientific discussions and conflicts are more public than ever (Gulbrandsen et al., 2020), revealing an additional threat, as socially responsible attitudes are crucial to stop the spread of
the outbreak (Thelwall and Thelwall, 2020). Examples such as a recent paper
suggesting the virus was man-made (Delgado López-Cózar et al., 2020) reveal
that responsible communication to non-scientific audiences is essential to balance between open scientific debates and public outreach. In this new context,
altmetrics gain more importance than ever, as they become the quickest vehicle to monitor social perception of science in an area where citations play a
secondary role as they lack on speed to keep up the production and reception
of new findings.
In this study we compare the growth on publications, citations and altmetric mentions to COVID-19 literature using the Dimensions dataset which
includes publications, datasets, grants and clinical trials (Resources, 2020).

The general goal is to analyze the size of scientific literature is expected in relation to this crisis, as well as the size of the discussions as any type of analysis
or tool built based on this increasing body of information will have to consider
such growth rate. More specifically, in this study we aim at responding at the
following research questions:
1. What are the differences in terms of access to COVID-19 related literature? We establish comparisons between OA and non-OA output as well
as between journal articles and preprints to study the effectiveness of the
communication strategies followed by scientists working on this subject.
2. What is the expected growth of both, scientific literature, citations and
social media attention? By modelling our data we establish predictions to
up to 30 days which will can help on the design of infrastructure and tools
which will make use of this data.

We use the Dimensions dataset on COVID-19 literature version 14, which was
updated for the last time in April 14, 2020 (Resources, 2020). This dataset
contains information on four document types: publications, datasets, clinical
trials and grants. In this study we work with the publications dataset, which
includes a total of 11,686 records. This dataset is much more restrictive than
CORD-19, which employs a much wider criteria of inclusion (Colavizza et al.,
2020). This set is retrieved from the Dimensions database after using the
following search query3 :
Year: 2020; Data Search: ”2019-nCoV” or ”COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”
or ((”coronavirus” or ”corona virus”) and (Wuhan or China))
For each record it includes publication metadata as well as information
on number of citations, Altmetric Attention Score, journal or repository and
open access (OA) status. Table 1 offers a brief overview of the contents of the
publication dataset with regard to publication type, document type and type
of access. Dimensions provided OA information retrieved from Unpaywall, but
assigns documents to one OA type exclusively, overriding cases in which there
might be evidence of more than one OA type for a single document (RobinsonGarcia et al., 2020).
In this study we restrict our analysis to two document types, that is, articles and preprints. The Dimensions dataset includes other document types
such as monographs, book chapters and proceedings, but these only amount
to a total of 278 records. We must also note that preprints and articles are
document types unrelated to their OA status of the manuscript, as preprints
(e.g., online first) can also be found in journals. After some normalization on
the original dataset, we identified 67.5% of all COVID-19 related publications

The focus of the paper is on the growth of publications as well as of social
media attention. As a proxy for the latter we use the Altmetric Attention
Score (AAS) provided in the original dataset. Altmetric scores can only be
obtained for documents which include an identifier such as a DOI or a PMID.
11,189 records in the Dimensions dataset include an identifier, that is 95.7%
of the records. The AAS has been strongly criticized by the scientometric
community (Gumpenberger et al., 2016; Mukherjee et al., 2018) as it is a
composite measure difficult to interpret. In the case of altmetrics this becomes
even more problematic as Altmetric.com (the altmetric platform behind the
score) includes a plethora of diverse sources with little relation with each
other. While these limitations are acknowledged, we used this indicator as
an exploratory attempt to identify those documents with higher social media
attention. In further analyses we plan to obtain additional information from
Altmetric.com on the specific scores obtained by each paper in each of the
platforms this database covers.
To establish prediction on publications, citations and altmetrics growth
(with particular interest on OA) we address the proble as a one one of time
series prediction. To do so, we need adequate tools to analyze historical data
and thus, making predictions Hassan (2014); de Oliveira and Oliveira (2018).
There are several types of models that can be used for time-series forecasting
Siami-Namini et al. (2018). In this study we make use of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Ho and Xie (1998), which is one of the
most widely known approaches Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018). In this
kind of models, the forecasts correspond to a linear combination of past values
of the variable Hyndman and Khandakar (2008), explaining a given time series
based on past values.
An ARIMA model is characterized by three parameters (p, d, q) where,

Here we obtain ARIMA models for the total number of publications, by
location of the record (journal or repository) and OA status. All the analyses
are conducted on an Ubuntu 18.04.1 machine with R version 3.6.3 and RStudio
version 1.1.456. Figure 1 shows the publication time trends observed in the
Dimensions dataset. As reported in a previous paper (Torres-Salinas, 2020)
the literature on COVID-19 is growing at an exponential rate. If we consider
the total number of publications, the value of R2 is equal to 0.93. In the case
of journal publications the value of R2 is 0.92. In the case of repositories, we
observe a much slower growth (R2 = 0.36). Predictive models were obtained
for each of the variables observed and subsequently estimated. These models will be referred to from here on as ARIMA(1,2,2) for the ”Total” series,
ARIMA(0,2,1) for the ”Journal” series, and ARIMA(2,2,4) for the ”repositories” series. Our 30 days predictions are based on these models.

Table 2 provides an overview of the dataset used. A total of 11,686 papers
were retrieved, out of which 7,884 (68%) are available in OA. This proportion
decreases during the month of April. Despite the fact that this analysis covers
three and 1/2 months, a total of 27,129 citations have already been made.
This means on average 2.32 citations per paper. This average is even higher
for non OA publications, which receive an average number of citations of 3.28.
These papers have raised an unprecedented amount of social media attention according to their AAS. On average, these documents receive an AAS of

117, which is even higher in the case of OA papers (152.25). In this sense, we
observe differences depending on the location of the record. Journal articles
receive higher citations than those stored in repositories, but there are differences by repository. PubMed and PMC receive a considerably higher number
of social media attention than the rest of the repositories. Although BioRvix
and MedRxiv provide a lower number of documents to the dataset, they still
attract a high number of citations (in the case of the former) and social media
attention (for the latter).

the papers on COVID-19 are OA and reach higher values of AAS than non-OA
papers. For instance, two papers obtained AAS values of 27,609 (Nat Med 26,
450-452, 2020) and 21,738 (N Engl J Med, 382, 1564-1567, 2020) respectively.
Likewise 15 OA papers obtained a score of at least 10,000 AAS, accumulating
a total of 215,885. These fifteen papers alone add up to more AAS than the
entire set of papers published as non OA (Table 2).
Figure 3 shows the distribution of AAS (A) and the size of the output (B)
by OA type. Bronze OA documents tend to receive a higher AAS and represent
the largest share of COVID-19 related publications (3,072). Overall OA papers,
either We observe that OA papers published in journals (regardless of the OA
type: bronze, hybrid or pure), predominate. In relation to AAS, bronze papers
have an average of 249 and papers with higher AAS are within this modality.
Hybrid and gold OA papers receive less attention, 154 and 61 on average,
respectively.
In Figure 4 we shift our focus to records deposited in repositories. The
repository with the largest number of publications is PMC, with a total of 2,330
papers and an average AAS of 182. Here we must note that PMC not only
includes self-archived documents, but also indexes OA journals (RobinsonGarcia et al., 2020). The second largest repository is medRxiv with a total
of 1,232 and an average AAS of 125 per document. Despite being the repository with the lowest number of records included (387), documents indexed in
BioRxiv receive on average, the highest AAS (223). All documents in BioRxiv
have receive at least an AAS of 1. The rest of the repositories analyzed (ChemRxiv, JMIR Preprints, Research Square and SSRN) have a peripheral role on
production and visibility of COVID-19 related publications.

Paying attention to Figure 5, it can be seen that the estimate made by the
predictive models at 30 days is of a growing trend in the number of publications. The ARIMA model forecast for total publications starts on 14/04/200
with 12254 publications and ends on 13/05/2020 with 27162 publications. In
the case of journals it starts with 8601 publications and ends with 17660. The
repositories will grow at a slower rate, the forecast starts with 3538 publications and ends with 7712. The data indicate that total publications will
double in about 20 days, journal publications will double in about 24 days,
and repository publications will double in about 24 days
Figure 6 shows the accumulated time trend as well as the predicted trend
differentiating between OA and non OA publications.The ARIMA model forecast for OA papers starts on April 14, 2020 with 8,067 publications and ends
on May 13, 2020 with 13,359 publications. According to these predictions, non
OA publications will grow at faster rate than OA publications. The forecast
starts with 4,075 publications and ends with 11,992. It can be said that OA
publications will double every 30 days and non OA publications will double
every 14 days. The differences between the number of OA and non OA publications appears to be narrowing as the prediction progresses. By the end of
the forecast, the central role of open access will not be as clear as it was in
early February and March.

Dimensions dataset (Resources, 2020) which is openly accessible and has been
updated daily until its last update on April 14, 2020. While the dataset itself
is not free of limitations, and other COVID-19 datasets are being used alternatively, it is the one coming from the largest scientific database as compared
with Web of Science and Scopus (Torres-Salinas et al., 2020). Furthermore,
the search query used seems to be much more restrictive than other used elsewhere, which can introduce some noise when identifying the scientific corpus
specifically dealing with this virus (Colavizza et al., 2020).
The findings reported here shows that many journals (e.g., New England
Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, JAMA, Nature) are doing an important
effort to prioritize the urgency of the current situation over their monetary
benefits by providing COVID-19 related literature in OA. This is an unprecedented event which should not go unnoticed, and explains to a large extent the
large shares of OA literature identified related with the coronavirus outbreak.
The interest on scientific development on this front go beyond the scientific
realm as the high social media attention revolving these documents shows.
Scientific advancements are reported daily in the news media, discussed on
Twitter and used for decision-making by politicians. Indeed, scientific efforts
have not only focused on mitigating the pandemic, but have also responded
to social concerns, such as those derived from the rise of fake news (Andersen
et al., 2020).
The amount of literature produced since the coronavirus outbreak suggests
an exponential growth on the number of publications produced, citations and
social media mentions. If we want to be able to keep up with such growth
and produce tools and analyses on such increasing corpus, some preparation
is needed. Our estimates indicate that this number of records will duplicate

every 14 days if the current rhythm of production continues. First reactions
praised OA efforts from the scientific community and how these confronted
the ”normal” speed of science (Larrivière et al., 2020). However, our analysis
shows a great dependency on journal literature and specifically on the role
of major toll journals which have made openly accessible COVID-19 related
literature as an exceptional measure. This reflects a great dependency on the
traditional journal publishing system. Furthermore, our predictions estimate a
higher growth for non OA literature in the near future. This trend, if confirmed,
can become a great obstacle on the advancement of a cure for COVID-19 as
well as on mitigating collateral damages from the pandemic.
Social media attention revolves mainly around OA publications, but again,
here the role of toll journals opening their contents through bronze OA is
crucial, followed by hybrid OA and gold OA, again reflecting that, despite the
urgency, the traditional and mechanisms of scholarly publishing are still in
place, along with all their deficiencies (Gadd, 2020).
That said, any conclusions on the predictions reported must be taken with
caution as we live in a constantly changing situation, closely linked to the
mitigation of the pandemic and political actions derived from it. Still, analyses
such as the present can help us contextualize the phenomenon and provide
alternative views from which scientometricians can contribute.

In this section we provide a brief summary of the main findings reported in
this study.
1. 11,686 publications on COVID-19 were retrieved. 68% are OA. 27,129 citations have already been made. This means on average 2.32 citations per
publication
2. On average publications receive an Altmetric Attention Score of 117, which
is even higher in the case of Open Access papers (152.25)
3. Most of the publications on COVID-19 are OA and receive higher social
media attention than non OA papers.
4. Most of the OA publications are bronze OA. These are receiving the highest
social media.
5. OA papers published in scientific journals predominate. This fact emphasizes the central role of journals and peer review versus early access to
preprints.
6. Pubmed is the repository with the largest number of publications, followed
by medRxiv. Documents indexed in BioRxiv receive on average, the highest
social media attention.
7. We expect that the total number of COVID-19 related publications will
double in 20 days. Journal articles will double in 24 days, while papers in
repositories will grow at a slower rate.
8. We expect non OA papers to grow at a faster rate than OA publications.
By mid-May the number of non OA papers will have almost tripled.
