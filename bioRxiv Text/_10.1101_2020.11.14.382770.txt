Abstract

24

The outbreak of new viruses, such as serve acute respiratory syndrome

25

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as the emerging of drug-resistance viruses

26

highlight the urgent need for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

broad-spectrum antiviral activities against several RNA and DNA viruses, including

32

herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human

33

cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

34

RDT can significantly suppress viral gene expression and show the low possibility to

35

elicit drug-resistant variants. Mechanistic study implied that RDT inhibited viral

36

infection by disturbing the cellular factors that essential for viral gene expression. Our

37

results suggested that RDT might be a promising lead compound for the development

38

of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

45

Most of the current drugs are used to treat virus infections by directly targeting

46

viral factors, particularly the enzymes (e.g., protease or DNA/RNA polymerase)1,2. In

47

the past decades, these direct-acting drugs have achieved great success to fight

48

virus-associated diseases. However, a variety of issues, such as drug resistance and

49

adverse effects, have been developed2. Moreover, a direct-acting antiviral drug is

50

often effective in inhibiting the viruses of the same subfamily, it is incapable when the

51

patients are infected with multiple viruses or undiagnosed viruses. In contrast, the

52

broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitors would be a great significance in these cases. In

53

addition, with the rapid emergence of new viruses in recent years, the development of

54

broad-spectrum antiviral drugs is urgently needed. Recently, a novel severe acute

55

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged and is rapidly

56

spreading around the world, resulting in over 40.9 million infections and 1,125,474

57

deaths until now. Currently, the therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 are still limited, and

58

most of the drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 target the viral factors3. With the

59

rapid mutation in the genome of SARS-CoV-24,5, the direct-acting antiviral drugs

60

would increase the risk of resistance.

61

Search for the broad-spectrum antiviral drugs targeting host cell factors essential

62

for the reproduction of virions is becoming an alternative approach. Also,

63

broad-spectrum antiviral drugs minimize the risk of drug resistance. As an ongoing

64

research interest of our group in the past decades, we have constructed an in-house

65

compound library composing of structural diversity natural products obtained from

66

approximately 100 species of medicinal plants. After systematic bioassay screening, a

In this

molecule,

72

Rhodomyrtone (RDT), a phloroglucinol dimer originally isolated from

73

traditional Chinese medicine “Tao-Jin-Niang” (Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Ait.) Hassk.),

74

was previously reported to be a Gram-positive bacteria inhibitor that could

75

significantly inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus by targeting the bacterial

76

farR protein13. However, the antiviral activities of RDT have not been explored. In the

77

present study, we demonstrated for the first time that RDT potently inhibited several

78

DNA and RNA viruses (Fig. 1b–c), including severe acute respiratory syndrome

79

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), herpes simplex virus

80

type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV),

81

human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus

82

(KSHV). In vitro, the antiviral activities of RDT are stronger than those of several

83

FDA-approved nucleoside analogue antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, ribavirin,

84

acyclovir (ACV), and ganciclovir (GCV). Importantly, RDT potently suppressed

85

SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells at the concentrations without exhibiting

86

substantial cytotoxicity. The EC50 of RDT against SARS-CoV-2 is 0.44 μM, which is

87

lower than that of remdesivir.

88

Subsequently, the antiviral mechanism of RDT against HSV-1 was investigated.

89

We found that HSV-1/Blue virus, a TK mutant variant, showed strong resistance to

90

ACV but sensitive to RDT. The virus-induced plaques were significantly inhibited by

91

the treatment of RDT at the concentrations from 0.5 to 2 μM, however, the plaque

92

formation was not affected by ACV even at the concentration of 20 μM (Fig. 2a). In

93

time-of-addition assay, the reproduction of HSV-1 was almost completely suppressed

94

by 1 μM of RDT as well as 2 μM of ACV at 0, 2, 4, 6 h post-infection. The inhibitory

95

effect of ACV on HSV-1 was diminished at 8 h post-infection, however, the virus in

96

the cells was still potently inhibited by RDT until 14 h after viral infection (Fig. 2b).

97

These results indicated that the action mechanism of RDT is distinct from that of

98

ACV.

99

The results of immunofluorescence and RT-PCR assay demonstrated that RDT

100

potently suppressed the viral gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner

101

(Fig. 2c–d). Interestingly, the transcription level of US6 (gD) that inserted in a

102

pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid was decreased after the treatment of RDT in the cells,

103

particularly significantly decreased in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2e–f). Next, we observed

104

that the distribution of NXF1/TAP, a cellular mRNA export receptor, in the cytoplasm

105

was inhibited by RDT treatment, suggesting an inhibitory effect of RDT on mRNA

106

export (Fig. 2g). To determine whether the mRNA export pathway was affected by

107

RDT, we inserted Aly/Ref, a cellular mRNA export adaptor, and NXF1/TAP into

108

pEGFP-N3 and pmCherry-N1 plasmids, respectively. The results in confocal assay

109

demonstrated that NXF1/TAP-mCherry was co-localized with Aly/Ref-EGFP in the

110

cells, however, their interaction was affected by the treatment of RDT (Fig. 2h).

111

Together, these results implied that RDT is a broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitor

112

targeting the cellular factors involved in viral gene expression. Moreover, a resistant

113

variant was not be generated despite culturing the virus in the presence of RDT over

114

two months, providing evidence that RDT is not a direct-acting antiviral inhibitor.

115

In summary, RDT is a promising inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 with

116

broad-spectrum antiviral activities. It inhibits viral infection by affecting the

117

distribution of cellular factors essential for viral gene expression. Further research

118

including in vivo antiviral activity and potential target of RDT against different

119

viruses are remaining to be elucidated.

188

Vero cells in 12-well culture plates were infected with HSV-1/F at MOI = 0.5 or

190

various concentrations. After infection at 4 °C for 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS

containing different concentrations of RDT. At 9 h post-infection or 12 h after

206

NXF1/TAP, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pEGFP-Aly/Ref and

207

pmCherry-NXF1 plasmids with lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

208

Following the transfection, the cells were treated with the RDT at 1 μΜ. At 12 h after

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as the mean ± SD unless indicated otherwise. Statistical

considered statistically significant.
