Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by infection
with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
which is spread primary via respiratory droplets and infects the lungs. Currently
widely used cell lines and animals are unable to accurately mimic human
physiological conditions because of the abnormal status of cell lines
(transformed or cancer cells) and species differences between animals and
humans. Organoids are stem cell-derived self-organized three-dimensional
culture in vitro and model the physiological conditions of natural organs. Here
we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected and extensively replicated in
human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived lung organoids, including airway
and alveolar organoids. Ciliated cells, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and rare club
cells were virus target cells. Electron microscopy captured typical replication,
assembly and release ultrastructures and revealed the presence of viruses
within lamellar bodies in AT2 cells. Virus infection induced more severe cell
death in alveolar organoids than in airway organoids. Additionally, RNA-seq
revealed early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an unexpected
downregulation of ACE2 mRNA. Further, compared to the transmembrane
protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat, the nucleotide analog
prodrug Remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung
organoids. Therefore, human lung organoids can serve as a pathophysiological
model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug discovery.

Introduction
The current fast-evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which infects lungs and can lead to severe lung injury, multiorgan failure,
and death1-3. To prevent and effectively manage COVID-19, public health,
clinical interventions, basic research, and clinical investigation are all
emergently required. For basic research, it is essential to establish models that
can faithfully reproduce the viral life cycle and mimic the pathology of COVID19.
Cell lines and animals are two major models for coronavirus infection in
vitro and in vivo, respectively4-7. Cell lines can be used to amplify and isolate
viruses (like Vero and Vero E6 cells8,9), to investigate the viral infection (like
primary human airway epithelial cells, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells3,5,10,11), and to
evaluate therapeutic molecules (like Huh7 and Vero E6 cells12). Animal models
can be used to mimic tissue-specific and systemic virus-host interaction and
reveal the complex pathophysiology of coronaviruses-induced diseases7. Mice,
hamster, ferrets, cats, and non-human primates have been reported to model
COVID-1913-21. These cell and animal models have greatly enriched our
understanding of coronaviruses and assisted in the development of a variety of
potential therapeutic drugs7. However, these models yet have obvious
limitations. Species differences make animal model results unable to be
effectively translated into clinical applications22,23. Species differences (cells
from species other than humans, like Vero cells) and abnormal status
(transformed or cancer cells) make cell models unable to faithfully reproduce
the viral infection cycle and host response24-26.
Organoids are a three-dimensional structure formed by self-assembly of
stem cells in vitro27,28. As the cell composition, tissue organization, physiological
characteristics, and even functions are similar to natural organs in the body,
organoids have been used for human virus studies29,30. For SARS-CoV-2, lung,

kidney, liver, intestine, and blood vessel organoids have been reported to be
sensitive for virus infection31-37. Here using human embryonic stem cells
(hESCs)-derived lung airway and alveolar organoids, we demonstrate that
SARS-CoV-2 infects ciliated cells, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2 cells) as well as
rare club cells, and remdesivir is more potent than camosat to inhibit virus
infection.

Results and Discussion
Generation of human lung airway and alveolar organoids from hESCs
Based on our previous protocol38, as well as other reported protocols39,40,
we developed an optimized method to differentiate human airway organoids
(hAWOs) and alveolar organoids (hALOs) from hESCs, which contained six
stages, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), definitive endoderm (DE), anterior
foregut endoderm (AFE), ventralized anterior foregut endoderm (VAFE), lung
progenitors (LPs), and hAWOs and hALOs (Fig. 1a, b). Quantitative RT-PCR
revealed the expression dynamics of marker genes along differentiation (Fig.
1c). POU5F1 (ESCs), SOX17 (DE), SOX2 (ESCs and lung proximal
progenitors), SOX9 (lung distal progenitors), FOXA2 (lung epithelial cells),
NKX2.1 (lung epithelial cells), P63 (basal cells), SCGB1A1 (club cells),
MUC5AC (goblet cells) and SPC (AT2 cells) showed expected expression
patterns (Fig. 1c). Human lung organoids (hLOs) at day21 expressed lung and
pan epithelial markers NKX2.1

and E-CAD, respectively (Fig. 1d).

Immunofluorescent staining revealed that hAWOs contained basal cells (P63+),
ciliated cells (acetylated TUBULIN, a-TUB+), club cells (CC10+), and goblet
cells (MUC5AC+), as well as lung proximal progenitors (SOX2+) and
proliferating cells (Ki67+) (Fig. 1e). And hALOs contained AT2 cells (SPC+) and
AT1 cells (PDPN+ or AQP5+) (Fig. 1f). Since ACE2 is the receptor for SARSCoV-2 for host cell entry and TMPRSS2 is the serine protease for spike (S)
protein priming5,9, we checked their expression along the differentiation and
found they were highly expressed in hAWOs and hALOs (Fig. 1g).

SARS-CoV-2 infects human airway and alveolar organoids
To test whether SARS-CoV-2 infects human lung organoids, hAWOs and
hALOs (ranging from day 31 (D13) to D41) were exposed to SRAS-CoV-2 at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Samples were harvested at indicated time
points after infection and processed for the various analyses shown in Fig 2-5.
Live virus titration on Vero E6 cells and quantitative RT-PCR of viral RNA in the
culture supernatant and cell lysates showed that hAWOs and hALOs were
productively infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2a, b). Viral RNA and infectious
virus particles could be detected as early as 24 hours post infection (hpi),
increased at 48 hpi, and remained stable at 72 hpi. Compared to hALOs,
hAWOs produced less virus at 24 hpi and similar amount of virus at 48 hpi and
72 hpi (Fig. 2a, b). Co-immunostaining of viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) and
pan epithelial marker E-CAD showed that SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells
in human lung organoids (Fig. 2c). Quantification analysis showed that the
percentages of infected hAWOs increased from about 50% at 24 hpi to about
75% at 72 hpi (Fig. 2d). And the percentages of infected cells within a single
hAWO increased from about 24.9±3.7% at 24 hpi to 63.9±6.1% at 72 hpi (Fig.
2e). For hALOs, the percentages of infected organoids remained stable at
about 85% and the percentages of infected cells per organoid remained about
30%-40% from 24 hpi to 72 hpi. These cellular infection results were consistent
with viral RNA detection and infectious viral particle titration results.
SARS-CoV-2 infects ciliated cells, alveolar type 2 cells and rare club cells
To determine the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2, we co-stained each cell
lineage marker with viral N protein and virus receptor ACE2. Microscopy
analyses revealed that ciliated cells (a-TUB+) and alveolar type 2 cells (ProSPC+) were the major target cells (Fig.3a, b, and Fig. S1), which was consistent
with the previous report41. In addition, rare club cells (CC10+) could be infected
(Fig.3a). In hAWOs, about 90%-95% infected cells were ciliated cells and about
5%-10% were club cells, and no basal (P63+) or goblet cells (MUC5AC+) were

found infected (Fig. 3c). In hALOs, 100% infected cells were AT2 cells and no
AT1 cells (PDPN+) were found infected (Fig. 3c). We also measured the
percentages of infected cells within ciliated cells and AT2 cells. About 26±3.6%
at 24 hpi and 64.5±9.8% at 72 hpi of ciliated cells were infected, and the
percentages of infected AT2 cells remained stable at about 30%-40% from 24
hpi to 72 hpi (Fig. 3d, e). The distinct infection dynamics of ciliated cells and
AT2 cells indicated that more and more ciliated cells could be infected by SARSCoV-2 during a prolonged infection period and even all the ciliated cells could
be finally infected when given long enough infection time. On the contrary, only
a subpopulation of AT2 cells (about 30-40%) was sensitive for viral infection
although they could be quickly infected (within 24 hpi). The identity of the
SARS-CoV-2 sensitive AT2 cell subpopulation and why other AT2 cells could
not be infected need further investigation.
We noted that viral infected cells expressed ACE2 but not all ACE2
expressing cells were infected. TMPRSS2 is another known factor that
determines SARS-CoV-2 cell entry5, and therefore we checked the expression
pattern of TMPRSS2 in human lung organoids. Immunostaining analyses
showed that TMPRSS2 was ubiquitously expressed in both hAWOs and hALOs,
which was contrary to the restricted expression pattern of ACE2 (Fig. S2).
Therefore, compared to TMPRSS2, ACE2 was the major factor that determined
the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung organoids.
Next, we checked whether SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with
proliferation status by co-immunostaining with viral N protein and Ki67 (cycling
marker). We found that infected cells (NP+) contained both cycling (Ki67+) and
noncycling (Ki67-) cells in hAWOs and most infected cells were cycling cells in
hALOs (Fig. S3a). We then checked whether SARS-CoV-2 infection induced
apoptosis by co-immunostaining with viral N protein and cleaved Caspase3 (CCaspas3, apoptotic cell marker). No obvious cell death was observed at 24 hpi
or 48 hpi, but at 72 hpi, apoptosis became prominent in both organoids,
particularly more in hALOs (Fig. S3b-d).

Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung organoids
To conform the viral replication, the ultrastructures of infected hAWOs and
hALOs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy at 72 hpi or 96 hpi.
Part of hAWOs and hALOs in one mesh of the grids were shown in Fig. 4a and
4e, and viral particles were found in cells of both organoids (Fig. 4b-d, f and g).
In both organoids, viral particles were observed in the apical, lateral and
basolateral side of the cells (Fig. 4h-j), indicating potential dissemination route
how SARS-CoV-2 passes across the lung epithelial barrier. Double membrane
vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs) with spherules are typical
coronavirus replication organelles42,43, which were observed in the lung
organoids (Fig. 4k). Virus particles in cells were seen in membrane bound
vesicles, either as single particles or as groups in enlarged vesicles (Fig. 4l).
Enveloped viruses were observed in the lumen of Golgi apparatus and
secretory vesicles (Fig. 4m, n), which was consistent with previous report that
coronaviruses assembled and matured at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi
intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the mature virions were transported to
the cell surface and released from the host cells via exocytosis 43,44. Therefore,
TEM analyses captured three critical phases of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle:
replication, assembly and release.
Interestingly, we found virus particles within lamellar bodies (Fig. 4o), the
typical organelles in AT2 cells, which are essential for pulmonary surfactant
synthesis and secretion45. Does SARS-CoV-2 hijack lamellar bodies for virus
release? Or does SARS-CoV-2 impair the function of lamellar bodies and then
the homeostasis of pulmonary surfactant in the alveoli? These questions
remain open for further investigation. Additionally, vesicles full of dense virus
particles were routinely observed (Fig. 4b, g and n). Besides, virus particles
were found in late endosomes with engulfed cell debris (Fig. 4p, q). And more
dying cells and engulfed cell debris were observed in hALOs than in hAWOs
(Fig. 4r). The TEM data (Fig. 4p-r), as well as the C-Caspase3 immunostaining
data (Fig. S3b-d), indicated that the pathological changes of alveoli and

bronchioles after SARS-CoV-2 infection were different.
Early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
To determine the early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
performed RNA-sequencing analysis using hAWOs and hALOs 48h after
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Abundant SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected solely
in the infected organoids (Fig. 5a). Principle component analysis (PCA) showed
that the samples formed four separate clusters according to organoid type and
virus infection (Fig. 5b). In total, 1679 differential expressed genes were
identified with 718 genes upregulated and 961 genes downregulated in hAWOs,
and 719 genes differential expressed in hALOs with 334 upregulated and 385
downregulated (Fig. 5c). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that most
downregulated genes were associated with lipid metabolism, while upregulated
genes were associated with immune response (Fig. 5d). Several cytokines and
chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), CXCL8,
CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL10, CXCL11, as well as NF-kB related mRNA NFKB1,
NFKB2 and RELB, interferon-stimulated genes ATF3, GEM, IFITM3 and MX1
were upregulated, consistent with observation in COVID-19 patients46-48 (Fig.
5e). ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV
spike (S) protein can induce shedding of ACE2 by ADAM17, which is believed
to be a crucial mechanism for SARS-CoV-induced lung injury49-52. Surprisingly,
we found that the mRNA expression level of ACE2 was downregulated at 48h
after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5f). Since most infected cells were viable at
48 hpi (Fig. S3b-d), the downregulation of ACE2 mRNA was not a secondary
effect of cell death but a direct effect of virus infection. Therefore, we believe
that SARS-CoV-2 infection might decrease the expression of ACE2 at both
protein and mRNA levels. However, the mechanisms of downregulation remain
open for further investigation. In addition, we found that the expression of
TMPRSS2 was also slightly downregulated after SARS-CoV-2 infection at a
much less extent than ACE2 (Fig. 5f).

Remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication inhuman lung organoids
Finally, we tested the inhibitory effect of remdesivir, camostat, and bestatin
on the infection of human lung organoids by SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is a
nucleotide analogue prodrug to inhibit viral replication53, which has been
reported to repress SARS-CoV-2 infection in basic research and clinic
trials12,54,55. Camostat is an inhibitor of the serine protease TMPRSS2 that
cleaves SARS-CoV-2 S protein and facilitates viral entry5. Bestatin is an
inhibitor of CD13 (Aminopeptidase N/APN)56, a receptor utilized by many αcoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronaviruses)44. As shown in Fig.
6a, remdesivir reduced the production of infectious virus in hAWOs and hALOs,
and camostat showed a slightly inhibitory effect in hAWOs not in hALOs, while
bestatin had no effects in either hAWOs or hALOs. Quantitative RT-PCR
analyses of supernatant viral RNA also demonstrated that remdesivir inhibited
viral load (Fig. 6b). We noted that remdesivir reduced viral load to 1/10 but
infectious virus titer to less than 1/1000. Similar phenomena, with potent
inhibitory effect on virus titer and much less effect on viral load, have been
reported in remdesivir treated rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 infection16.
An explanation for the phenomena might be that virus particles with RNA
containing the remdesivir-metabolized adenine analogue are defective for
infection, in addition to the known mechanism that remdesivir induces delayed
chain termination53.
In summary, we demonstrated that hESCs-derived airway and alveolar
organoids could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and be used for drug test, serving
as a pathophysiological model to complement cell lines and animals.

Methods
Maintenance of human ESCs
All experiments in the present study were performed on H9 human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs). hESCs were maintained in feeder-free culture
conditions in 6-well tissue culture dishes on Matrigel (BD Biosciences, 354277)
in mTeSR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies, 05850) at 37°C with 5% CO 2.
Cells were passaged with TrypLE (Gibco) at 1:6 to 1:8 split ratios every 4 days.
Generation of hESCs derived hAWO and hALO
hESCs derived hAWOs and hALOs were generated as previously
described with modifications1-3. H9 cells (~90% confluence) were cultured in
24-well tissue dishes for 3 days in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with
100ng/ml Activin A (R&D Systems, 338-AC-050) and 2µM CHIR99021 (Tocris,
4423-10MG), followed by 4 days with 200ng/ml Noggin (R&D Systems, 6057NG-100), 500ng/ml FGF4 (Peprotech, 100-31-1MG), 2µM CHIR99021 and
10µM SB431542 (Tocris, 1614-10MG) in Advanced DMEM/F12 (Life
Technologies, 12634010). After 7 days treatment with above-mentioned factors,
anterior foregut endodermal cells were embedded in a droplet of Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, 356237) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 20-25 min. After
matrigel solidification, cells were then fed with 20ng/ml human BMP4 (R&D
Systems, PRD314-10), 0.5µM all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, Sigma-Aldrich,
R2625), 3.5µM CHIR in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, 11320033) with 1%
Glutamax (Gibco, 35050061), 2% B27 supplement (Life Technologies,
17504044) basal medium from day 8 to day 14. For preconditioning toward lung
progenitor stem cell differentiation, NKX2-1+ VAFE-enriched cells were cultured
in the same basal medium supplemented with 3µM CHIR99021, 10ng/ml

(Sigma-Aldrich, D4902), 100 nM 8-Br-cAMP (Biolog Life Science Institute,
B007-500), 100 nM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Wako, 095-03413), 10 ng/ml
KGF, 1% B-27 supplement, 0.25% BSA (Sigma, A1470) and 0.1% ITS premix
(Corning, 354351). And human alveolar organoids (hALOs) medium was
prepared by supplementing 3µM CHIR99021 and 10µM SB431542 to the
human airway organoids medium. Organoids were transferred into new
Matrigel droplets every 4-7 days using mechanical digestion.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (MRC, TR1187) and
cDNA was converted from 1μg total RNA using the ReverTraAce Kit (TOYOBO,
34520B1). The qPCR reactions were done on Roche LightCycler® 96 PCR
system with the SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ Kit (TAKARA, RR420A). Gene
expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and compared to gene
expression levels in hESCs. Three or more biological replicates were performed
for each assay and data bars represent mean ± SD. Primers used in this study
are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
SARS-CoV-2 Infection, drug test, and virus titers determination
SARS-CoV-2 (WIV04)4 was propagated 7 times on Vero E6 cells in DMEM
(Gibico, C12430500BT) with 2% FBS (Gibico, 10099-141) at 37°C with 5% CO2.
The SARS-CoV-2 isolate was obtained and titrated by plaque assay on Vero
E6 cells. Human airway and alveolar organoids were harvested, sheared and
resuspended in Ham’s F12 medium (Gibco, 21127022) and infected with virus
at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. After 2 hours of SARS-CoV-2 virus
adsorption at 37°C in the incubator, cultures were washed twice with Ham’s F12
medium to remove unbound viruses. hAWOs and hALOs were re-embedded
into Matrigel (BD Biosciences, 356237) in 24-well tissue plates, and cultured in
500 μL corresponding organoid media, respectively. In drug testing experiments,
different drugs at concentration of 10µM were added to the culture 2h after virus
infection. Samples were harvested at indicated time points by collecting the

supernatant in the wells and the cells via resuspending the matrigel droplet
containing organoids into 500 μL Ham’s F12 medium. The viral RNA in the
supernatants was extracted by Magnetic Beads Virus RNA Extraction Kit
(Shanghai Finegene Biotech, FG438). The intracellular RNA was extracted with
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596026). The viral RNA was quantified by realtime qPCR with Taqman probe targeting the RBD region of S gene. Viral titers
(TCID50 equivalants per mL) were determined by plaque assay on Vero E6
cells.
RNA-seq sequencing and data analysis
Total RNA in the cells was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, 15596026)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and 1ug RNA was used to reverse
transcribed into cDNA using Oligo (dT). Fragmented RNA (average length
approximately 200 bp) was subjected to first strand and second strand cDNA
synthesis followed by adaptor ligation and enrichment with a low-cycle
according to the instructions of NEBNext" UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for
Illumina (NEB, USA). The purified library products were evaluated using the
Agilent 2200 TapeStation and Qubit"2.0 (Life Technologies, USA).
Reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg38 with bowtie25,
and RSEM6 was used to quantify the reads mapped to each gene. Gene
expression was normalized by EDASEQ7. Differentially expressed genes were
obtained using DESeq2 (version 1.10.1)8, a cutoff of Q-value < 0.05 and log2
(fold-change) > 1 was used for identify differentially expressed genes. All
differentially expressed mRNAs were selected for GO analyses clusterProfiler9.
Other analysis was performed using glbase10. The RNA-seq supporting this
study is available at GEO under GSE155717. Data are accessible with a
reviewer token: “mbcxaucmpbwttup”.
Immunofluorescence Staining
For immunofluorescence staining, samples were transferred into 1.5ml
tubes and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C or 2h at RT.

Following fixation, paraformaldehyde was removed the organoids were rinsed
three times with PBS, then the samples were overlaid with O.C.T compound
and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were cryosectioned into 6μm
sections, washed with PBS three times and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X100 (Sigma, T9284)/PBS for 20 min at RT, rinsed again with PBS and then
blocked with 5%BSA at RT for 1 hour. The samples were incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C, and then stained with secondary antibodies at RT
for 40min. Nuclear counterstained with DAPI (Sigma, D9542) for 3 min, then
covered with glass microscope slides and imaged with the Nikon A1 confocal
microscope. NIS-Elements software was used to render Z-stack threedimensional images. The primary and secondary antibodies used in this study
are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Organoids were collected and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 24h, washed
with 0.1M Phosphate buffer (19ml 0.2M NaH2PO4, 81ml 0.2 M Na2HPO4) for 3
times, and further fixed with 1% Osimium tetraoxide for 2h at room temperature.
The fixed organoids were then washed with phosphate buffer and dehydrated
with 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100% alcohol sequentially.
After a step of infiltration with different mixtures of acetone-epon (2:1, 1:1,
vol/vol), the samples were embedded in pure Epon. Polymerization was
performed by incubation at 60°C for 48h. Ultra-thin sections (80-100 nm) were
cut on Ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC7), put on grids and stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate. After wash and drying, images were acquired by the
digital camera on TEM (FEI, Tecnai G2 20 TWIN, 200kv), with identical
magnificence.
