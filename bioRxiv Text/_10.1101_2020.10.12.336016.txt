Abstract

30

The human membrane protein Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) acts as the main receptor for host

31

cells invasion of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The viral surface glycoprotein Spike binds to hACE2,

32

which triggers virus entry into cells. As of today, the role of hACE2 for virus fusion is not well understood.

33

Blocking the transition of Spike from its prefusion to post-fusion state might be a strategy to prevent or treat

34

COVID-19. Here we report a single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike

35

in presence of the human ACE2 ectodomain. The binding of purified hACE2 ectodomain to Spike induces the

36

disassembly of the trimeric form of Spike and a structural rearrangement of its S1 domain to form a stable,

37

monomeric complex with hACE2. This observed hACE2 dependent dissociation of the Spike trimer suggests

38

a mechanism for the therapeutic role of recombinant soluble hACE2 for treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction

42

(MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2017; Monto, 1984). The symptoms of coronavirus-related diseases can be mild

43

and mainly occur in respiratory tract. For example, roughly 15%-30% cases of the common cold are caused

44

by human coronaviruses (Mesel-Lemoine et al., 2012). A coronavirus infection sometimes can develop serious

45

illnesses, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and

46

also the current pandemic COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) (Tang et al., 2020). SARS-CoV is a beta-

47

coronavirus that caused a pandemic in 2002. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that is genetically similar to

48

the previous SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 causes the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 and has been spreading

49

globally since the first quarter of this year (Ciotti et al., 2020). The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from person

50

to person. In some cases, the illness is very serious, in particular for the elderly (Pascarella et al., 2020). As of

51

today, no specific antiviral drugs were approved for use against COVID-19 and vaccine development is still

52

at the phase of clinical testing.

53

Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a technique for structure determination of biomacromolecules,

54

which has been particularly successful for studying high molecular-weight proteins. Cryo-EM does not require

55

crystallization of the target protein. COVID-19 related protein structures have been widely investigated since

56

the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in this year, using cryo-EM single particle analysis (SPA). The protein nicknamed

57

Spike is with its 180kDa monomeric molecular weight the largest viral surface protein of SARS-CoV-2. It

58

consists of two domains S1 and S2 that are connected by a short linker. Spike forms stable trimers on the virus

59

surface that are attached to the virus membrane. This Spike trimer is the key molecule for host cells receptor

60

binding and invasion of the host cells. The cryo-EM structure of the entire Spike homotrimer was determined

61

recently, showing a mushroom sharped overall architecture (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020a). As also

62

for the SARS-CoV, the viral fusion bridge from SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell is formed by Spike and the

63

ectodomain of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is the virus receptor on the host

64

cell that triggers virus entry. In vitro studies have shown that the Spike receptor binding domains (RBDs) from

65

SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 can both bind to the ectodomain of hACE2 with comparable binding

66

affinities in low nanomolar levels (Lan et al., 2020a). However, the new SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a more potent

67

capacity of host cells adhesion, as well as a larger virus-entry efficiency than other beta-coronaviruses (Shang

68

et al., 2020).

69

The membrane-attached hACE2 is known to be the key molecule for the infection by several viruses, including

70

SARS-CoV, Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and SARS-CoV-2. The infection process primarily

71

involves virus adhesion and fusion (Bao et al., 2020; Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Kuba et al., 2005; Sia et al.,

72

2020). Interestingly, hACE2 may not only serve as a drug target to prevent SARS-Co-2 infection, but hACE2

73

itself may also be considered as a potential therapeutic drug candidate for the usage against COVID-19 or

74

other beta-coronavirus related diseases. The clinical-grade soluble form of hACE2 has been reported to be a

75

potential novel therapeutic approach for reducing the infection of SARS-CoV-2 (Monteil et al., 2020) by

Coronavirus is a family of single-stranded RNA viruses, many of which can infect animals and humans

preventing the viral Spike from interacting with other hACE2 present on human cells. Recently, researchers

77

have also characterized the entire architecture of the inactivated authentic virions from SARS-CoV-2 using

78

cryo-electron tomography, observing that post-fusion S2 trimers are distributed on the surface of SARS-CoV-

79

2 virions (Ke et al., 2020; Turonova et al., 2017). The exact role of hACE2 so far is not yet fully understood

80

in terms of its interaction with full-length Spike protein.

81

In this study, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) study of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in

82

complex with hACE2. Our analysis reveals a monomeric complex of Spike S1 domain with hACE2, requiring

83

a large structural rearrangement in S1 compared to its isolated structure. Our data show that hACE2 binding

84

induces a conformational change in Spike, leading to Spike trimer dissociation.

85

Results

86

Spike and hACE2 production and its complex assembly.

87

The prefusion Spike 2P ectodomain was expressed in ExpiCHO cells and affinity purified via its twin Strep-

88

tag. SDS-PAGE analysis showed the presence of pure full-length Spike protein, consisting of both, the S1 and

89

S2 domains at the expected molecular weight of 180 kDa for the Spike monomer. (Suppl. Fig. S1a). The

90

purified Spike sample in PBS buffer was imaged as negatively stained preparations by transmission electron

91

microscopy (TEM). This revealed the expected trimeric shape, and 2D class averages of selected particles in

92

negative stain TEM images showed the typical, mushroom-shaped particles (Suppl. Fig. S2a.c), in accordance

93

with the expected structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the pre-fusion state.

94

Human ACE2 ectodomain was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified via a poly-histidine immobilized metal

95

affinity chromatography (IMAC) with a Fastback Ni2+ column, followed by another anion exchange column

96

(Suppl. Fig. S1b). For details, see Methods.

97

Purified Spike protein was mixed with excess hACE2 (molar ratio Spike:hACE2 of 1:5) and incubated for 12

98

hours at 4º C. Samples were prepared by negative staining and imaged by TEM. Unexpectedly, the observed

99

particle features were largely different from the typical Spike trimers in shape. A 2D analysis of 5’854 picked

100

negatively stained particles revealed in class averages that the majority of the particles were smaller in size

101

and asymmetrical, compared to the non-incubated Spike trimeric samples (Suppl. Fig. S2b,d). This suggests

102

that the prolonged incubation with hACE2 led to Spike trimer dissociation. A similar observation for SARS-

103

CoV-ACE2 complex was recently reported by Song et al (Song et al., 2018). Due to particle heterogeneity, we

104

decided to further purify the complex by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and indeed the SEC profile

105

showed three distinct peaks, called Peak1, Peak2 and Peak3 (Suppl. Fig. S1c,d).

106

By analyzing the 3 peaks by SDS gel and negative stain EM, we could clearly differentiate non-structured

107

aggregates of full-length Spike and hACE2 in Peak1, that did not allow further structural analysis (data not

108

shown), to the excess of unbound hACE2 in Peak3 (Suppl. Fig. S1c,d). The homogenous Peak2 that contained

109

full-length Spike in complex with hACE2, was further analyzed by cryo-EM.

111

Peak2 (Spike:hACE2 at molar ratio 1:5 after overnight incubation at 4°C) was vitrified and frozen grids were

112

loaded into a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TFS) Titan Krios cryo-EM instrument, operated at 300kV acceleration

113

voltage, and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS energy filter equipped with K2 direct electron detector

114

(Suppl. Fig. S3). 8’927 dose-fractionated images (i.e., movies) were recorded (Suppl. Fig. S4), from which

115

~1.7 million particles were extracted and subjected to image processing and 3D reconstruction. The final 3D

116

reconstruction from 72’446 particles at 5.1Å overall resolution showed a density map corresponding to a single,

117

monomeric Spike protein in complex with hACE2 (Fig. 1a). The map allowed docking with available

118

structures for S1 and hACE2 taken from the previously reported structures (Spike PDB ID 6VYB and Spike

119

RBD-ACE2 6M0J), revealing a structural rearrangement of the C-terminal domain (CTD) and N-terminal

120

domain (NTD) of S1 compared to a monomer from that Spike structure in the RBDup conformation. The

121

interaction between the S1 RBD and hACE2 is in agreement with several other reported structures of the RBD-

122

ACE2 complex (PDB ID 6M0J, 6VW1 or 6LZG). No additional density for S2 or a fragment of S2 was

123

detected in the reconstruction.

124

We tested a shorter incubation time by mixing Spike:hACE2 (molar ratio of 1:3) and let it incubate for 3 hours

125

at 4ºC, instead as overnight. No further SEC purification was performed. Subsequently, cryo-EM grids of this

126

sample were prepared and subjected to cryo-EM analysis (Suppl. Fig. S5). From 7’045 recorded movies,

127

615’348 particles were extracted and subjected to classification and 3D analysis. This revealed a small sub-set

128

of 47’901 particles corresponding to the prefusion Spike trimer, which allowed a 3D reconstruction at 4.2Å

129

overall resolution (no symmetry was applied), while some regions of the 3D map showed lower resolution,

130

presumably due to increased flexibility of these areas (Suppl. Fig. S6). A resolution-limited map at 9Å

131

resolution (Fig. 1b) allowed clear docking the models of Spike S1 and S2 and hACE2, which showed that the

132

complex is composed of Spike and hACE2 in a molar ratio of 3:3 (Spike:hACE2). Three hACE2 molecules

133

were observed to attach to the RBDs of Spike. All three RBDs were in the RBDup conformation and slightly

134

shifted away from the central trimer axis (Fig. 1b). A similar arrangement was also recently observed by

135

Kirchdoerfer et al. (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018), see also (Zhou et al., 2020).

136

Structural comparison of Spike-hACE2 complexes

137

A detailed analysis of both obtained structures shows significant structural rearrangements in different forms

138

of Spike-hACE2 complex. The resolution of our reconstructed EM maps was not sufficient for building atomic

139

models, but allowed clear placement of available atomic structures for Spike (PDB ID: 6VYB) and ACE2-

140

RBD (PDB ID: 6M0J) (Lan et al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2020). Comparison of the docked and fitted monomeric

141

S1-hACE2 model to that of the trimeric Spike-hACE2 (3:3) showed that a ~30º rotation of the C-terminal and

142

N-terminal sub-domains of Spike S1 were required to bring the Spike S1 protein into the monomeric

143

arrangement with hACE2. After such re-arrangement, the domains of hACE2 and the RBDs of the S1 protein

144

are in good agreement with a reported crystal structure (REF Lan et al.) (Fig. 2b).

145

When comparing the docked model of the monomeric S1-hACE2 complex with that of the trimeric Spike-

146

hACE2 complex (Fig. 2e), a considerable number of stearic clashes at the interface between Spike S1 (CTD)

147

and its neighboring region from the S2 polypeptide chain was obvious. The docked monomeric S1-hACE2

148

complex is further structurally incompatible with the observed trimeric arrangement.

149
150

Discussion

151

established. Nevertheless, one hACE2 molecule per Spike trimer is likely sufficient for binding and initializing

152

virus fusion with the host cell (Song et al., 2018). Even though the structure of a post-fusion S2 trimer has

153

recently been determined (Cai et al., 2020), it is not clear how membrane fusion during virus entry is

154

coordinated upon release of the S1-hACE2 caps (Fig. 3). We here report the cryo-EM structure of a stable

155

monomeric S1 Spike-hACE2 (1:1) complex. Even though size-wise it would have been detectable, our particle

156

classification did not reveal any particle class corresponding to an isolated S1 fragment in addition to the

157

observed S1 Spike-hACE2 (1:1) particles (Suppl. Fig. S3c, S4). Knowledge of the mechanism how the S1

158

fragment might be detached from the hACE2 receptors after virus entry would be relevant for understanding

159

its mechanism of infection and pathogenicity. The fact that we did not observe any free S1 fragments suggests

160

that the S1-hACE2 complex is rather stable, at least under our in vitro conditions.

161

Secondly, the S2 domain was not detected in the obtained structure of the Spike-hACE2 monomeric complex

162

(1:1), even though the SDS-PAGE analysis showed that S2 was present as full length in the sample (Suppl.

163

Fig. S1d). The S2 domain is expected to be connected to the S1 domain via a short loop between S1 and S2,

164

where a Furin protease cleavage site is expected (Belouzard et al., 2009; Haan et al., 2004; Hoffmann et al.,

165

2020). However, in the absence of stable trimers, the loop between S1 and S2 is likely very flexible, possibly

166

making the S2 domain undetectable by cryo-EM maps. Our cryo-EM analysis that didn’t show the S2 domain

167

in the averaged 3D reconstruction therefore likely failed to align the S2 domains either due to their flexibility,

168

or due to a denaturation of S2 during sample preparation.

169

An early study presented a potential dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a recombinant

170

soluble form of hACE2 (Monteil et al., 2020). The mechanism, how the soluble forms of hACE2 would be

171

able to neutralize the virus, is not known. One possible mechanism could be a direct competition between the

172

soluble hACE2 and the host cell hACE2 receptor, so that Spike proteins saturated with soluble hACE2 domains

173

render them unable to interact with host cell hACE2. Here, however, we report that the soluble forms of hACE2

174

induce the opening and disassembly of the trimeric Spike structure to create the stable Spike S1-hACE2

175

complex (Fig. 3). We propose a mechanism by which the formation of the Spike-hACE2 (3:3) complex induces

176

a high structural flexibility in the Spike trimer, allowing a conformational re-arrangement of the S1 C- and N-

177

terminal domains when interacting with hACE2. In consequence, the new S1-hACE2 complex is incompatible

178

with a trimeric arrangement, causing the dissociation of the trimeric complex (Fig. 3).

The stoichiometric ratio of the complex of Spike:hACE2 on the host cell upon virus entry is not well

This hypothesis is supported by the recent manuscript deposited in bioRxiv.org, which describes a similar

180

effect triggered by engineered DARPin molecules (Walser et al., 2020). Therefore, we suppose that the soluble

181

forms of hACE2 may not only block the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2, but also destroy the trimeric

182

Spike adaptors that are responsible for viral host membrane fusion. This mechanism suggests a novel

183

therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, by adding soluble hACE2 to dissociate the Spike trimer

184

of approaching viruses.

185

Methods

186

Protein production and purification

187

Spike protein: The gene for the prefusion ectodomain of the SARS-CoV2 Spike 2-P protein (the prefusion

188

stabilized construct (2P) that includes the putative furin cleavage site mutated; the plasmid was a generous gift

189

from Prof. Jason McLellan, University of Texas, Austin (Wrapp et al., 2020b)) was transiently transfected into

190

suspension-adapted ExpiCHO cells (Thermo Fisher) with PEI MAX (Polysciences) in ProCHO5 medium

191

(Lonza). After 1 h, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; AppliChem) was added to 2% (v/v). Incubation with agitation

192

was performed at 31°C and 4.5% CO2 for 5 days. The transparent supernatant was passed over a Strep-Tactin

193

column (IBA Lifesciences) and bound protein was eluted with PBS buffer + 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. The elute

194

was dialyzed against PBS buffer. The average protein yield for Spike 2P was 15 mg/L culture.

195

hACE2 protein: The gene for the secreted expression of hACE2-Fc-His was a generous gift from Prof. Jason

196

McLellan. The construct was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells (Thermo Fisher) with PEI MAX

197

(Polysciences) in EX-CELL 293 serum-free medium (Sigma), supplemented with 3.75 mM valproic acid.

198

Incubation with agitation was performed at 37°C and 4.5% CO2 for 8 days. The clear supernatant was purified

199

as follows via MabSelect Protein A resin (Cytiva), cleavage of the Fc-His tag by overnight treatment with 3C

200

protease, removal of the cleaved tag and 3C protease by NiNTA followed by an anion exchange column. The

201

purified protein was finally dialyzed into PBS buffer. The average yield for cleaved hACE2 was 13 mg/L

202

culture.

203

Negative stain TEM imaging

204

For all protein samples, 3ul of sample solution was applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated Cu-grids and

205

incubated for 1min. The free liquid was removed by blotting with filter paper and the grids were stained for

206

25s with 2% uranyl acetate solution. The negatively stained preparations were imaged with a Tecnai G2 Spirit

207

TEM, operated at 120kV at a magnification of 135kx. Image were recorded with a Veleta CCD camera (EMSIS

208

GmbH, Münster, Germany). The 2D analysis of the negative stain TEM images was performed with the

209

program cisTEM1.0 (Grant et al., 2018).

210

Cryo-EM imaging

211

Two different preparations of cryo-EM grids were performed. Purified Spike and hACE2 proteins were mixed

212

at the molar ratio of 1:5 and incubated for 12 hours at 4ºC. After that, the sample was subjected to size exclusion

chromatography (SEC) with a Superose 6 increase (10/300) column, and the fractions from Peak2 were pooled

214

and concentrated in 100 kDa centrifugal concentrators (Millipore).

215

Alternatively, purified Spike and hACE2 were mixed at the molar ratio of 1:3 (Spike:hACE2) an incubated

216

for 3 hours at 4ºc, without further purification via sec.

217

For both samples, the concentration was adjusted to 0.5mg/ml. Cryo-EM grids were prepared with a Vitrobot

218

Mark IV (Thermo Fisher), using a temperature of 4°C and 100% humidity. 4 μL of sample was applied onto

219

glow-discharged Quantifoil holey carbon grids (R2.0/2.0, 200 mesh, copper) and blotted for 2.0-3.0s. The grids

220

flash-frozen in a liquid ethane, cooled by liquid nitrogen.

221

For both samples, dose-fractionated images (i.e., movies) were recorded with a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher),

222

operated at 300kV, and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS energy filter (20 eV zero-loss energy filtration)

223

followed by a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. The data collection statistics is presented in Table 1.

224

Images were recorded in counting mode, at a magnification yielding a physical pixel size of 0.82Å at the

225

sample level. Images were automatically recorded with the SerialEM program (Mastronarde, 2003) at a

226

defocus range of -0.8 ~ -2.5um. All the movies were gain-normalized, aligned, dose weighted and averaged

227

with the program of MotionCor2 (Zheng et al., 2017) within FOCUS (Biyani et al., 2017), which also was

228

used to sort images and reject images of insufficient quality. The pre-processed micrographs were imported

229

into cryoSPARC V2 (Punjani et al., 2017).

230

Image processing

231

Data processing of the monomeric Spike-hACE2 complex was conducted in CryoSPARC V2 (Punjani et al.,

232

2017). The defocus and contrast transfer function (CTF) values were estimated on 8’927 micrographs and

233

7’927 good images were selected. 1’685’202 particles were auto-picked by blob picking, followed later by

234

another round of template picking. Particle clearing was performed by two rounds of 2D classifications,

235

resulting in a particles stack of 435’410 particles. 3D references were generated using ab-initio reconstruction

236

(CryoSPARC V2) and followed by two rounds of 3D hetero-refinements. The final particle set contained

237

72’446 particles, leading to a 3D map at 5.1Å overall resolution, as estimated by Fourier Shell Correlation

238

(FSC) using the 0.143 cutoff criterion.

239

For the trimeric Spike-hACE2 complex, image processing was performed similarly. The final reconstruction

240

produced a 3D map at 4.2Å overall resolution.

a. The 3D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and human ACE2 (mixed at a molar ratio 1:5)
incubated for 12hrs and further purified by SEC shows a structure corresponding to monomeric
Spike S1 protein in complex with hACE2. No density for S2 is observed. The N- and C-terminal
domains of S1 had to be re-arranged to fit into the map. Left: Side-view, center: 90º rotated view.
The structure is colored as follows: hACE2 ectodomain green, Spike S1-RBD yellow, Spike S1-CTD
slate blue, Spike S1-NTD salmon. Right: The bottom image shows a representative 2D class average
of the S1-hACE2 complex. The upper cartoon is its interpretation. b. 3D reconstruction of Spike and
hACE2 (ratio 1:3) incubated for 3 hours shows a trimeric map allowing docking of three hACE2
molecules and three S1 and three S2 molecules, all forming a trimeric complex. The map is low-pass
filtered to 9Å resolution for better interpretation. The complex is arranged in a molar ratio of 3:3
(SpikeS1-S2:hACE2). The image on the left indicates the host cell membrane as a cartoon. Center:
90º rotated view. Right: The bottom image shows a representative 2D class average of Spike-hACE2
(3:3) complex, here shown from the top as in the central panel. The upper cartoon is its
interpretation (here shown from the side). Scale bar in class averages: 2 nm.

Figure 3 Proposed models for Spike-hACE2 complex formation and structural rearrangement. The
upper row shows a possible pathway leading to a conformational change of the trimeric SARS-CoV2
Spike. In this model, one hACE2 molecule binds to one Spike S1 monomer and induces the
conformational changes in the trimeric Spike. Subsequently, a post-fusion S2 trimer is formed. The
lower row shows a novel proposed pathway leading to Spike trimer disassembly by hACE2. In
presence of a high concentration of hACE2 molecules, a Spike-hACE2 (3:3) complex is formed.
Structural clashes between the three Spike-hACE2 elements lead to their dissociation. This induces
the formation of monomeric Spike-hACE2 complexes.
