Summary
This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to
understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. This analysis will
provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a
future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in
the viral genome.
Abstract
Novel coronavirus has wrecked medical and health care facilities claiming ~5% death tolls
globally. All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines
largely remained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this
virus. In the present study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which
indicated that bat-SARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus.
The protein sequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was
higher as compared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous
mutations in the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of
different clades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino
acid changes. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in
the coding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The
non-synonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be
distributed over different hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important diamino acid change RG to KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting
features of the novel coronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other
human infecting viruses which may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and
simultaneously the reason behind failure of the antiviral therapies.
Keywords
bat-hCoV, coronavirus, pangolin-hCoV, phylogeny, SARS, synonymous and non-synonymous

Introduction
Current and last two decades saw emergence of zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) crossing the
species barrier ultimately infecting human species resulting in pandemics such as severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Drosten et al.,
2003; Zaki et al., 2012). An apocalyptic threat is posed by a sempiternal pathogen ruining the
health and the economies on global scale. A severe pneumonia outbreak starting in December,
2019 in the Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China was caused by novel CoV referred as “2019
novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV” (Huang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). CoVs are RNA
viruses with wide host pathogenesis in mammals including humans, pangolins and birds.
Genetically the CoVs were categorised into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus,
Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Li, 2016). The alpha and beta
CoVs infect mammals whereas the gamma and delta CoVs infect birds (Tang et al., 2015).
Primary symptoms associated with CoV infection include respiratory, hepatic, enteric and
neurological diseases. Previous investigation showed that there are 6 type of CoVs (hCoVNL63, hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) which can
infect the human species. HCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E belongs to alphaCoV genus while rest
belongs to betaCoV genus. (Tang et al., 2015). The betaCoVs appears to be prima-facie genre
of CoVs which will peril universal human civilization in upcoming decades. Recently, the
2019-nCoV outbreak spread from China to the intercontinental arena and already infected 0.3
million people globally claiming ~13000 (~4.3%) deaths till 21st March 2020
(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). China and Italy were the epicentres
until now and chances for more calamitous centres cannot be ruled out in near future. Genome
sequence analysis of SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV confirmed its presence in betaCoVs family
and divergence from the other two viruses (Zhu et al., 2020). The 2019-nCoV is a positivestrand RNA viruses with ~29 Kb genome size, 125 nm in diameter and 6 to 11 open reading
frames (ORFs) (Song et al., 2019). Viral genome encodes for 4 major structural proteins
namely envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M) and 3–5 nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The
genome starts with short untranslated regions (5’ UTR) followed by genes 5′-replicase (rep
gene), S, E, M, N and 3’ UTR (Song et al., 2019). Two-third of the genome is represented by
the rep gene at 5’ end which encodes for non-structural protein (Nsp). Spike protein is
responsible for receptor binding and corresponding viral entry into the host and hence
important target for future drugs to restrict the viral titre (Du et al., 2009, 2017). Viral assembly

relies primarily on M and E proteins and RNA synthesis is achieved by action of N protein
(Song et al., 2019).
To mitigate the severity of 2019-nCoV, researchers around the world are trying to develop
antibodies and vaccine against this deadly virus. The problem with the delay in antiviral
medication is superficial understanding of the virus. A dire need is to unravel the mutations in
the viral genome and concomitant amino acid changes occurring presumably due to varying
geographical location or upon interaction with the diverse human immune system. Various
reports compared the SARS, MERS, bat and pangolin coronaviruses and paved way for
significant findings, still leaving a lacunae in terms of the variations in the hCoV genomes and
comparison with the previous available viruses resources. The present study deals with the
mutations in the hCoV genomes and resulting change in amino acids.
Results and Discussion
Comparative genomic analyses of human novel coronavirus with other coronaviruses
Genomic features may provide an important clue about the relatedness and evolution of the
organism. In order to get an insight into the similitude and dissimilitude between human novel
coronavirus (hCoV) and other coronaviruses, the genome sequence of human novel
coronavirus (hCoV) were compared with bat coronavirus (GU190215.1) (Drexler et al., 2010),
severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus strain BtKY72 (KY352407.1) (Tao and
Tong, 2019), bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 (MG772933.1) (Hu et al.,
2018), hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019|EPI ISL 410721 (pangolin-hCoV) and hCoV19/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013|EPI ISL (bat-hCoV) which revealed approximately 81%, 81%,
89%, 90% and 96% similarity, respectively (Table 1).
To further assess the relationship between hCoV and other coronaviruses, alignment and
phylogenetic analysis was carried out. Alignment of hCoV with above mentioned viruses
showed that several nucleotide sites were unique in hCoV sequences when compared to other
coronaviruses (Table S1). Among these sites, C:T (hCoV :other coronavirus) is the most
prevalent substitution followed by T:C, G:A and A:G (Table S1). Many regions were absent in
bat and SARS coronavirus genome when compared to hCoV, bat-hCoV and pangolin-hCoV.
Among these regions, one of largest portion is of 391 nt (28026-28417) coding for ORF8
protein in hCoV putatively involved in interspecies transmission (Lau et al., 2015). Genomic
similarities and alignment indicate that several mutation events over the time is responsible for

emergence of human novel coronavirus. Further a phylogenetic analysis between these viruses
displayed that hCoVs are closer to bat/SARS-like virus (MG772933.1) and distant from SARS
coronavirus (KY352407.1) and bat coronavirus (GU190215.1) (Figure 1). These results
demonstrate that SARS coronavirus and bat coronavirus (GU190215.1) could be apparent
ancestor of other coronaviruses studied in the investigation.

Scrutiny of nucleotide and amino acid in coding region of the genome revealed that the hCoV
genome share 92.67% and 96.92% similarity at nucleotide level with pangolins and bat hCoV
genome, whereas the similarity level increased up to 97.82% and 98.67% at amino acid level
(Table 2). This indicates that most substitutions taking place were of synonymous type. Among
various protein coding genes Nsp4-10, Nsp12-14, Nsp16, M, E and ORF6 shared highly
conserve amino acid composition between bat-hCoV and hCoV with >99% similarity,
especially Nsp7-10, Nsp16, E and ORF6 share 100% amino acid similarity (Table 2). The
100% similarity in these regions across 591 hCoVs, bat and pangolin-hCoV mark them to be a
probable target region for future antibodies and vaccine therapy. Notably, Nsp2 and Nsp14
region in hCoVs were most diversified in terms of nucleotide when compared to pangolin and
bat-hCoV, whereas ORF10 and E regions were the least diverse (Table 2).
Phylogenetic analyses of human novel coronavirus
We investigated the phylogenetic analysis of 591 genomic sequences of hCoV obtained from
GISAID database using RAxML methods. The phylogram was majorly divided into 5 groups
based on their clade division. Bat and pangolin-hCoV were categorized in the group I and all
other hCoVs were categorized in group II to V (Figure 2). Group II comprises of the human
2019-nCoV mainly belonging to different province of China. However, few exceptions were
also from South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Chile, USA, India, Belgium, Spain, Germany and
France hCoVs. Group III mainly comprised of the hCoVs belonging to USA while Group IV
represented the hCoVs of mixed type population belonging to several countries distributed over
continents. Group V possess the hCoV from European countries along with few hCoVs of
America and one from Taiwan. To understand mystery underlying the clustering pattern of the
hCoVs, bat and pangolin-hCoV were used as a reference sequence to observe the nucleotide
substitution in hCoV members in different groups. Interestingly, hCoV members (Group II and
Group III) falling in proximity to Group I have less substitution in the genome sequences (Table
S2). The T:C (GroupV-hCoV:bat-hCoV and GroupV-hCoV:pangolin-hCoV) substitution were
frequent in Group V as compared to hCoV representing other groups (Table S2) . The genomic
signature of USA-hCoVs present in Group V is very different from USA-hCoVs of Group III.
This could be indicative of differences between direct and community transmission of the virus.
Member belonging to each subgroup has distinct genomic features in terms of nucleotide
substitution (Table S2).

Non-synonymous substitutions and associated amino acid changes
Genomic comparison of 591 hCoV sequences among the human as well as with pangolinhCoV and bat-hCoV revealed several sites possessing substitutions which clearly indicated the
mutation in viral genome either according to the geographical locations or upon interaction
with the human immune system. The nucleotide substitution in hCoV genomes were
predominantly of transition type with ~45% being C:T (Figure 3A). A detailed investigation of
the nucleotide substitution in the coding region of hCoVs genome with perspective of encoded
amino acids revealed 43 synonymous and 57 non-synonymous substitutions (Table S3). The
proteins Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp7-10, Nsp14-16, ORF4, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 mainly
possessed synonymous substitutions and hence were mostly devoid of amino acid changes
(Figure 3B).

The 57 amino acid changes were distributed over 12 regions in the ~30kb genome. The number
of amino acids substitutions varied between different regions such as 7 in Nsp2, 10 in Nsp3, 5
in Nsp4, 3 in Nsp6, 1 in Nsp12, 4 in Nsp13, 11 in Spike, 3 in ORF3a, 2 in ORF5, 1 in ORF6,
2 in ORF8 and 8 in ORF9 (Figure 4). Intriguingly, various important non-synonymous
mutations were observed majorly in European and US continent while the mutations were
mostly synonymous in Asian continent. These interesting observations can be used to infer the
reason behind larger infectivity and pathogenicity in these regions (Table S3). Further two type
of amino acid change viz., conservative and radial replacements were intensively studied with
respect to previous reports stating the effect of such changes on the enzymatic activities.
Mutations were most prevalent in the spike region followed by Nsp2, Nsp3 and ORF9 (N)
(Table S3). Spike region determines the specific binding to host receptor and initiation of viral
replication. This region is reported to be the most potent and indispensable for viral attachment
and entry into host system. The RRAR amino acids found only in the human CoVs spike
region has proved to be essential for binding to host receptor (Walls et al., 2020). We observed
similar region in the hCoV genomes studied (23713-23724 region in nucleotide alignment),
although there was mutation in two hCoV-England nucleotide sequences (CTCCGCGGCGGG
in place of CTCCTCGGCGGG) but the resulting amino acid remained same in all hCoV
genomes. These findings corroborate the essentiality of RRAR sequence for viral infection to
host system. We found different type of mutation in hCoV spike protein at different places such
as leucine to valine (L8V), glutamine to histidine (Q675H and also found in ORF3a:Q57H),
glutamine to lysine (Q239K) and aspartate to glycine (D614G and also found in ORF5, D3G)
might have potential role to augment viral infection (Table S3). Previous investigations showed
mutations such as leucine to valine change in retroviral envelope protein, glutamine to lysine
in influenza virus, glutamine to histidine and aspartate to glycine in H1N1 had a severe impact
in virus entry, replication and cross infectivity to other species (Côté et al., 2012; Glinsky,
2010; Yamada et al., 2010).

Figure 4. The genomic landscape of the hCoV genome representing amino acid changes.
The non-synonymous mutations resulting into 57 amino acid changes in respective proteins are
marked. The numerals on the arrow represent the position corresponding to amino acid change.
Additionally, mutations were present in structural proteins such as, glycine to valine mutation
in ORF3a (G196V and G251V). Similar amino acid change imparts resistance against inhibitor
drug saquinavir in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This might provide an
explanation why drugs used for treating HIV became a failure in case of hCoV infection (Hong
et al., 1997). Notably, in ORF9 region the nucleotide sequence GGG changed to AAC in
European and American continent resulting in a change of amino acid from RG to KR
(AGGGGA coding for RG changed to AAACGA coding for KR, 28993-28995 in nucleotide
alignment).
Furthermore, several amino acid changes were also observed in the non-structural proteins
(Nsp) of the hCoVs which may affect the virulence and titer. Threonine to isoleucine
substitution was observed in different Nsp proteins (Nsp2:T85I, Nsp3:T127I and T1030I and
Nsp4:T295I) mainly in European and US samples. Earlier reports established that threonine to
isoleucine substitution increased viral infectivity of Ebola virus and resistance to ganciclovir

in human cytomegalovirus (Kurosaki et al., 2018; Wolf et al., 1995). Importantly, alanine to
valine substitution in non-structural protein, NS2A in Zika virus affects viral RNA synthesis
and results in vivo viral attenuation (Marquez-Jurado et al., 2018). This mutated virus also
induce a comprehensive protection against lethal challenge proposed by the wild type Zika
virus. Falling in similar lines alanine to valine substitutions in non-structural proteins (Nsp3,
A1187V, Nsp4, A457V and Nsp6, A46V) could reduce viral lethality of hCoVs (Table S3).
These mutations might pave way towards identification of less lethal strains and help to raise
immunity to counteract the noxious strains. An isoleucine to valine mutation (Nsp2, I559V and
Nsp3, I797V) and methionine to isoleucine (Nsp4, M33I) were observed in hCoVs. Change of
isoleucine to valine in polymerase subunit PB2 of influenza virus resulted in critically enhanced
activity of reconstituted polymerase complex (Rolling et al., 2009) and M to I substitution in
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase imparted resistance to nucleoside analog 2′,3′-dideoxy3′thiacytidine (3TC) (Julias et al., 2004). Interestingly, presence of a non-synonymous
substitution in RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RDRP) region in majority of European
hCoV samples resulted in change of amino acid from proline to leucine (P314L). It will be
quite interesting to validate the effect of this substitution on RDRP activity as one of the
previous study established that similar change of proline-to-leucine substitution (P236L) of
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, imparts resistance against a highly specific inhibitor
bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) (Fan et al., 1995). These examples clearly show that amino
acid changes may significantly affect the functional competency of polymerase and the
associated subunits.
In conclusion, present study enlightens about several types of mutation such as deletion,
insertion and substitutions present in 2019-nCoV samples. These mutations may vary at
different geographical distribution or interaction with different host systems. Few mutations
also resulted in change of amino acid which may provide an explanation for failure of
previously employed antiviral therapies. This research will better equip the researchers to
utilize the mutated amino acid information for drug targets in particular geography and less
cases of failure. Beside the substitution resulting into transformation to a more virulent strain
there are number of highly conserved regions in the hCoV genome which can be used as target
for inhibitory drugs and vaccine development for a large repertoire of strains. Finally, we
believe that our data provide useful information pertaining the changes in genomic and
proteomic features which could serve as a guide to design the future antiviral therapies and
diagnostics.

Star Methods
To analyse the phylogenetic relationship between different coronaviruses, 591 genomes were
downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Database (GISAID)
(https://www.gisaid.org/). The hCoV is an RNA virus and the deposited sequences are in DNA
format. To prevent anomaly in the data represented, complete genomes and only high coverage
datasets were utilized. The genomic sequences were aligned using MUSCLE program
(v3.8.31) (Edgar, 2004). The alignments were utilized to deduce various nucleotide
substitutions and maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstrap was constructed
by RAxML program (Stamatakis, 2014). The alignment and tree were visualized using Jalview
2.11.0 (Waterhouse et al., 2009) and iTOL respectively (Letunic and Peer, 2007). Different
substitutions and resulting amino acid changes were analyzed between human, bat, pangolin
and SARS coronavirus genomes. To deduce a mutation or amino acid change only those
confirmed in three individual genomes were considered (replicates for biological significance).
