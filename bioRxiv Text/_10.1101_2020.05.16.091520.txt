Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus capable of rapid transmission and causing severe
clinical symptoms; much of which has unknown biological etiology. It has prompted researchers
to rapidly mobilize their efforts towards identifying and developing anti-viral therapeutics and
vaccines. Discovering and understanding the virus’ pathways of infection, host-protein
interactions, and cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the design of new therapeutics to treat
COVID-19. While it is known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as
clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including inhibiting autophagy,
there are also dose-limiting toxicities in patients that make clearly establishing their potential
mechanisms-of-action problematic. Therefore, we evaluated a range of other autophagy
modulators to identify an alternative autophagy-based drug repurposing opportunity. In this
work, we found that 6 of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in
Vero-E6 cells with EC50 values ranging from 2.0 to 13 µM and selectivity indices ranging from
1.5 to >10-fold. Immunofluorescence staining for LC3B and LysoTracker dye staining assays in
several cell lines indicated their potency and efficacy for inhibiting autophagy correlated with the
measurements in the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. Our data suggest that autophagy
pathways could be targeted to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and become an important
component of drug combination therapies to improve the treatment outcomes for COVID-19.

Introduction
The COVID-19 global viral pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 began in late 2019 originating
from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1). SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family
of positive single-stranded RNA viruses. As of May 14, 2020, there have been over 4,405,000
infections worldwide and 300,000 deaths (2). While not the deadliest virus in the past century, it
is highly infectious (estimated R0 = 5.7) (3). The absolute number of infections and mortality will
not be known for several years (4) .
SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans produces a disease called coronavirus disease of 2019,
COVID-19 (5) (6). It is related to the 2003 coronavirus outbreak of SARS-CoV, the original
SARS. Fortunately, the virus was well-contained and no cases have been reported since 2004.
COVID-19 symptoms range from mild fever, tiredness, and dry cough, to acute respiratory
distress syndrome, stroke due to blood clots, cardiac and renal damage, and death (7). While
some clinical symptoms are common among patients with severe disease, its epidemiology and
the mechanisms of disease pathology are still unclear and need to be further studied.
The research and clinical responses have been unprecedented, and much of the effort is focused
on identifying therapeutics, including drug repurposing efforts with the experimental anti-Ebola
virus drug remdesivir (8, 9) and developing vaccines. Chloroquine (CQ), an older FDA-approved
anti-malarial drug, along with its better tolerated analog hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been
reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and show some promise in patients (10-12). In
mice, CQ and HCQ display antiviral effects against human coronavirus strain OC43 (13), human
enterovirus EV71 (14), Zika virus (15), and human influenza virus H5N1 (16). CQ was not
effective in reducing viral titers in the lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV, although it did

induce a reduction in markers of inflammation (17). The efficacy of CQ in animal models of
SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported. CQ and HCQ have been reported to elicit antiviral
activity via a number of mechanisms of action including modulation of autophagy.
Autophagy maintains cellular organelle homeostasis by clearing cellular waste and providing the
cell with a supply of energy when nutrients are scarce (18). Autophagy also functions as the first
line of defense to cleanse the cell of invading pathogens such as viruses, and plays an important
role in mediating the innate immune response (19). The activation of autophagy engulfs virions
inside host cells via the formation of autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with acidic
lysosomes to form autolysosomes through a pH-dependent mechanism. The autolysosomal
contents are then degraded by the lysosomal hydrolases. This entire autophagy cycle is called
autophagic flux and plays a key role in processing invading viruses. In Drosophila, for example,
NF-kB activation during Zika virus infection leads to elevated levels of Drosophila stimulator of
interferon genes and increased autophagy in the brain (20). Unfortunately, some viruses have
developed mechanisms to escape autophagy (21), avoid the immune response (22), and hijack
the autophagosomes for viral replication (23, 24).
Viral hijacking of the endocytic pathway for viral entry and utilization of the autophagic
machinery for their replication has been reported (24, 25). However, some conflicting data has
demonstrated that SARS-CoV replication is independent of autophagic mechanisms (26).
Viruses have also evolved strategies for escaping degradation through the inhibition of
autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagic flux (27, 28). Nonetheless, given that
autophagy inhibitors may act on multiple points within the viral life cycle, treating infection with
lysosomotropic compounds may be a viable strategy for suppressing viral attack, and explain the
potential therapeutic benefits of CQ and HCQ that have been reported in COVID-19 (29).

Autophagy inhibitors including CQ, HCQ, and others with related chemical structures are known
to prevent the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and blocks the later stages of autophagic
flux (30). CQ, in addition to its inhibitory effects on autophagy, has been reported to have broad
antiviral effects through several mechanisms of action. One in particular is the disruption of the
early steps in the viral life cycle including the release of the virus from the endosome when
endocytosis is used for viral entry (31, 32). Given the fact that the basic properties of CQ and
similar molecules lead to their accumulation in acidic compartments and raise their pH, viruses
that depend on low acidic pH for entry, uncoating, and replication can no longer execute these
functions. While they exert multiple cellular effects, their characterized inhibition of autophagic
flux and elevation of vesicular pH is consistent with the antiviral efficacy in vitro (33).
Accordingly, a recent SARS-CoV-2 study by Liu et al. has proposed that these drugs may act by
preventing the progression of the virions through the endocytic pathway, thereby inhibiting
release of the viral genome (12).
In this study, we have identified 6 known autophagy inhibitors that reduce the cytopathic effect
(CPE) of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells. We have further investigated the effects of the
compounds on markers of autophagy in several different cell lines using LC3B autophagic
marker immunostaining as well as LysoTracker dye staining (34). These assays revealed
comparable potency of the compounds for inhibiting autophagy compared to inhibition of the
virally-induced cytopathic effect. Altogether, we demonstrate that the autophagy inhibitors
effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, indicating autophagy as a viable target
pathway for COVID-19 drug discovery.

We employed a cell-based assay using Vero-E6 host cells that measures the CPE of SARS-CoV2 (Fig. 1).

The CPE reduction assay is a widely-employed assay format to screen for antiviral agents, and it
can be scaled for high-throughput screening (35, 36). In this assay, host cell death is a

consequence of the viral infection and cell viability is a surrogate readout for viral infection that
can be measured with a range of cell viability assays. All compounds were tested in doseresponse, and ‘hit’ antiviral compounds are those that protect the host cells from viral CPE. To
increase infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the CPE assay, we used a clone of Vero-E6 that had
previously been selected for high ACE2 expression (35). The cell viability measurements were
normalized to cells not infected with the virus (100% activity) and untreated cells infected with
virus (0% activity; virus completely kills cells). As a counter-assay, all compounds were tested
against cells not exposed to virus, in order to identify compounds that exerted cytotoxicity
against Vero E6 cells.
Given that autophagy inhibitors including HCQ have shown efficacy against many different
types of viruses (31) including SARS-CoV-2 in CPE assays (12), we assessed the protective
effect of a group of autophagy inhibitors including ROC-325, clomipramine, hycanthone,
verteporfin, CQ, HCQ, and mefloquine in 384-well plates (Fig. 2).

µM down to 1.14 nM. Red dashed line indicates EC50 or CC50 for CPE and Toxicity assays,
respectively. Duplicate values shown for each concentration. Curves generated using non-linear
regression.

While CQ was the most potent compound (discussed below), ROC-325 was the second most
potent with an EC50 of 3.28 µM and less than 20% cytotoxicity at 30.0 µM (Fig. 2A), indicating
a greater than 10-fold selectivity index (SI) between antiviral and cytotoxic concentrations.
Clomipramine exhibited an EC50 of 13.6 µM while inducing less than 20% cytotoxicity at 30.0
µM (Fig. 2B). Hycanthone demonstrated an EC50 of 5.79 µM and a cytotoxicity CC50 of 14.0 µM
(Fig. 2C). Hycanthone’s concentration-response was bell-shaped due to reduction of cell
viability by almost 100% at 30 µM. Verteporfin was inactive in the screen against SARS-CoV-2
CPE and reduced cell viability by approximately 22% at 30.0 µM (Fig. 2D).
The anti-malarial drugs CQ and HCQ inhibited viral CPE with an EC50 of 2.01 µM and 4.47 µM,
respectively, with no associated cell toxicity (Fig. 3A,B). HCQ was the third most potent
compound tested in the CPE. Mefloquine, a related anti-malarial compound, exhibited an EC50 of
3.85 µM with an associated cell toxicity CC50 of 8.78 µM and 100% cytotoxicity at 15.0 to 30.0
µM (Fig. 3C). For comparison, remdesivir, the nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase for a number of viruses and top clinical candidate for SARS-CoV-2 (8, 9, 37),
exhibited an EC50 of 7.04 µM with no apparent cytotoxicity (Fig. 3D). The EC50 values for all of
the autophagy inhibitor compounds are summarized in Table 1.

Autophagy inhibitors increase LC3B and LysoTracker dye staining
Because 6 out of the 7 autophagy inhibitors (ROC-325, clomipramine, hycanthone, CQ, HCQ,
and mefloquine) showed activity in the CPE assay, we sought to confirm their effect on
autophagy in Vero-E6, HeLa, HEK293T, and Huh-7.5 cells using immunostaining for autophagy
marker LC3B, as well as LysoTracker dye staining. LC3B immunostaining directly visualizes
autophagosomes, while LysoTracker Dye stains acidic organelles. These assays allow for the
visualization of autophagosome accumulation and acidic organelles such as endosomes and
lysosomes, respectively. Compounds that block autophagic flux are expected to increase LC3B
and LysoTracker staining measurements (34).

To carry out this assay, cells were allowed to adhere overnight, and were then treated with
compounds at concentrations ranging from 50 µM – 0.02 µM for approximately 16 h. In VeroE6 cells, increases in intracellular LC3B spot, also called spots, were concentration-dependent
for all of the compounds except for mefloquine (Fig. 4A,B). CQ, HCQ, and hycanthone
treatment produced maximal spot counts, while ROC-325 and clomipramine produced a
submaximal increase of 80% and 40%, respectively. Mefloquine was ineffective at inducing
LC3B spot accumulation. Increases in LC3B spots indicate an accumulation of LC3B that is
localized to the autophagosome when autophagic flux is blocked. The potent effect of CQ and
HCQ on LC3B spot counts was apparent in all cell lines tested (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1,3,5). Based on
nuclei counts, CQ, HCQ, clomipramine, and ROC-325 were not cytotoxic at the highest
concentrations (50 µM for all except for ROC-325 at 25 µM). In line with the drug toxicity data
from the CPE assay, mefloquine was completely toxic at 50 µM, while hycanthone killed
approximately 60% of cells at 50 µM. The compound CC50 data was consistent between the two
assays.

In Vero-E6 cells, after drug treatment large concentration-dependent increases of LysoTracker
relative spot intensity measurements were observed (Fig. 5A,B). With the exception of HCQ, the
maximum efficacy was higher than the CQ positive control (100%) that was used to normalize
the responses. Interestingly, clomipramine and mefloquine, which did not induce large increases
in Vero-E6 LC3B spot counts, produced dramatic elevations in LysoTracker relative spot
intensity similar to ROC-325 and hycanthone (Fig. 5B). In further support of the CPE assay data,
mefloquine was toxic at the highest concentration.

In addition to Vero-E6 cells, we also examined the effects of these compounds in three human
cell lines and observed some differences between them (Fig. S1-6). For example, in Huh-7.5,
mefloquine increased LC3B spot counts even at low concentrations (Fig. S3), whereas in other
cell lines it was not a potent inducer of autophagosome accumulation. Clomipramine was
effective in increasing LC3B in all cell lines except for Vero-E6 (Fig. 4, Fig. S1,3,5). In contrast,
hycanthone and mefloquine produced the strongest effect on LysoTracker measurements in
Vero-E6 compared to the other three cell lines (Fig. 5, Fig. S2,4,6). Although there were some
interesting variations in compound effects among the cell lines tested, the average EC50 and CC50
values from the LC3B spot count measurements in all four cell lines corresponded well with the
data from the CPE assay, indicating that the effects of the compounds on markers related to
autophagy and protection from viral-induced cell death were well-correlated (Table 1).
We have illustrated our working hypothesis in Figure 6 as to one potential mechanism for the
reduction of viral infection and subsequent CPE. First, in a healthy cell there is normal

(Fig. 6B). In the case of an infected cell, potential endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 leads to the
release of viral RNA into the cell, whereas autophagic machinery may be hijacked to prevent

treatment in healthy cells causes a blockade of normal fusion processes and a buildup of
endosomes and autophagosomes. (C) In healthy cells, viral infection through endocytosis leads
to the release of viral RNA after endosome lysosome fusion. Similarly, autophagy of viral
particles may result in formation of viral autophagosomes but lysosome fusion would be blocked
by the virus (orange X). Dotted arrow indicates a possible, but unverified event of viral RNA
release from autophagosomes. (D) Autophagy inhibitors can block steps (red Xs) within the viral
life cycle including at the early steps of endocytosis, the fusion of endosomes with the lysosome,

Discussion
New anti-viral drug repurposing opportunities are necessary for pre-clinical and clinical
evaluation for treating COVID-19. In this work we have identified several autophagy inhibitors
that can protect against CPE of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells. ROC-325 (38-40) and
clomipramine (41, 42) display autophagy inhibitor activity that can completely prevent SARSCoV-2 CPE without any significant inherent cytotoxicity. Hycanthone, an FDA-approved
schistosomicide and oxidative metabolite of lucanthone (43-45), and mefloquine (46-48) both
showed moderate levels of activity against SARS-CoV-2 CPE, but did exhibit drug-induced cell
toxicity at the highest drug concentration tested (up to 30 µM) . The autophagy inhibitor
verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin derivative used in the clinic as a photosensitizer (49), did not
inhibit CPE of SARS-CoV-2, and was not tested in follow-up autophagy assays. To confirm
whether CPE protecting compounds interrupted cellular autophagy and lysosomal function, we
examined their effects on autophagy marker LC3B (50), along with late endosome and
lysosomes as visualized with LysoTracker dye. We found that the activities of autophagy

inhibition as measured by LC3B spot counts correlated well with inhibition of SARS-CoV-2
measured in the CPE assay for ROC-325, clomipramine, hycanthone, and mefloquine. To our
knowledge, this is the first report showing that ROC-325 and hycanthone are efficacious against
SARS-CoV-2.
The 72 h SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay measures the phenotypic consequence of viral infection and
replication in cells (51-53). SARS-CoV-2 can induce cell death (54-57) after 48 to 72 h of
infection, and thus cell viability is a surrogate measure of viral replication in vitro. However,
there are limitations to the CPE assay including its dependence on the host response and the fact
that it is an indirect measurement of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The phenotypic
outcome can also vary depending on culture conditions and viral multiplicity of infection (MOI),
number of virions that are added per cell during infection (58). The potencies of drug protection
against virally-induced cell death can be lower than in other assays that directly measure viral
load. Nevertheless, this study confirms that SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells results in
cell death similar to other reports, and that CPE can be suppressed by blocking autophagy with
small molecule inhibitors to the same extent as positive control remdesivir (59, 60). Recently, a
drug-repurposing screen of FDA-approved compounds, using a similar CPE assay with SARSCoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells, found clomipramine (IC50 5.93 µM; CC50 >30 µM) and mefloquine
(IC50 7.11 µM; CC50 >18.5 µM) to be active with low toxicity (61). The same study found HCQ
to be more active than CQ with an IC50 of 9.21 µM and 42.03 µM, respectively. Mefloquine was
also found to be active in another SARS-CoV-2 CPE screen using Caco-2 cells with an IC50 of
14.1 µM (62). In our study, the SI was calculated using the ratio of the EC50, the half-maximal
effective concentration, and the CC50, the half-maximal cytotoxic concentration. Between the

by CellTiter-Glo and nuclei counts, respectively. The SI is an important measure for future
preclinical development, as it provides insights into the potential clinical safety of a compound at
a cellular level. From this work, we show that CQ, HCQ, clomipramine, and ROC-325 were less
than 50% cytotoxic at all concentrations, whereas mefloquine and hycanthone were cytotoxic at
the highest concentrations with mefloquine being the most cytotoxic.
Evolution has endowed many viruses with the ability to escape autophagic degradation by using
the autophagosome membrane for the formation of viral double membrane vesicles (DMVs),
although the precise mechanism is still unclear. It has also been reported that some coronavirus
proteins such as open reading frame protein 8b (ORF-8b), directly contribute to cell death
following viral infection (63). Interestingly, ORF-8b causes the induction of autophagosome
formation accompanied by damaging effects on lysosomal function and autophagy flux. ORF-8b
also forms aggregates in cells that caused ER stress and lysosome malfunction, which could be
responsible for reduced clearance of viral particles by autophagic flux (63). The nonstructural
protein 6 (NSP-6) of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, significantly
increased the number of autophagosomes in host cells (28). The SARS-CoV accessory protein
ORF-3a has three transmembrane domains that insert into the lysosomal membrane causing
lysosome function dysregulation and necrotic cell death (27). Recently, Benvenuto and
colleagues analyzed 351 available SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences and discussed that the
mutations in NSP-6 may modify the virus’ activity for inducing autophagy, though experimental
data was not presented (21). It appears paradoxical that viral infection inhibits autophagic
clearance while autophagy inhibitors, also known to block autophagosome to lysosome fusion,
suppress viral infection. Our data, combined with the reported mechanism of action for CQ as an
antiviral, suggest that these autophagy inhibitors may interrupt the early steps in the viral life

cycle, namely the fusion of the viral endosomes with the lysosome, thereby reducing viral
replication and protecting cells from viral induced cell death. The effect of altering endosomal
pH among other mechanisms appears to make compounds like HCQ and CQ highly effective
against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses (64). However, more work is needed to elucidate the
exact mechanism of action for these autophagy inhibitors in relation to SARS-CoV-2 and the
impact at the different stages of the viral life cycle. Other host targets for viral inhibition include
the point of entry with clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the virus (65), p38 MAPK involved in
viral replication (66), post-translational processing of viral proteins in the Golgi apparatus (67),
and budding of the virus from the infected cell (68, 69).
ROC-325 was originally developed as an orally available inhibitor of autophagy designed to
incorporate the chemical motifs of HCQ and lucanthone, with the goal of both improved
autophagic inhibition and consequent single-agent anticancer activity (39, 45). ROC-325 is a
preclinical candidate with low in vitro and in vivo toxicity and strong anti-cancer properties (40,
70). Our study shows that it may also be a candidate for repositioning as a treatment for COVID19. Clomipramine, a centrally acting, FDA-approved, tricyclic antidepressant used for the
treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and
chronic pain (71, 72) may also be an interesting preclinical candidate with its existing regulatory
status easing a path towards use in the clinic, although the human Cmax does not cover the CPE
EC50. Because most of these compound EC50 values were higher than their human plasma
concentrations at the clinically efficacious doses, they likely will not be efficacious as single
agents for the treatment of COVID-19 (Table 2). Indeed, toxicity with CQ and HCQ has been
reported and caution has to be taken with its clinical application because of potential
cardiotoxicity (73). Furthermore, a large observational trial did not find a reduction in death of

patients taking HCQ, which suggests that large randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the
true benefit to patients with regard to decreased mortality rate and duration of hospitalization
(74). However, the sum of this work indicates that targeting steps of the viral life cycle in cells
with molecules similar to CQ, focusing on their anti-autophagic properties, could be a valid drug
discovery strategy for combating SARS-CoV-2. The compounds described here also have value
as research tools to better understand the interplay between host autophagy pathway and viral
live cycle.
Because such compounds target host cells to suppress SARS-CoV-2 CPE, they have potential to
be combined with other drugs that directly target viral proteins for treatment. This type of
combination therapy has certain advantages including synergistic activity from different
mechanisms of action and reducing the development of viral drug resistance due to the
involvement of a host cell target. Furthermore, individual drug concentrations can be lowered in
combination therapies to prevent the toxicity seen at higher doses when treating with a single
drug. Further tests of the drug combination therapy using SARS-CoV-2 animal models will be
needed to confirm the therapeutic usage of these compounds.

Materials and Methods
Study Design
Sample Size and Replicates:
For the CPE, inter-plate duplicates were used for each data point for quantitative HTS and curve
fitting. For CPE luminescence measurements, each well was read once. For the autophagy assay,
three intra-plate replicates were used in consecutive columns for quantitative HTS, high-content
analysis, and curve fitting. For the autophagy assay automated high-content imaging, each well

was imaged 6 times in equally spaced fields using a 40x objective. This allowed for the
collection of data from approximately 500 or more cells per well.

Data inclusion and outliers:
All data was included in the CPE assay. For the high-content imaging autophagy assays, efficacy
data points were excluded in the case where there was >80% cell death. For non-linear curve
fitting, data points were excluded when there was an experimental error that prevented proper
drug addition or staining.

Selection of endpoints:
CPE assay 72 h and autophagy assay 16-18 h endpoints were selected a priori based on previous
studies.

Research Objectives:
We aimed to contribute valuable pharmacological data towards the fight against COVID-19 by
screening autophagy inhibitor compounds in a viral cytopathic effect assay to determine their
potency and efficacy in preventing virally-induced cell death. We further aimed to validate these
autophagy inhibitors in a number of cell lines to understand whether the pharmacological effect
of autophagy inhibition corresponded with anti-viral effects. Autophagy inhibition is a known
anti-viral strategy effective in vitro, in vivo, and potentially in human patients. However, there is
a lack of clinically available autophagy inhibitors due to dose-limiting adverse side effects. After
screening, we identified a new preclinical compound ROC-325 is a potential target for further
development.

Units of investigation:
Traditional cell culture methods were used in high-throughput formats for CPE and autophagy
screening. Vero-E6 cells previously developed by collaborators were used for the CPE assay.
Vero-E6, HEK293T, and HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC, and Huh-7.5 cells were a gift
from the Tang Lab at FSU.

Experimental design:
The experiments put forth in this research article were controlled laboratory experiments devised
with the guidelines established for high-throughput screening. Cells were maintained in a healthy
state with proper cell culture techniques and treated using small volumes of compound dissolved
in DMSO. Luminescence readings were collected for the CPE assay and fluorescence images
were captured using automated high-content microscopy. Controls were assigned to specific
wells and compounds were distributed throughout the entire 384 well plates. For the autophagy
assays, compound dilutions were arranged vertically with the highest concentration in the middle
of the plate and the lowest concentrations on the edges. Each compound was in three consecutive
columns. Further details are provided in the Methods section. Measurements for the CPE assay
and fluorescence images were captured sequentially well by well. For the autophagy assay, a
horizontal serpentine imaging sequence was used.

Blinding:
For the luminescence readings, the simple data structure was processed according to the plate
layout annotation. For the autophagy assay, a custom high-content imaging protocol was
developed in Columbus Analyzer for each cell line based on the detection of signals from the

identifiers called NCGC values, and then the data was quantified and visualized in Excel and
Prism GraphPad. The compound NCGC numbers were then unmasked using the corresponding
compound names.

mL of trypsin is added for 1-2 minutes at room temperature and 10 mL of EMEM is added to
wash flask and create a single cell suspension. Cells are spun at 800 RPM for 5 minutes.
Supernatant was aspirated and cells resuspended in fresh media for seeding into flasks or multiwell plates.
Vero-E6 (grown in EMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin), HeLa CCL-2,
HEK293T and Huh-7.5 (grown in DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) were
cultured in T175 flasks and passaged at 95% confluency. Briefly, cells were washed once with
PBS and dissociated from the flask using TrypLE. Cells were counted prior to seeding.
Preparation of Assay Ready Plates
An 80 µL aliquot of each compound stock solution (10 mM in 100% DMSO) is transferred into
empty wells in columns 3 and 13 of an Echo® Qualified 384-Well Polypropylene Source
Microplate (Labcyte P-05525). Compounds are diluted 2-fold by transferring 40 µL of each
sample into 40 µL DMSO in the adjacent well (columns 4 and 14) and mixing. This process is
repeated to create 8 more 2-fold serially diluted samples in the wells of columns 5-12 and 6-22.
Using a Labcyte ECHO 550 (San Jose, CA) acoustic liquid handling system a 90 nL aliquot of
each diluted sample is dispensed into corresponding wells of a Corning 3764BC plate. An equal
volume of DMSO is added to control wells to maintain 0.3% DMSO final assay concentration in
all wells. These are referred to as Assay Ready Plates (ARPs) and are stored at -20°C.
Method for measuring antiviral effect of compounds
A CPE assay previously used to measure antiviral effects against SARS-CoV (35) was adapted
for performance in 384 well plates to measure CPE of SARS CoV-2 with the following
modifications. Cells harvested and suspended at 160,000 cells/ml in MEM/1% PSG/1% HEPES
supplemented 2% HI FBS were batch inoculated with SARS CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) at

M.O.I. of approximately 0.002 which resulted in approximately 5% cell viability 72 h post
infection. ARPs were brought to room temperature and 5µl of assay media was dispensed to all
wells. The plates were transported into the BSL-3 facility were a 25 μL aliquot of virus
inoculated cells (4000 Vero E6 cells/well) was added to each well in columns 3-24. The wells in
columns 23-24 contained virus infected cells only (no compound treatment). A 25 μL aliquot of
uninfected cells was added to columns 1-2 of each plate for the cell only (no virus) controls.
After incubating plates at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 h, 30 μL of Cell TiterGlo (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Following incubation at room temperature
for 10 minutes the plates were sealed with a clear cover and surface decontaminated and
luminescence was read using a Perkin Elmer Envision (Waltham, MA) plate reader to measure
cell viability. Raw data from each test well was normalized to the average signal of non-infected
cells (Avg. Cells; 100% inhibition) and virus infected cells only (Avg. Virus; 0% inhibition) to
calculate % inhibition of CPE using the following formula: % inhibition CPE = 100*(Test Cmpd
– Avg. Virus)/(Avg. Cells – Avg. Virus).
Method for measuring cytotoxic effect of compounds
Compound cytotoxicity was assessed in a BSL-2 counter screen as follows: Host cells in media
were added in 25 μl aliquots (4000 cells/well) to each well of assay ready plates prepared with
test compounds as above. Cells only (100% viability) and cells treated with hyamine at 100 µM
final concentration (0% viability) serve as the high and low signal controls, respectively, for
cytotoxic effect in the assay. DMSO was maintained at a constant concentration for all wells
(0.3%) as dictated by the dilution factor of stock test compound concentrations. After incubating
plates at 37°C/5% CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 h, plates were brought to room temperature and
30μl Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) was added to each well. Luminescence was read using a BMG

PHERAstar plate reader following incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes to measure
cell viability.
Autophagy assays
20 µL of cells were seeded into 384-well, black, clear-bottom, poly-d-lysine coated plates to
achieve 60% confluent wells. Plates were covered with metal lids and placed in a 37°C incubator
with 95% humidity and 5% CO2 overnight before compound treatment. 100 nL of compound per
well was dispensed using the Labcyte Echo 655. The compounds were added at 8 concentrations
with 1:3 dilutions starting at 50 µM down to 0.02 µM. ROC-325 was dispensed at the highest
working concentration of 25 µM due to a maximum solubility of 5 mM in DMSO.
For LysoTracker staining, 5 µL of a 5x 250 nM LysoTracker Deep Red (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) diluted in Live Cell Imaging Buffer (Invitrogen) was added to the plates mentioned above
and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 after which cells were fixed using 4% PFA (Electron
Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Media in
wells was then evacuated and cells were washed three times with PBS using the automated
Bluewasher plate washing system from Blue Cat Bio (Concord, MA). Plates were then sealed
and imaged on the IN Cell 2500 HS (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) automated high-content
imaging system. Images was uploaded to Columbus Analyzer and processed for high-content
analysis.
For LC3B immunostaining, media was evacuated on the Bluewasher and 100% ice-cold
methanol was added to wells for 10 minutes at -30°C. Plates were washed three times with PBS
and blocked with Cell Staining Buffer (BioLegend, San Diego, CA). Plates were then incubated
with rabbit-anti-LC3B (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA) antibodies in Cell Staining
Buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS and secondary

h. Plates were washed three times in PBS before adding 1:5000 Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen).
After a final three washes in PBS, plates were sealed and imaged on the IN Cell 2500 HS
automated high-content imaging system. Images was uploaded to Columbus Analyzer and
processed for high-content analysis. Image montages were prepared using Fiji (ImageJ, NIH).
Statistical analysis
CPE assay raw data from each test well was normalized to the average signal of non-infected
cells (Avg. Cells; 100% inhibition) and virus infected cells only (Avg. Virus; 0% inhibition) to
calculate % inhibition of CPE using the following formula: % inhibition CPE = 100*(Test Cmpd
- Avg Virus)/(Avg Cells – Avg Virus). EC50 values were obtained using non-linear regression.
High-content image analysis data was downloaded as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. DMSO
negative control (0% activity) (col. 1 and 24 for acoustic dispensing) and CQ positive control
(100% activity) (col. 2 for acoustic dispensing, 8 wells) was used to normalize each compound
concentrations’ response. The other 8 wells of column 2 contained 10 mM HCQ. EC50 values
were obtained using non-linear regression in Graphpad Prism 7.04. In some cases, the highest
concentration point was not included in curve-fit due to technical issues during experimental
execution, although the measured value was shown. When cell viability was below 20%, the
efficacy point was excluded altogether (i.e. mefloquine at 24 µM or 8 µM). Six fields per well
were imaged on the IN Cell 2500HS. LC3B and LysoTracker data was obtained using a single
well with hundreds of cells for each compound concentration from three intra-plate replicate
wells were imaged when acoustic dispensing was used for compound treatment. Cell counts were
also reported using nuclear object segmentation. GraphPad Prism 7.04v was used for visualizing
