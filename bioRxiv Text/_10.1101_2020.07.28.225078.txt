Abstract
The current genomics era is bringing an unprecedented growth in the amount of gene
expression data, only comparable to the exponential growth of sequences in databases
during the last decades. This data now allows the design of secondary analyses that take
advantage of this information to create new knowledge through specific computational
approaches. One of these feasible analyses is the evaluation of the expression level for a
gene through a series of different conditions or cell types. Based on this idea, we have
developed ASACO, Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression, which performs
expression profiles for a given gene along hundreds of normalized and heterogeneous

transcriptomics experiments and discover other genes that show either a similar or an
inverse behavior. It might help to discover co-regulated genes, and even common
transcriptional regulators in any biological model, including human diseases or microbial
infections. The present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an opportunity to test this novel approach
due to the wealth of data that is being generated, which could be used for validating results.
In addition, new cell mechanisms identified could become new therapeutic targets. Thus, we
have identified 35 host factors in the literature putatively involved in the infectious cycle of
SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 and searched for genes tightly co-expressed with them. We
have found around 1900 co-expressed genes whose assigned functions are strongly related
to viral cycles. Moreover, this set of genes heavily overlap with those identified by former
laboratory high-throughput screenings (with p-value near 0). Some of these genes aim to
cellular structures such as the stress granules, which could be essential for the virus
replication and thereby could constitute potential targets in the current fight against the
virus. Additionally, our results reveal a series of common transcription regulators, involved
in immune and inflammatory responses, that might be key virus targets to induce the
coordinated expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. All of this proves that ASACO can
discover gene co-regulation networks with potential for proposing new genes, pathways and
regulators participating in particular biological systems.

Introduction
Genes are team players that rarely act in solitude but require the cooperation of others to
carry out their physiological functions. Groups of genes are usually expressed together when
necessary, under the conduction of regulatory proteins, conforming the so-called regulatory
networks. In higher organisms, augmented complexity requires an increase in the number of
biological functions. This is mainly achieved by expanding regulatory relationships rather

than the number of participating genes (Long et al., 2016; Rogers and Bulyk, 2018). The
combinatorial or regulatory activity of proteins on structural genes seem to account for the
genetic plasticity required for development, organ functional diversity, responses to
environmental changes and other emergent properties of multicellularity (Lobo, 2008; Spitz
and Furlong, 2012). One gene might play different roles in different regulatory contexts, but it
will always be accompanied by other genes involved in that function. We hypothesize that,
even under this complex scenario, this regulatory linkage among proteins sharing biological
functions and pathways can be brought to light by carefully analysing co-expression profiles
from functional genomics and transcriptomic experiments.
The genomics era is generating a wealth of information about gene expression in many
different biological processes and experimental approaches. Although designed to address
specific questions, genomic expression data (as those from microarrays or RNA-Seq
experiments), can provide a huge amount of information regarding regulatory relationships,
usable to address different unrelated problems. One of the main obstacles encountered
when analysing data from different experimental sources is standardization. Lately, curated
databases have been deployed to gather and normalize genomics experimental data.
Expression Atlas is one of them (Papatheodorou et al., 2020). As of July 2020, it holds
normalized data from 1403 human transcriptomics experiments. These data contain valuable
information on regulatory relationships that can be exploited to gain insights into any human
biological system.
With all this in mind, we have devised a bioinformatics method based on an algorithm called
Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression (ASACO) that analyses information of
multiple human transcriptomics experiments from Expression Atlas to predict novel
regulators and functional partners of a given function. To challenge this algorithm, we have
addressed the analysis of several known human proteins that are important to Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection cycle and predicted new
possible partners and regulators of these functions. The rationale behind this choice is the
amount of experimental high-throughput genomic data, which is being produced because of
the interest generated by the COVID-19 pandemics, providing an excellent opportunity to
benchmark our in silico output. Moreover, we must also value the possibility of generating
new knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 infection process. The virus infection cycle rests on the
host’s physiological functions to take place, requiring the sequestration or co-option of
multiple host factors. In the first place, it is clearly stated the general inhibition activity
exerted by SARS viruses on host´s mRNAs translation (Kamitani et al., 2009; Thoms et al.,
2020). But also other aspects of the host physiology are used or modified by the virus, such
as the general RNA metabolism, protein synthesis, cell cycle regulation, cell membrane
dynamics, autophagy, apoptosis, unfolded protein response, MAP kinases, innate immunity

and inflammatory response (Fung and Liu, 2018; Sanche et al., 2020). The infection cycle
heavily relies on tight interactions with the host endomembrane organelles. Coronaviruses
enter the host cell by an endocytic mechanism involving the fusion between its coat
membrane and the cell plasma membrane. This fusion is mediated by plasma membrane
receptor recognition through the virus spike (S) protein (Belouzard et al., 2012; Boulant et
al., 2015; Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012). Moreover, interaction with endoplasmic
reticulum-derived membrane structures is essential for gene expression and proper
nucleocapsid formation. Both posttranslational modifications (Fung and Liu, 2018) and
folding assistance by cell chaperones are important for correct virus functions (Fukushi et al.,
2012). Virus assembly takes place on the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate
compartment (ERGIC), where they are engulfed in membrane-bound vesicles to be finally
secreted out of the host cell (Fung and Liu, 2019; Masters, 2006).
Understanding the basis of interactions of these pathways is crucial to fight infection.
Translatomics and proteomics analysis of the response to viral infection have recently
revealed cellular functions possibly involved in the infection process (Bojkova et al., 2020). In
the same way, interactomics using viral proteins as baits to find human proteins physically
interacting with them, have also revealed possible new therapeutic targets (Gordon et al.,
2020). Even more complex network analysis combining protein-protein interactions and
transcriptomics pointed to new potential targets as well (Yadi Zhou et al., 2020). It is also
noteworthy a study made on SARS-CoV knocking down kinases by sRNAi treatment. This
study highlighted cellular kinases that are important to SARS-CoV virus infection and
possibly crucial for SARS-CoV-2 as well (de Wilde et al., 2015). Notably, not only the cellular
but also the systemic response to the virus infection is important, and it seems to play a
relevant role in SARS-CoV-2 infection as in many other viral cycles. Evidence is arising
suggesting that SARS viruses are able to exploit the organism´s innate immune response on
its own benefit, co-opting some components of the response, as stress granules and
processing bodies (Fung et al., 2016; Moosa and Banerjee, 2020; Sola et al., 2011), and
recruiting as host factors those genes co-expressed with the innate immune response (Pinto
et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). This evidence stresses the necessity
of research to a broader systemic landscape to explain, for instance, SARS-CoV-2 influence
on the inflammatory response (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020;
Yonggang Zhou et al., 2020).
To help identifying functional companions in regulatory networks for a given gene we have
refined our algorithm to search for genes co-expressed with that initial gene along many
unrelated transcriptomic experiments. We have applied this analysis to 35 human genes
experimentally shown to play a role in SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here, we
present the results of this test, compare with those from several experimental high-

throughput genomic analysis and suggest some new functions possibly involved in SARSCoV-2 biology.

Materials and methods
Seed and expression data collecting
We searched in PubMed for human genes involved in the infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV, and both the gene names and UniProtKB entry identifiers were collected.
We called these genes as seeds. Then, we used the gene name in the Expression Atlas
database to download the experiments where the seed was differentially expressed. This
database provides 1352 standardized human transcriptomics experiments with a total of
3744 comparisons of different biological conditions coming from published results
(Papatheodorou et al., 2020). Then, we used a program written in Python language to get
the expression matrices from all the considered experiments. These matrices contain the
logarithm in base 2 of the fold change value (log2FC) for each gene within the experiments.
We took the log2FC from all the genes with this value higher than 1 or lower than -1, and pvalue lower than 0.05, in at least one of the collected experiments, and created a matrix of
log2FC with the genes and the experiments. Finally, the Pearson correlation coefficient was
independently calculated with the expression profile, for all the experiments, between the
seed and each of the other genes.
ASACO algorithm
The ASACO algorithm (Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression) involves a
methodology to select genes that share similar behavior in terms of expression with the
seed. The algorithm is based on fold change signs, as it is described as follows. The
procedure begins with the matrix of fold change values extracted from the experiments of the
Expression Atlas database in which the seed appears with a fold change value.
First, we only consider experiments where the absolute value of fold change for the seed is
equal or higher than 1, in order to consider only experiments with significant expression
changes. Let be

for each ௜ from the sample distribution of ௜ . Similarly, a p-value ௜  was computed for
each ௜ from the distribution of ௜ .
The p-value of ௜ , ௜ , is the probability that there are values greater than or equal to ௜ in
the distribution of , given the sample obtained from the experiment data base. Analogously
the p-value of ௜ , N௜ , is the probability that there are values greater than or equal to ௜ in
the distribution of .
Finally, selected genes were divided into two groups: a) those that are directly correlated in
terms of the sign of their fold changes, and b) those that are inversely correlated.
The first group is defined as  

In this way, selected directly correlated genes are those which fold change signs are mostly
the same than the seed in the same experiments, since their value of P is significantly high
and, therefore, the probability of finding genes with a higher value of P is very low ( .01).
Analogously, selected inversely correlated genes are those which fold change have mostly
the opposite sign than the seed in the same experiments, since their value of  is

significantly high and, therefore, the probability of finding genes with a higher value of  is
very low.
The ASACO algorithm is written in R language and available at
https://github.com/UPOBioinfo/asaco
Functional annotation and pathway analysis
Functional annotation for both seeds and co-expressed genes were obtained from Biomart
(Durinck et al., 2009). The functional enrichment were made with KEGG Pathway (Kanehisa
et al., 2017), and Reactome (Jassal et al., 2020), using the R libraries biomaRt,
clusterProfiler, and ReactomePA, and a p-value cutoff of 0.05.
To find pathways with a significant averaged correlation with the seeds, all human genes
were grouped by the Reactome pathway where they belong. A Wilcoxon test was calculated
by each pathway and the p-value was adjusted by the FDR method. Finally, only the
pathways with p-value equal or lower than 1e-05, and a median correlation higher than the
third quartile of the distribution of all the analyzed genes were considered as significant
pathways.
To discover transcription factors into the gene datasets, the gene ontology term ‘DNAbinding transcription factor activity’, together with those of ‘regulation of DNA-binding
transcription factor activity’ were searched (GO:0003700, GO:0051090, GO:0051091,
GO:0043433).
Comparison with high-throughput experiments
Supplementary files with genes from the published interactome of SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et
al., 2020) and both translatome and proteome (Bojkova et al., 2020) were downloaded, and
gene identifiers were mapped to UniProt accession numbers. Then, co-expressed proteins
from ASACO were independently compared to every dataset. To calculate the number of
expected matches we take 21489 as the number of total proteins in the human proteome,
based on the Biomart gene type ‘protein_coding’. To calculate the p-value of the number of
found matches, a hypergeometric test was used (dhyper function in R).
Genes regulated by interferon and genes related to stress granules
To check if a gene was induced or repressed by interferon, its expression was evaluated
using the Interferome database v2.01 (Rusinova et al., 2013). Only experiments where a
gene had a fold change higher than 2 were considered. When a gene appeared differently
expressed in more than one experiment, the average value was calculated.

Genes related to stress granules were extracted from the MSGP database (Mammalian
Stress Granules Proteome), that store a total of 464 proteins (Nunes et al., 2019). Available
gene names were mapped to UniProt accession numbers.

Results
Genes involved in well-known pathways from host factors show a positive correlation
to these factors over hundreds of experiments
A set of human genes are known to be involved in the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2. We searched the literature and found 35 protein-coding genes that participate
in different stages of their infection (Table 1). Then, we classified those host factors by the
viral activity where they are involved (entry, replication, or vesicle fusion), and created two
subgroups according to their type of function (proviral or antiviral). Proteins encoded by
these genes show common cellular functions (Fig. 1). The three most populated groups of
genes encode for: five replication proteins involved in metabolism of RNA, mainly mRNA
splicing (DDX1, DDX5, HNRNP1, PPIH, and ZCRB1), three proteins of vesicle fusion
involved in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus trafficking (COPB1, COPB2, and
GBF1), and a large number of proteins involved in immune system, mainly interferon and
cytokine signaling. This latter group includes five antiviral proteins (EIF2AK2, BST2, IFITM1,
IFITM2, and IFITM3), together with the replication proteins IMPDH1, IMPDH2, and PPIA,
and the vesicle protein VAPA. Furthermore, around the proteins of this group appear several
proteins relevant for the virus entry into the host cell such as the proteases FURIN and
cathepsin L1 (CTSL), as well as BSG and PIKFYVE. In fact, CTSL that improves the
efficiency of the viral entry, is known to be involved in both adaptive and innate immune
system (Zavašnik-Bergant et al., 2004).
All these proteins are part of autochthonous cell processes where they interact with others.
Those proteins involved in the same biological processes frequently share expression
profiles, which suggests they are co-regulated, often even showing common regulators. To
study the expression relationships between the previous host factors and their co-expressed
genes, we obtained transcriptomics experiments where they appear to be differentially
expressed (Fig. 2). Starting from these host factors, that we named as seeds from now on, a
total of 1381 different experiments were analyzed, 116 of them related to conditions
involving viruses different from SARS-CoV-2. Then, the correlation value between the
expression profile of these seeds versus all the other human genes through the different
experiments was calculated.

It is expected that genes participating in the same biological process than the seed show a
high correlation with it. Thus, we separated the correlation values for all the genes versus a
given seed by the pathway they belong, and those pathways with a high average correlation
value were analyzed. As a result, the most significant obtained pathways were usually those
corresponding to the ones already annotated for the corresponding seed (Fig. 3a), which
would support the previous assumption that genes participating in the biological process
where the seed is involved show a positive correlation with the seed. In addition, the most
significant pathways found when analyzing all the seeds are once again discriminating those
involved in replication (mainly metabolism of RNA, and cell cycle) from those related to
vesicle fusion, including the main five antiviral genes (Fig 3b). Remarkably, seeds involved in
cell entry appeared linked to these groups of genes. TPCN2 and BSG are linked to the
group of replication seeds by the mitochondrial translation pathway, while NRP1 and CTSL
appear linked to the group of antiviral genes, once again by both interferon and cytokine
signaling pathways (Fig. 3b). These two groups would highlight the two important cell
interactions with the virus: functions essential for its infectious cycle such as mRNA splicing,
and the cytokine antiviral response.
Genes with expression profiles like the seed ones present common pathways as well
as others related to viral infections
To assess the agreement of functions from the best correlated genes to the ones of seeds,
the expression profile of each seed was constructed using the available transcriptomic
conditions. Genes with a similar expression profile (co-expressed genes) as well as genes
with an inverse profile (inversely expressed genes) were obtained (Fig. 4). The total number
of found co-expressed genes was 2567, although several of them were common to different
seeds. Thus, the number of different co-expressed genes was 1899, while the number of the
inversely expressed ones was 1578 (Suppl. Fig. S1, Suppl. Table S1).
Co-expressed genes present common functions again related to those of the seeds (Fig. 5).
Pathways related of cytokine response such as interleukin or interferon signaling appear
enriched to the expected antiviral genes IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, EIF2AK2, and BST2, but
also to the entry gene CTSL, and the replication genes PPIB and DDX1. In fact, the protease
CTSL presented several interleukins as co-expressed genes, such as Interleukin-1 beta
(IL1B), and the X-C-C motif chemokines 2 and 3 (CXCL2, CXCL3). Other shared pathways
are those related to the cell cycle. Five genes show enrichment in cell cycle checkpoints
(DDX1, PPIB, PPIH, PRKCI, and ZCRB1). The cell cycle disarrangement is an action that
many viruses perform in the infected cells, where they induce a cell cycle arrest. For
example, the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) activates the cell ATR

signaling, which contributes to S-phase arrest and is required for efficient virus replication
and progeny production (Xu et al., 2011). Genes of vesicle fusion such as COPB1, COPB2,
OSBP, together with PPIB, are enriched in the expected processes of trafficking between the
endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, glycosylation or the unfolded protein
response. Other highlighted pathway is related to the nuclear export protein (NEP/NS2) of
Influenza A virus that helps the transport of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes from the
nucleus (Boulo et al., 2007), and it is enriched from the correlators of DDX1, PPIB, and
PPIH. Other unexpected pathways were those relating DDX1, IMPDH2, PPIH, and ZCRB1
to mitochondrial translation. Noteworthy, this latter pathway appeared previously related to
PPIB, as well as the entry genes BSG and TPCN2, in the previous analysis of pathway
average correlations (Fig. 3b). Finally, the most remarkable common pathway in the
inversely expressed genes was interferon-alpha/beta pathway, which appeared for both
HNRNPA1 and PPIH genes. These genes are involved in mRNA splicing, that is one of the
essential host functions for the virus, so it is expected that the cell response try to silence
them, and because of this we expect that their negative correlators were related to cytokine
response.
The best seeds’ correlators overlap with results of high-throughput experiments on
SARS-CoV-2
To evaluate the list of co-expressed genes obtained, we compared them against genes
identified in high-throughput laboratory experiments performed upon viral infection or in the
presence of viral proteins. A recent work has completed the interactome of viral versus
human proteins, and they found 332 human proteins interacting with viral proteins which are
candidates to be involved in the viral infectious cycle (Gordon et al., 2020). In addition, other
experimental group has published both the translatome and proteome in human cells
infected by the virus (Bojkova et al., 2020), and they describe proteins that differentially
change during the infection.
Two thirds of the positively correlated genes proposed by our approach appear in any of
those experimental datasets (1212 out of 1899), while the expected random value would be
29 proteins in the interactome, 239 in the translatome, and 493 proteins in the proteome
(Fig. 6a). However, 682 of our proposed genes did not appear as results in these
experimental analyses. To assess whether these new genes could perform virus related
functions their associated pathways were analyzed. In fact, a good number of genes are
involved in processes related to the infectious cycle of other viruses such as Influenza A,
Epstein-Barr, Hepatitis B and C, and Measles (Fig. 6b). Another function found was the
homology directed repair (HDR), which is also used for the Epstein-Barr (Sugimoto et al.,

2011). Furthermore, it is noteworthy the enrichment in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Fig.
6c), since the ubiquitin mediated proteolysis is important during various stages of
coronavirus infectious cycle (Raaben et al., 2010). Finally, there are functions related with
the immune system which respond to virus infections such as class I MHC mediated antigen
processing and presentation, and interferon/interleukin signaling.
These results suggest that co-expressed genes found by our approach can offer an accurate
landscape of the cellular pathways and proteins affected by the virus when the infection is
progressing, even though it is based on heterogeneous experiments from many different
conditions that do not include coronavirus infections.
Transcription factors co-expressed with seeds are regulated by interferon and could
induce the expression of genes involved in cell entry
The coincidence in the assigned pathways for seeds and their correlators suggests that
SARS-CoV-2 host factors may belong to common regulatory networks, possibly sharing
transcriptional regulators. Moreover, these regulators could be co-regulated with seeds as
well. To test this hypothesis, transcription factors were identified from the correlators. So,
116 transcription factors, or putative upstream regulators, were found among the coexpressed genes, and 155 in the inversely expressed genes. Among them, 23 co-expressed
regulators were common to two or more seeds (Fig. 7a). They form an interrelated network
with the main antiviral genes (EIF2AK2, BST2, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3), but some of
them also appeared co-expressed with proviral genes involved in vesicle fusion such as
COPB1, COPB2, and VAPA, replication, as DDX5, and entry, suggesting common
regulatory features. Related to viral entry, the transcription factor NUPR1, a stress-response
protein induced by the Hepatitis B virus (Bak et al., 2015), is co-expressed with the protease
TMPRSS2. Moreover, the factor ZNF267, which is an antiviral zinc finger protein (Huntley et
al., 2006), is co-expressed with the kinase ABL2. Finally, TRIM14, which is a member of a
family of E3 ubiquitin ligases linked to the mitochondria that plays an important role in innate
defense against viruses facilitating the interferon response (Tan et al., 2017), is coexpressed with both the receptor ACE2 and the lysosomal channel TPCN2. Remarkably, all
the regulators connecting the antiviral seeds with several proviral activities, including the cell
entry, are genes induced by interferon. However, other transcription factors mainly
connecting replication genes are contrarily repressed by interferon. For example, YEATS4 is
co-expressed with DDX1, IMPDH2, and ZCRB1, that were co-expressed with genes
involved in mitochondrial translation. Other remarkable co-expressed gene is CEBPZ, which
belongs to a family of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, some of them related to immune
and inflammatory response (Kinoshita et al., 1992). CEBPZ is a gene co-expressed with the

replication seeds DDX1 and PPIG, but also inversely expressed with the protease FURIN.
Other correlators from this protein family are CEBPD, that is a co-expressed gene of IFITM3,
but inversely expressed with COPB2, and CEBPB that is a co-expressed gene of the
protease CTSL.
Conversely, regulators inversely expressed with seeds are mainly interferon repressed
genes (Fig. 7b). Among these genes, three zinc-finger proteins that act as antivirals against
Herpex simplex virus 1 stand out in this dataset (Melchjorsen et al., 2009): ZNF91 inversely
expressed with CTSL, IFITM2, IFITM3, and VAPA, that is not induced or repressed by
interferon, is a transcription factor specifically required to repress SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA)
retrotransposons (Jacobs et al., 2014); the transcription factor ZNF550, which is repressed
by interferon and appeared inversely correlated with the entry genes FURIN and BSG; and
ZNF768, that appeared as inversely expressed to the genes involved in vesicle fusion
COPB1 and OSBP. Two others inversely expressed genes were the transcriptional
repressors YBX3 and CREBRF, that are repressed by interferon and link the entry genes
ACE2 and TPCN2. Y-Box-Binding Protein 3 (YBX3) restricts Influenza A virus by impairing
viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (Qin et al., 2020), and also controls amino acid levels by
regulating solute carrier amino acid transporter (SLC) mRNA abundance, a pathway that is
related with inversely expressed genes of HPRNPA1 (Fig. 5b).
To further analyze the interferon signaling related with the seeds, the response to interferon
was independently evaluated for each seed, together with their co-expressed and inversely
expressed genes. As expected, the main interferon induced genes, the antivirals IFITM1-3,
BST2, and EIF2AK2, presented an important activation together with its co-expressed
genes, and a repression of their inversely expressed genes (Fig 7c). Unexpectedly, proviral
genes involved in entry, ACE2, ABL2, and CTSL, together with the replication gene PPIB,
present a similar interferon response, suggesting an undesired effect of interferon promoting
SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, the seeds HNRNPA1, COPB2, and VAPA
present a reversed profile. Specifically, HNRNPA1 is a gene involved in mRNA splicing,
which is moved towards the stress granules during viral infection. This structures include
ribonucleprotein complexes together with the cell translation machinery, and is proposedly
used by the virus to perform its replication (Perdikari et al., 2020). These cytosolic particles
seem to be targeted by the viral nucleocapsid protein (N). The N protein interact with 15
human proteins (Gordon et al., 2020), and 3 of them were found as co-expressed genes of
COPB1 and COPB2 (FAM98A), EIF2AK2 (MOV10), and HNRNPA1 and IMPDH2
(PABPC4). These three proteins have been associated to the stress granules, together with
DDX1, EIF2AK2, and HNRNPA1, which reinforce the relation of the N viral protein with this
stress structures (Burgess et al., 2011; Goodier et al., 2015; Ozeki et al., 2019). In fact, the

antiviral seed EIF2AK2 has been seen as the kinase activated by double-stranded RNA of
viruses that activate the formation of the stress granules (Burgess and Mohr, 2018).
Currently, 464 proteins are known to form part of this liquid-liquid structures, and the seed
co-expressed genes include 131 of them (41 were expected by chance; 4.6e-35) (Fig. 7d),
21 from the interactome (7 expected; 7.7e-06), and 372 from the proteome (119 expected;
3.1e-137), which support the importance of these structures in the SARS-CoV-2, as well as
the fact that the virus could use them for its replication and mRNA translation.

Discussion
Currently, databases sharing gene expression data are exponentially growing due to the
universalization of transcriptomics techniques (Athar et al., 2019). A secondary analysis of
this data allows to reconstruct gene networks based on co-expressed genes using the socalled reverse engineering (Basso et al., 2005; He and Tan, 2016). We have developed a
new in silico method called ASACO based on standardized gene expression data analysis.
Starting from an initial seed gene, it finds the closest neighbors in terms of transcriptional
regulation. Compared to other previous procedures, it has the advantage of evaluating
thousands of experiments whose outcomes are normalized, allowing co-expression analysis
for different heterogeneous genes over hundreds of experimental conditions (Cardozo et al.,
2019; Gibbs et al., 2013). We have used this strategy on a selection of 35 cellular genes
reportedly involved in SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection, identifying their closest coexpressed genes. Even though the experiments employed to find them are not focused on
coronaviruses infection, the functional enrichment of the co-expressed genes identify many
of the already known pathways for these seeds (Fig. 3). Furthermore, both seeds and
correlators fairly match most of the cellular pathways relevant to the infection cycle (Fig. 5).
Moreover, these co-regulated genes show a high coincidence with the ones identified in
recent high-throughput studies on cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 6a). This
match can be interpreted as a cross-validation of both, experimental and in silico
approaches, providing relevance to our identified functions and supporting the idea that coregulation, as we identify it, can be a hallmark of co-function.
When viruses enter the host, one of the first systems that respond to the infection is the
interferon signaling pathway, that induces the expression of interferon stimulated genes
(ISG). Five of the seeds used in this study, considered as antiviral genes, are ISGs.
EIF2AK2 inhibits viral replication via the integrated stress response, and blocks the cellular
and viral translation through the phosphorylation of EIF2α (Kang et al., 2009). BST2 blocks
the release of viruses by directly tethering nascent virions to the membranes of infected cells
(Dafa-Berger et al., 2012). Finally, the transmembrane proteins IFITM1-3 inhibit the entry of

enveloped virus by preventing vesicle fusion, though they also could facilitates the infection
of other viruses (Lim et al., 2016). As expected, genes positively correlated with these
antiviral genes consistently belong to interferon and interleukins response pathways (Fig.
5a), and our co-expression analysis links them to regulators as STAT1, STAT3 or TRIM21
(Fig. 7ac). Surprisingly, several proviral seeds, remarkably those involved in virus entry
(ACE2, TPCN2, ABL2, and TMPRSS2), are found to be linked to these antiviral genes by
means of common co-expressed transcriptional regulators. The main viral receptor, ACE2,
has already been found as induced by interferon, and this fact has been interpreted as
“evidence that coronaviruses, as well as other viruses, have evolved to leverage features of
the human IFN pathway” (Ziegler et al., 2020). This could be true for other entry genes.
TRIM14 is one of the regulators found in common to ACE2, TPCN2, and four out of five
antivirals (excluding IFITM2). This regulator is known to interact with MAVS at the outer
mitochondria membrane and attenuates the antiviral response by the type I interferon
response (Zhou et al., 2014). Since TRIM14 is co-expressed with ACE2, it could be
responsible of, or related to, the receptor’s positive response to interferon. Interestingly, not
only ACE2 seems to be induced by interferon, but also its positive correlators, as well as
those of ABL2 (which could be induced by the ISG ZNF267 according to our results), and
the cathepsin L protease, CTSL. All of these are genes involved in the viral entry, and the
latter activates the membrane fusion function of the spike viral protein S of SARS-CoV
(Bosch et al., 2008), and could substitute to the TMPRSS2 protease in cell types different to
lung cells (Liu et al., 2020). CTSL co-expressed genes are not only interferon but also
interleukin induced genes, and three cytokines are co-expressed with it (IL1B, CXCL2, and
CXCL3). In addition, it shares with IFITM2, IFITM3 and the vesicle gene VAPA links to the
transcriptional repressor ZNF91. All of this points to both ZNF91 and TRIM14 as putative
regulators responsible for the presumptive interferon and interleukin dependent induction of
entry proviral genes and pinpoints them as useful pharmacological targets to interfere with
the viral infection. In fact, the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be
lightly induced by interferon, but strongly by chemokines (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020).
Furthermore, CTSL appeared also linked to the co-expressed transcription factor CBPB that
regulates the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses
(Kinoshita et al., 1992). This transcription factor can form heterodimers with CEBPD, which
is also a co-expressed gene of IFITM3, but inversely expressed gene of the vesicle protein
COPB2. It suggests that the interleukin response could repress proviral genes such as
COPB2, but undesirably induce CTSL.

Contrarily, genes required for viral replication such as PPIG, DDX1, ZCRB1, IMPDH2,
GSK3A, and GSK3B, are bound to interferon repressed transcriptional regulators such as
RFX7 and YEATS4, which could negatively affect the infection in the presence of interferon.
One essential cellular pathway needed by the virus is the mRNA splicing. In this function,
HNRNPA1 is a key gene (Luo et al., 2005). Interferon triggers EIF2AK2-dependent
HNRNPA1 protein translocation to stress granules resulting in mRNA translation inhibition.
Until now, 464 different human proteins have been identified to participate in this liquid-liquid
cytosolic structures (Nunes et al., 2019). Remarkably, proteins from stress granules show a
broad convergence with our host factors co-expressed genes (131 out of 464), as well as
those from the high-throughput experiments. Thus, 46 proteins out of 332 from the viral
interactome are also components of stress granules. From these 46 proteins, 9 interact with
the N nucleocapsid protein that seems the viral protein most related to these structures
(Savastano et al., 2020). Furthermore, 20 of these proteins interact with the viral polymerase
complex (nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8), and with the helicase nsp13 that in turn seems to interact
with our seed DDX5 in SARS-CoV (Chen et al., 2009a). Since virus infection leads to the
hijacking of the translation machinery into the stress granules, this is a beneficial place for
the translation of viral mRNA molecules, where viruses such as the respiratory syncytial
virus take advantage of this (Lindquist et al., 2010). Thus, the general emergence of
interferon and cytokine related genes (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020), as well
as stress granules related genes (Perdikari et al., 2020; Savastano et al., 2020), revealed by
this and other studies strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could also use the interferoninduced stress granules as replication factory, which points to this structure as a new target
for the development of therapeutic approaches to treat COVID-19.

Conclusions
We here presented ASACO, an algorithm with the capacity to generate key functional
knowledge on specific genes based on their co-expressed genes. We have tested this
algorithm with host factors involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, by means of the analysis
of co-expression data extracted from public transcriptomics databases. Although further
experiments using in vitro and in vivo approaches will be required to further confirm the
results obtained here, our results have allowed the discovery of relevant gene networks and
cell pathways, and pointed to a series of transcription regulators as potential targets useful in
the fighting against SARS-CoV-2. The consistency of our results with those obtained by
other experimental approaches represent a proof of concept of the utility of this algorithm,
which could be used for the study in other pathologies where there is still a need for
discovering new functional knowledge.

Figure legends
Fig. 1. Reactome pathways shared between three or more seeds. Seeds are highlighted by
its type of activity (proviral or antiviral), and its function in the infection (entry, replication, or
vesicle fusion). Seeds with none shared pathways are not showed (PPIG, TOP3B,
TMPRSS2).
Fig. 2. Workflow followed by ASACO; Automatic and Serial Analysis of COexpression. Transcriptomics experiments where seeds are differently expressed are
searched in the Expression Atlas database. Different experiments can be found for a given
seed, along with its fold change value (log2FC). Then, experiments are downloaded and the

complete expression matrix by experiment is obtained. In this matrix, other genes can be
differentially expressed and their log2FC are also extracted. The log2FC values are used to
create expression profiles for each gene. When the expression profiles have a positive
correlation with that of the seed, their corresponding genes are expected to be co-regulated
and functionally related to the seed (gene 2, gene 5, gene 7), and when the expression
profiles have a negative correlation with that of the seed (gene 4, gene 6, gene 8), they are
expected to have an inverse behavior in terms of expression.
Fig. 3. Significative pathways found by ASACO. a) Distribution of correlation values of
genes belonging to the most significant pathways (maximum 10) for 6 of the seeds.
Pathways already annotated for the seed are highlighted in red color. The number of the
genes that the pathway has annotated is shown in brackets. The solid line marks correlation
0, and the dashed line marks the median of the correlation for all the genes. b) Significative
pathways shared between three or more seeds. Seeds are highlighted by its type of activity
(proviral or antiviral), and its function in the infection (entry, replication, or vesicle fusion).
Seeds with none shared pathways are not showed (ABL2, ACE2, COPB1, DDX5, EZR,
FURIN, GBF1, GSK3A, GSK3B, IMPDH1, OSBP, PIKFYVE, TMPRSS2, VAPA). Pathways
already annotated for any seed are highlighted in red color.

Fig. 4. Expression profile of all seeds together with their positive and negative
correlated genes. The black colored line represents the expression profile for the target
gene through the different experiments (X axis), which are ordered from its higher to lower
log2FC. Correlated genes are labeled in green (co-expressed genes), or red (inversely
expressed genes), together with its deviation (Q1 an Q3 quartiles). Note that the number of
ticks on the X axis is relative to the number of experiments for that seed.

Fig 5. Functional enrichment of the positively (a) and negatively (b) correlated genes
for all the seeds. Reactome pathways were used, with those already annotated for a seed
highlighted in red color. Pathways related with interferon or interleukin signaling are
highlighted with a darker line. The color of the seed name is related to their viral function
(entry=orange, replication=blue, vesicle=green). Seeds without any enriched pathway are
not shown.
Fig. 6. Overlapping between co-expressed proteins found by ASACO and other
proteins related with the SARS-CoV-2 infection from high-throughput experiments. a)
Co-expressed genes found by ASACO are shown inside the blue box. The interactome
obtained by Gordon et al., 2020 is displayed in the green box, the translatome and the
proteome by Bojkova et al., 2020 are shown in the pink and the yellow boxes respectively.

The total number of proteins in each dataset is shown inside the boxes as well as the
number of overlapping proteins (n), the number of coincidences expected by chance (e), and
the p-value calculated with the hypergeometric distribution (p). Results for positively (green
color), and negatively (red color) correlated genes are separated. The table represents the
number of proteins found by ASACO for each seed, together with those that overlap with any
other dataset in brackets and separated by the correlation sign. The total number of proteins
is indicated below together with the total number of shared proteins and the number of
positively correlated proteins exclusively found by ASACO. Outside the blue box, the number
of proteins shared by the four datasets is shown. Note that the 2703 proteins in the
translatome also appear in the proteome. b) KEGG pathway enrichment for genes
exclusively found by ASACO. c) Reactome pathway enrichment for genes exclusively found
by ASACO.

Fig. 7. Transcription factor network from co-expressed genes, and relation with
interferon and stress granules. a) Positively expressed transcription factors common to, at
least, two seeds. Seeds are highlighted by its type of activity (proviral or antiviral), and its
function in the infection (entry, replication, or vesicle fusion). Transcription factor induced by
interferon are highlighted in red color and those repressed by interferon in blue color. b) The
same as a) but for the negatively expressed transcription factors. c) Average interferon
induced fold change of seeds, together with the value for both positively and negatively
expressed genes. d) Number of genes related to stress granules in both positively and
negatively expressed genes for each seed. The first column of the heatmap shows if the
seed is related or not to stress granules.
