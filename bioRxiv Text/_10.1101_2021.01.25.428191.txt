Abstract:
The challenges imposed by the ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 affects every aspect of our modern world, ranging from our
health to our socio-economic needs. Our existence highly depends on the vaccine's
availability, which demands in-depth research of the available strains and their
mutations. In this work, we have analyzed all the available SERS-CoV2 genomes
isolated from the Kingdom of Bahrain in terms of their variance and origin analysis.
We have predicted various known and unique mutations in the SERS-CoV2 isolated
from Bahrain. The complexity of the phylogenetic tree and dot plot representation of
the strains mentioned above with other isolates of Asia indicates the versatility and
multiple origins of Bahrain's SERS-CoV2 isolates. We have also identified two high
impact spike mutations from these strains which increase the virulence of SARSCoV2. Our research could have a high impact on vaccine development and
distinguishes the source of SERS-CoV2 in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 is the most dangerous
threats to humankind across the globe. This disease became a pandemic in early 2020
and effects various countries worldwide. It not only affects the human race by its
disastrous impact on human health but also through its devastating influence on every
socio-economical aspect of the modern world. It was first reported in China at the
city of Wuhan in December 2019. The novel coronavirus, the causative agent of
SARS-CoV-2, can be transmitted from man to man through body secretions. SARSCoV-2 is an enveloped and single-stranded positive-sense RNA containing virus
which is closely related to the coronavirus that has been isolated from SARS outbreak
in 2003. Though there are some shreds of evidence for the spillover infection of the
zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, some controversies also exist regarding its
laboratory origin ( Andersen et al. 2020).

In the Kingdom of Bahrain, the very first case was detected in 21/02/2020 in a school
bus driver who had a travel record to Iran and Dubai. Within three months, total
number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the Kingdom of Bahrain reaches 103. Though
there was a reduction in the increasing rate of new cases after six months, it was
again started increasing at the beginning of September. This could be counted as the
second wave, which also has started decreasing at the end of November.

This work aims to analyse up to date 150 SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were isolated
from the Kingdom of Bahrain. With state of the art comparative genomic approach,
we have analysed the mutations present in those strains which will help in the vaccine

design. We have also compared all the genomes with twenty different SARS-CoV-2
genomes that were isolated from various parts of Asia, to study the proper origin of
SARS-CoV-2 in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

Method:

Sample selection:
We have fetched all the genomes of SERS-CoV2 from the Global Initiative on
Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) server (Shu et al. 2017). Total 150 genomes
with the origin of Bahrain and other 20 genomes with other Asian roots have been
identified. The other 20 locations under considerations are Zahedan, Wuhan, Tehran,
Semnan, Riyadh, Qom, Qatif, Qatar, Muscat, Makkah, Madinah, Lebanon, Kuwait,
Jordan, Jerusalem, Jeddah, Islamabad, Iraq, Dhaka and Delhi. We have only collected
complete genome of 28-29MB of sizes.

Multiple sequence alignment:
Multiple sequence alignment has been performed for two groups of the sample. One
group contains only the SERS-CoV2 sequences isolated from Bahrain and the other
group contains all the genomes from Bahrain and previously mentioned twenty
different locations. We performed MSA for both the groups for SNP detection in the
first group and phylogenetic tree construction in the second group. Here, we have
used MUSCLE (Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation) algorithm to
align the sequences (Edgar 2004). MUSCLE algorithm is based on two distance

measures: k-mer distance and Kimura distance for each of the two sequences. Before
multiple alignments, scores for pairwise alignment has been defined. Initially, a
binary tree has been created which is followed by accurate multiple alignments in the
refinement stage through calculations of time and space complexities.

Variant and mutations analysis:

We have used hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 strain (isolated from Wuhan, China) as
reference for variant and mutations analysis of 150 SERS-Cov2 genomes isolated
from the Kingdom of Bahrain. We have used CoVsurver mutant analysis tool from
GISAID server. This tool identifies specific mutations of SERS-Cov2 along with
various structural and functional proteins. Similarly, for characterization of Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), we have used SNiPlay tools available at
(http://sniplay.cirad.fr/. ). This tool helps us to in the determination of Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion (indels) along the whole
genome length. Both the tools accept aligned FASTA sequence.

Phylogenetic tree construction:

Phylogenetic tree construction is required for the detection of similarities in SERSCov2 genomes isolated from various places. it is also helpful to detect the close
relative or source of the 150 different SERS-Cov2 genomes isolated from the
Kingdom of Bahrain. For phylogenetic tree reconstruction, we have used the PhyML

algorithm which is based on the maximum likelihood method (Guindon 2003). It
allows very large datasets in multiple sequence aligned format. This method follows
the hill-climbing algorithm which simultaneously adjusts tree topology and branch
lengths. It starts with a basic tree buildup via the fast distance-based method and with
every iteration, it improves the likelihood of the tree. It is a very fast method which
reaches optima within a few iterations.

Dot plot assay:

The Dot plots are used to compare large sequence sets to get an insight into the
similarity overview. A distinct set of sequences will produce a diagonal straight line.
We have used D-genies (Cabanettes 2018) which is under GNU General Public
License (GPL). Here, similar sequences will produce a scatter plot as most of the
sequences will be matched with each other. A large number of samples could be
plotted with a multiple sequence aligned format as an input file. We have used this
plot to estimate the overall 170 previously mentioned SERS-Cov2 sequences to check
their similarities and relatedness.
Results:
Mutation analysis:
We have compared total 150 genomes that have been isolated from the Kingdom of
Bahrain with the reference genome from Wuhan strain (hCoV19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) which is the official reference sequence employed by
GISAID. We have analysed all the mutations in the 150 genomes compared to the

unique mutations. The analyzed the genome variations in terms of SNP’s for these
150 genomes are given in Supplementary Information 2. Among these mutations,
E484K and D614G are recently noted as the significant mutations due to their effect
on SARS-CoV 2 virulence. E484K mutation on the spike protein causes SARS-CoV
2 escape from the neutralizing effect of the human immune systems mediated by
antibody (Mahase 2021). On the other hand, D614G mutation on the spike protein
has high infectivity in human cells having ACE2 receptors (Ogawa et al. 2020, Kim
et al. 2020). D614G mutation situated exactly at the receptor binding domain of the
spike protein. So due to this mutation, affinity of ACE2 receptor in increases. It was
reported that infectivity increases by >1/2 log10 which is measured through cell
fusion assay (Ogawa et al. 2020).

Phylogenetic tree analysis:
We have reconstructed phylogenetic tree separately for the SERS-Cov2 sequences
isolated from the Kingdom of Bahrain and all 170 sequences from all over Asia.
Here, first of all our main aim was to identify the similarities between SERS-Cov2
sequences isolated from the Kingdom of Bahrain. A view of phylogenetic tree only
for Bahrain sequences has been presented in Fig 2. It can be observed from Fig 2
that there is a huge diversity in the genomic sequences isolated from various places of
Bahrain. This could definitely increases our curiosity for finding the actual origin of
SERS-Cov2 in Bahrain. So we constructed the second tree which posses all the 170
sequences from Bahrain as well as the sequences from various places of Asia. The
phylogenetic tree for all the 170 sequences is represented in Fig 3.
From Fig 3. it seems that the origin of SERS-Cov2 in Bahrain is not only from one
place. There is huge diversity in the phylogenetic tree where we can see that 37
sequence of SERS-Cov2 isolated from Bahrain is very much different from other
sequences. Other 113 sequences have different origin. Some of the sequence have
similarities with Qatif where some other sequences have similarities with the
sequence isolated from Iran, Qatar and Israel. Such huge diversity leads us to perform
a dot plot assay for overall understanding of all the 170 sequences.
Dot plot assay:

We have placed all 170 sequences in a specific manner both in the X and the Y axis
of a graph, and study the similarity matrix between them. The dot plot is represented
in Fig 4.

Fig 4. A dot plot assay of all the 170 sequences isolated from various regions of Asia.

The scattered nature of the dot plot in Fig 4 clearly indicates that all the 170 genomes
are closely related to each other. If there is a single origin of the 150 SERS-Cov2

genomes isolated from Bahrain, then the plot looks like a diagonal straight line. So
we can conclude that the origin of SERS-Cov2 in Bahrain is not only from one place.
Discussion:
In this paper we have represented a detailed account of total 150 SERS-Cov2
genomes that have been isolated from the Kingdom of Bahrain. We have analyzed
the mutations in all the strains in reference with the hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019
Wuhan strain which is considered as the origin or SERS-Cov2. We have identified
various known and unknown mutations from these 150 strains. We saw that hCoV19/Bahrein/BAH-24/2020|EPI_ISL_483638|2020-04-07 possesses maximum number
of unique mutations. We have found two significant mutations (E484K and D614G)
on the spike protein of Bahrain isolates. These mutations cause decrease in antibody
affinity towards SARS-CoV2 and increase of binding affinity towards ACE2 receptor
respectively. A detailed account of all these mutations will be helpful for designing
the vaccine against SERS-Cov2. We have also studied the origin of SERS-Cov2 in
the Kingdom of Bahrain. We found that there is a huge diversity in the 150 genomes.
This indicates that there could be multiple source of SERS-Cov2 in the Kingdom of
Bahrain.
