Abstract

11

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel highly virulent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the

12

cell surface receptor – angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). We computationally contrasted the

13

binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)

14

of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the

15

Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized

16

to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced

17

infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23%

18

less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1

19

binding site. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD out-competes the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1)

20

which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 35% in terms of the calculated binding affinity. Strong

21

binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus

22

alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent

23

accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different

24

livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine,

25

canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and

26

reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infectivity of SARS-

27

CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved

28

in binding with the virus.

Introduction

31
32

The causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in January 2020 to be a

33

novel β-coronavirus of the same subgenus as SARS-CoV-1. SARS-CoV-2 strain has caused a

34

dramatically greater number of infections and fatalities and an effective antiviral treatment and vaccine

35

remains elusive to this day. It has been reported that the first step to viral entry is association between the

36

viral spike RBD and human ACE2 protein1. There have been several structural analyses2,3 of both SARS-

37

CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 binding interactions with human ACE2 (hACE2) but no quantitative

38

assessment of the contribution of different residues in the spike RBD towards tight binding or

39

comparisons with its native receptor ATR1. It has been suggested2,4 that viral spike binding to hACE2

40

prevents ATR1 binding with hACE2 but no quantitative comparisons have been drawn. Experimental and

41

computational investigations have focused on the RBD-hACE2 interaction for SARS-CoV-15 and CoV-27

42

, the role of glycosylated spike residues8, and the potential impact of the CoV-2’s furin cleavage site6.

43
44

In this study, we first assess the molecular interactions between the three spike RBDs with the hACE2

45

complex. We also provide a comparative analysis of the most important RBD residues from all three viral

46

spike proteins that drive binding with hACE2. Using the Rosetta binding energy function to score

47

interactions, we find that SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the human ATR1 surface receptor protein to

48

preferentially bind hACE2 by 35% quantified using the Rosetta binding energy function. A recent study9

49

explained interactions between hACE2 and SARS-CoV-1 vs. SARS-CoV-2 RBDs using a homology

50

modeled structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and only considering five residues from the spike RBDs.

51

Building on these results, we used an experimentally confirmed atomic scale maps (cryo-EM structures)

52

for the SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 RBD in complex with hACE2. Because no experimentally resolved

53

RaTG13-hACE2 complex structure is available, we computationally reconstructed a putative one using

54

flexible protein-protein docking (see Methods). We find that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds hACE2

55

23% stronger than SARS-CoV-1 and 11% compared to RaTG13 quantified using the Rosetta energy

56

function. Extending this analysis to include non-human ACE2 orthologues, we calculated a descending

57

order of binding strength starting with bats and followed by humans, felines, canines, equines, bovines,

58

and finally poultry. This rank order is consistent with a recent experimental report that finds that

59

mammals especially felines are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, whereas birds, fish, and reptiles are not10.

lts

70

indicate that hACE2 can bind with either human ATR1 or the viral spike (but not both simultaneously) as

71

the binding domains overlap. hACE2 forms hydrophobic and strong electrostatic (including pi-pi, and
nd

72

cation-pi) interactions with the binding domain of ATR1 with a Rosetta binding energy of 31.4 kcal/mol

73

which is 35% less strong than the one with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The CoV-2 RBD maximally co-opts

74

these interactions to gain entry via strong non-covalent attachment (see Figure 1).

To understand the role of the inter-residue interaction network formed during viral entry, we first

77

constructed a contact map depicting all such interactions for the spike-binding interface of unbound

78

hACE2 (see Figure 1). We then computed the changes in this contact map upon binding with the RBD of

79

SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13. We observe that SARS-CoV-2 more radically co-opts the

original contact map of unbound hACE2 to form a highly stabilized hACE2-RBD interface (see Figure

hydrophobic contact with hACE2 residue Thr27 (using the side-chain) and an electrostatic stabilization

with hACE2 residue Asp30 (using the backbone) (see Figure 2). The RaTG13 RBD only forms the

hydrophobic interaction whereas the SARS-CoV-1 RBD forms neither (see Figure 2). Consequently, a

103

computational alanine scan (see Figure 3) reveals that alanine mutation of this position leads to

104

significant loss of hACE2 binding in both SARS-CoV-2 (~61% reduction) and RaTG13 (~59%
%

105

reduction) but not in SARS-CoV-1 (only ~12% reduction). The spike protein RBD for SARS-CoV-1 (and
nd

106

RaTG13) are only able to form eight (and eleven) strong electrostatic contacts using seven (and ten) RBD

residues, respectively. This does not imply that SARS-CoV-1 and RaTG13 only use these residues to bind

new complex-stabilizing contacts. SARS-CoV-1 and RaTG13 show weaker attachments as they are able

122
123

Each one of the hACE2 binding residues from the three viral spike RBDs was computationally mutated to

124

alanine (one at a time) and the resultant hACE2-RBD complexes were energy minimized and scored

125

using the Rosetta energy function. This procedure assesses how important is the identity of the native

126

residues by defaulting them to alanine and observing whether this significantly affects binding. The

127

percent loss of hACE2 binding upon an alanine mutation was used as a proxy score for assessing the

128

importance of each RBD residue in binding and subsequent pathogenesis. The results from the alanine

129

scan study (see Figure 3) reveal that ~90% (19 out of 21) of the hACE2-binding residues of SARS-CoV-

130

2 are important for complex formation. Even a single mutation to alanine of any of these residues lowers

131

the binding score by more than 60%. These results imply that the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs of the spike

132

protein are highly optimized for binding with hACE2. We note that positions Lys417 and Gly502 have

133

one of the strongest impacts on binding (78% and 79% reduction upon mutation to Ala, respectively).

134

This is because they help establish one strong electrostatic contact with Asp30, and three with Gln325,

135

Lys353, and Gly354 (as listed in Table 1). The computational alanine scanning results identify the same

136

three residues Phe486, Gln493, and Asn501 to be important for hACE2 binding as proposed by Wan et

137

al.9. We find that Phe486, Gln493, and Asn501 each establish three new contacts, consequently their

138

mutation to Ala (even for only one of them) leads to loss of ACE2 binding by more than ~62.5%.

Presence of tyrosine and glycine residues in the hACE2 binding domains of these spike proteins

161
162

All three viral RBDs are enriched in tyrosine residues. As many as 26.3% (5 out of 19 residues) of the

163

SARS-CoV-1 RBD residues, 25% (4 out of 16 residues) for SARS-CoV-2, and 29% (5 out of 17

164

residues) for RaTG13 are tyrosine residues. We have not explored the phylogenetic basis for the presence

165

of tyrosine residues but they do seem to be important for conferring high binding affinity spike and

166

hACE2 for both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, as alluded to by the alanine scan results (see Figure 3). In

167

contrast, the tyrosine residues in SARS-CoV-1 (Tyr442, Tyr475, and Tyr491) only constitute self-

168

stabilizing electrostatic contacts. We use Figure 4a to explain one representative case of interface

169

tyrosine residues from all three RBDs: SARS-CoV-1 (Tyr442 and Asn473), SARS-CoV-2 (Tyr473 and

170

Tyr489), and RaTG13 (Tyr473 and Tyr489).

172

The SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 Tyr473 and Tyr489 backbones, even though present in a loop, are
re

173

mutually stabilized by hydrogen bonding and the side chains are locked in place by a pi-pi aromatic
tic

174

interaction between the phenyl rings. This enables both of these tyrosine side-chains to form a strong

electrostatic contact with the Thr27 side-chain of hACE2. It is thus unsurprising that mutation of either

Tyr473 or Tyr489 (in both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13) to alanine results in a similar (>58%, respectively

hACE2 residues while in SARS-CoV-1 they are primarily responsible for forming stabilizing contacts within the

spike and are hence unavailable for hACE2 binding. (b) The role of glycine residues in both all three RBDs is to
provide a xGzGx motif for binding hACE2 Lys353 using a strong electrostatic (or cation-

interaction). Here, ‘x’ is

a polar residue, and ‘z’ a short chain hydrophobic residue (Ile or Val). The glycine residues along with residue ‘z’’
offer a hinge to present polar residue ‘x’ for strong electrostatic interactions with hACE2 residue Lys353.

194

RaTG13.

195
196

Interestingly, for all three variants the interaction with the hACE2 residue Lys353 with glycine residues in

197

the spike protein is the same. Atomic coordinates of both these complexes were independently, and

198

experimentally confirmed by Song et al.11 in 2018 and Wang et al. in 2020 (manuscript unpublished but

199

structure deposited at - www.rcsb.org/structure/6lzg). Both SARS spike RBDs use a combination of a

200

cation-ߨ and a strong electrostatic interaction to bind with Lys353 whereas RaTG13 uses two electrostatic

201

contacts. One electrostatic interaction is mediated by Thr487 in SARS-CoV-1 and Asn501 (and Asp501)

202

in SARS-CoV-2 (and RaTG13). Two glycine residues and a short hydrophobic residue (‘z’ – Val or Ile)

203

brings Thr487, Asn501, and Asp501 for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13, respectively, within

204

strong electrostatic reach of Lys353 while ensuring another cation-ߨ or an electrostatic interaction

205

between Tyr491, Tyr505, and His505 residues, respectively (see Figure 4b). Mutation Y491A for SARS-

206

CoV-1 has no effect on hACE2 binding but Y505A (and H505A) in SARS-CoV-2 (and RaTG13) reduces

207

binding by more than 40%. However, alanine mutation to any of the hinge glycine residues leads to >70%

208

loss of hACE2 binding in all three RBD-hACE2 complexes. Thus, we recover the strong functional motif

209

xGzGx in the spike RBD which is conserved between all three SARS-CoV strains.

210
211

Analysis of the three hACE2 binding interfaces (see Figure 5a-c) demonstrate that even though all three

212

spike proteins have a similar number of total interface residues (see Figure 5f), SARS-CoV-2 establishes

213

more hydrogen bonded contacts (see Figure 5g) followed by RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-1. Consequently,

214

SARS-CoV-2 exhibits the strongest Rosetta binding energy with hACE2 (see Figure 5d) calculated using

215

ten unique Rosetta energy minimization trajectories. Interestingly, RaTG13 spike residues occupy the

216

largest number of hACE2 residues resulting in the highest reduction (~14% more than SARS-CoV-2) of

217

solvent accessible surface area (SASA) (see Figure 5e). Nevertheless, the associated Rosetta binding

218

energy is 11.2% less than the one for SARS-CoV-2 which forms overall stronger hydrogen-bonded

219

contacts.

234

for the hACE2-ATR1 complex, we used protein-protein docking and Rosetta binding energy screening to

identify the most stable configuration of the complex. Analysis of the hACE2-ATR1 binding interface

reveals 41 hACE2 residues and 26 ATR1 residues at the interface connected by five strong electrostatic

238

binding residues of hACE2 are shared by the ATR1 binding region. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 spike

protein binds hACE2 with ~35% better binding score than ATR1 binds hACE2. RaTG13 and SARS--

240

CoV-1 exhibit ~21% and ~5% better Rosetta binding energies, respectively with hACE2 compared to the

241

hACE2-ATR1 complex. They also share only nine and eight residues, respectively with the ATR1

calculations therefore suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can more effectively than CoV-1 outcompete the
he

hACE2-ATR1 complex thus possibly facilitating the formation of the hACE2-spike complex. This is in

245

line with the respective Cov-1 vs. Cov-2 infectivities.

Figure 6. hACE2 complexes with ATR1, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 spike RBDs along with the
number of shared hACE2 residues (Venn diagram) at their respective binding regions is shown. Residue positions
ns
that are shared between ATR1 and the three spike RBDs (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13) have been
en
listed.

252

We computationally explored the potentially available margin of improvement for the binding affinity of

253

SARS-CoV-2 with hACE2 using the IPRO13 protein design software. We allowed all 21 contacting
ng

254

residues of the RBD of the spike protein to simultaneously mutate. We run two separate design
gn

255

trajectories and, in both cases the best design achieved an approximately 23% improvement in binding
ng

256

affinity using the Rosetta scoring function. This improvement is less than the difference between the
he

257

calculated binding scores of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 implying that SARS-CoV-2 has already
dy

258

achieved most of the theoretically possible binding affinity gain with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1..

259

Interestingly, the network of glycine residues in SARS-CoV-2 is conserved in all redesigned RBDs.

261

A recent report14 analyzes that humans can transfer SARS-CoV-2 to domesticated animals such as dogs,,

262

cats, ducks, and chickens in varying degrees. However, animal-to-human transmission has not been
en

263

observed15. Similar to SARS-CoV-116, felines are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 followed by

264

canines17 whereas chickens and ferrets are less susceptible17. The calculated Rosetta binding energies do

265

not follow the trends (R2=0.383) expected from simply their respective sequence identities with the

266

human ACE2. Interestingly, even though the ACE2 (Uniprot Entry: G1PKW9_MYOLU) of the little

267

brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) is quite different from human (similarity 84.5%, identity 66.7%), we predict

268

a stronger Rosetta binding energy (by about ~5.6%). This is due to the formation of nine electrostatic

269

contacts and one pi-pi stacking. Strong binding with bat ACE2 may be a consequence of the SARS-CoV-

270

2 origins. In all other cases, the Rosetta binding energies of ACE2 with the spike protein were at most

271

78.3% of the one calculated with hACE2. We found that feline ACE2 had the closest (78.3% of hACE2-

272

CoV-2) Rosetta binding energy with the spike compared to other pet or livestock animals.

273
274

Discussion

275

In this effort we apply Rosetta binding analysis to gain insight onto possible biophysical factors that may

276

explain the difference in pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1 and RaTG13.

277

Multiple lines of computational evidence indicate that the spike RBD binds hACE2 through electrostatic

278

attachment with every fourth residue on the N-terminal alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the

279

turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. Results from computational models of canine,

280

feline, bovine, equine, and chicken ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD recapitulates

281

infectivity potential observed so far and pinpoint bat ACE2 as the most highly optimized for binding the

282

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

283
284

Methods

285

We have used experimentally determined coordinates of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in complex

286

with ACE2 (PDB accessions: 6ACG11 and 6LZG - www.rcsb.org/structure/6lzg, respectively). RaTG13

287

RBD model was built using the iTasser program18. Similarly, unbound ATR1 structure (PDB: 4YAY19)

288

was also separately downloaded and docked against hACE2 using protein-protein docking scripts from Z-

289

DOCK 3.020. ZDOCK uses pairwise shape-complementarity, electrostatics, and implicit solvation terms

290

in scoring the docked poses. Implicit solvation treats the water as a dielectric continuum. The rotational

291

sampling interval was set to 10°. Clustering of the docked poses were done at an 8 Å cutoff.

292

Subsequently, PyRosetta21 scripts were written to rank and identify the most stable complexes from each

293

cluster which were then energy-minimized and re-ranked. Finally, the complex which ranked high in

294

stability and binding scores was chosen as the model. An alanine scan was again performed using

295

PyRosetta scripts, where the computational models of the alanine variants were first generated, energy

296

minimized, and hACE2 binding scores computed. The hACE2 interface definitions for each binding

297

partner (RBDs and ATR1) were obtained by feeding the energy minimized protein-protein complexes

298

through the find_contacts module of OptMAVEn-2.022.

We used the three-dimensional atomic coordinates of the experimentally determined human ACE2

300

(hACE2) in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (PDB id: 6ZLG https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6lzg)

301

as a backbone template to repackage the updated residue side-chains of bat, feline, canine, bovine, equine,

302

and chicken ACE2. A python script was prepared to execute multiple times the iTasser program18. First,

303

a fragment structure assembly was performed using replica-exchange Monte Carlo23 followed by

304

clustering of decoy ACE2 structures generated using the SPICKER protocol24. Finally atomic-level

305

backbone and side chain refinement was performed using fragment-guided molecular dynamics

306

simulations (FG-MD)25 for 50ns for each structure. All five ACE2s were subsequently docked with the

307

SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein whose 3D coordinates were downloaded from the hACE2-spike

308

complex (PDB id: 6LZG).
