This antibody may have therapeutic potential alone or with one blocking
receptor attachment

Summary
There are as yet no licenced therapeutics for the COVID-19 pandemic. The causal
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric Spike whose receptor binding
domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating
conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that monoclonal antibody
CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralising SARS-CoV-2 and report the crystal
structure at 2.4 Å of the Fab/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for
entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilising, CR3022 epitope
is inaccessible in the prefusion Spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding would facilitate
conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryo-EM analysis confirms that
incubation of Spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer.
Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously
focus immune responses. Binders at this epitope may be useful therapeutically, possibly
in synergy with an antibody blocking receptor attachment.

Introduction
Incursion of animal (usually bat)-derived coronaviruses into the human population has caused
several outbreaks of severe disease, starting with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)

in 2002 (Menachery et al., 2015). In late 2019 a highly infectious illness, with cold-like
symptoms progressing to pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, resulting in an estimated
6% overall death rate (Baud et al., 2020), with higher mortality among the elderly and
immunocompromised populations, was identified and confirmed as a pandemic by the WHO
on 11th March 2020. The etiological agent is a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging
to lineage B betacoronavirus and sharing 88% sequence identity with bat coronaviruses (Lu
et al., 2020a). The heavily glycosylated trimeric surface Spike protein mediates viral entry
into the host cell. It is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein (the ectodomain alone
comprises over 1200 residues) (Wrapp et al., 2020). It is made as a single polypeptide and
then cleaved by host proteases to yield an N-terminal S1 region and the C-terminal S2 region.
Spike exists initially in a pre-fusion state where the domains of S1 cloak the upper portion of
the spike with the relatively small (~22 kDa) S1 RBD nestled at the tip. The RBD is
predominantly in a ‘down’ state where the receptor binding site is inaccessible, however it
appears that it stochastically flips up with a hinge-like motion transiently presenting the
ACE2 receptor binding site (Roy, 2020; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al.,
2020). ACE2 acts as a functional receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, binding to
the latter with a 10 to 20-fold higher affinity (KD of ~15 nM), possibly contributing to its ease
of transmission (Song et al., 2018; Wrapp et al., 2020). There is 73% sequence identity
between the RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S1). When ACE2 locks on it
holds the RBD ‘up’, destabilising the S1 cloak and possibly favouring conversion to a postfusion form where the S2 subunit, through massive conformational changes, propels its
fusion domain upwards to engage with the host membrane, casting off S1 in the process
(Song et al., 2018; Wrapp et al., 2020). Structural studies of the RBD in complex with ACE2
(Lan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Yan et al., 2020) how that it is recognized by the

protein is an attractive candidate for both vaccine development and immunotherapy. Potent
nanomolar affinity neutralising human monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV RBD
have been identified that attach at the ACE2 receptor binding site (including M396, CR3014
and 80R (Ter Meulen et al., 2006; Sui et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2007)). For example 80R binds
with nanomolar affinity, prevents binding to ACE2 and the formation of syncytia in vitro,
and inhibits viral replication in vivo (Sui et al., 2004). However, despite the two viruses
sharing the same ACE2 receptor these ACE2 blocking antibodies do not bind SARS-CoV-2
RBD (Wrapp et al., 2020). In contrast CR3022, a SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal selected
from a single chain Fv phage display library constructed from lymphocytes of a convalescent
SARS patient and reconstructed into IgG1 format (Ter Meulen et al., 2006), has been
reported to cross-react strongly, binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 with a KD of 6.3 nM
(Tian et al., 2020), whilst not competing with the binding of ACE2 (Ter Meulen et al., 2006).
Furthermore, although SARS-CoV escape mutations could be readily generated for ACE2blocking CR3014, no escape mutations could be generated for CR3022, preventing mapping
of its epitope (Ter Meulen et al., 2006). Furthermore a natural mutation of SARS-CoV-2 has
now been detected at residue 495 (Y N) (GISAID (Shu and McCauley, 2017): Accession
ID: EPI_ISL_429783 Wienecke-Baldacchino et al., 2020), which forms part of the ACE2
binding epitope. Finally, CR3022 and CR3014 act synergistically to neutralise SARS-CoV
with extreme potency (Ter Meulen et al., 2006). Whilst this work was being prepared for
publication a paper reporting that CR3022 does not neutralise SARS-CoV-2 and describing
the structure of the complex with the RBD at 3.1 Å resolution was published (Yuan et al.,
2020). Here we extend the structure analysis to significantly higher resolution and, using a
different neutralisation assay, show that CR3022 does neutralise SARS-CoV-2, but via a
mechanism that would not be detected by the method of Yuan et al (Yuan et al., 2020). We
use cryo-EM analysis of the interaction of CR3022 with the full Spike ectodomain to confirm

this mechanism. Taken together these observations suggest that the CR3022 epitope should
be a major target for therapeutic antibodies.

Results
CR3022 binds tightly to the RBD and allosterically perturbs ACE2 binding
To understand how CR3022 works we first investigated the interaction of CR3022 Fab with
isolated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD, both alone and in the presence of ACE2. Surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements (Methods and Figure S2) confirmed that CR3022
binding to RBD is strong (although weaker than the binding reported to SARS-CoV (Ter
Meulen et al., 2006)), with a slight variation according to whether CR3022 or RBD is used as
the analyte (KD = 30 nM and 15 nM respectively, derived from the kinetic data in Table S1).
An independent measure using Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) with RBD as analyte gave a
KD of 19 nM (Methods and Figure S2). These values are quite similar to those reported by
Tian et al. (Tian et al., 2020) (6.6 nM), whereas weaker binding (KD ~ 115 nM) was reported
recently by Yuan et al. (Yuan et al., 2020). Using SPR to perform a competition assay
revealed that the binding of ACE2 to the RBD is perturbed by the presence of CR3022
(Figure S3). The presence of ACE2 slows the binding of CR3022 to RBD and accelerates the
dissociation. Similarly, the release of ACE2 from RBD is accelerated by the presence of
CR3022. These observations are suggestive of an allosteric effect between ACE2 and
CR3022.

CR3022 neutralises SARS-CoV-2
A plaque reduction neutralisation test using SARS-CoV-2 virus and CR3022 showed an
ND50 of 1:201 for a starting concentration of 2mg/mL (calculated according to Grist (Grist,
1966)), superior to that of MERS convalescent serum (ND50 of 1:149) used as a NIBSC

international standard positive control (see Methods and Table S2). This corresponds to 50%
neutralisation at ~70 nM (~10.5 ug/mL). This is similar to the neutralising concentration
(50% neutralisation at 11 ug/mL) reported by Ter Meulen et al. (Ter Meulen et al., 2006) for
SARS-CoV, however, as discussed below, it is in apparent disagreement with the result
reported recently by Yuan et al. (Yuan et al., 2020).

Structure determination of RBD-CR3022 Fab complex
We determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-CR3022 Fab complex (see
Methods and Table S3) to investigate the relationship between the binding epitopes of ACE2
and CR3022. Crystals grew rapidly and consistently. Two crystal forms grew in the same
drop. The solvent content of the crystal form solved first was unusually high (ca 87%) with
the ACE2 binding site exposed to large continuous solvent channels within the crystal lattice
(Figure S4). These crystals therefore offer a promising vehicle for crystallographic screening
to identify potential therapeutics that could act to block virus attachment. The current
analysis of this crystal form is at 4.4 Å resolution and so, to avoid overfitting, refinement
used a novel real-space refinement algorithm to optimise the phases (Vagabond, HMG
unpublished, see Methods). This, together with the favourable observation to parameter ratio
resulting from the exceptionally high solvent content, meant that the map was of very high
quality, allowing reliable structural interpretation (Figure S5, Methods). Full interpretation of
the detailed interactions between CR3022 and the RBD was enabled by the second crystal
form which diffracted to high resolution, 2.4 Å, and the structure of which was refined to
give an R-work/R-free of 0.213/0.239 and good stereochemistry (Methods, Table S3, Figure
S5).

CR3022 binding epitope is highly conserved and inaccessible in prefusion S protein

The high-resolution structure is shown in Figure 1a. There are two complexes in the crystal
asymmetric unit with residues 331-529 in one RBD, 332-445 and 448-532 in the other RBD
well defined, whilst residues133-136 of the CR3022 heavy chains are disordered. The RBD
has a very similar structure to that seen in the complex of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2,
rmsd for 194 Ca atoms of 0.6 Å2 (PDB, 6M0J (Lan et al., 2020)), and an rmsd of 1.1 Å2
compared to the SARS CoV RBD (PDB, 2AJF (Li et al., 2005)). Only minor conformational
changes are introduced by binding to CR3022, at residues 381-390. The RBD was
deglycosylated (Methods) to leave a single saccharide unit at each of the N-linked
glycosylation sites clearly seen at N331 and N343 (Figure S5). CR3022 attaches to the RBD
surface orthogonal to the ACE2 receptor binding site. There is no overlap between the
epitopes and indeed both the Fab and ACE2 ectodomain can bind without clashing (Figure
1d) (Tian et al., 2020). Such independence of the ACE2 binding site has been reported
recently for another SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody, 47D11 (Wang et al., 2020a). The
Fab complex interface buries 990 Å2 of surface area (600 and 390 Å2 by the heavy and light
chains respectively, Figure 2a and Figure S6), somewhat more than the RBD-ACE2 interface
which covers 850 Å2 (PDB 6M0J (Lan et al., 2020)). Typical of a Fab complex, the
interaction is mediated by the antibody CDR loops, which fit well into the rather sculpted
surface of the RBD (Figure 1b, c). The heavy chain CDR1, 2 and 3 make contacts to residues
from α2, β2 and α3 (residues 369-386), while two of the light chain CDRs (1 and 2) interact
mainly with residues from the β2-α3 loop, α3 (380-392) and the α5-β4 loop (427-430)
(Figures 1, S1, S7). A total of 16 residues from the heavy chain and 14 from the light chain
cement the interaction with 26 residues from the RBD. For the heavy chain these potentially
form 7 H-bonds and 3 salt bridges, the latter from D55 and E57 (CDR2) to K378 of the RBD.
Whilst the light chain interface comprises 6 H-bonds and a single salt bridge between E61
(CDR2) and K386 of the RBD. The binding is consolidated by a number of hydrophobic

interactions (Figure S7b). Of the 26 residues involved in the interaction 23 are conserved
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2b and Figure S1). The CR30222 epitope is
much more conserved than that of the receptor blocking anti-SARS-CoV antibody 80R for
which only 13 of the 29 interacting residues are conserved (Hwang et al., 2006), in-line with
the lack of cross reactivity observed for the latter.

The reason for the conservation of the CR3022 epitope becomes clear in the context of the
complete pre-fusion S structure (PDB IDs: 6VSB (Wrapp et al., 2020), 6VXX, 6VYB (Walls
et al., 2020)) where the epitope is inaccessible (Figure 3). When the RBD is in the ‘down’
configuration the CR3022 epitope is packed tightly against another RBD of the trimer and the
N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighbouring protomer. In the structure of the pre-fusion
form of trimeric Spike the majority of RBDs are ‘down’, although presumably stochastically
one may be ‘up’ (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). The structure of a SARS-CoV
complex with ACE2 ectodomain shows that this ‘up’ configuration is competent to bind
receptor, and that there are a family of ‘up’ orientations with significantly different hinge
angles (Song et al., 2018). However, the CR3022 epitope remains largely inaccessible even in
the ‘up’ configuration. Modelling the rotation of the RBD required to enable Fab interaction
in the context of the Spike trimer, showed a rotation corresponding to a > 60° further
declination from the central vertical axis was required, beyond that observed previously
(Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) (Figure 3i), although this might be partly mitigated by
more complex movements of the RBD and if more than one RBD is in the ‘up’ configuration
this requirement would be relaxed somewhat. Since locking the up state by receptor blocking
antibodies is thought to destabilise the pre-fusion state (Walls et al., 2019) binding of
CR3022 presumably introduces further destabilisation, leading to a premature conversion to
the post-fusion state, inactivating the virus. CR3022 and ACE2 blocking antibodies can bind

independently but both induce an ‘up’ conformation, presumably explaining the observed
synergy between binding at the two sites (Ter Meulen et al., 2006).

Mechanism of neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 by CR3022 confirmed by cryo-EM
To test if CR3022 binding destabilises the prefusion state of Spike, the ectodomain construct
described previously (Wrapp et al., 2020) was used to produce glycosylated protein in HEK
cells (Methods). Cryo-EM screening showed that the protein was in the trimeric prefusion
conformation. Spike was then mixed with an excess of CR3022 Fab and incubated at room
temperature, with aliquots being taken at 50 minutes and 3 hours. Aliquots were immediately
applied to cryo-EM grids and frozen (Methods). For the 50 minutes incubation, collection of
a substantial amount of data allowed unbiased particle picking and 2D classification which
revealed two major structural classes with a similar number in each, (i) the prefusion
conformation, and (ii) a radically different conformation (Methods, Table S4 and Figure S8).
Detailed analysis of the prefusion conformation led to a structure at a nominal resolution of
3.4 Å (FSC = 0.143), based on a broad distribution of orientations, that revealed the same
predominant RBD pattern (one ‘up’ and two ‘down’) previously seen (Wrapp et al., 2020)
with no evidence of CR3022 binding (Figure 4a, Figure S9). Analysis of the other major
particle class revealed strong preferential orientation of the particles on the grid (Figure
S10a). Despite this a reconstruction with a nominal resolution of 3.9 Å within the plane of the
grid, and perhaps 7 Å resolution in the perpendicular direction (Figure S10b), could be
produced which allowed the unambiguous fitting of the CR3022-RBD complex (Figure 4b).
Note that in addition there is less well defined density attached to the RBD, in a suitable
position to correspond to the Spike N-terminal domain (Wrapp et al., 2020). These structures
are no longer trimeric, rather two complexes associate to form an approximately symmetric
dimer (however, application of this symmetry in the reconstruction process did not improve

the resolution). The interactions responsible for dimerisation involve the ACE2 binding site
on the RBD and the elbow of the Fab, however the interaction does not occur in our lowresolution crystal form and is therefore probably extremely weak and not biologically
significant. Since conversion to the post-fusion conformation leads to dissociation of S1
(which includes the N-terminal domain and RBD) these results confirm that CR3022
destabilises the prefusion Spike conformation. Further evidence of this is provided by
analysis of data collected after 3 h incubation. By this point there were no intact trimers
remaining and a heterogeneous range of oligomeric assemblies had appeared, which we were
not able to interpret in detail but which are consistent with the lateral assembly of Fab/RBD
complexes (Figure S11). Note that the relatively slow kinetics will not be representative of
events in vivo, where the conversion might be accelerated by the elevated temperature and the
absence of the mutations which were added to this construct to stabilise the prefusion state
(Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Wrapp et al., 2020).

Discussion

Until now the only documented mechanism of neutralisation of coronaviruses has been
through blocking receptor attachment. In the case of SARS-CoV this is achieved by
presentation of the RBD of the Spike in an ‘up’ conformation. Although not yet confirmed
for SARS-CoV-2 it is very likely that a similar mechanism can apply. Here we define a
second class of neutralisers, that bind a highly conserved epitope (Figure S1) and can
therefore act against both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (CR3022 was first identified as a
neutralising antibody against SARS-CoV (Ter Meulen et al., 2006)). We find that binding of
CR3022 to the isolated RBD is tight (~20 nM) and the crystal structure of the complex
reveals the atomic detail of the interaction. Despite the spatial separation of the CR3022 and
ACE2 epitopes we find an allosteric effect between the two binding events. The role of the

CR3022 epitope in stabilising the prefusion Spike trimer explains why it has, to date, proved
impossible to generate mutations that escape binding of the antibody (Ter Meulen et al.,
2006).

Whilst in our assay CR3022 neutralises SARS-CoV-2, a recent paper (Yuan et al., 2020)
reported an alternative assay that did not detect neutralisation. The difference is likely due to
their removal of the antibody/virus mix after adsorption to the indicator cells, before
incubating to allow cytopathic effect (CPE) to develop. This would be in-line with the
distinction previously seen between neutralisation tests for influenza virus by antibodies
which bind the stem of hemagglutinin and therefore do not block receptor binding (Thomson
et al., 2012). These antibodies did not appear to be neutralising when tested with the standard
WHO neutralisation assay, in which a similar protocol is used to that adopted by Yuan et al,
in which the inoculum of virus/antibody is washed out before development of CPE.
Neutralisation was observed, however, when the antibodies were left in the assay during
incubation to produce CPE. By analogy we would expect antibodies to the RBD that block
attachment to ACE2 to behave in a similar way to antibodies against the globular head of
HA, whilst antibodies such as CR3022, that neutralise by an alternative mechanism to
blocking receptor attachment, may need to be present throughout the incubation period with
the indicator cells to reveal neutralisation. This agrees with our observation that, in the
absence of ACE2, the CR3022 Fab destroys the prefusion-stabilised trimer (T1/2 ~1h at room
temperature as measured by cryo-EM).

With monoclonal antibodies now recognised as potential antivirals (Lu et al., 2020b; Salazar
et al., 2017) our results suggest that CR3022 may be of immediate utility, since the
mechanism of neutralisation will be unusually resistant to virus escape. In contrast antibodies
which compete with ACE2 (whose epitope on SARS-CoV-2 is reported to have already

shown mutation at residue 495 (GISAID: Accession ID: EPI_ISL_429783 WieneckeBaldacchino et al., 2020 (Shu and McCauley, 2017)), are likely to be susceptible to escape.
Furthermore, with knowledge of the detailed structure of the epitope presented here a higher
affinity version of CR3022 might be engineered. Alternatively, since the same mechanism of
neutralisation is likely to be used by other antibodies, a more potent monoclonal antibody
targeting the same epitope might be found (for instance by screening for competition with
CR3022). Additionally, since this epitope is sterically and functionally independent of the
well-established receptor-blocking neutralising antibody epitope there is considerable scope
for therapeutic synergy between antibodies targeting the two epitopes (indeed this type of
synergy has been described for SARS-CoV (Ter Meulen et al., 2006)). Moreover, it has been
reported (Wan et al., 2019) that antibody mediated enhancement occurs via antibodies that
mimic receptor attachment whereas CR3022-like binding might circumvent this by preattachment conversion to the post-fusion state. Finally, display of this epitope on an RBDbased vaccine antigen might focus immune responses, conceivably mitigating the
immunopathology reported for SARS-CoV (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005; Tseng et al.,
2012).

CR3022 used for neutralisation: The heavy and kappa light variable genes of the antibody
were sourced from the Genbank ABA54613.1 and ABA54614.1 respectively and the codon
optimised sequences were synthesized by GeneArt. These sequences were cloned into
Antibody expression vectors (Genbank FJ475055 and FJ475056). Antibody was expressed
using ExpiCHO expression system (LifeTechnologies) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and purified using a Protein A MabSelect SuRE column (GE Healthcare). The wash
buffer contained 20mM Tris & 150mM NaCl buffered to pH 8.6 and the elution was done
using 0.1 M Citric acid pH 2.5. The eluate was neutralised immediately using 1.5 M Tris pH
8.6 and then buffer exchanged to PBS using a 15 ml 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter (Merck
Millipore).

Validation and protein production: All vectors were sequenced to confirm clones were
correct. Recombinant RBD, ACE2, CR3022 Fab and CR3022 IgG were transiently expressed
in Expi293™ (ThermoFisher Scientific, UK) and proteins were purified from culture
supernatants by an immobilised metal affinity using an automated protocol implemented on
an ÄKTAxpress (GE Healthcare, UK) (Nettleship et al., 2009), followed by a Hiload 16/60
superdex 75 or a Superdex 200 10/300GL column, using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH
7.4 buffer. Recombinant Spike ectodomain was expressed by transient transfection in
HEK293S GnTI- cells (ATCC CRL-3022) for 9 days at 30 °C. Conditioned media was
dialysed against 2x phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 buffer. The Spike ectodomain was
purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography using Talon resin (Takara Bio)
charged with cobalt followed by size exclusion chromatography using HiLoad 16/60
Superdex 200 column in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3 at 4 °C, before

Surface plasmon resonance
Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 (GE
Healthcare). All assays were performed with a running buffer of PBS pH 7.4 supplemented
with 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. To determine the binding kinetics
between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and CR3022 mAb, two different experimental settings
were attempted. The first experiment was performed with the use of a CAP sensor chip (GE
Healthcare). Biotin CAPture Reagent provided in the Biotin CAPture Kit (GE Healthcare)
was captured onto the sensor chip according to manufacturer’s instructions. The RBD with a
BirA tag was biotinylated using a biotinylation kit (Avidity, LLC) and was immobilized
through the Biotin CAPture Reagent, at a density of 15-30 RU on the sample flow cell. The
reference flow cell was left blank. The CR3022 Fab was injected over the two flow cells at a
range of five concentrations prepared by serial two-fold dilution from 95 nM, at a flow rate of
30 μL/min using a Single-cycle kinetics program with an association time of 60 s and a
dissociation time of 60 s. Running buffer was also injected using the same program for
background subtraction. The second experiment was performed using a Sensor Chip Protein
A (GE Healthcare). CR3022 IgG was immobilised at a density of approximately 30 RU on
the sample flow cell. The reference flow cell was left blank. The RBD was injected over the
two flow cells at a range of five concentrations prepared by serial two-fold dilution from 100
nM, at a flow rate of 30 μL/min using a Single-cycle kinetics program with an association
time of 75 s and a dissociation time of 60 s. Running buffer was also injected using the same
program for background subtraction. All data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using the
Biacore T200 Evaluation Software 3.1. In the competition assay where CR3022 IgG was
used as the ligand, approximately 1000 RU of CR3022 IgG was immobilised onto a Sensor
Chip Protein A. The following samples were injected: (1) 1 µM ACE2, (2) 1 µM (antiCaspr2) E08R Fab; (3) a mixture of 1 µM ACE2 and 0.1 µM RBD, (4) a mixture of 1 µM

E08R Fab and 0.1 µM RBD, and (4) 0.1 µM RBD. In the competition assay where ACE2hIgG1Fc was used as the ligand, approximately 1000 RU of ACE2-hIgG1Fc was
immobilised onto a Sensor Chip Protein A. The following samples were injected: (1) 1 µM
CR3022 Fab, (2) 1 µM E08R Fab; (3) a mixture of 1 µM CR3022 Fab and 0.1 µM RBD, (4)

performed with an association time of 60 s and a dissociation time of 600 s. All curves were
plotted using GraphPad Prism 8.

Bio-layer interferometry
To further validate the SPR results the KD of Fab CR3022 for RBD was also measured by
bio-layer interferometry. Kinetic assays were performed on an Octet Red 96e (ForteBio) at
30

℃ with a shake speed of 1000 rpm. Fab CR3022 was immobilized onto amine reactive

， ， ，

2nd generation (AR2G) biosensors (ForteBio) and serially diluted RBD (80 40 20 10
and 5 nM) was used as analyte. PBS (pH 7.4) was used as the assay buffer. Recorded data
were analysed using the Data Analysis Software HT v11.1 (Fortebio), with a global 1:1
fitting model.

Neutralisation
Neutralising virus titres were measured in serum samples that had been heat-inactivated at 56
°C for 30 minutes. SARS-CoV-2 (strain Victoria/1/2020 at cell passage 3 (Caly et al., 2020))
was diluted to a concentration of 1.4E+03 pfu/mL (70 pfu/50 µ l) and mixed 50:50 in 1%
FCS/MEM containing 25 mM HEPES buffer with doubling serum dilutions from 1:10 to
1:320 in a 96-well V-bottomed plate.

The plate was incubated at 37 °C in a humidified box for 1 hour to allow the antibody in the
serum samples to neutralise the virus. CR3022 (pH7.2) at a starting concentration of 2
mg/mL was diluted 1 in 10. The dilutions were then made 2-fold up to 320. The neutralised
virus was transferred into the wells of a twice DPBS-washed plaque assay 24-well plate that
had been seeded with Vero/hSLAM the previous day at 1.5E+05 cells per well in 10%
FCS/MEM. Neutralised virus was allowed to adsorb at 37 °C for a further hour, and overlaid
with plaque assay overlay media (1X MEM/1.5% CMC/4% FCS final). After 5 days
incubation at 37 °C in a humified box, the plates were fixed, stained and plaques counted.
Dilutions and controls were performed in duplicate. Median neutralising titres (ND50) were
determined using the Spearman-Karber formula (Kärber, 1931) relative to virus only control
wells.

Crystallization, data collection and X-ray structure determination
Purified and deglycosylated RBD and CR3022 Fab were concentrated to 8.3 mg/mL and 11
mg/mL respectively, and then mixed in an approximate molar ratio of 1:1. Crystallization
screen experiments were carried out using the nanolitre sitting-drop vapour diffusion method
in 96-well plates as previously described (Walter et al., 2003, 2005). Crystals were initially
obtained from Hampton Research PEGRx HT screen, condition 63 containing 0.1 M Sodium
malonate, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0 and 30% w/v Polyethylene glycol 1,000. The best crystals were
grown in drops containing 200 nl sample and 100 nl reservoir solution.

Crystals were mounted in loops and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection.
Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline I03 of Diamond Light Source, UK.
Diffraction images of 0.1° rotation were recorded on an Eiger2 XE 16M detector (exposure
time of either 0.002 s or 0.01 s per frame, beam size 80×20 μm and 100% beam

transmission). Data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the automated data processing
program Xia2-dials (Winter, 2010; Winter et al., 2018). The data set of 720° was collected
from a single frozen crystal to 4.4 Å resolution with 52-fold redundancy. The crystal belongs
to space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 150.5 Å and c = 241.6 Å. The
structure was determined by molecular replacement with PHASER (McCoy et al., 2007)
using search models of human germline antibody Fabs 5-51/O12 (PDB ID, 4KMT
(Teplyakov et al., 2014)) heavy chain and IGHV3-23/IGK4-1 (PDB ID, 5I1D (Teplyakov et
al., 2016)) light chain, and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex (PDB ID, 6M0J (Lan
et al., 2020)). There is one RBD/CR3022 complex in the crystal asymmetric unit, resulting in
a crystal solvent content of ~87%.

During optimization of the crystallization conditions, a second crystal form was found to
grow in the same condition with similar morphology. A data set of 720° rotation with data
extending to 2.4 Å was collected on beamline I03 of Diamond from one of these crystals
(exposure time 0.004 s per 0.1° frame, beam size 80×20 μm and 100% beam transmission).
The crystal also belongs to space group P41212 but with significantly different unit cell
dimensions (a = b = 163.1 Å and c = 189.1 Å). There were two RBD/CR3022 complexes in
the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of ~74%.

X-ray crystallographic refinement and electron density map generation
The initial structure was determined using the lower resolution data from the first crystal
form. Data were excluded at a resolution below 35 Å as these fell under the beamstop
shadow. One cycle of REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011) was used to refine atomic
coordinates after manual correction in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) to the protein
sequence from the search model. The software suite Vagabond was used to convert the

atomic model into a bond-based description suited for low resolution refinement (Ginn,
submitted). This described the protein model through a series of identical but positionally
displaced conformers (referred to as an ensemble). The flexibility was described through
whole-molecule translations and rotations per polypeptide chain and intramolecular
flexibility through variation in torsion angles of bonds connecting C-alpha atoms. These
torsion variations were constrained, with bonds of a similar effect on the flexibility of the
protein structure moving in tandem. A global B factor of 130 was applied to the model to
account for most of the disorder in the crystal. Alternate rounds of refinement were
performed of (a) these flexibility parameters and (b) rigid body refinement of each
polypeptide chain, for both the target function was the correlation coefficient with the
electron density in real space. Local adjustments of atoms were performed in COOT (Emsley
and Cowtan, 2004) using the Vagabond map and average model output coordinates. After
local real-space refinement, updated coordinates were reloaded into Vagabond and bond
torsion angles were adjusted to match them. Best electron density maps accounting for
sources of phase error were output as a list of Fourier coefficients. Maps were sharpened by
applying a B factor of -100 (Figure S5). The final refined structure had an Rwork of 0.331
(Rfree, 0.315) for all data to 4.36 Å resolution. This structure was later used to determine the
structure of the second crystal form, which has been refined with PHENIX (Liebschner et al.,
2019) to Rwork = 0.213 and Rfree = 0.239 for all data to 2.42 Å resolution. This refined model
revealed the presence of one extra residue at each heavy chain N-terminus and 3 extra
residues at the N-terminus of one RBD from the signal peptide. There is well ordered density
for a single glycan at each of the glycosylation sites at N331 and N343 in one RBD, and only
one at N343 in the second RBD.

Data collection and structure refinement statistics are given in Table S3. Structural
comparisons used SHP (Stuart et al., 1979), residues forming the RBD/Fab interface were
identified with PISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007), figures were prepared with PyMOL (The
PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.2r3pre, Schrödinger, LLC).

CR3022 Fab complex preparation and cryo-EM data collection
Purified spike protein was buffer exchanged into 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.02 %
NaN3 buffer using a desalting column (Zeba, Thermo Fisher). A final concentration of 0.2
mg/mL was incubated with CR3022 Fab (in the same buffer) in a 6:1 molar ratio (Fab to
trimeric spike) at room temperature. Aliquots were taken at 50 minutes and 3 h. Immediately
an aliquot was taken 3 μL of it was applied to a holey carbon-coated 200mesh copper grid
(C-Flat, CF-2/1, Protochips) that had been freshly glow discharged on high for 20 s (Plasma
Cleaner PDC-002-CE, Harrick Plasma) and excess liquid removed by blotting for 6 s with a
blotting force of -1 using vitrobot filter paper (grade 595, Ted Pella Inc.) at 4.5 ºC, 100 %
relative humidity. Blotted grids were then immediately plunge frozen using a Vitrobot Mark
IV (Thermo Fisher).

Frozen grids were first screened on a Glacios microscope operating at 200 kV (Thermo
Fisher) before imaging on a Titan Krios G2 (Thermo Fischer) at 300 kV. Movies (40 frames
each) were collected in compressed tiff format on a K3 detector (Gatan) in super resolution
counting mode using a custom EPU version 2.5 (Thermo Fischer) with a defocus range of
0.8-2.6 μm and at a nominal magnification of x105,000, corresponding to a calibrated pixel
size of 0.83 Å/pixel, see Table S4.

For both the 50 minute and 3 h incubation datasets, motion correction and alignment of 2x
binned super-resolution movies was performed using Relion3.1. CTF-estimation with GCTF
(v1.06) (Zhang, 2016) and non-template-driven particle picking was then performed within
cryoSPARC v2.14.1-live followed by multiple rounds of 2D classification (Punjani et al.,
2017).
For the 50 minutes dataset. 2D class averages for structure-A and structure-B were then used
separately for template-driven classification before further rounds of 2D and 3D classification
with C1 symmetry. Both structures were then sharpened in cryoSPARC. Data processing and
refinement statistics are given in Table S4.

An initial model for the spike (structure-A) was generated using PDB ID, 6VYB (Walls et
al., 2020) and rigid body fitted into the final map using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004).
The model was further refined in real space with PHENIX (Liebschner et al., 2019) which
resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.84. Two copies of RBD-CR3022 were fitted into
structure-B in the same manner. Because of the strongly anisotropic resolution the overall
correlation coefficient vs the model was lower (0.47).
For the 3 h incubation dataset, particles were extracted with a larger box size (686 pixels as
compared to 540 pixels), and, following multiple rounds of 2D classification, 2D class
averages from ‘blob-picked’ particles showing signs of complete ‘flower-like’ structures
were selected for ab initio reconstruction. For the 3 h data no detailed fitting was attempted.

Figure 3 | The CR3022 binding regions are inaccessible in the pre-fusion form of the S
protein. Panels a-c provide an overview. a, The pre-fusion state of the S protein with all
RBDs in the down conformation (generated by superposing our RBD structure on the prefusion trimer of ref (Wrapp et al., 2020)). The viral membrane would be at the bottom of the
picture. All of S1 and S2 are shown in yellow, apart from the RBD, which is shown in grey,
with the CR3022 epitope coloured green. a, A cut-way of the trimer showing, in red, the dipeptide (residues 986-987) which has been mutated to PP to confer stability on the pre-fusion
state. Note the proximity to the CR3022 epitope. c, Showing a top view of the molecule (also
used for panels d-f). One of the RBDs has been drawn in light grey in the down configuration

coronavirus Spikes, but extending the motion sufficiently to allow CR3022 to bind. The PP
motif is shown in red and the glycosylated residue N343 in magenta. Panels d-f show the
trimer viewed from above d – all RBDs down, e – one RBD up f – one RBD rotated (as in c)
to allow access to CR3022. Panels g-i are equivalent structures to d-f, but are viewed from
the side. In e bound ACE2 is shown and in f CR3022.
