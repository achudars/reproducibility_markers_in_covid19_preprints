ABSTRACT

39

The beginning of 2020 brought us information about the novel coronavirus emerging in China.

40

Rapid research resulted in the characterization of the pathogen, which appeared to be a member

41

of the SARS-like cluster, commonly seen in bats. Despite the global and local efforts, the virus

42

escaped the healthcare measures and rapidly spread in China and later globally, officially

43

causing a pandemic and global crisis in March 2020. At present, different scenarios are being

44

written to contain the virus, but the development of novel anticoronavirals for all highly

45

pathogenic coronaviruses remains the major challenge. Here, we describe the antiviral activity

46

of previously developed by us HTCC compound (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium

47

chitosan chloride), which may be used as potential inhibitor of currently circulating highly

48

pathogenic coronaviruses – SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.

INTRODUCTION

50

Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans, other mammals,

51

and birds. However, some species can cause more severe conditions such as hepatitis,

52

peritonitis, or neurological disease. Seven coronaviruses infect humans, four of which (human

53

coronavirus [HCoV]-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1) cause relatively

54

mild upper and lower respiratory tract disease. Other three zoonotic coronaviruses - the severe

55

acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East

56

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are associated with severe, life-threatening

57

respiratory infections and multiorgan failure 1-7.

58

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the Hubei province of China by the end of 2019 and caused

59

an epidemic that was partially contained in China by March 2020. However, the virus rapidly

60

spread globally and caused the pandemic 8. SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus and belongs to

61

a large cluster of SARS-like viruses in bats, classified in Sarbecovirus subgenus. While bats

62

are considered to be the original reservoir, it is believed that there is an intermediate host, and

63

pangolins were suggested as such 9. The virus is associated with a respiratory illness that, in a

64

proportion of cases, is severe. The mortality rate varies between locations, but at present, is

65

estimated to reach 3-4% globally. The virus infects primarily ciliated cells and type II

66

pneumocytes in human airways, hijacking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to

67

enter the cell, similarly as SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63.

68

MERS-CoV is related to SARS-CoV-2, but together with some bat viruses forms

69

a separate Merbecovirus subgenus. Bats are believed to serve as an original reservoir also in

70

this case 10, but camels were identified as the intermediate host 11. The virus never fully crossed

71

the species border, as the human-to-human transmission is limited, and almost all the cases are

72

associated with animal-to-human transmission. The entry receptor for MERS-CoV is the

73

dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)

12,13

. In humans, MERS-CoV causes a respiratory illness with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.014183; this version posted March 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

74

severity varying from asymptomatic to potentially fatal acute respiratory distress 14-16. To date,

75

MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in 27 countries, with over 2,000 cases and a mortality rate

76

of ~35%.

77

Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs with proven efficacy to treat coronavirus

78

infection, and treatment is limited to supportive care. However, a range of therapeutics have

79

been experimentally used in clinic to treat SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-infected patients, and

80

their use is based on the knowledge obtained in previous years. The most promising drug

81

candidates include broad-spectrum polymerase inhibitors (remdesivir) 17 and some re-purposed

82

drugs (e.g., HIV-1 protease inhibitors). However, until today none of these has proven effective

83

in randomized controlled trials. On the other hand, the antiviral potential of several small

84

molecules have been demonstrated in cell lines in vitro, but their effectiveness in vivo have not

85

been confirmed 18,19. For the ones that reached animal models, some promising drug candidates

86

have been shown to exacerbate the disease (ribavirin, mycophenolic acid) 20.

87

Drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV is of great importance, but

88

considering the diversity of coronaviruses and the proven propensity to cross the species barrier,

89

the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is probably not the last one. Warnings about the possibility of

90

another SARS-CoV epidemic have appeared in the scientific literature for a long time

91

Consequently, broad-spectrum antivirals are essential in long-term perspective.

21

.

92

Previously, we have demonstrated an antiviral potential of the HTCC polymer (N-(2-

93

hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride), which efficiently hampered

94

infection of all low pathogenic human coronaviruses in vitro and ex vivo 22 and several animal

95

coronaviruses (unpublished data). Furthermore, using several functional and structural assays,

96

we dissected the mechanism of the HTCC antiviral activity. We showed that the polymer

97

interacts with the coronaviral Spike (S) protein and blocks its interaction with the cellular

98

receptor 22-24. Here, we analyzed the HTCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.014183; this version posted March 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

99

vitro using permissive cell lines and ex vivo, using a model of human airway epithelium (HAE).

100

The study showed that the replication of both viruses was efficiently hampered. Overall, our

101

data show that HTCC polymers are potent broad-spectrum anticoronavirals and may be very

102

promising drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.

104

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

105

HTCCs hamper MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell lines

106

Previously, we showed that HTCC with different degrees of substitution (DSs) is a

107

potent inhibitor of all four low pathogenic HCoVs 22. DSs are expressed as the fraction of NH2

108

groups of gluocosamine units in chitosan substituted with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride

109

(GTMAC). The DS of the studied HTCC polymers varied between 57% and 77%; thus, the

110

polymers were named HTCC-57, HTCC-62, HTCC-63, HTCC-65, and HTCC-77. The

111

synthesis and characterization of polymers are described elsewhere 22,23. The analysis showed

112

that HTCC-63 demonstrated the most significant inhibitory effect on HCoV-NL63, HCoV-

113

OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. On the other hand, HTCC-62 and HTCC-77 proved to be effective

114

inhibitors of HCoV-229E infection. Further, HTCC-65 effectively inhibited the replication of

115

HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43, while HTCC-62 showed a potent antiviral effect on HCoV-

116

HKU1 infection.

117

The study on the MERS-CoV using the Vero cells revealed that all HTCC variants

118

inhibit virus replication to a similar extent (~100-1000-time decrease in viral yields), at non-

119

toxic concentration (Figure 1A, C). The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6

120

cells was even more pronounced, and all HTCC variants inhibited virus replication by ~10,000

121

times at non-toxic concentration (Figure 1B, C). In this case, the HTCC-63 was arbitrarily

122

selected for further studies on MERS-CoV, while HTCC-77 was selected for SARS-CoV-2.

infected with MERS-CoV (A), and Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (B). Briefly, cultures were
inoculated with a given virus in the presence of HTCC (100 μg/ml) or control PBS. Replication of viruses was
evaluated at 48 h post-inoculation using RT-qPCR. The data are presented as Log Removal Value (LRV) compared
to the untreated sample. The assay was performed in triplicate, and average values with standard errors are
shown. (C) Cytotoxicity of HTCCs with DS ranging from 57% to 77% in vitro at 100 μg/ml. Cell viability was assessed

differences in cytotoxicity of HTCCs were not statistically significant.

Next, the dose-dependence was tested for the HTCCs. The inhibitory activity of selected

135

polymers was verified for three different concentrations, and obtained data are shown in Figure

The parameters observed for the SARS-CoV-2 appear to be favorable with SI above 12. It is

also worth to note that HTCC was previously administered by inhalation in rats, and no adverse

150

reactions were observed 25. In that study, HTCC was used as a carrier for the active substance,

151

and as such, was reported to be promising for local sustained inhalation therapy of pulmonary

152

diseases.

153

HTCCs hamper MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway epithelium

154

While the Vero cells constitute a convenient model for antiviral research, it is of utmost

155

importance to verify whether the results obtained are not biased due to the artificial system

156

used. This is especially important for compounds, which activity is based on electrostatic

157

interaction. To verify whether the natural microenvironment, which is rich in sugars and

158

charged molecules, does not abrogate the effectiveness of the inhibitors, we employed HAE

159

cultures that mirror the fully differentiated layer linng the conductive airways, as well as the

160

site of coronavirus replication. Briefly, fully differentiated HAE cultures were infected with a

161

given virus

162

Following inoculation, apical lavage samples were collected daily, and replication kinetics for

163

each virus was investigated. The analysis revealed that the polymer efficiently hampered

164

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV also in this model. For MERS-CoV, the inhibitory effect was

165

the most evident at 72 h p.i., while for SARS-CoV-2 the most substantial decline of virus

166

progeny was observed at 24 h p.i. (Figure 3). Whether such kinetics will be reflected in vivo it

167

is to be investigated.

Figure 3. Ex vivo inhibition of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by HTCC in human airway epithelium cultures. HAE
cultures were exposed to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of HTCC-63 (for MERS-CoV) or HTCC-77 (for
SARS-CoV-2) at 200 μg/ml or control PBS. To analyze virus replication kinetics, each day post infection, 100 μl of
1 × PBS was applied to the apical surface of HAE cultures and collected after 10 min of incubation at 37°C.
Replication of viruses was evaluated using quantitative RT-qPCR. The data are presented as Log Removal Value
(LRV) compared to the untreated sample. The assay was performed in triplicate, and average values with
standard errors are shown.

182

HTCCs inhibits MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 entry into susceptible cells

183

Our previous research showed that the HTCC-mediated inhibition of coronaviral

184

replication results from the electrostatic interaction between the polymer and the Spike protein

185

of coronaviruses. We hypothesize that the selectivity of the inhibitors yields from the fitting

186

charge distributions on the polymer and on the S proteins on the viral surface. While the

187

interaction of a single charged moiety is relatively weak, the concatemeric nature of the virus

188

and the polymer stabilizes the binding. Such structure-based interaction may be an interesting

189

entry point for further fine-tuning of the polymeric inhibitors of viral replication.

190

To ensure that the observed effect was a result of coronavirus entry inhibition by HTCC,

191

two experiments were performed. First, HAE cultures were inoculated with MERS-CoV in the

192

presence of HTCC-63 (200 μg/ml) or control PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Next, cells

193

were fixed, immunostained for MERS-CoV N protein and actin. Virus entry was analyzed with

194

confocal microscopy. To visualize the effect, the signal attributed to intracellular MERS-CoV

was quantified, and the results show that the internalization of MERS-CoV was drastically

decreased (Figure 4A).

Figure 4. Coronavirus internalization into susceptible cells is hampered by HTCC. (A) Pre-cooled HAE cultures
were incubated with ice-cold MERS-CoV suspension in the presence or absence of HTCC-63 (200 μg/ml) for 2 h
at 37°C. Next, cells were fixed in PFA and immunostained for MERS-CoV N protein and actin. Virus entry was
analyzed with confocal microscopy. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments, each
performed in triplicate. * P < 0.05. (B) A549 cells overexpressing ACE2 were incubated with lentiviral particles
bearing GFP reporter gene, pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S-SARS-CoV-2), VSV control G protein (VSV-G)
or particles without an envelope protein (ΔEnv) in the presence of HTCC-77 or control PBS. After 2 h at 37°C cells
were washed with PBS and overlaid with fresh medium. Following 72 h incubation, GFP signal was measured
using fluorometer and pseudovirus entry is presented as Relative Fluorescence Units per ml. The assay was
performed in triplicate, and average values with standard errors are presented. ** P < 0.005.

210

Due to the limited availability of tools for the SARS-CoV-2 we were not able to replicate

211

the experiment for this virus. Here, we employed a surrogate system based on lentiviral vectors

212

pseudotyped with full-length Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. A549 cells overexpressing the

213

ACE2 protein were incubated with pseudovirions harboring SARS-CoV-2 Spike or control

214

VSV-G protein in the presence of HTCC-77 (100 μg/ml) or control PBS for 2 h at 37°C. After

215

72 h p.i. cells were lysed, and pseudovirus entry was quantified by measurement of the reporter

216

GFP protein. The analysis showed a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudoviruses

217

internalization in the presence of the polymer, while no inhibition was observed for the control

218

VSV-G (Figure 4B).

219

Next, to verify whether the mechanism of action for the highly pathogenic

220

betacoronaviruses is similar to that observed for alphacoronaviruses 22, and is based on locking

221

the interaction between the virus and the entry receptor, we analyzed MERS-CoV

222

co-localization with its entry receptor, DPP4 in the presence or absence of the HTCC. For this,

223

human cell line Huh7 was inoculated with the virus or mock in the presence of HTCC-63

224

(100 μg/ml) or control PBS and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. Subsequently, cells were fixed and

225

immunostained for the DPP4 and MERS-CoV N using specific antibodies. Virus co-

226

localization with its receptor was examined using confocal microscopy. Obtained results

227

demonstrated that in the control samples, virions co-localize with the DPP4 protein, while in

228

the presence of the polymer, this interaction is blocked (Figure 5).

238
239

Taking together, we show here that the previously developed and described polymeric

240

HTCC anticoronaviral compounds based on chitosan are able to efficiently inhibit infection

241

with emerging coronaviruses. We believe that the HTCC can be fine-tuned to target any

242

coronavirus, and this interaction is specific to viruses that belong to the Coronaviridae family.

243

One may speculate that the inhibition results from the concatemeric nature of the virus surface

244

and the fact that the polymer with appropriate charge distribution can interact with multiple

245

sites on this surface. While the interaction of the monomer is relatively weak, and no inhibition

246

is observable for monomers, the sum of interactions stabilizes the binding and specific

247

inhibition is observed. Considering that the extended chain length for the HTCC used is

248

~700 nm this scenario seems realistic 27. If that would be true, HTCC would constitute a first

249

structure-specific inhibitor of viral replication. The major disadvantage of the HTCC is that, at

250

present, it is not registered for use in humans. However, previous experience with HTCC in

251

different laboratories shows that it may be delivered topically to the lungs, it is not associated

252

with toxicity, and it does not worsen the lung function 25. We believe that HTCC is a promising

253

drug candidate that should be further studied, as it provides a ready-to-use solution for

254

SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging coronaviruses.

Human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures

276

Human airway epithelial cells were isolated from conductive airways resected from

277

transplant patients. The study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical

278

University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland (approval no: KNW/0022/KB1/17/10 dated

279

16.02.2010). Written consent was obtained from all patients. Cells were dislodged by protease

280

treatment, and later mechanically detached from the connective tissue. Further, cells were

281

trypsinized and transferred onto permeable Transwell insert supports ( = 6.5 mm). Cell

282

differentiation was stimulated by the media additives and removal of media from the apical side

283

after the cells reached confluence. Cells were cultured for 4-6 weeks to form well-differentiated,

284

pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium. All experiments were performed in accordance with

285

relevant guidelines and regulations.

Cell viability assay

288

HAE cultures were prepared as described above. Cell viability assay was performed by

289

using the XTT Cell Viability Assay (Biological Industries, Israel) according to the

290

manufacturer’s instructions. On the day of the assay, 100 μl of the 1 × PBS with the 50 μl of

291

the activated XTT solution was added to each well/culture insert. Following 2 h incubation at

292

37°C, the solution was transferred onto a 96-well plate, and the signal was measured at

293

λ = 490 nm using the colorimeter (Spectra MAX 250, Molecular Devices). The obtained results

294

313

virions were removed by washing with 100 μl of 1 × PBS and fresh medium containing

314

dissolved respective polymer was added to each well. Samples of cell culture supernatant were

315

collected at day 3 p.i. and analyzed using RT-qPCR.

316

For the ex vivo study, fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures were

317

exposed to the tested polymer or control PBS for 30 min at 37°C, following inoculation with

318

MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 at a TCID50 of 400 per ml in the presence of the polymer or

319

control PBS. Following 2 h incubation at 37°C, unbound virions were removed by washing

320

with 200 μl of 1 × PBS and HAE cultures were maintained at an air—liquid interphase for the

321

rest of the experiment. To analyze virus replication kinetics, each day p.i., 100 μl of 1 × PBS

322

was applied at the apical surface of HAE and collected following the 10 min incubation at 32°C.
