Summary:
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease COVID19, which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. Laboratory work with SARS-CoV-2 in
a laboratory setting was rated to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. However, certain
research applications in particular in molecular biology require incomplete denaturation of the proteins,
which might cause safety issues handling contaminated samples. In particular, it is critical to provide
proof of inactivation before samples can be removed from the BSL-3.
In this study, the stability of the virus in cell culture media at 4°C and on touch panel surfaces used in
laboratory environment was analyzed. In addition, we evaluated common lysis buffers that are used in
molecular biological laboratories for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. We have found that
guanidine thiocyanate and most of the tested detergent containing lysis buffers were effective in
inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, however, the M-PER lysis buffer containing a proprietary detergent failed
to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we compared chemical and non-chemical inactivation
methods including ethanol, acetone-methanol mixture, PFA, UV-C light, and heat inactivation.
In conclusion, careful evaluation of the used inactivation methods are required and additional
inactivation steps are necessary before removal of lysed viral samples from BSL-3.

1. Introduction:
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by an infection with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The origin of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was initially described in
Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020) and rapidly established a worldwide pandemic. Globally, 57.8 million
cases 1.3 million deaths in total since the start of the pandemic have been reported by the WHO as
published on November, 24th 2020 (WHO, 2020). Numerous experimental studies are currently being
carried out, which require appropriate inactivation methods to restrict laboratory born spread among
scientists and lab personnel.
SARS-CoV-2 is a spherical beta coronavirus with a size of 120 nm in diameter, which has a lipid
envelope. Persistence and inactivation of coronaviruses including the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, which emerged in the last decades, was evaluated in several publications (reviewed in
(Kampf et al., 2020a; Kampf et al., 2020b)). Accordingly, a whole series of chemical and physical
inactivation methods such as UV radiation, heat inactivation and detergents are assumed to be effective
inactivation methods against SARS-CoV-2 (Kratzel et al., 2020b). However since human coronaviruses
were shown to remain infectious on inanimate surfaces at room temperature for up to 9 days (reviewed
in (Kampf et al., 2020a; Kampf et al., 2020b)), contamination of frequently touched surfaces in laboratory
settings are therefore a potential source of viral transmission.
As shown for other enveloped viruses (Fischer et al., 2015; Goo et al., 2016; Muller et al., 2016), it might
be assumed SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for much longer period of time when stored in liquid
milieu at appropriate temperatures. This is the case in laboratory environments in which the condition of
the sample has to be partially preserved for the subsequent molecular biological assays.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the major detection method
for SARS-CoV-2, in which guanidine thiocyanate containing chaotropic buffers are efficient in disrupting
viral structures. However, there are applications in particular in molecular biology that require incomplete
denaturation of the proteins (e.g. luciferase measurements). Thus, in this study we evaluated common
lysis buffers that are used in molecular biological laboratories for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, we investigated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in cooled cell culture media and on touch
panels on electronic devices. In addition we analyzed the impact of temperatures, physical (UV) and
chemical influences on viral infectivity.

2. Materials and methods:
4.1 Cell culture and virus propagation
Caco2 and Vero cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml of penicillin and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin. Viral titers of SARS-CoV isolate
HK or FFM1 (Drosten et al., 2003) and SARS-CoV-2 isolate (Frankfurt 1, FFM1) (Hoehl et al., 2020;
Toptan et al., 2020) were determined by TCID50. For virus propagation, Caco-2 or Vero cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate and inoculated with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 using a MOI of 0.1 (Toptan
et al., 2020). After 60 min at 37°C and 5% CO2 cells were rinsed with PBS, supplemented with fresh
medium, and incubated until harvest. Influenza isolates PR8 (H1N1) [ATCC-VR-1469; p1; Titer: 1.1x
107] and Victoria (H3N2) [ATCC-VR-822; p5; Titer: 1.4x 107] were prepared by infecting MDCK cells.

Cell free virus aliquots were stored at -80°C. All infectious work was performed under biosafety level 3
(BSL-3) conditions in a BSL-3 facility according to the Committee on Biological Agents (ABAS) and
Central Committee for Biological Safety (ZKBS).

2.2 Determination of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by TCID50
Infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 supernatant were determined by an end-point limiting dilution assay as
50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50/ml) in confluent cells in 96-well microtiter plates. Briefly,
Caco-2 were seeded onto a 96-well plate and infected with untreated or treated SARS-CoV-2 containing
supernatant in an initial 1:10 dilution (quadruplicates). Titration was performed on 96-well plate with ten
serial 1:10 dilutions. Viral titer was determined 48 h post infection as 50% tissue culture infectious dose
(TCID50) as described by Spearman and Kaerber (Kärber, 1931; Spearman, 1908). To analyze inhibition
capacity of different inactivation methods viral titers were normalized to the untreated control and
reduction factor was calculated as described elsewhere (Rabenau et al., 2005b). All infection
experiments were performed with initial viral titer of 1x 106 TCID50/mL if not indicated differently.

2.3 Chemical Inactivation of cell culture supernatants
To test different chemical compounds to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, virus containing supernatant was
mixed 1:1 or 1:10 with lysis buffers or fixation solutions, respectively. As adapted from previously
published procedures (Rabenau et al., 2005a), the mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at room
temperature before further processing. Testing different lysis buffers, compound-virus mixture was
further diluted 1:1000 to avoid cytotoxic effect before added to the seeded Caco-2 cells. Viral load and
inactivation capacity were determined by RT-qPCR and CV staining, respectively. Analyzing different
fixation solutions, compound-virus mixture was further diluted 1:100 before added to the seeded Vero
cells. Viral titers and inactivation capacity were determined by RT-qPCR and compared to viral control.
Before use Western blot (WB) lysis buffer (20 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaPPi,
20 mM NaF, 1% Triton-X, 1.9 M glycine, and 250 mM TRIS base) was supplemented with cOmplete™
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche).

2.4 Physical Inactivation of cell culture supernatants
Analyzing physical parameters to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, virus containing supernatant was treated
either at different temperatures or with UV-C light or was applied to different surfaces and stored for a
distinct period of time. For surface inactivation SARS-CoV-2 was applied to cell culture dishes
(polystyrole; plastic), used smartphone display, and used protection film and dried at ambient
temperature. Of note, the used surfaces were not cleaned prior to the experiments to maintain an
environment close to real-world conditions. Dried virus spots were incubated for 6 h or 5 days at ambient
temperature before wiped off with a PBS soaked swab (2 cm 2) and eluted in culture medium. Testing
different temperatures for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus containing supernatant was incubated on a
thermo shaker for defined time at 56°C, 60°C or 90°C. In addition, determination of viral load was
performed by infecting Vero cells and measuring gene copies/reaction by RT-qPCR. Finally, SARSCoV-2, SARS-CoV- and Influenza A containing supernatant was applied to cell culture dishes and dried.
Dried virus spots were treated with UV light of different light sources. “UVA-Cube” and UV-C LED (Hönle

AG, Germany) both contain a UV-C light source (LED Spot 100 IC / HP IC), which was set to E = 8.8
mW/cm² (365 – 460 nm) with a fixed distance of 2 cm. Benchtop UV-light was emitted using a laminar
flow (Holton LaminAir, Heto-Holten, Denmark). After irradiating for a defined time spots were eluted in
culture medium. Viral load and inactivation capacity were determined by TCID50 and CV staining,
respectively.

2.5 Rotitest Vital viability assay
To analyze the viability of cells treated different compounds to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, the intracellular
dehydrogenase activity was tracked using the Rotitest Vital Kit (Carl Roth GmbH + Co. KG, Karlsruhe,
Germany). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with 1:1000 dilution of inactivating
compound in culture medium in triplicates per sample. After 48 h of incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2,
Rotitest Vital solution was added and analyzed using a multimode reader at 450 nm.

2.6 RT-qPCR analysis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA
For detection of intracellular and extracellular SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, primers M-475-F (5'TGTGACATCAAGGACCTGCC-3') and M-574-R (5'-CTGAGTCACCTGCTACACGC-3') were used
together with the Fam-BHQ1 dual-labeled probe M-507-P (5'-TGTTGCTACATCACGAACGC-3') as
described previously (Toptan et al., 2020). For normalization to intracellular mRNA level human GAPDH
was measured using primers GAPDH-fwd (5'-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTA) and GAPDH-rev (5'GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3').

2.7 Determination of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by Crystal Violet Staining
Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by chemical and physical methods was (when indicated) determined by
Crystal Violet Staining (CV). Therefore, Caco-2 cells were seeded on a 96-well plate infected with
untreated or treated SARS-CoV-2 supernatant and cultured for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were fixed
after incubation with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 minutes at room temperature before stained
with 0.1% CV for another 20 minutes. Staining solution was removed and plates were dried overnight.
CV was dissolved with 100% ice-cold methanol and analyzed using a multimode reader at 560 nm. To
determine inactivation capacity samples were normalized to untreated control.

2.8 Statistical analysis
If not indicated differently all infection experiments were repeated in three independent experiments.
Data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, USA).
Statistical significance compared to untreated control was determined using unpaired student’s t-test on
non-log-transformed data. Asterisks indicated p-values as * (p < 0.05), ** (p ≤ 0.01) and *** (p ≤ 0.005).

3. Results:
3.1 SARS-CoV-2 is stable for several weeks
To investigate how long SARS-CoV-2 viruses are stable under 4°C storage conditions, we thawed
different stock aliquots of a SARS-CoV-2 strain FFM1 (Hoehl et al., 2020; Toptan et al., 2020) (which

were cryo-conserved at -80°C) at weekly intervals and stored them at 4°C in cell culture medium for up
to 23 weeks. The long-stored virus stocks were then examined for their infectivity using TCID50.
Remarkably, even after 23 weeks under these storage conditions we found considerable quantities of
infectious virus (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 – Stability of SARS-CoV-2 under different storage conditions. a) SARS-CoV-2 virus stocks were
stored in cell culture medium at 4°C for the indicated period of time. b) Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces (with
and without protection glass).TCID50 using CaCo2-cells was performed to determine viral infectivity (Microscopical
CPE readout). Representative experiment performed in quadruplicates. Error bars indicate SD from four technical
replicates.

Since coronaviruses were shown to remain infectious on commonly used touch surface materials
(Warnes, Little, and Keevil, 2015), we next examined how long SARS-CoV-2 might be stable on touch
panels of electronic devices that are commonly used in well-equipped laboratories. For this purpose, we
coated plastic as well as touchscreen displays of mobile phones with and without protective glass with
SARS-CoV-2 (2.8x105 TCID50/mL). After a short and long incubation time at room temperature
corresponding to one working day (6 h) and one working week (5 days), the surfaces were wiped off
with a PBS soaked swab and the viruses were eluted in culture medium and tested quantitatively for
infectivity. After 6 hours we saw a decrease in TCID50 of 1.91 log on the display and of approx. 2.6 log
for displays with a protective glass and for plastic surfaces (Figure 1b, and Table 1). After 5 days we
were unable to recover infectious virus particles on any of the surfaces indicating a minimal reduction
factor of 4.95 log.
These data indicate that it is particularly important to inactivate contaminated material and instruments
before continue working under less stringent safety requirements.

3.2 Effectiveness of lysis buffers at inactivating SARS-CoV-2
Molecular biological detection methods require specific lysis methods to ensure subsequent partly
enzymatic reactions. Buffers containing guanidine thiocyanate have proven useful for the isolation of
viral nucleic acids and PCR-based analysis. We have therefore tested a set of six common lysis buffers
for nucleic acid extraction whereof three are also used in routine diagnostic. Buffers AL, ATL and AVL
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the cobas omni buffer (Roche, Germany) are commonly used to isolate
nucleic acids from cell culture supernatants and patient material such as serum, blood, plasma, but also
throat swab samples. The buffer RLT (Qiagen), however, is mainly used for research purpose for the
isolation of total cellular RNA from infected cells. SARS-CoV-2 containing cell culture supernatants were
mixed 1:1 with lysis buffers and diluted after 10 minutes of incubation. To evaluate the remaining
infectivity viral outgrowth assays were performed in Caco2 cells and after 48 h cell culture supernatants
were harvested for analysis. To control that the readout was not affected by cell toxicity issues, in parallel
we performed a cell viability assay (Figure 2a). In order to monitor virus production, we additionally
carried out an RT-qPCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 M-gene. As shown in Figure 2 all tested buffers
containing guanidine isothiocyanate including the cobas omni buffer (Roche) were able to completely
inactivate samples containing SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2).

Figure 2 – Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by lysis buffers commonly used in molecular biology
laboratories. a) Crystal violet staining of Caco2 cells previously infected with virus pre-incubated with
the indicated lysis buffer. Cell viability was determined by commercial RotiTest Vital Assay measuring
OD450. Cells were incubated with a mixture of cell culture medium and the depicted lysis buffer in the
given concentration used for virus inactivation. For the untreated control no viability assay was
performed to avoid handling with infectious samples outside the safety cabinet. Samples were diluted
1:1000 to avoid cell toxicity. b) RT-qPCR analysis of intracellular RNA obtained from infected cells
Caco2 cells showing the relative expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA targeting M-Gene. Values were
normalized to cellular GAPDH expression. Error bars indicate SD from the mean of representative
experiment performed in triplicates. Virus control indicates SARS-CoV-2 infected cells without preincubation. Cell control indicates uninfected Caco2.

The IGEPAL CA-630 (MP Biomedicals Germany GmbH, Eschwege, Germany) containing direct lysis
(DL) buffer was developed in order to avoid expensive and time-consuming RNA extraction procedure
while concomitantly inactivating infectious samples prior to PCR analysis. DL buffer was found to
efficiently inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2; Supplementary Figure 1). Next, we also tested lysis
buffers that are commonly used to analyze protein samples and used a buffer for Western blot analysis,
and Triton-X containing buffers, which are commonly used for luciferase-based assay. The latter have
the critical property of maintaining protein function in order to allow enzymatic reactions with light
emission. The buffers used therefore have a membrane-permeabilizing, but incompletely denaturing
effect on cells. For Western blot lysis buffer and the commercially available Glo-Lysis buffer (Promega,
Walldorf, Germany) as well as the PL buffer (lysis juice; p.j.k., Kleinblittersdorf, Germany) we were able
to demonstrate complete inactivation (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 1). Importantly, Mammalian
Protein Extraction Reagent (M-PER, ThermoFisher) was not able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2,
Table 2). As determined using crystal violet staining, only 22% of the cells were inactivated, which was
comparable to the untreated control (18%). This data was confirmed by RT-qPCR since the relative
SARS-CoV-2 M gene expression for infected and M-PER treated samples (1.043) was not statistically
different from the virus control.
These findings highlight the fact that careful evaluation of the used inactivation methods are required
and that additional inactivation steps might be necessary to prepare the samples for safe processing.

3.3 Physical Inactivation effectively eliminates infectious SARS-CoV-2
Since not all lysis buffers were able to completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2, we have further tested
physical and chemical inactivation methods that can be applied subsequently. First, we evaluated the
effects of heat inactivation on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and heated cell culture supernatants at different
temperatures with different incubation times. To monitor the temperature of the liquid that has to be
inactivated, we generated heat curves (Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Tables 1-2).
Subsequently, the treated supernatants were used to infect Caco2 cells. After 48 h cell culture
supernatants were harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to evaluate viral outgrowth (Table 3). We found
that heat inactivation by placing the tube (500 µl in a 1.5 ml vessel) from ambient temperature (approx.
23°C) to a pre-warmed heating block for 5 min at 56°C was not effective (0.15 log), while increasing the
incubation time to 30 min was a highly effective method of inactivation (4.35 log). Already 5 minutes at
60°C drastically reduced the infectivity of the virus suspension by 4.35 log. Short incubation time of
1 min at 90°C also achieved a very effective 4.28 log reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

Next, we evaluated chemical disinfectant and fixation solutions and treated virus supernatants in cell
culture media in 1:10 dilution to the testing compound for 10 minutes at ambient temperature.
Acetone/methanol (40:60), ethanol (70%), and paraformaldehyde (PFA, 3%) were found suitable to
completely inactivate the virus (Table 4). However, ethanol/PBS (50%, 1:1) did not inactivate SARSCoV-2, which was in line with previously published data (Kratzel et al., 2020b).

Finally, we investigated the influence of UV light on the stability of SARS-CoV-2. For comparison, we
included two different strains of SARS-CoV (from 2003) and also H1N1 Influenza A virus (IAV) as a
representative of a seasonally recurring respiratory pathogen. To mimic daily laboratory
decontamination routines, we exposed SARS-CoV-2 contaminated samples in a biological safety
cabinet to UV light and irradiated for 15- 60 min. We found that 15 min were already highly efficient and
30 min as well as 60 min completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. In addition, we used two
different UV light sources with a discharge lamp (low pressure radiation chamber) or a highly potent

LED UV light to inactivate contaminated surfaces. We compared different exposure times ranging from
2 – 210 seconds for UV-C discharge lamp and 0.5 -3.5 seconds for UV-C LED with fixed distances of
20 to 40 mm to the light source, respectively. Using UV light from the discharge lamp, 2 seconds
exposure time resulted in a minimal reduction factor of 3.5 log while after 4 seconds no infectious SARSCoV-2 was detected in the viral outgrowth assay (Figure 3, Table 5). One second UV-C LED was
sufficient to reduce viral infectivity by 3.9 log. 3.5 seconds completely reduced viral titers >4 log.

These data demonstrate that UV-light exposure is a suitable method for complete inactivation of SARSCoV-2 contaminated material. In particular, irradiation with UV-C LED light might also represent a fast
and reliable inactivation method for contaminated material and surfaces also in laboratory settings.

4. Discussion:
Enveloped viruses are less resistant to chemical and physical environmental influences compared to
non-enveloped viruses (Geller, Varbanov, and Duval, 2012; Kramer, Schwebke, and Kampf, 2006).
Depending on air temperature and relative humidity (Casanova et al., 2010) coronaviruses are stable
for up to 9 days on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic (Kampf et al., 2020b; van Doremalen,
Bushmaker, and Munster, 2013). In this study mid-term and long term storages revealed a high stability
of the virus during liquid storage over several weeks/months. We have found that even after months of
storage conditions at 4°C, we found considerable quantities of infectious virus. This suggests that
laboratories must be absolutely certain that their inactivation methods used for subsequent research
purposes will also provide sufficient inactivation. SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently inactivated by surface
disinfection procedures (Kampf et al., 2020b), however, several research methods in molecular biology
require functional proteins for enzymatically catalyzed reactions or for the maintenance of secondary
and tertiary structures. In this manuscript, we tested several lysis buffers and other chemical and
physical inactivation methods that would allow downstream analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside
of the BSL3 laboratory. Among several lysis buffers we found the proprietary detergent M-PER lysis
buffer (Thermo Fisher) to fail in the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.
In agreement with previously published studies we found that most inactivation methods were effective.
In particular, our results were in line with studies that showed high temperature (Kratzel et al., 2020a),
alcohols (Kratzel et al., 2020b), UV irradiation (Duan et al., 2003), and lysis by detergents are effective
in inactivate corona virus (Rabenau et al., 2005a; Rabenau et al., 2005b). In particular, UV irradiation of
infected cell culture samples was very effective in our study, but varied between the methods. Our results
were partly consistent with previously published results recently reviewed by Derraik and colleagues
(Derraik et al., 2020). In a study by Darnell et al., an experimental setup similar to our setup was
performed, and revealed that already 1 min UV-C (distance from source 3 cm) irradiation led to a
decrease in infectious SARS-CoV titers and that 6 min irradiation led to an almost complete inactivation
(Darnell et al., 2004). After 15 minutes of UVC irradiation no detection of infectious viruses was possible.

These data are consistent with our observation that after 15 minutes UV-C irradiation in a sterile
workbench more than 4-log loss in infectivity was observed for SARS-CoV-2. After irradiation with a
highly potent UV-C source after 35 seconds and with a UV-C LED even after 1 second the vast majority
of viruses were already inactivated.
The usual radiation takes place within the safety cabinets after work. Here, 15 minutes were already
highly effective to eliminate infectious virus. In most laboratories, an exposure time of 30 minutes is
suggested after infectious work. Thus, after correct use, inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 can be assumed,
however, the physical lifespan of the light source must not be exceeded in order to generate sufficient
emission. For fast inactivation of small surfaces, we evaluated two different UV-C light sources and
found that UV-C discharge lamp with a radiation duration of 4 seconds was sufficient to inactivate SARSCoV-2. The use of the high-potency UV-C LED light already results after 1 seconds. Although, all tested
UV light source were UV-C rays the distance between light source and sample plays a critical role to
define irradiation time. Furthermore, it has to take in account that lifespan of conventional UV lamps
used in safety cabinets ranges between 6000 to 8000 hours. Therefore, intensity and effectiveness of
the UV light is decreasing over time and when reaching maximum of expected useful life. In conclusion,
irradiation with UV-C LEDs thus represents a highly effective inactivation method for contaminated
surfaces.
In comparison to the Triton-X-containing lysis buffers used for enzyme based assays (e.g. luciferase
based measurements), we found that the commercially available M-PER buffer (Thermo Scientific) was
not sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. M-PER is a proprietary detergent in 25 mM bicine buffer (pH
7.6) used for enzyme based reporter protein assays and immunoassays as well as protein purification.
While bicine is an organic compound used as a buffering agent the exact composition of M-PER is not
publicly known. However, according to the manufacturer, M-PER reagent has been tested on different
cell lines showing complete lysis of adherent cells. Even if the manufacturers describe an efficient and
fast cell lysis, the virus was able to withstand the mild detergent in our experiments. In line with
previously published data on SARS-CoV (Rabenau et al., 2005a), also fixation with PBS/ethanol (EtOH
50%; 1:1) over 5 min was sufficient to eliminate infectivity.
This study has limitations that need to be considered. To maintain real-lab-settings, we performed the
stability evaluation with daily used virus stocks thawed for routine infectious experiments. Since the
stocks in use had different lifetimes, longer standing times at ambient temperature could possibly have
influenced viral stability. Hence we quantitatively cannot compare the samples with each other and also
statistical evaluation was not applicable. Far more replicates under more controlled conditions would be
necessary here. Nonetheless, even after 23 weeks we still found high-titer virus that has to be
adequately inactivated by appropriate lysis buffer. These data are therefore important as a derivation
for the inactivation tests. A further limitation of this study is based on the fact that inactivation efficiency
largely depends on the initial virus load and the reaction volume. Especially in the case of heat
inactivation, the heating time of the respective medium must be considered (Supplementary Figure 1,
Supplementary Tables 1-2). In addition, the higher the virus titer, the longer the inactivation time is
necessary for complete inactivation.
SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate in susceptible cells lines like Caco2 and Vero cells both yielding high
viral titers in the cell culture supernatants. The main difference is the ability to form a CPE, which is

definitely more pronounced in Caco2 cells (Hoehl et al., 2020). However, in this study we did not match
results obtained from different experiments with dissimilar cell lines but rather compare heat inactivation
conditions in a defined setup using a specific cell line. Since the respective cell line was used for readout
purpose, only the reduction factor which mirrors the heat inactivation efficiency is relevant.
In conclusion, inactivation methods including alcohols (except PBS/EtOH 1:1), acetone-methanol
mixture, PFA, UV-light and heat inactivation efficiently inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Most but not all
research laboratory used lysis buffers were suitable to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. However, since M-PER
was not able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, research buffers, especially if they are non-denaturating, must
be carefully evaluated to protect laboratory personnel and must be substituted to maintain laboratory
safety.
