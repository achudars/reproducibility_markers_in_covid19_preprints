Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19
pandemic that continues to pose significant public health concerns. While research to deliver
vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental
spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad
spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a
pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped
and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and
human noroviruses surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear
regression with r2=0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D90 - dose for 90% inactivation) for SARSCoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21 and 28 J/m2, respectively (with an estimated 18 J/m2 as
published for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light
compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59
strain with a D90 of 21 J/m2 close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to
validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human
noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D90 values of 69.1, 89 and 77.6 J/m2 for genogroups GI, GII
and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D90 = 100 J/m2 was identified as a
potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful
insights for the identification of potential nonpathogenic surrogates to understand inactivation
kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be
used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and
animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.

Coronaviruses belong to the family of Coronaviridae, comprising of 26 to 30 kb, positive-sense,
single-stranded RNA, in an enveloped capsid (Woo et al., 2010). Coronaviruses can cause severe
infectious diseases in human and vertebrates, being fatal in some cases. Severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), a β-coronavirus emerged in Guangdong, southern
China, in November, 2002 (Guan et al., 2003), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Alagaili et al., 2014). Since
late December 2019, a novel β-coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for
the pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with > 7.2 million confirmed cases throughout the
world, and a fatality rate of approximately 5.7 % as of 11 June, 2020 (WHO, 2020a). This 2019nCoV is thought to have originated from a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China,
and has spread rapidly to other provinces of China and other countries (Zhu et al., 2020).

According to current evidence documented by the World Health Organization (WHO), SARS-CoV-2
virus (2019-nCoV) is transmitted between humans through respiratory droplets and contact (personto-person, fomites, etc.) routes (WHO, 2020b). van Doremalen et al. (2020) reported that SARSCoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the 3 h duration of the experiment and more stable on
plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and virus was detected up to 72 hours after
the application to these surfaces at 21-23°C and 40% relative humidity. Given the ability of these
viruses to survive in the environment, appropriate treatment strategies are needed to inactivate
SARS-CoV-2. As per WHO recommendations, SARS-CoV-2 may be inactivated using chemical
disinfectants. As of 07 April, 2020, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
has announced a list of 428 registered chemical disinfectants that have been approved for use against
SARS-CoV-2 (USEPA, 2020). However, chemical disinfection requires intense labor and product to
treat large surface areas. As an alternative, ultraviolet light (UV) technology (with germicidal UV-C
at wavelengths from 100 nm to 280 nm) can be an effective approach to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on
large surface areas and in the air (regardless of humidity levels) with less labor. UV inactivates a
broad spectrum of microorganisms by damaging the DNA or RNA and thereby prevents and/or alters
cellular functions and replication (Patras et al., 2020). UV-C inactivation of various microorganisms
such as pathogenic bacteria, spores, protozoa, algae and viruses has been reported (Malayeri et al.,
2016; Bhullar et al., 2019; Gopisetty et al., 2019; Pendyala et al., 2019, 2020; Patras et al., 2020). As
of date, information on the UV susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.

Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) cause > 80 % of global nonbacterial gastroenteritis that can be spread
through contamination of food, water, fomites, or direct contact, and also via aerosolization
(Fankhauser et al., 2002; Widdowson et al., 2005; Godoy et al., 2006). HuNoVs are also singlestranded RNA viruses that are small 27 to 32 nM in size that belong to the Caliciviridae family.
However, HuNoVs are enclosed in a non-enveloped capsid, unlike SARS-CoV-2 that is enveloped.
UV-C inactivation data on the HuNoV genogroups is limited due to the lack of available cultivation
methods to obtain high infectious titers (Doultree et al., 1999; Ettayebi et al., 2016; Estes et al.,
2019). Thus, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is widely-used
for assessing survivor populations of HuNoVs after treatment. However, research studies showed
overestimation of survivors with RT-qPCR in comparison to virus infectivity plaque assays
(Rönnqvist et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2019). As an alternative, cultivable animal
viruses (caliciviruses, echoviruses and murine norovirus (MNV)) have been used as surrogates to
determine UV-C inactivation of HuNoVs (Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2003; de Roda Husman et al.,
2004; Lee et al., 2008; Park et al., 2011), but proper selection of surrogates which mimic the UV-C
inactivation characteristics of HuNoVs is required to evaluate kinetics and scale up validation
studies.

Furthermore, it is well known that microorganisms respond to UV exposure at rates defined in terms
of UV rate constants (Patras et al., 2020). The slope of the logarithmic decay curve is defined by the
rate constant, which is designated as k. The UV rate constant k has units of cm2/mJ or m2/J and is also
known as the UV susceptibility. It can be also defined as D90 or D10 [dose for 90% inactivation or
10% survival] as the primary indicator of UV susceptibility. UV dose is expressed as J/m2 or mJ/cm2
(Patras et al., 2020). The varied microbial sensitivity to ultraviolet light (UV) among species of
microbes, is due to several intrinsic factors including physical size, presence of chromophores or UV
absorbers, presence of repair enzymes or dark/light repair mechanisms, hydrophilic surface
properties, relative index of refraction, specific UV spectrum (broad band UVC/UVB vs. narrow
band UVC), genome based parameters; molecular weight of nucleic acids, DNA conformation (A or
B), G+C %, and % of potential pyrimidine or purine dimers (Kowalski et al., 2009).

The physical size of a virus bears no clear relationship with UV susceptibility, except that for the
largest viruses, as size increases, the UV rate constant tends to decrease slightly (which is likely the
result of UV scattering) (Kowalski et al., 2009). There is no thorough literature available on the
above-mentioned optical parameters, hydrophilic surface properties and repair mechanisms relating
to UV sensitivity. On the other hand, genome sequences of UV susceptibility can be easily retrieved
from genome databases and the development of genomic models based on the above mentioned
genome-based parameters is feasible to predict the UV susceptibility of ssRNA viruses, which
include pathogenic novel viruses (such as SARS-CoV-2) and cultivation-challenging HuNoVs.

Our hypothesis is that predicting UV-C inactivation based on genomic modeling, will enable the
determination of surrogates to be used in UV-C validation studies. In the present study, we attempted
to develop a genomic model to predict and compare the UV sensitivity of enveloped SARS-CoV-2
and non-enveloped HuNoVs and to determine their suitable surrogates for use in UV-C process
validation.

We collected UV sensitivity of ssRNA viruses form published studies and carefully selected D90
values (Table 1). The selection was based on the careful assessment of methods that were used to
generate the UV dose response curves. The UV sensitivity of an ssRNA virus is determined via a
dose-response curve, with the log10 survivors as a function of UV dose and represented as D90.

The molecular size of genomes were directly obtained from available NCBI genome database (Table
2). PyNNFV model was developed based on the frequency of each type of pyrimidine dinucleotides
(TT, TC, CT and CC) which varies based on genome sequence. Pyrimidines are almost 10 times
more susceptible to photoreaction (Smithyman and Hanawalt, 1969), while strand breaks, inter-strand
cross links and DNA-protein cross links form with less frequency (1:1000 of the number of dimers
and hydrates) (Setlow and Carrier, 1966). Three simple rules were formulated for sequencedependent dimerization (Becker and Wang, 1989); “i) When two or more pyrimidines are
neighboring to one another, photoreactions are observed at both pyrimidines, ii) Non-adjacent
pyrimidines exhibit little or no photoreactivity, and iii) Purines form UV photoproducts when they
are flanked at 5’ side by two or more adjacent pyrimidine residues”. Therefore, we considered 100%
probability of formation of photoreaction products when PyNN are flanked by pyrimidines on both
sides and 50% probability when PyNN are flanked by purine on either side. The individual PyNNs

Research studies showed the proportion of photoreaction products in the order of TT > TC > CT >
CC (Douki, 2013), thus same sequence was followed in counting individual PyNNs. Table 3 shows
the method used for PyNNFV calculation in this study. A mathematical function was written to
calculate PyNNFV from the potential PyNNs exist in the genome of RNA (Equation 1).

Table 1 shows the median D90 values collected from UV-C inactivation studies of various ssRNA
viruses. The data was selected from the studies conducted in transparent medium (water or phosphate
buffer saline), followed standard method for UV dose calculation (Bolton and Linden, 2003). The
D90 values reported for ssRNA viruses ranged from 18 J/m2 for SARS-CoV-1 to 190 J/m2 for murine
sarcoma virus. Genomic parameters; genome size, PyNNFVs of respective viruses were shown in
Table 2. The values are in the range of 3569 bp to 29751 bp for genomic size; 0.00067 to 0.00807 for
PyNNFV.

To determine the relationship between genome size and UV-C sensitivity, the D90 values were
plotted against the genome size of various ssRNA viruses (Figure 1). The data was best fitted to log
linear regression model with r2 = 0.63. The results revealed that decisive relationship between
genome size and UV sensitivity across the range (3569 – 29751 bp).

Further to evaluate the influence of base composition and sequence along with genome size on UV-C
sensitivity, the D90 values were plotted versus pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency value (PyNNFV)
(Fig 2). Linear regression model was best fitted with r2 = 0.90. Therefore, the results show good
relationship between PyNNFV and UV-C sensitivity of virus. The following linear regression
equation shows the correlation between D90 values and PyNNFV.

Equation 2

Also, to predict the distribution of UV-C sensitivities and estimates of the true population mean using
this model, 95% prediction and confidence intervals were shown in Figure 2. To confirm the
adequacy of the fitted model, studentized residuals versus run order were tested and the residuals
were observed to be scattered randomly, suggesting that the variance was constant. It can be
indicated from Figure 3 that predicted values were in close agreement with the experimental values
and were found to be not significantly different at p > 0.05 using a paired t-test. Despite some
variations, results obtained predicted model and actual experimental values showed that the
established models reliably predicted the D90 value. Therefore, the predictive performance of the
established model can be considered acceptable. The applicability of the models was also
quantitatively evaluated by comparing the bias and accuracy factors (Table 4, equation 3 & 4).

In most cases, as shown in Table 4, the accuracy factor (AF) values for the genomic model were
close to 1.00, except for Measles virus (0.83), Semliki forest virus (0.86). The bias factor (BF) values
for the predicted models were also close to 1.00, ranging from 1.02 to 1.21 for the parameter studied.
These results clearly indicate that there was a good agreement between predicted and observed D90
values. Ross et al. (2000) stated that predictive models ideally would have an AF=BF=1.00,
indicating a perfect model fit where the predicted and actual response values are equal. However,
typically, the AF of a fitted model will increase by 0.10–0.15 units for each predictive variable in the
model (Ross et al., 2000). Genomic model, as in this study, that forecasts a response may be expected
to have AF and BF values ranging from 0.83 to 1.21 or an equivalent percentage error range of
0.82% to 25.67%.

Owing to good model fitting, the PyNNFV genomic model was used to predict UV sensitivity of
coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and different HuNoV genogroups. PyNNFV values of target
viruses were calculated from genomic sequences obtained from the NCBI database. The UV
sensitivities were predicted by substituting PyNNFV value in equation 2. Table 5 shows PyNNFV
values and corresponding predicted D90 values of target viruses. Predicted D90 of SARS-CoV-2 virus
(21.4 J/m2) (Table 5) is closer to the estimated D90 of SARS-CoV-1 (18 J/m2) from the experimental
study (Table 1). Kariwa et al. (2006) irradiated 2 mL of SARS-CoV-1 in 3-cm petri dishes without
stirring UV-C light at 134 µW/cm2 for 15 min, and observed reduction in infectivity from 3.8 × 107
to 180 TCID50/mL with equivalent to D90 value of 226 J/m2. In contrast, Darnell et al. (2004) showed
4 log reduction of SARS-CoV-1 at UV-C exposure of 4016 µW/cm2 for 6 min which is equivalent to
D90 value of 3610 J/m2. The authors conducted the experiment in 24 well plate containing 2 mL virus
aliquots without mixing. These two studies neither calculate the average irradiance nor provide
conditions for uniform UV-C dose distribution throughout the test fluid and thereby reported higher
values. The model predicted D90 value of MERS-CoV (28.1 J/m2) that is found to be higher than
SARS-COV-2, whereas murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) strains showed similar UV-C
sensitivity (D90 values = 20.3 to 21 J/m2). For α- and γ-coronaviruses, the predicted D90 values (17.8
to 18.3 J/m2) were lower than the β-coronaviruses. Saknimit et al. (1988) demonstrated the efficiency
of UV-C irradiation on the inactivation of MHV and CCV coronaviruses using 15 W UV-C lamp at a
distance of 1 m and reported efficient UV-C inactivation after 15 min treatment. From this data, the
estimated D90 values for MHV and CCV (γ-coronavirus) were 17 and 15 J/m2, respectively, and
observed to be slightly lower (~20 %) than the model predicted values (Table 5). Overall the results

show that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light than other ssRNA viruses reported in
Table 1. From the UV sensitivity data obtained using the genomic model, it was observed that UV
doses ranging from 90-141 J/m2 is required for 5 log reduction of human pathogenic coronaviruses
(SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV). Here we demonstrate an example of UV exposure using a
low-pressure mercury lamp. If the UV-C lamp source provides an average irradiance of 0.4 mW/cm2
or 4 W/m2 (under uniform dose distribution conditions), a mere 35 second treatment is adequate to
inactivate β-coronaviruses (99.999% or 5 log reduction).

The predicted D90 values of HuNoVs are 69.1, 89 and 77.6 J/m2 for genogroups, GI, GII, GIV,
respectively (Table 5). The results revealed that the UV-C sensitivity of GII was lower with higher
predicted D90 value in comparison to GI and GIV. To the best of our knowledge, limited
experimental data is currently available on UV-C sensitivity of HuNoVs. Some research studies used
RT-qPCR method to estimate MNV survivors and validated with virus infectivity assay (Rönnqvist
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2019). The reported validation results showed that the
values obtained with RT-qPCR method are overestimates to standard virus infectivity assay
(Rönnqvist et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2019). For instance, Rönnqvist et al. (2014)
reported 4-log reduction of MNV at a UV dose of 60 mJ/cm2 with infectivity assay, whereas just 2log decline of MNV and HuNoV RNA levels was found at UV dose of 150 mJ/cm2 with RT-qPCR
method. The experimental D90 values of conservative surrogates (MNV, echovirus and caliciviruses)
obtained via viability assay are reported to be in the range of 60 -100 J/m2 (Table 1).

Validation of the UV-C inactivation kinetics of specific pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 is not
possible because of the need for sophisticated biosafety level (BSL)-3 containment, and to protect the
researchers, and the public from health risk in environmental settings. For HuNoV, research on
reproducible cultivable systems that obtain high titers are still on-going. Hence, criteria for the
selection and application of surrogates are required to ensure that the surrogates mimic the behavior
of the SARS-CoV-2 or HuNoV under specific treatment conditions, while ensuring safety of
personnel and also decreasing labor, cost and time. Also, surrogates are useful in process validation
studies at scale up that can reduce the uncertainties linked with UV-C dose measurement.

As seen from Table 5, the model predicted D90 value (~21 J/m2) of SARS-CoV-2 was comparable to
MHV strains (nonpathogenic to humans) of β-coronavirus group (~21 J/m2), higher than αcoronaviruses (TGEV, CCV and FIPV) and γ-coronavirus (AIBV) (~18 J/m2). Also, since both
SARS-CoV-2 and MHV are β-coronaviruses, MHV-strain A59 may show similar behavior under
various culture conditions making it a potential surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 for UV-C inactivation
kinetics and validation studies.

For HuNoVs, the predicted D90 values of all genogroups (69-89 J/m2) were higher than D90 values of
caliciviruses (60-67 J/m2), echoviruses (75 J/m2), whereas lower than MNV (100 J/m2) (Table 1 & 5).
Use of surrogates that exhibit similar or slightly higher D90 values to target pathogens can avoid the
risk associated with improper inactivation, hence our results indicate that MNV is the better choice
(though conservative) to validate UV-C inactivation of all HuNoVs under laboratory experimental
setup conditions. Furthermore, it was not surprising that the studied enveloped ssRNA viruses
including SARS-CoV-1, MERS- CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) were not as resistant to UVC treatments compared to the non-enveloped HuNoVs and caliciviruses used in this modeling study.

In conclusion, a predictive genomic-modeling method was developed for estimating the UV
sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 and HuNoVs. Results of the model validation showed that the developed
model had acceptable predictive performance, as assessed by mathematical and graphical model

performance indices. We predicted the D90 values by conducting extensive genomic modelling.
Although the parameters reported here may suffice to estimate the UV sensitivity, experimental
research directed to address various knowledge gaps identified in this study is required to maximize
the accuracy of predicted models. Additional parameters will be computed to the predictive model as
needed, including terms for the presence of chromophores or UV absorbers and for possible UV
scattering. In the future, we plan to validate this data by demonstrating experimental UV-C
sensitivity (D90 values) of SARS-CoV-2 in containment laboratories with biosafety level 3 (BSL3)
features and for HuNoVs (when suitable cultivation systems that reproducibly provide high viral
titers are easily available for use in most laboratories).

is located in the genome, it is excluded from participating in other dimers); b – Overall probability of
each PyNN is calculated by considering 50 % probability (0.5) for PyNNs flanked with purine and
100 % probability (1.0) for PyNNs flanked without purine; c – PyNNs % was determined by
calculating the % of probability of PyNNs in total genome.
