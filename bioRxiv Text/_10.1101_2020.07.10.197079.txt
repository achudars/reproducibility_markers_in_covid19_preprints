Summary
SARS-CoV-2 is the positive-sense RNA virus that causes COVID-19, a disease that has

27

triggered a major human health and economic crisis. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among

28

viral RNAs in its vast potential to form stable RNA structures and yet, as much as 97% of its 30

29

kilobases have not been structurally explored in the context of a viral infection. Our limited knowledge

30

of SARS-CoV-2 genomic architecture is a fundamental limitation to both our mechanistic understanding

31

of coronavirus life cycle and the development of COVID-19 RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we apply a

32

novel long amplicon strategy to determine for the first time the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2

33

RNA genome probed in infected cells. In addition to the conserved structural motifs at the viral termini,

34

we report new structural features like a conformationally flexible programmed ribosomal frameshifting

35

pseudoknot, and a host of novel RNA structures, each of which highlights the importance of studying

36

viral structures in their native genomic context. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals extensive

37

networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals new aspects of SARS-CoV-2

38

genome architecture that distinguish it from other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses.

39

Evolutionary analysis of RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 shows that several features of its genomic

40

structure are conserved across beta coronaviruses and we pinpoint individual regions of well-folded

41

RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, complete secondary structure of

42

SAR-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on mechanisms of

43

replication, translation and packaging, and guide the identification of new RNA drug targets against

44

COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

51

Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which is responsible for the

52

current global pandemic(Zhu et al., 2020), is a positive strand RNA virus in the genus β-coronavirus. To

53

date, the outbreak of SARS-CoV2 has infected at least 12 million people globally, causing great

54

economic loss and posing an ongoing public health threat(Dong et al., 2020). Included in the β-

55

coronavirus genus are two related viruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome

56

coronavirus (MERS-CoV), that caused global outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively(de Wit et al.,

57

2016). Despite the continued risk posed by β-coronaviruses, mechanistic studies of the family are

58

limited and to date no effective antivirals or vaccines exist, highlighting the need for research that

59

facilitates the development of therapeutics. With most research efforts focusing on viral proteins (Lan et

60

al., 2020a, Yin et al., 2020, Wan et al., 2020), little is known about the viral RNA genome, especially its

61

structural content. This is a major gap in our understanding because RNA structural elements in

62

positive strand viruses play central roles in regulating all aspects of replication, translation, packaging

63

and host defense (McMullan et al., 2007, Fricke et al., 2015, Pirakitikulr et al., 2016, Clyde and Harris,

64

2006, MacFadden et al., 2018), so an understanding of their location and function is critical for

65

mechanistic understanding and strategies for viral control(Barrows et al., 2018, Adams et al., 2017).

66

Given the success of antimicrobials targeted against conserved RNA structural elements in other

67

pathogen genomes(Warner et al., 2018, Fedorova et al., 2018), there is an urgent, unmet need to

68

elucidate the genome architecture of SARS-CoV-2.

69

Like other coronaviruses, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is incredibly large (Maier et al., 2015, Zhu et

70

al., 2020). Two open reading frames (ORF) for viral nonstructural proteins (Nsp) and 9 small ORFs that

71

encode the structural proteins and a number of accessory genes comprise a ~30kb genome(Kim et al.,

72

2020). These ORFs are flanked on either side by a 5’ and 3’UTR that have been shown in other

73

coronaviruses to possess conserved RNA structures with important functional roles in the viral life

74

cycle(Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). Studies in Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and Bovine Coronavirus

75

(BCoV) suggest that the 5’ viral termini folds in to 6 stems (SL1-SL6) that play roles in sgRNA synthesis

76

and viral replication(Madhugiri et al., 2018, Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010). In the 3’UTR, a pseudoknot

77

and a bulged stem loop (BSL) are essential for sgRNA synthesis in MHV(Zust et al., 2008).

78

One of the best-studied functional RNA elements in β-coronavirus genomes is the programmed

79

ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot (PRF) that sits at the boundary between Orf1a and Orf1ab(Plant

80

and Dinman, 2008). The PRF, found in all coronaviruses, induces a -1 ribosomal frameshift that allows

81

for bypassing of the Orf1a stop codon and production of the orf1ab polyprotein, which includes the viral

82

replicase(Plant et al., 2005). Reporter assays using a truncated PRF construct showed that

83

programmed frameshifting occurs ~25% of the time in SARS-CoV(Kelly et al., 2020), and that it is

84

crucial for sgRNA synthesis(Plant et al., 2013). Extensive mutational analysis has revealed a three-

85

stemmed pseudoknot structure for the SARS-CoV PRF(Plant et al., 2005). However, neither the

86

mechanism of frameshifting regulation nor the three-stem pseudoknot PRF conformation has been

87

validated in cells.

88

While recent computational studies suggest the 5’UTR, 3’UTR, and PRF functional elements

89

are conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 genome(Rangan et al., 2020, Andrews et al., 2020), these regions

90

account for a vanishingly small fraction of the total nucleotide content. Studies of other positive-sense

91

viral RNA genomes such as Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have

92

revealed extensive networks of regulatory RNA structures contained within viral ORFs(Siegfried et al.,

93

2014, Pirakitikulr et al., 2016, Friebe and Bartenschlager, 2009, Li et al., 2018, You et al., 2004) which

94

direct critical aspects of viral function. It is therefore of crucial importance to assess and characterize

95

the structural features of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF, as elucidation of structural motifs will improve our

96

understanding of all coronaviruses and facilitate development of antiviral therapies for the entire family.

97

Recent advances in high-throughput structure probing methods (SHAPE-MaP, DMS-MaP) have

98

greatly facilitated the structural studies of long viral RNAs (Siegfried et al., 2014, Zubradt et al., 2017).

99

Recently, Manfredonia et al. performed full-length SHAPE-MaP analysis on ex vivo extracted and

100

refolded SARS-CoV-2 RNA(Manfredonia et al., 2020). However, structural studies on both viral and

101

messenger RNA have highlighted the importance of probing RNAs in their natural cellular

102

context(Simon et al., 2019, Rouskin et al., 2014). Lan et al performed full-length in-vivo DMS-MaPseq

103

on SARS-CoV2 infected cells(Lan et al., 2020b), but as DMS only reports on A and C nucleotides, the

104

data coverage is necessarily sparse. While both studies reveal important features of the structural

105

content in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and its evolutionary conservation, to date no work has been

106

published that captures information for every single nucleotide in an in-vivo context.

107

Here, we report for the first time the complete secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

108

genome using in SHAPE-MaP data obtained in living cells. We deploy a novel long amplicon method

109

readily adapted to other long viral RNAs made possible by the highly processive reverse transcriptase

110

MarathonRT (Guo et al., 2020). The resulting genomic secondary structure map reveals functional

111

motifs at the viral termini that are structurally homologous to other coronaviruses, thereby fast-tracking

112

our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. We reveal conformational variability in the PRF,

113

highlighting the importance of studying viral structures in their native genomic context and underscoring

114

their dynamic nature. We also uncover elaborate networks of well-folded RNA structures dispersed

115

across Orf1ab, and we reveal features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from

116

other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. The analysis reveals large RNA structures within

117

the ORF that may ultimately prove to be as important for viral function as the PRF. Evolutionary

118

analysis of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 structure suggests that, not only do its architectural features

119

appear to be conserved across the β-coronavirus family, but individual regions of well-folded RNA may

120

be as well. Our work reveals the unique genomic architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells, points to

121

important viral strategies for infection and persistence, and identifies potential drug targets. The full-

122

length structure model we present here thus serves as an invaluable roadmap for future studies on

123

SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that emerge in the future.

MATERIALS & METHODS

129

Cell Culture and SARS-CoV-2 Infection

130

VeroE6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% heat-

131

inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Approximately 5x106 cells were plated in each of four T150 tissue

132

culture treated flasks. The following day media was removed and 105 PFU in 4mL of media of SARS-

133

CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources #NR-52281) was added to each flask. Virus was

134

adsorbed for 1 hour at 37°C and then 16mL of fresh media was added to each flask.

135
136
137

RNA Probing and Purification
Four days post-infection (dpi), the supernatant was aspirated from each flask, cells were

138

washed with 10mL of cold PBS-/- and then dislodged in 10ml PBS-/- with a cell scraper. The contents

139

were collected and centrifuged at 450g x 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the cell

140

pellet was resuspended into 2ml of PBS-/- with 200µl DMSO or 2ml PBS with 200µl of 2M NAI (final

141

concentration = 200mM). Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature followed by

142

addition of 6mL of Trizol. RNA was extracted with the addition of 1.2mL of chloroform. The aqueous

143

phase was transferred to a new tube, followed by the addition of 12mL of 100% EtOH (70% final) and

144

precipitated overnight at -20°C. RNA was resuspended in 1xME buffer and purified using the Qiagen

145

RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 1xME buffer.

146
147
148

Tiled-Amplicon Design
Leveraging the extreme processivity of MarathonRT, a highly processive group II intron-

149

encoded RT(2), we designed fifteen 2000nt amplicon and a single 1300nt amplicons tiled across the

150

SARS-CoV-2 genome for full sequencing coverage. Adjacent amplicons were designed with a 100nt

151

overlap to ensure data is collected for regions otherwise masked by primer binding. Primers for reverse

152

transcription (RT) were designed using the OligoWalk tool(Lu and Mathews, 2008) to avoid highly-

153

structured primers and highly-structured regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Forward and reverse

154

primer sets were designed for an optimal Tm of 58°C. Reverse primers were inset 3nt from the 5’end of

155

the RT primer to enhance specificity of the PCR reaction.

156
157
158

Reverse Transcription with MarathonRT
MarathonRT purification was performed as described in (Guo et al., 2020). For each amplicon,

159

500ng of total cellular RNA was mixed with 1µL of the corresponding 1µM RT primer. Gene-specific

160

primers used for RT are listed in Table S2. Primers were annealed at 65°C for 5min then cooled to

161

room temperature, followed by addition of 8µL of 2.5x MarathonRT SHAPE-Map Buffer (125mM 1M

162

Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500mM KCl, 12.5mM DTT, 1.25mM dNTPs, 2.5mM Mn2+), 4µL of 100% glycerol, and

163

0.5µL of MarathonRT. RT reactions were incubated at 42°C for 3 hours. 1µL 3M NaOH was added to

164

each reaction and incubated at 95°C for 5min to degrade the RNA, followed by the addition of 1µL 3M

165

HCl to neutralize the reaction. cDNA was purified using AmpureXP beads (Cat. No. A63880) according

166

to manufacturer’s protocol and a 1.8x bead-to-sample ratio. Purified cDNA was eluted in 10µL

167

nuclease-free water.

168
169
170

SHAPE-MaP Library Construction
Amplicons tiling the SARS-CoV-2 genome were generated using NEBNext UltraII Q5 MasterMix

171

(Cat. No. M0544L), gene-specific forward and reverse PCR primers, and 5µL of purified cDNA. Gene-

172

specific primers used for PCR are listed in Table S3. Touchdown cycling PCR conditions were used to

173

enhance PCR specificity (68-58°C annealing temperature gradient). PCR reaction products were

174

purified with Monarch DNA Clean-up Kits (NEB) with a binding buffer:sample ratio of 2:1 to remove

175

products smaller than 2kb. PCR products were visualized on 0.8% agarose gels to confirm production

176

of correctly sized amplicons. Amplicons were diluted to 0.2ng/uL and then pooled into two odd and two

177

even amplicon pools for downstream library preparation. Sequencing libraries were generated using a

178

NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s protocol, but with 1/5th

179

the recommended volume. Libraries were quantified using a Qubit (Life Technologies) and a

BioAnalyzer (Agilent). Amplicon pools were recombined and sequenced on a NextSeq 500/550

181

platform using a 150 cycle mid-output kit.

183
184

Structure Prediction
All libraries were analyzed using ShapeMapper 2(Busan and Weeks, 2018), aligning reads to

185

SARS-CoV-2 genome (accession number: MN908947). Mutation rates between NAI-modified and

186

unmodified samples were tested for significance using the equal variance t-test. Using reactivities

187

output from ShapeMapper, ShapeKnots(Hajdin et al., 2013) was used to determine whether two

188

previously reported pseudoknots contained in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were predicted with

189

experimental SHAPE constraints. The two pseudoknots tested were the programmed ribosomal

190

frameshifting element that exists at the Orf1a/b boundary, and a pseudoknot in the 3’UTR that was

191

identified in the MHV and B-CoV genomes (references). We analyzed all 500nt windows separated by

192

a 100nt slide that contained each of the putative pseudoknots to determine if the pseudoknot was

193

successfully predicted.

194

SuperFold (Smola et al., 2015b) was used to generate a consensus structure prediction for the

195

entire SARS-CoV-2 genome using SHAPE reactivities obtained from biological replicate 1 as

196

constraints. We imposed a maximum pairing distance of 500nt. As our data only supported formation of

197

the pseudoknot contained in the programmed ribosomal frameshifting element, only this pseudoknot

198

was forced in this prediction. All structures output from the SuperFold prediction were visualized and

199

drawn using StructureEditor, a tool in the RNAStructure software suite(Reuter and Mathews, 2010).

200

Base-pairing distances were calculated from .ct structure files output from SuperFold full-length

201

SARS-CoV-2 consensus predictions, and compared to previously published, publically available full-

202

length genome structures for Dengue and Hepatitis C Virus generated with SHAPE constraints, a max-

203

pairing distance of 500nt, and the SuperFold pipeline (Mauger et al., 2015, Dethoff et al., 2018).

Identification of Well-Folded Regions

206

Two data signatures were used to identify well-folded regions: The first is the SHAPE reactivity

207

data generated with the SHAPE-MaP workflow and the ShapeMapper analysis tool(Busan and Weeks,

208

2018). The second is the Shannon entropy calculated from base-pairing probabilities determined during

209

the SuperFold partition function calculation(Smola et al., 2015b). Two replicate data sets were used,

210

including separate SuperFold predictions.

211

Local median SHAPE reactivity and Shannon Entropy were calculated in 55nt sliding windows.

212

The global median SHAPE reactivity or Shannon Entropy were subtracted from calculated values to aid

213

in data visualization. Regions with local SHAPE and Shannon Entropy signals 1) below the global

214

median 2) for stretches longer than 40 nucleotides 3) that appear in both replicate data sets were

215

considered well-folded. Disruptions, or regions where local SHAPE or Shannon Entropy rose above the

216

global median, are not considered to disqualify well-folded regions if they extended for less than 40

217

nucleotides. Arc plots generated from each replicate consensus structure predication were compared

218

for regions that meet sorting criteria described above in order to ensure agreement between secondary

219

structure models generated from each replicate SHAPE-MaP dataset.

220

Base-pairing distances of well-folded regions were calculated from .ct structure files output from

221

SuperFold consensus predictions, and compared to previously published, publicly available structures

222

for well-folded regions of the HIV genome generated with SHAPE constraints, a max-pairing distance of

223

500nt, and the SuperFold pipeline (Siegfried et al., 2014).

224
225
226

Multiple sequence alignment
To analyze evolutionary support for our consensus secondary structure prediction of the SARS-

227

CoV-2 genome, we generated two codon-based multiple sequence alignments (MSA) for Orf1a and

228

Orf1b constructed from genomes of closely related viral species (Douzery EJP,2018). All sequences

229

were chosen based on a phylogenetic study of SARS-CoV-2 (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020). All sequences

230

referenced below were downloaded from the NCBI Taxonomy browser(Benson et al., 2018).

231

A sarbecovirus MSA was generated using SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947.3),

232

four bat coronaviruses (MG772934.1, JX993987.1, DQ022305.2, DQ648857.1), and five human SARS

233

coronaviruses (AY515512.1, AY274119.3, NC_004718.3, GU553363.1, DQ182595.1).

234

We also generated an “All β-coronavirus Alignment” using the sarbecovirus sequences

235

described above in addition to four MERS-CoV sequences (MK129253, KP209307, MF598594,

236

MG987420), one HKU-4 sequence (MH002337), three HKU-5 sequence (MH002342, NC009020,

237

MH002341), four HKU1 sequences (KY674942, KF686343, AY597011, DQ415903), three murine

238

hepatitis virus sequences (AY700211, AF208067, AB551247), three human coronavirus OC43

239

sequences (AY585229, NC006213, MN026164), two bovine coronavirus sequences (KU558922,

240

KU558923), and one camel coronavirus sequence (MN514966).

241

The orf1a and orf1b region were extracted from the full-length sequences based on the

242

GenBank annotation. Separate codon alignments for both Orf1a and orf1b were generated using

243

MACSE v2.0.3(Ranwez et al., 2018) and default parameters (-prog alignSequences).

244
245
246

Synonymous mutation rate analysis
All codon alignments were visualized and edited using Jalview v 2.11.0(Waterhouse et al.,

247

2009). Synonymous mutation rates for each codon were estimated using the phylogenetic-based

248

parametric maximum likelihood (FUBAR) method(Murrell et al., 2013). Each codon was categorized as

249

base-paired or unpaired depending on strandedness of the nucleotide at the third position of each

250

codon in our SARS-CoV-2 consensus structure model(Dethoff et al., 2018). The significance of

251

synonymous mutation rates between single- and double-stranded regions was determined using two-

252

tailed, equal variance t-test.

RESULTS

268

In-vivo SHAPE-MaP workflow yields high quality data suitable for structure prediction.

269

To study the SARS-CoV-2 structure in the context of infected cells, the SARS-CoV-2 isolate

270

USA-WA1/2020, isolated from an oropharyngeal swab from a patient who had returned to the United

271

States from China and developed clinical disease, was used to infect VeroE6 cells (BEI Resources

272

#NR-52281). Infection was allowed to proceed for four days, at which point cells were collected and

273

treated with either NAI or DMSO. RNA was then extracted and purified. To generate sequencing

274

libraries, 2000 nucleotide (nt) overlapping amplicons were tiled across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome

275

(Fig. 1A). Importantly, this approach is made possible by the utilization of the ultra-high processive

276

reverse transcriptase MarathonRT, which encodes NAI adducts as cDNA mutations during long-

277

amplicon SHAPE-MaP library construction(Guo et al., 2020). Specifically, gene-specific primers were

278

used to prime reverse transcription in the presence of manganese, followed by amplicon PCR with

279

gene-specific primers and cycling conditions designed to enhance specificity(Korbie and Mattick, 2008).

280

Gel electrophoresis confirmed successful amplification of all 16 amplicons (data not shown).

281

Sequencing of SHAPE-MaP libraries was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500/550 platform.

282

After generating two independent biological replicates, the resulting sequencing data were

283

analyzed using the ShapeMapper pipeline(Smola et al., 2015b). Comprehensive datasets were

284

obtained, with median effective read depth > 70,000x and effective reactivity data for 99.7%

285

(29813/29903) of nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in both replicate experiments. To check the

286

SHAPE-MaP data quality, we analyzed the relative mutation rates of NAI-treated and DMSO-treated

287

RNA samples, revealing a significant elevation of mutation rates for NAI-treated samples (Fig. 1B, p-

288

value < 0.0001). This confirms that the full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully modified in-vivo

289

and that these modifications were encoded as cDNA mutations.

290

To understand the relative SHAPE reactivity agreement within local regions of the genome, we

291

calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between two biological replicates. The Pearson’s correlation

292

across the entire span of Orf1ab is 0.62, consistent with those previously reported for reactivities

293

calculated from in-vivo modified RNAs of this size(Smola et al., 2016). Across the sub genomic RNA

294

ORFs, the Pearson ‘s correlation is poor. We believe this reflects the fact that Amplicons 13, 14, 15,

295

and 16 will amplify both full-length and sub-genomic RNAs, and the difference in context will result in

296

different secondary structures(Tavares et al., 2020). For this reason, despite the fact all data have been

297

obtained globally, subsequent discrete structural analysis will focus on shared features of the viral

298

termini and the Orf1ab region.

De novo structure prediction on full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA identifies conserved functional

301

elements at the 5’ and 3’ genomic termini

302

We performed secondary structure prediction with the SuperFold pipeline(Smola et al., 2015b),

303

using the in-vivo SHAPE reactivities to generate an experimentally constrained consensus secondary

304

structure prediction for the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome. As an extensive body of research has

305

elucidated structured RNA elements at the 5’ and 3’ viral termini as well as the Orf1ab boundary, with

306

conserved functions across β-coronaviruses, we first examined these regions from our consensus

307

prediction to determine whether they were stably folded and well-determined in the SARS-CoV-2

308

genome.

309

The 5’ genomic terminus includes seven regions that have been identified and studied in other

310

coronaviruses (Reviewed in (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015)). While sequence conservation suggested that

311

these elements might be conserved in SARS-CoV-2, our consensus structure prediction shows this to

312

be the case, and we derived a specific experimentally-determined structure for this section of the

313

genome. The in-vivo SHAPE reactivity data correspond well with the resulting structural model (Fig 2A,

314

inset) and the low overall Shannon entropy values in this region (determined from base pair probability

315

calculation during the SuperFold prediction pipeline(Smola et al., 2015b)) support a well-determined

316

structure for the 5’ genomic terminus (medianNuc(1-400) = 2.7x10-5 ; global median = 0.022).

317

Individual features that typify coronavirus structures are evident in the secondary structure of

318

the SARS-CoV-2 5’-UTR with good SHAPE reactivity agreement (Fig 2A, inset). For example, we

319

observe a bipartite domain architecture for SL1, which was previously reported to play a role in

320

coronavirus replication(Li et al., 2008) (Fig 2A, labeled SL1). Similarity between SL1 structures

321

reported for other coronaviruses and the experimentally-determined structure reported here for SARS-

322

CoV-2 suggests that SL1 plays a similar role in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

323

Structural studies of SARS-CoV SL2 have shown that the SL2 pentaloop is stacked atop a 5-bp

324

stem. In addition, the pentaloop adopts a canonical CUYG fold in which the uracil is flipped out,

325

resulting in an architecture that is important for sgRNA synthesis(Lee et al., 2011). Our experimentally-

326

determined structure of SL2 from SARS-CoV-2 shows that it adopts exactly the same RNA fold (Fig 2A,

327

labeled SL2), again suggesting that it plays the same functional role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

328

The transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) is a conserved feature of β-coronaviruses and it is

329

required for sgRNA production(Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). The SARS-CoV leader TRS is predicted in

330

silico to be in stem loop 3 (SL3), with nucleotides exposed in its loop and base-paired in the stem(Chen

331

and Olsthoorn, 2010). The primary sequence of the SARS-CoV leader TRS is absolutely conserved

332

between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2(Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010) ( 5’-ACGAAC-3’). Importantly, our

13

333

consensus prediction shows the SARS-CoV-2 leader TRS is also found in SL3, with a similar structural

334

organization as reported for other viruses (Fig 2A, labeled SL3, TRS indicated with solid black line).

335

The SL4 of SARS-CoV-2 adopts a bipartite domain structure (Fig 2A, labeled SL4a, SL4b)

336

similar to that reported for MHV(Kang et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2015). Importantly, the AUG of the

337

predicted upstream ORF(uORF), which is phylogenetically conserved among β-coronaviruses(Raman

338

et al., 2003), is found in the top-most stem loop of SL4a, meaning it would be accessible for recognition

339

by a scanning ribosome (Fig 2A, uORF start codon indicated with solid grey line).

340

As predicted across coronaviruses(Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010), the trifurcated stem at the top of

341

SL5 is observed in the experimentally-determined structure of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 2A, labeled SL5A-C).

342

This includes UUCGU pentaloop motifs in SL5A and SL5B, and a GNRA tetraloop in SLC. Previous

343

reports suggest this may represent a packaging signal for GroupIIB CoVs(Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010).

344

SL6 and SL7 are predicted in the SARS-CoV-2 structure, and the in-vivo SHAPE data agree

345

strongly support the existence of these stems (Fig 2A, labeled SL6 and SL7). However, functional

346

evidence for SL6 and SL7 is lacking in the literature for any coronavirus.

347

The 3’ genomic terminus includes three well-studied stems, including the bulged-stem loop

348

(BSL), Stem Loop 1 (SLI), and a long-bulge stem that includes the hypervariable-region (HVR), the

349

S2M domain, the octanucleotide motif (ONM) subdomains, and a pseudoknot (Reviewed in (Yang and

350

Leibowitz, 2015)). The consensus structure recapitulates the secondary structure of all the three stems

351

with good SHAPE reactivity agreement (Fig 2B, inset) and overall low Shannon entropy

352

(medianNuc(29,472-29,870) = 0.016 ; global median = 0.022). While the BSL is well determined in our

353

structure, the low reactivity for bulged nucleotides suggests the possibility of protein binding-partners

354

(Fig 2B, labeled BSL).

355

A pseudoknot structure is proposed to exist between the base of the BSL stem loop and the

356

loop of SL1 in coronaviruses(Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). While pseudoknot formation is mutually

357

exclusive with the base of the BSL, studies in MHV have suggested that both structures contribute to

358

viral replication and the mutually exclusive structures are thought to function as a molecular switch in

14

359

different steps of RNA synthesis(Goebel et al., 2004). However, our in-vivo determined secondary

360

structure is inconsistent with formation of the pseudoknot (Fig 2B, putative base-pairing interactions

361

indicated by black lines). The low SHAPE reactivities for the nucleotides at the base of the BSL support

362

formation of the extended BSL stem, while high-reactivities of the nucleotides in the loop of SLI indicate

363

that it is highly accessible. Using the SHAPEKnots program for robust predication of pseudoknots

364

(implemented in RNA structure v5.8(Hajdin et al., 2013)), we found that a pseudoknot is never

365

predicted in three 500nt windows that cover the pseudoknotted region. Taken together, our data

366

strongly support the extended BSL conformation, indicating it is probably the dominant conformation in-

367

vivo.

368

The third stem in the 3’ UTR includes three sub-domains. The HVR, so-named because it is

369

poorly conserved across group II coronaviruses(Goebel et al., 2007), is predicted to be mostly single-

370

stranded in our secondary structure, and the high reactivities across the span of this region lends

371

strong experimental support for an unstructured region (Fig. 2B, region indicated with solid black line

372

and labeled HVR). The fact that this region is highly unstructured may also explain why it has been

373

experimentally demonstrated to tolerate numerous deletions, rearrangements, and point mutations in

374

MHV(Goebel et al., 2007).

375

The S2M region is contained within the apical part of the third stem. We observe that the first

376

three helices of S2M from SARS-CoV-2 exactly match the crystal structure determined for S2M from

377

SARS-CoV (Robertson et al., 2005). However, our in-vivo structure deviates significantly at the top of

378

the stem, with bases that are highly reactive (Fig. 2B, region indicated with solid black line and labeled

379

S2M). It is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 S2M folds into a unique S2M conformation despite differing

380

by only a two bases (Fig. 2B, base-changes indicated by arrows; SARS-CoV base identity shown in

381

red). Indeed, as both single-nucleotide changes are transversions, any base-pairing interaction

382

involving these nucleotides in the SARS-CoV S2M structure could not be maintained in SARS-CoV-2.

383

Alternatively, this site could interact with factors in-vivo that are not captured in the crystallographic

384

study.

385

The ONM is predicted at the central bulge between the S2M region and the HVR region. The

386

sequence is absolutely conserved across β-coronavirus(Goebel et al., 2007), but no functional

387

significance has yet been shown. In our consensus structure, it is single-stranded (Fig. 2B, ONM

388

indicated with solid black line and labeled ONM).

389

Finally, we predict a completely different structure for the downstream terminal stem in the viral

390

3’UTR region (adjacent to the poly-A tail) than previously reported for other coronaviruses(Zust et al.,

391

2008). However, our structure prediction in this region is not highly accurate because of proximity of the

392

primer binding site. That said, the putative stem is predicted to have high Shannon entropy

393

(medianNuc(29472-29495,29853-29870) = 0.2154 ; global median = 0.022), suggesting that it is not a well-ordered

394

structure in the cellular environment.

395
396

Structure prediction of the programmed ribosomal frame-shifting element reveals

397

conformational flexibility

398

One of the most well-studied RNA structures in the coronavirus coding region is the

399

programmed frame-shifting pseudoknot (PRF). It is located between orf1a and orf1b and plays an

400

important role in inducing a -1 frameshift in a translating ribosome, resulting in the synthesis of the

401

polyprotein ab, which includes the SARS-CoV-2 replicase (Plant and Dinman, 2008).

402

The PRF element previously characterized in SARS-CoV is proposed to contain three parts: an

403

attenuator stem loop, a conserved heptanucleotide “slippery” sequence, and a H-type pseudoknot

404

(Plant and Dinman, 2008). We performed SHAPEKnots(Hajdin et al., 2013) over four 500nt windows

405

that cover the pseudoknotted region in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to check if the PRF pseudoknot can

406

be discerned from our vivo SHAPE data. We found that the pseudoknot is successfully predicted in 3

407

out of 4 windows generated by ShapeKnots. Moreover, the nucleotides predicted to be involved in the

408

pseudoknotted helix have low SHAPE-reactivity (Fig. 3A, pseudoknot base-pairs indicated with red

409

lines). Our in-vivo SHAPE data therefore strongly support the formation of the pseudoknotted helix, and

16

410

the frame-shifting pseudoknot was thereafter included as a hard constraint during secondary structure

411

prediction.

412

The most probable, dominant structure of the PRF region, extracted from the full-length in-vivo

413

secondary structure, is shown in Fig. 3A. In our model, the SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy

414

calculation support a well-folded attenuator stem (AS) immediately upstream of the heptanucleotide

415

slippery sequence (HSS) (Fig 3A; AS and HSS indicated with labeled, solid black lines). The attenuator

416

stem has been demonstrated to be important for attenuating frameshifting in SARS-CoV(Cho et al.,

417

2013), and previous reports suggested that the attenuator stem structure is not well conserved between

418

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2(Kelly et al., 2020). By contrast, our results suggest a SARS-CoV-2-

419

specific fold for the attenuator stem. The highly conserved heptanucleotide slippery sequence is

420

predicted to be single-stranded in our in-vivo structural model, which is consistent with studies on other

421

coronaviruses(Plant et al., 2005, Plant and Dinman, 2008).

422

Overall, the dominant structure prediction for the H-type pseudoknot in our structural model

423

differs from the one characterized in SARS-CoV. The H-type pseudokont in SARS-CoV is composed of

424

three coaxially stacked stems: SL1, SL2 and the pseudoknotted helix(Plant et al., 2005). The SL1 stem,

425

which contains the upstream pseudoknotted loop, is well folded in our consensus model as indicated by

426

SHAPE reactivity mapping (Fig. 3A; labeled SL1) and Shannon entropy (Fig. 3C, medianNuc(13476-13503)

427

= 1.9x10-4; global median = 0.022). Importantly, the region reported to contain the SL2 stem(Rangan et

428

al., 2020, Plant et al., 2005) is predicted as single-stranded in our consensus structure, and

429

consequently does not include SL2 (Fig 3A; region indicated by dotted black line). Rather, the

430

dominant structure predicted for the PRF includes a different stem, SL3, that includes the downstream

431

pseudoknot arm (Fig 3A; labeled SL3). However, neither the single-stranded region nor SL3 are well-

432

determined in our structure as indicated by Shannon entropy mapping to the region (Fig. 3C,

433

medianNuc(13503-13534) = 0.24; global median = 0.022, labeled with a dotted black-line and SL3,

434

respectively).

435

As SuperFold calculates a partition function, lower probability base-pairing interactions are

436

captured during structure prediction steps. We therefore checked alternative, low probability base-pair

437

interactions captured for the PRF region. We found that the single-stranded region (Fig. 3A; indicated

438

by dotted black line) forms base-pairing interaction as many as 6 different regions in the SARS-CoV-2

439

genome (data not shown), We sought to determine if the previously reported SL2 conformation was

440

captured among them. Indeed, an alternate, lower probability structure containing an extended SL2 is

441

generated in the SuperFold prediction with the attenuator stem, heptanucleotide slippery sequence,

442

and SL1 intact. (Fig. 3B; alternate SL2 conformation labeled). In this variation, the SL2 stem is

443

predicted to fold with a median probability of 20% as determined from the probabilities of each

444

individual base-pair of the SL2 stem (Fig. 3D; individual base-pairs indicated with grey dots). In

445

contrast, the SL3 stem predicted in our dominant consensus structure has as much as 80% probability

446

of folding. The chemical probing data does not strongly support one structure over another (Fig. 3A and

447

Fig. 3B) and likely reflects structural flexibility and pairing promiscuity for the SL2 region. Taken

448

together, data determined in-vivo suggest that the frame-shifting pseudoknot in SARS-CoV-2 includes a

449

well-folded attenuator stem, SL1, and a pseudoknot, but that the region containing the putative SL2 is

450

conformationally flexible. Future studies are needed to explore if there is relationship between the

451

structural flexibility and the mechanistic role of the frameshifting pseudoknot.

452
453

The secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 Orf1ab reveals a network of unique RNA structural

454

elements

455

While the successful identification of known, functional RNA structural elements lends strong

456

support for our methodology and for the overall secondary structural model, these known regions

457

account for only 3% of the total nucleotide content of the SARS-CoV-2 genome; little is known about

458

remaining 97%.

460

Here we report the first in-vivo-derived, SHAPE-constrained secondary structural model that
includes a description of the base-pairing interactions for all nucleotides within a coronavirus genome

461

(Fig. 4A; secondary structures described by arc plots underneath each of the three SHAPE/Shannon

462

plots). Representative secondary structural maps of small regions extracted from the consensus

463

prediction exemplify the types of substructures that are observed in protein-encoding regions of SARS-

464

CoV-2 (Fig. 4B, structures contained within Nsp3 and spanning Nsp6&7; nt4716-5682, nt11221-12043,

465

respectively). This resource is a valuable roadmap for ongoing studies, and to that end, a .ct file for the

466

full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome structure is freely available (see Data Availability).

467

To discover additional, well-folded RNA structures within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we used a

468

sliding 55nt window to calculate the local median Shannon Entropy and we correlated these values with

469

experimentally-determined SHAPE reactivities (Fig 4A). Only regions with both median Shannon

470

entropy and SHAPE reactivity signals below the global median for stretches longer than 40nt, and

471

which appear in both replicate data sets, were considered well-determined and stable. In total, we

472

identify 40 such regions in Orf1ab (Fig. 4B, shaded). Hereafter, any structured region that meets these

473

above criteria will be referred to as “well-folded.”

474

We also identified well-folded regions in the subgenomic RNA region (data not shown).

475

However, our previous correlation analysis suggests that the SHAPE signal from this region includes

476

reactivity signals from multiple RNA species, including genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Given the

477

method deployed to construct our SHAPE-MaP sequencing libraries, it is impossible to deconvolute

478

sgRNA data from genomic data, and new approaches will be required to separate genomic from

479

subgenomic structures. While it will be interesting to explore this issue in subsequent studies, the

480

following analysis focuses on stable structures within the orf1ab region, which can be uniquely

481

determined.

482

To understand architectural organization of the overall “structuredness”, or base-pair content

483

(BPC) within orf1ab, we calculated the double-strand content of individual protein domains within this

484

region of the genome (Fig. 5A, grey bars). We find that all protein domains have comparable BPC, with

485

an average of 56% (+/- 6.09%) of nucleotides involved in base-pairing interactions. However, the RNA

486

sequences within each protein domain are not equivalently well-folded (Fig 5A, black bars). For

487

example, we observe that ~50% of nucleotides within the 5’UTR, Nsp1, Nsp6, Nsp8, and Nsp12 are

488

concentrated in well-folded regions, suggesting these domains may be hubs for regulatory RNA

489

structures. By contrast, Nsp13, Nsp14, and Nsp16 have <15% of their nucleotide content lies in

490

discretely well-folded regions. At the most extreme end, Nsp10 contains no nucleotides in well-folded

491

regions. Considering that Nsp10 is located immediately upstream of the PRF, this lack of well-folded

492

structures may be important to direct proper frameshifting.

493

While analyzing the resulting secondary structural map, we noticed that the SARS-CoV-2

494

genome contains long-stretches of short, locally-folded stem loops (for example - Fig. 4B) with few

495

long-distance base-pairing interactions such as those indicated by large arcs in typical arc plots (Fig.

496

4A). Wondering if this was quantifiable feature unique to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we calculated the

497

distance between base-paired nucleotides for every base-pairing interaction in our SARS-CoV-2

498

structural model. We compared these SARS-COV-2 base-pairing distances to those we calculated from

499

published full-length structural models for HCV(Mauger et al., 2015) and Dengue Virus(Dethoff et al.,

500

2018), where the data were prepared using the same structure prediction pipeline and constraints used

501

in our study. Interestingly, the median base-pairing distance in our SARS-CoV-2 consensus model is

502

25nt, and is significantly smaller than the median base-pairing distance in the HCV (median=40nt) and

503

Dengue Virus (median=33nt) consensus models (Fig. 5B). Even more, the upper bound of the

504

interquartile range (IQR) that describes the distribution of base-pairing distances in Dengue and HCV

505

genomes is much higher than the same bound in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (SARS-CoV-2 75th

506

percentile = 46nt; Dengue Virus 75th Percentile = 104nt; HCV 75th percentile = 101nt). This suggests

507

SARS-CoV-2 has fewer long-distance base-paring interactions compared to Dengue and HCV genome.

508

We also calculated the median base-pairing distance for the well-folded regions of the SARS-

509

CoV-2 genome and compared the result to well-folded regions previously identified using the same Low

510

Shannon/Low SHAPE signatures in the HIV genome(Siegfried et al., 2014). We found that although

511

there is no significant difference in the size of well-folded regions in the SARS-CoV2 and HIV genomes

512

(data not shown), the median base-pairing distance in the well-folded regions of SARS-CoV-2 (median

513

= 26nt) is significantly lower than the base-pairing distance in well-folded regions of HIV (median = 34nt)

514

(Fig. 5C). Similarly, the upper bound of the IQR that describes the distribution of base-pairing distances

515

in well-folded regions of the HIV genome is much higher than the same bound in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-

516

CoV-2 75th percentile = 44nt; HIV 75th percentile = 133nt).

517

Taken together, these results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 genome folds into more local

518

secondary structures, such as the short stem-loops in Fig. 4B, and contains fewer long-range base-

519

pairing interactions than observed for other positive-sense RNA viruses. Given the exceptional size of

520

the coronavirus genome (~30kb) relative to those of the positive-sense RNA viruses compared here

521

(~10kb), it is possible that the short base-pairing distance of SARS-CoV2 may carry functional

522

implications for maintaining genomic stability, preserving fidelity of translation, and evading innate

523

immune response.

524
525
526

The overall structured-ness of the SARS-CoV-2 is conserved across all β-coronaviruses
Synonymous mutations rates have been used previously to lend evolutionary support for well-

527

folded RNA secondary structures in other positive-sense RNA viruses(Dethoff et al., 2018, Tuplin et al.,

528

2002, Assis, 2014, Simmonds and Smith, 1999). This body of work has suggested lower synonymous

529

rates for double-stranded nucleotides when compared to single-stranded nucleotides in viral RNAs,

530

likely reflecting an evolutionary pressure to maintain base-pairing interactions of double-stranded

531

nucleotides. We therefore computed relative synonymous mutation rates to determine how evolutionary

532

pressure is applied to single- and double-stranded regions of the SARS-CoV2 genome.

533

To generate the codon-based alignment, 33 full-length genome sequences from the NCBI

534

Taxonomy database(Benson et al., 2018) were collected, including 12 SARS-CoV genomes, 8 MERS-

535

CoV genomes, and 13 more distantly related β-coronaviruses genomes. This alignment was then used

536

to calculate synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates (dS and dN, respectively) for each codon

537

in the SARS-CoV2 orf1ab region using A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for inferring

538

selection (FUBAR) (Murrell et al., 2013). We then separated dS and dN into single- or double-stranded

539

bins as predicted in our consensus model. The strandedness of each codon was determined by the

540

strandedness at the third position of the codon(Dethoff et al., 2018).

541

In the “All β-Coronavirus” alignment, we observed a significantly lower synonymous mutation

542

rate (p<0.0001) for double-stranded codons (median = 3.765; IQR = 3.034-4.978) when compared to

543

single-stranded codons (median = 4.189; IQR = 3.232 - 5.562) in our consensus model (Fig. 6A). In

544

contrast, there was no significant difference (p = 0.86) observed for non-synonymous mutation rates

545

(dN) at single- (median = 0.4535; IQR = 0.103 – 0.685) or double-stranded codons (median = 0.453;

546

IQR = 0.139 – 0.675) (Fig. 6B) as dN reflects changes at the amino acid level. This suggests that

547

double-stranded regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome experience stronger selective pressure against

548

synonymous mutations than single-stranded regions, which lends support to our consensus model and

549

suggests evolutionary maintenance of the observed secondary structure. Because an all β-coronavirus

550

alignment was used, our results indicate that the structural organization and overall base-pairing

551

content of Orf1ab is a conserved feature of the β-coronavirus family.

552

When analyzing relative synonymous mutation rates within individual protein domains, we

553

observed significantly decreased synonymous mutation rates for double-stranded codons in Nsp1,

554

Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp4, Nsp6, Nsp8, Nsp12, Nsp13, and Nsp15 (Fig. 6C). Consistent with this, Nsp1, Nsp6,

555

Nsp8, and Nsp12 have >50% of their nucleotides localized within well-folded regions (Fig. 5A, black

556

bars). Taken together, this suggests that certain protein-coding domains contain regions of RNA

557

secondary structure that are conserved across β-Coronaviruses. For example, Nsp8, which is the most

558

well folded domain in SARS-CoV-2, is likely well-folded in other β-Coronaviruses.

559

By contrast, the base pairing content of Nsp5, Nsp7, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp14, and Nsp16 does not

560

appear to be conserved, as there is no significant difference in synonymous mutation rates of single-

561

and double-stranded codons (Fig. 6C). Consistent with this, Nsp14 and Nsp16 were shown to have

562

<15% of their nucleotides in well-folded regions, while Nsp10 does not contain any well-folded

563

nucleotides (Fig. 5A). Not only does this analysis support the observation that these regions of RNA

22

564

are not well-folded in SARS-CoV-2, our data suggest these regions may not be well folded in other β-

565

Coronaviruses.

566
567

Evolutionary analysis for individual well-folded regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome identifies

568

several conserved regions

569

To further prioritize structural elements that may have conserved functional roles in the SARS-

570

CoV2 life cycle, we next applied our synonymous mutation rate analysis to each of the 40 discrete well-

571

folded domains identified by Low Shannon/Low SHAPE signatures (Fig. 4B, Table S1). Four regions

572

(regions 23, 25, 34, and 36) that are well-determined based on their low median Shannon Entropy

573

values (Table S1) and SHAPE reactivity data showed significantly decreased synonymous mutation

574

rates at double-stranded codons when compared to single-stranded codons across the β-coronavirus

575

alignment (Fig. 7A, 7B). Among those structures, region 25 and 34 are found at protein domain

576

boundaries. Region 25 ends exactly at the Nsp8/9 domain boundary, while Region 34 spans the

577

Nsp12/13 boundary. Region 23, 34, and 36 (Fig. 7C, Fig. 7E, Fig. 7F) contain a series of stem-loops

578

with small bulges. Region 25 contains a long-range duplex that closes a clover-leaf like structure with 8

579

stem-loops radiating from a central loop (Fig. 7D). This hub, or multi-helix junction might represent a

580

promising drug target, as multi-helix junctions often contain binding pockets with high binding affinity

581

and selectivity for small molecules(Warner et al., 2018).

582

Within the Sarbecovirus subgenus, we were able to identify four regions (regions 15, 22, 24, 27,

583

and 30) that are well-determined in our secondary structural model (based on low median Shannon

584

Entropy (Table S1) and SHAPE reactivity data) with significantly decreased synonymous mutation

585

rates in double-stranded relative to single-stranded codons (Fig. 8A, 8B). Among these structures,

586

Region 24 contains two discrete multi-helix junctions, each with at least three stems radiating from

587

large central loops (Fig. 8C). Region 27, which contains a series of six stem-loops, is particularly

588

significant because it is only 100nt downstream of the PRF in Nsp12 (Fig 8D). Region 15, like Region

589

24, contains several well-determined long-range duplexes that segment the region into two discrete

590

multi-helix junctions (Fig. 8E). Region 22 contains a series of well-folded loops and it spans the Nsp5/6

591

boundary (Fig. 8F). Region 30 is a single stem-loop with bulges that divide the stem into distinct

592

duplexes (Fig. 8G)

593

To look for evolutionary evidence that directly supports conservation of specific base-pairing

594

interactions and secondary structures, we performed covariation analysis on the 5 structures that are

595

supported by Sarbecovirus-specific synonymous mutation rates. We visualized the base-pair

596

covariation levels using R-chie (Lai et al., 2012) and we used R-scape version 0.2.1(Rivas et al., 2017)

597

with the RAFSp statistics(Tavares et al., 2019) to test the statistical significance of putatively covarying

598

base-pairs. Specifically, we identified 3 regions (15, 22, and 30) that have covariation support (Fig. 8E-

599

G). Region 15 has three significantly covarying base-pairs at the terminus of the downstream stem loop

600

(e-value < 0.05, Fig. 8E); Region 22 has 2 nucleotides with have one-sided variation in the most

601

upstream stem loop (e-value < 0.05, Fig. 8F); Region 30 has 3 covarying base-pairs at the very top of

602

the stem loop, and a single covarying pair at the bottom portion of the stem (e-value < 0.05, Fig. 8G).

603

Taken together, these results suggest the existence of stable, evolutionarily conserved structural

604

elements that merit subsequent functional analysis.

605
606
607

Discussion
Here we establish that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA has an extraordinarily complex molecular

608

architecture, filled with elaborate secondary and tertiary structural features that persist in-vivo and

609

which are conserved through time, suggesting that this network of RNA secondary structural elements

610

plays a functional role in the virus lifecycle. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains more well-

611

determined RNA structures than any virus studied to date, suggesting that its inherent “structuredness”

612

contributes in a unique way to viral fitness. This RNA secondary structural complexity is not just

613

confined to untranslated regions of the genome, as protein-coding sections of the SARS-CoV-2 open

614

reading frame are among the most well-structured regions. Thus, as observed for HCV, coronavirus

615

reading frames experience evolutionary pressure that simultaneously shapes both protein sequence

616

and the surrounding RNA structures in which the proteins are encoded (a “code within the

617

code”)(Pirakitikulr et al., 2016). The secondary structure that we report is well-determined based on

618

available metrics in the field(Siegfried et al., 2014). It is both a roadmap for navigating the vast RNA

619

landscape in coronaviruses, and a resource for orthogonal studies by others. As such, the data

620

reported here are all publicly available for analysis and comparison by others

621

https://github.com/pylelab/SARS-CoV-2_SHAPE_MaP_structure.

622

Well-determined secondary structures of long RNA molecules are typically difficult to obtain in-

623

vivo(Mitchell et al., 2019, Leamy et al., 2016). They are usually derived from transcripts that have been

624

refolded and probed in-vitro, or from isolated cellular transcripts that have been stripped of cellular

625

components(Smola et al., 2015a, Siegfried et al., 2014). What is particularly surprising about this

626

SARS-CoV-2 study, and the high quality of the resulting secondary structure, is the fact that it was

627

entirely determined in-vivo, using infected cells that were treated directly with chemical probes. This

628

may be attributable to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is so abundant in the infected cell,

629

ultimately becoming ~65% of the total cellular RNA(Kim et al., 2020). With so much RNA material, it

630

becomes possible to maximize the signal to noise ratio in chemical probing experiments. In addition,

631

the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may overwhelm the cell’s ability to coat transcripts with

632

nonspecific RNA binding proteins, which can otherwise limit accessibility of chemical probes. That said,

633

it will be interesting to compare the structure reported here with that obtained “ex vivo” (stripped of

634

protein), as that ∆SHAPE approach provides a useful way to flag possible protein binding sites(Smola

635

et al., 2015a).

636

The resulting experimental secondary structure provides new insights into known coronaviral

637

RNA motifs, and leads to the prediction of new ones that are likely to regulate viral function. The near

638

perfect structural homology of motifs at the 5’ terminus for SARS-CoV-2 and other β-coronavirus

639

genomes suggests that the function of these upstream elements is conserved in coronaviruses

640

(reviewed in (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015)). Furthermore, because our SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure

641

was determined in-vivo, our findings validate previous coronavirus structural models of 5’-elements, as

642

our data were obtained in a biologically relevant context.

643

Our SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure at the 3’ viral terminus largely agrees with previous

644

studies on other β-coronavirus genomes (reviewed in(Yang and Leibowitz, 2015)). However, our model

645

of the 3’ viral terminus deviates in one important way. Neither the raw SHAPE reactivity data nor the

646

subsequent secondary structure prediction supports formation of a pseudoknot proposed between the

647

base of the BSL and SLI. Indeed, the putative pseudoknot conformation is mutually exclusive with the

648

well-structured stem that we report at the base of the BSL. However, both conformations are proposed

649

to be essential in MHV(Goebel et al., 2004), so it is possible that the pseudoknot exists as a minority

650

conformation, or is transiently folded in SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, because our structure represents

651

the first detailed description of a coronavirus 3’UTR structure in-vivo, it is possible this pseudoknot is

652

not present in other viruses.

653

Arguably the best-studied structural element in coronaviruses is the programmed ribosomal

654

frameshifting pseudoknot (PRF). Required for proper replicase translation in all coronavirus family

655

members, the PRF adopts different conformations in the various coronaviruses, including three-

656

stemmed, two-stemmed, and kissing-loop pseudoknots (Baranov et al., 2005, Plant and Dinman, 2008).

657

The core of the SARS-CoV PRF, which shares an almost identical sequence with SARS-CoV-2, is

658

predicted to form a three-stem pseudoknot comprised of SLI, SL2, and a pseudoknot helix, with an

659

additional upstream attenuator stem that is poorly conserved in SARS-CoV-2(Kelly et al., 2020). Our

660

SHAPE reactivity and structure prediction are consistent with the existence of an attenuator stem, SL1,

661

and the pseudoknot. However, our data indicate that the region corresponding to SL2 is

662

conformationally flexible, adopting an SL2 stem with only a 20% probability. Consistent with our

663

reported distribution of structural isoforms, Kelly et al. use a reporter assay to suggest that the

664

frequency of successful frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2 is about 20%(Kelly et al., 2020), indicating that

665

the observed conformational variability of SL2 may be functional. Indeed, SL2 might function like a

666

switch: When SL2 is formed (~20% of the time), frameshifting occurs. When unfolded or forming base-

667

pairs with structures outside the PRF region, frameshifting would not occur. Further studies are

668

therefore required to explore the relationship between SL2 formation and SARS-CoV-2 frame-shifting

669

efficiency.

670

The study reported here provides a structure prediction for every single nucleotide in the SARS-

671

CoV-2 genome, enabling us to simultaneously interrogate both global and local features of genome

672

architecture. One can make two major observations about the global architecture the SARS-CoV-2

673

genome. First, this in-vivo derived, SHAPE-constrained model strongly agrees with the high double-

674

strand RNA content predicted from the entirely in silico model recently reported by our lab (Tavares et

675

al., 2020). Because the data herein were obtained in-vivo, this work confirms that the unusually high

676

double-strand content is maintained in a cellular context. Secondly, analysis of the experimental

677

secondary structure reveals that the SARS-CoV-2 genome has a shorter median base-pairing distance

678

when compared with other positive-sense RNA viral genomes, suggesting a role for extreme

679

compaction in the function of coronaviral genomes. Downstream analysis of synonymous mutation

680

rates suggests that global architectural features are conserved across β-coronaviruses. Considering

681

the exceptional size of these genomes, the high degree of dsRNA content may represent an

682

evolutionary strategy to enhance genome stability, as duplex RNA undergoes self-hydrolysis at a much

683

slower rate than single-stranded RNA and it is more resistant to cellular nucleases(Regulski and

684

Breaker, 2008, Wan et al., 2011). Interestingly, single-stranded regions in mRNA have been shown to

685

mediate phase separation at high cellular RNA concentrations(Van Treeck et al., 2018). Because

686

SARS-CoV-2 RNA is very abundant in-vivo (up to 65% of total cellular RNA content (Kim et al., 2020))

687

it is possible the high dsRNA content may provide a strategy to avoid phase separation during infection.

688

The preference for abundant locally folded, short stem-loop structures in β-coronavirus genomes may

689

also provide a conserved strategy for innate immune evasion. Pattern recognition receptors such as

690

MDA5(Dias Junior et al., 2019) and ADAR modification(Nishikura, 2010) proteins recognize long RNA

691

duplexes as part of host defense processes, which could obviously be avoided by keeping duplex

692

lengths short.

693

Analysis of local features within the genome pinpoints 40 well-folded regions within the SARS-

694

CoV-2 orf1ab region. Of these 40 regions, at least five are conserved across all β-coronaviruses and

695

four are sarbecovirus specific. Four of the nine regions (Region 25, Region 34, Region 22, Region 24)

696

span boundaries between non-structural proteins, which may have relevance for polyprotein translation.

697

Previous studies have shown that RNA secondary structures can slow the rate of ribosome

698

translocation(Chen et al., 2013) and ribosome stalling is known to be important for proper folding of

699

nascent polypeptides(Collart and Weiss, 2020). Conserved, well-folded RNA structures at protein

700

domain boundaries may therefore slow or stall translocating ribosomes, thus allowing individual non-

701

structural proteins in the large Orf1a and Orf1ab poly-proteins to fold into their native conformations.

702

Intriguingly, three of the nine well-folded regions (Region 15, Region 24, Region 25) contain

703

complex, multi-helix junctions, or structural hubs. This is significant because multi-helix junctions often

704

comprise the core of RNA tertiary structures, like group II self-splicing introns, riboswitches and other

705

regulatory elements. Because these elements are likely to contain well-defined pockets, they often

706

bind specifically to small molecules, and therefore serve as possible drug targets (Warner et al., 2018,

707

Hewitt et al., 2019, Fedorova et al., 2018).

708

One important cautionary observation from our work is the poor correlation of SHAPE

709

reactivities between two in-vivo biological replicates for regions encoding the subgenomic RNAs.

710

Previous in silico work from our lab has shown that individual subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs), such as the

711

N sgRNA, fold differently than the corresponding regions in the genomic RNA due to differences in

712

upstream sequence context(Tavares et al., 2020). Though our tiled-amplicon design affords

713

sequencing coverage for the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, it precludes deconvolution of reactivity

714

signals for regions shared between genomic- and subgenomic RNAs. This underscores the need for

715

methodological innovations that accurately assess the structural content specific to subgenomic RNA

716

molecules. Absent such methodological advances, we caution others when interpreting reactivities

717

from the subgenomic region.

The in-vivo-determined SARS-CoV2 secondary structure present here provides a roadmap for

719

functional studies of the SARS-CoV2 genome and insights into mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 life

720

cycle. Evolutionary support for consensus model across β-coronaviruses hints at conserved strategies

721

for genome stability, translation fidelity, and innate immune evasion. Finally, the identification of

722

individual well-folded regions conserved across β-coronaviruses, and within the sarbecovirus subgenus,

723

provide potential targets for the study of regulatory elements, and the search for much-needed
