Abstract

2

Targeted therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially

3

severe cases, are currently lacking. As macrophages have unique effector functions as a first-line

4

defense against invading pathogens, we genetically armed human macrophages with chimeric

5

antigen receptors (CARs) to reprogram their phagocytic activity against SARS-CoV-2. After

6

investigation of CAR constructs with different intracellular receptor domains, we found that

7

although cytosolic domains from MERTK (CARMERTK) did not trigger antigen-specific cellular

8

phagocytosis or killing effects, unlike those from MEGF10, FcRγ and CD3ζ did, these CARs all

9

mediated similar SARS-CoV-2 clearance in vitro. Notably, we showed that CARMERTK

10

macrophages reduced the virion load without upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression.

11

These results suggest that CARMERTK drives an ‘immunologically silent’ scavenger effect in

12

macrophages and pave the way for further investigation of CARs for the treatment of individuals

13

with COVID-19, particularly those with severe cases at a high risk of hyperinflammation.

Introduction

2

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a sudden significant

3

increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan disease and has led to more

4

than 300,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory

5

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus.

6

SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic or cause a wide spectrum of symptoms,

7

ranging from mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection to life-threatening sepsis.1

8

Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease

9

characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with

10

COVID-19, including 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms

11

necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19

12

require supplemental oxygen.1,2 The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by

13

age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 patients among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9

14

deaths per 1000 patients among patients aged 85 years or older. Among patients

15

hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality can reach 40%.1

16

There is currently no human vaccine available for SARS-CoV-2, but approximately

17

120 candidates are under development. In the development of an effective vaccine, a

18

number of challenges must be overcome, such as technical barriers, the feasibility of

19

large-scale production and regulation, legal barriers, the potential duration of immunity

20

and thus the number of vaccine doses needed to confer immunity, and the

21

antibody-dependent enhancement effect. Moreover, there is another complicated area to

22

consider: drug development for COVID-19, especially treatments for patients with severe

23

or late-stage disease. Dexamethasone therapy was reported to reduce 28-day mortality in

24

patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%;

25

age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) 3, and remdesivir was reported to

26

improve the time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen required)

27

from 15 to 11 days.4 In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent

28

plasma did not shorten the time to recovery5. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies,

29

immune modulators, and anticoagulants; however, there is no specific antiviral treatment

30

recommended for COVID-19.

1

Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that redirect T cell activity

2

towards specific targets6. A CAR construct includes antigen-recognition domains in the

3

form of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or a binding receptor/ligand in the

4

extracellular domains, a transmembrane domain providing the scaffold and signaling

5

transduction, and intracellular domains from the T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory

6

molecules that trigger T cell activation7. Based on the longstanding interest in harnessing

7

macrophages to combat tumor growth8,9, human macrophages engineered with CARs have

8

been developed and characterized for their antitumor potential. Macrophages, critical

9

effectors of the innate immune system, are responsible for sensing and responding to

10

microbial threats and promoting tissue repair. We therefore hypothesize that CAR

11

macrophages can be used to combat SARS-CoV-2. However, the hyperinflammatory

12

macrophage response, which has been found to be damaging to the host, particularly in

13

severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is

14

also the most significant complication associated with CAR-T cell therapy, raise questions

15

regarding the safety of using CAR macrophages for virus clearance.

16

In this report, we developed a series of chimeric antigen receptors based on

17

recognition of the S protein and tested their ability to induce phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2

18

virions. Interestingly, we reported that one CAR with the intracellular domain of MERTK,

19

which belongs to the TAM receptor family, did not show a notable killing effect in

20

antigen-expressing cell-based models compared with other CARs but did demonstrate

21

antigen-specific clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virions in vitro without the secretion of

22

proinflammatory cytokines.

23

Results

24

To program engulfment based on recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we

25

used a CAR design for the synthetic receptor strategy in our study. The synthetic receptors

26

were constructed to contain an scFv derived from an antibody recognizing the virus spike

27

protein, CR3022, which has been reported to bind with the receptor-binding domain of the

28

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein with high affinity, and the CD8 transmembrane domain

29

present in the αCD19 CAR for T cells 9. For the cytoplasmic domains, we used the

30

common γ subunit of Fc receptors (CARγ), MEGF10 (CARMEGF10), MERTK (CARMERTK)

1

and CD3ζ (CARζ) in our study (Fig. 1a). These cytoplasmic domains are capable of

2

promoting phagocytosis by macrophages.

3

Next, we used lentiviral vector technology to express the fusion constructs in human

4

macrophage THP-1 cells using clinically validated techniques10. The cDNA sequences

5

containing the various fusion constructs were cloned into a third-generation lentiviral

6

vector in which the CMV promoter was replaced with the EF-1α promoter11. An

7

extracellular MYC epitope was cloned into the receptors to permit detection by flow

8

cytometry. Lentiviral vector supernatants transduced THP-1 cells with high efficiency (Fig.

9

1b). The phagocytic potential of human macrophage THP-1 cell lines expressing different

10

CAR receptors or a truncated CAR receptor (CARΔ) lacking the intracellular domain was

11

measured with a cell-based assay. Consistent with previous reports8,9, CAR macrophages

12

and control untransduced (UTD) macrophages did not show notable phagocytosis of 293

13

cells; however, CARMEGF10, CARγ and CARζ cells but not CARMERTK, CARΔ, or UTD

14

macrophages phagocytosed Spike-bearing 293 cells in an S-specific manner (Fig. 1c).

15

CAR-mediated macrophage phagocytosis was further confirmed by a luciferase-based

16

killing assay, and our data showed that CARMEGF10, CARγ and CARζ cells eradicated S

17

protein-expressing 293T cells in an antigen-specific manner (Fig. 1d). Interestingly,

18

CARMERTK and UTD macrophages showed-no difference in killing effect. Our data further

19

showed that all synthetic receptors had the ability to bind the S protein (Fig. 1e); therefore,

20

the differences in phagocytosis and the lytic effect were not due to the affinity for the S

21

protein.

22

Although there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect THP-1 cells with

23

or without IgGs12, THP-1 cells have been shown to support antibody-mediated

24

enhancement of SARS-CoV infection in previous studies13. We therefore sought to

25

determine whether synthetic receptors facilitate the entry of SARS-COV-2 into

26

macrophages as host cells, as the extracellular domain of the CAR constructs has the

27

capacity to directly bind to the S protein. Replication-defective VSV particles bearing

28

coronavirus S proteins faithfully reflect key aspects of host cell entry by coronaviruses,

29

including SARS-CoV-2 14,15. We therefore employed VSV pseudotypes bearing SARS-2-S

30

to study the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Our data showed that Vero E6 cells were

31

susceptible to entry driven by SARS-S (Fig. 2a); however, no evidence of infection was

detected in THP-1 cells with or without synthetic receptors.

2

Antibody-mediated phagocytosis and internalization of virions are important

3

mechanisms of antiviral activity performed by macrophages against pathogens; however,

4

using the phagocytosis assay developed for SARS-CoV-2, we observed low levels of

5

phagocytic activity when UTD cells directly contacted virions. Phagocytic activity was not

6

significantly increased when CARΔ cells rather than UTD macrophages were the

7

phagocytes in the assay, suggesting that the extracellular domain of the CAR alone is not

8

sufficient to induce strong virion internalization. CARγ, CARMEGF10, and CARζ mediated

9

similar significantly stronger levels of SARS-CoV-2 phagocytosis by THP-1 cells than

10

CARΔ (Fig 2b). Unexpectedly, we also observed strong internalization of virions in

11

CARMERTK cells, which did not show specific phagocytic or lytic effects on S

12

protein-expressing 293T cells. Since all the CARs exhibited the ability to induce

13

phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 virions while there was no evidence of infection, these

14

experiments strongly suggest the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virions of CAR macrophages.

15

Because the systemic cytokine profiles observed in patients with severe COVID-19

16

show similarities to those observed in patients with macrophage activation syndrome,

17

culture supernatants from THP-1 cells with different CARs treated with virions were

18

further analyzed in a multiplex cytokine assay (Fig. 2c). Following SARS-CoV-2 treatment

19

of THP-1 cells, we observed slightly increased secretion of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and

20

TNF-α, but no discernable patterns could be confidently drawn for GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-2,

21

IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-γ. CARΔ cells showed a cytokine profile similar to that of

22

UTD macrophages. Notably, we observed not only strongly increased induction of IL-6,

23

IL-8 and TNF-α but also induction of IFN-γ and IL-10 in SARS-CoV-2-treated CARγ and

24

CARζ cells. However, for CARMERTK cells, we did not observe significant changes in

25

cytokines.

26

We further used a transwell-based coculture model to evaluate the protective role of

27

CAR macrophages in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3a). All the CAR-expressing

28

macrophages potently inhibited Vero E6 cell infection with the SARS-CoV-2-S

29

pseudotyped virus. Interestingly, CARΔ cells showed no protective effect in the infection

30

assay, although they had a similar capacity to bind to the S protein, suggesting that the

31

intracellular signaling domain is necessary for virion clearance by CAR macrophages (Fig.

Discussion

3

Macrophages, which protect against infections and scavenge the body’s worn-out or

4

abnormal cells, are known for their phagocytic activity, antigen presentation capability, and

5

flexible phenotype. The innate immune response of the pulmonary parenchyma, which is

6

characterized by the differentiation of bone marrow-derived monocytes into macrophages,

7

serves as a first-line defense against invading pathogens in the lungs16. In general,

8

monocytes/macrophages

9

monocyte-enhanced proinflammatory signaling molecule levels and antiviral responses

10

provoked during viral infection have been shown for influenza, herpes, and Zika viruses17.

11

Moreover, it has recently been suggested that some COVID-19 patients have enhanced

12

proinflammatory macrophage activity, which leads to accelerated production of

13

inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and has mostly been observed in subjects with a

14

poor prognosis18.

The

15

To our knowledge, no synthetic cell-based immunotherapy has been investigated for

16

COVID-19. CAR-expressing T cells have been demonstrated to be a very effective

17

approach to treat B-cell cancer patients. Harnessing the power of engineered macrophages

18

for the development of novel treatments for solid tumors is of great interest because

19

CAR-T cell therapy is often hampered by the inability of T cells to penetrate solid tumors

20

and the inhibitory tumor microenvironment19. Consistent with a previous report8, CAR

21

receptors with cytosolic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) were

22

capable of triggering specific engulfment and killing of antigen-expressing cells by

23

macrophages. These CAR macrophages also showed strong phagocytosis of SARS-COV-2

24

virions in our data; however, this effect was accompanied by increased secretion of the

25

proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-8. In CAR-T cell therapy, engineered T cell

26

expansion is usually accompanied by high-grade CRS with elevated circulating levels of

27

interferon (IFN)-γ, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10.

28

Recent reports have demonstrated that host-derived monocyte/macrophage and CAR-T

29

cell interactions play an important role in CRS pathophysiology20. This is of interest

associated with COVID-19 severity and death. Interestingly, the secretion of IL-6, IL-8,

2

TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-10 was significantly elevated in CARγ and CARζ cells treated with

3

SARS-CoV-2 virions, suggesting that these CAR macrophages may not be suitable for

4

application in severe patients or patients with late-stage COVID-19.

5

Previous studies have shown that human immune cells, such as THP-1 cell lines, are

6

susceptible to SARS-CoV infection24. We did not observe any evidence that our

7

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus infected THP-1 cells. Moreover, the uptake of virions by

8

THP-1 cells was very low, even with a truncated CAR with the ability to bind to the S

9

protein, suggesting that THP-1 cells did not innately engulf the virions. Notably,

10

CARMERTK, which was regarded as an unsuccessful receptor in a previous report8 and

11

showed no cellular killing effect on target cells when expressed in THP-1 cells in our assay,

12

demonstrated a virion clearance capacity similar to that of CARγ and CARζ. Our data

13

further support that CARMERTK mediates ‘immunologically silent’ virion removal, which

14

does not elicit a proinflammatory response.

15

MER tyrosine kinase (MERTK), together with TRYO3 and AXL, belongs to the TAM

16

family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). These receptors can be activated by a complex

17

ligand consisting of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) linked to the RTK by a vitamin

18

K-dependent protein ligand, Gas6, or Protein S25, playing a crucial role in innate immune

19

cells. Gas6 has the capacity to bind all three receptors, while Protein S is a specific ligand

20

of MERTK and TYRO326. Apoptotic cells, exosomes, and cell debris are the main sources

21

of the PtdSer component. In some cases, the PtdSer component is also provided by patches

22

of exposed PtdSer on living cells (including T cells)25. The activation of members of the

23

TAM family of receptors generally induces an anti-inflammatory, homeostatic response in

24

innate immune cells, diminishing excessive inflammation and autoimmune responses

25

elicited by the ingestion of “self”25. However, previous studies also proposed that

26

enveloped viruses may hijack TAM receptors to facilitate attachment and infection via a

27

PtdSer-dependent process termed “apoptotic mimicry” and act as potent TAM agonists, in

28

turn inhibiting the type I IFN response in target cells27. In our study, THP-1 cells

29

expressing the synthetic receptor with the MERTK cytoplasmic domain were relatively

30

resistant to virus infection but induced notable virion clearance. It should be noted that our

31

study used very simple infection models; therefore, the assays lack numerous physiological

and pathological factors, such as IgG or complement-mediated immune complexes, that

2

may interfere with the behavior of engineered cells. Of cause, cells expressing synthetic

3

receptors can be further engineered and developed to achieve precise control.

4

In summary, our data reveal that the CAR-based synthetic approach is applicable for

5

COVID-19 treatment. In addition to direct virion clearance by CAR macrophages, we

6

found evidence that MERTK-based CAR receptors did not induce further upregulation of

7

proinflammatory cytokine levels, thereby raising the possibility that CAR macrophages

8

may be useful as potent therapeutics in severe COVID-19.

Methods

11

Cell lines

12

All cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC;

13

Manassas, VA). The identities of the cell lines were verified by STR analysis, and the cell

14

lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma free. 293 and Vero cells were maintained in

15

DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and THP-1 cells were maintained in

16

RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell culture media and

17

supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

18
19

Vector construction

20

The sequence encoding the scFv generated from CR3022 was chemically synthesized.

21

As shown in Fig. 1a, synthetic receptors contained the human CD8α signal peptide

22

followed by the scFv linked in-frame to the hinge domain of the CD8α molecule,

23

transmembrane region of the human CD8 molecule, and intracellular signaling domains of

24

the FCER1G, MEGF10, MERTK or CD3ζ molecules. The fragments were subcloned into

25

the pELNS vector28. High-titer replication-defective lentiviruses were produced and

26

concentrated28. Lentiviral infection was used to stably express CAR constructs in THP-1

27

cells.

FACS-based phagocytosis assay

29

UTD or CAR-expressing THP-1 cells were cocultured with GFP+ 293T cells or GFP+

105 cells were used as both effector cells and target cells. After coculturing, the cells were

2

harvested and stained with an anti-CD11b APC-Cy7-conjugated antibody (M1/70,

3

BioLegend) and analyzed by FACS using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD

4

Biosciences). The percentage of phagocytosis was calculated based on the percent of GFP+

5

events within the CD11b+ population. Data are represented as the mean ± standard error of

6

quadruplicate wells.

7

Flow cytometry

8

Cell-surface staining was performed for 45 min at 4 °C and was analyzed using a

9

FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 1 × 104 events per sample

10

were examined.

11

In vitro cytotoxicity assay

12

293T and 293T-S cells were used as targets in luciferase-based killing assays including

13

control (UTD) or CAR macrophages. The effector-to-target (E:T) ratio was 10:1 for all the

14

groups. Bioluminescence was measured using a Bio-Tek Synergy H1 microplate reader.

15

The percent specific lysis was calculated on the basis of the experimental luciferase signal

16

(total flux) relative to the signal of the target alone, using the following formula: %Specific

17

Lysis = [(Sample signal － Target alone signal)] / [Background signal － Target alone

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and cell infection experiments

20

The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was constructed based on the spike genes of the strain

21

Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank: MN908947) using published methods29. The SARS-CoV-2 spike

22

gene was chemically synthesized and cloned into a eukaryotic expression plasmid. 293T

23

cells were first transfected with the S expression vector and then infected with a VSV

24

pseudotyped virus (G∗ΔG-VSV), in which the VSV-G gene was substituted with luciferase

25

expression cassettes. The culture supernatants were harvested and filtered at 24 h

26

postinfection. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could not be neutralized with anti-VSV-G

27

antibodies, and no G∗ΔG-VSV was mixed with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus stock. For

28

cell-based infection assays, target cells were grown in plates until they reached 50%–75%

29

confluency and then were inoculated with pseudotyped virus. The transduction efficiency

30

was quantified at 16 h posttransduction by measuring firefly luciferase activity according

31

to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega).

Phagocytosis assay

2

In all cases, SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virions were pelleted (90 min at 14,000 rpm

3

and 4 °C), and after removal of the supernatant, the pellets were resuspended in RPMI

4

medium and incubated with phagocytes (THP-1 cells or CAR macrophages) at 37 °C for

5

1.5 h. After allowing time for phagocytosis, the cells were washed three times with PBS

6

and incubated with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies) for 10 min at 37 °C, followed

7

by a final wash in Accutase. Intracellular staining for the S protein was performed for 60

8

min on ice after using a fixation/permeabilization kit (eBioscience) and then analyzed

9

using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The phagocytic score was

10

determined by gating the samples on events representing cells and was calculated as

11

follows: Percent S protein positive × median fluorescence intensity (MFI).

12

Cytokine analysis

13

Cytokine analysis was performed on supernatants derived from cultures given the

14

indicated treatments using a human cytokine 10-plex panel (Thermo Scientific) per the

15

manufacturer’s instructions, with the panel results read on a Luminex Analyzer.

16

Statistical analysis.

17

Unless otherwise specified, Student’s t test was used to evaluate the significance of
