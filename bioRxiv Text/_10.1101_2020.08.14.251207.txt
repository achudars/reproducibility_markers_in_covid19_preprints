ABSTRACT

53

While vaccines are vital for preventing COVID-19 infections, it is critical to develop new

54

therapies to treat patients who become infected. Pharmacological targeting of a host

55

factor required for viral replication can suppress viral spread with a low probability of viral

56

mutation leading to resistance. In particular, host kinases are highly druggable targets

57

and a number of conserved coronavirus proteins, notably the nucleoprotein (N), require

58

phosphorylation for full functionality. In order to understand how targeting kinases could

59

be used to compromise viral replication, we used a combination of phosphoproteomics

60

and bioinformatics as well as genetic and pharmacological kinase inhibition to define the

61

enzymes important for SARS-CoV-2 N protein phosphorylation and viral replication. From

62

these data, we propose a model whereby SRPK1/2 initiates phosphorylation of the N

63

protein, which primes for further phosphorylation by GSK-3a/b and CK1 to achieve

64

extensive phosphorylation of the N protein SR-rich domain. Importantly, we were able to

65

leverage our data to identify an FDA-approved kinase inhibitor, Alectinib, that suppresses

66

N phosphorylation by SRPK1/2 and limits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Together, these data

67

suggest that repurposing or developing novel host-kinase directed therapies may be an

68

efficacious strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus-mediated

69

diseases.

INTRODUCTION

72

In December 2019, a novel human coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged

73

and began causing a human disease termed COVID-19 (1, 2). Since then, a global

74

pandemic has infected countless numbers of people and caused more than a million

2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.251207; this version posted December 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

75

deaths to date. Due to the prevalence and severity of this disease, the development of

76

therapeutic interventions is of the highest importance. Much attention has been focused

77

on targeting viral proteins and their associated enzymatic activities. In particular, the

78

virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral proteases, are

79

attractive potential targets. Remdesivir, the only FDA-approved antiviral for SARS-CoV-

80

2, is a nucleoside analogue which targets the viral RdRp and causes premature

81

termination of transcription (3). Efficacy of this treatment however, unfortunately, appears

82

limited (4).

83
84

In addition to targeting viral proteins directly, other antiviral development strategies

85

attempt to target host factors that the virus requires to complete its lifecycle. Relative to

86

their hosts, viruses have dramatically less coding space in their genomes and therefore

87

utilize the host to enable means to render virus proteins to be multifunctional. The major

88

advantages of inhibiting a virus indirectly via an essential host factor are two-fold: (1)

89

many viruses may utilize the same host protein, therefore host-directed therapeutics have

90

the potential to be broadly acting and (2) while direct targeting of the virus can rapidly

91

select for resistant viral mutants, it is thought to be much more difficult for a viral mutation

92

to overcome inhibition of a co-opted host protein. While not all host factors are easily

93

targetable, some enzymes such as protein kinases, for which inhibitors have been

94

developed and tested for activity against other diseases such as cancer, are of high

95

interest for host-directed antivirals.

97

In this report, we focused on defining the kinases that mediate phosphorylation of the

98

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, specifically its SR-rich domain, due to its high

99

level of conservation across coronaviruses, previous data showing that it is highly

100

phosphorylated (5-10), and also the understanding that N protein phosphorylation is

101

important for its functionality (11-16). After performing phosphoproteomics analysis on

102

both human and monkey cells to identify the phosphorylation sites on the N protein, we

103

utilized high-throughput kinase substrate specificity mapping and in vitro phosphorylation

104

assays to define not only which host kinases can phosphorylate the N protein, but also

105

the order of action and the specific phosphorylation sites of each kinase. We then used

106

both genetic knockdown and pharmacological targeting of the key kinases SRPK1/2 to

107

verify their requirement during the replication of multiple human coronaviruses including

108

SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we showed that several SRPK1/2 inhibitors including FDA-

109

approved kinase inhibitor Alectinib, which can inhibit SRPK1/2 (17), can compromise

110

SARS-CoV-2 replication in multiple cell lines and primary human pneumocytes. Thus, not

111

only are the enzymatic activities of SRPK1/2 essential for the replication of multiple

112

human coronaviruses via phosphorylation of the N protein, but targeting these kinases

113

may represent an immediate and effective therapeutic strategy to combat coronavirus

114

mediated diseases, including COVID-19.

RESULTS

117

In order to first identify the phosphorylation sites on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N)

118

protein with high confidence, we infected both human A549 lung epithelial cells

119

expressing the ACE2 receptor (A549-ACE2) and African green monkey [Chlorocebus

120

sabaeus] kidney cells (Vero E6) with SARS-CoV-2, as these lines are highly susceptible

121

to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (18). Infected and control cells were harvested in biological

122

triplicate followed by global proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis using LC-MS

123

(Figure 1A). Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein revealed 14 phosphorylation sites in

124

A549-ACE2 cells, 11 of them specifically in the SR-rich domain (Table S1). In Vero cells,

125

26 phosphorylation sites were detected on the N protein, 15 of them in the SR-rich domain

126

(Table S1). Most of the sites in the SR-rich domain were found in both cell lines in our

127

study, as well as in 3 previous phosphoproteomics studies (8-10) (Figure 1B). To

128

investigate the evolutionary conservation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, we next

129

compared the nucleocapsid proteins from 82 different coronaviruses (Table S2) and

130

determined the percentage conservation of each amino acid. Interestingly, we noticed

131

that the SR-rich domain is significantly more conserved than the linker domain, and as

132

conserved as the two known functional domains of the N protein – the N-Terminus

133

Domain (NTD, involved in RNA binding (19-22)) and the C-Terminus Domain (CTD,

134

involved in protein oligomerization and RNA binding (23-25) (Figure 1B).

135
136

Further evolutionary examination of the SR-rich domain shows that the most conserved

137

amino acids in that domain are serines (S), threonines (T) and arginines (R) (Figure 1C),

138

indicating that these are the key residues in that domain. Together with previous evidence

139

that the phosphorylation of the SR-rich domain is important for the life cycle of

140

coronaviruses in general (7, 26) and SARS-CoV (5, 11, 13, 15, 27) in particular, we

141

hypothesized that the phosphorylation of the serines and threonines in this domain is

142

important for viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and that the arginines are likely to be

143

essential for the phosphorylation to occur as well. Finally, comparison of the conservation

144

of the detected phosphorylation sites in each domain to all the other amino acids in that

145

domain shows that only in the SR-rich domain, the phosphorylation sites are significantly

146

more conserved relative to the rest of the region (Figure 1D). These data taken together

147

suggest that not only is the N protein highly phosphorylated, but that the phosphorylation

148

of the SR-rich domain in particular may be functionally important for SARS-CoV-2 life

149

cycle.

150
151

We next identified the host kinase(s) that phosphorylate the serines and threonines in the

152

SR-domain. The ability of protein kinases to phosphorylate substrates is strongly

153

dependent on the serine/threonine phosphoacceptor’s surrounding amino acid sequence.

154

The majority of human kinases investigated show distinct preferences for or against

155

amino acids surrounding their phosphoacceptor. This is collectively referred to as their

156

substrate motifs and is useful for identifying biological substrates. To obtain the substrate

157

motif of a kinase, ours and other laboratories have developed an unbiased approach

158

using combinatorial peptide substrate libraries (28-31).

159
160

Previous studies have reported that the GSK-3 and SRPK families are involved in the

161

phosphorylation of the SR-rich domain of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV (5, 15).

162

Recent reports have suggested these kinase families to be involved in the

163

phosphorylation of SARS-CoV-2 N protein phosphorylation as well (32-34), however an

164

exact phosphorylation model has never been validated experimentally. To that end, we

165

empirically characterized the biochemical substrate specificities of GSK-3a/b and

6

166

SRPK1/2/3 (Figure 2A and Figure S1). Consistent with previous reports (35-37), GSK-

167

3 prefers to phosphorylate serines and threonines that have an already phosphorylated

168

serine or threonine four residues apart toward the C-terminus (designated position +4,

169

relative to the phosphoacceptor). This phenomenon is called phospho-priming – in which

170

an already phosphorylated residue promotes phosphorylation of another proximate

171

residue. The SR-rich domain of the N protein contains three chains of serines/threonines

172

regularly repeating every fourth residue: S206-S186, T205-S193 and S188-S176. We

173

therefore that the C-terminal serines/threonines of these chains (the priming sites S206,

174

T205, and S188) are phosphorylated first, which initiates a phosphorylation cascade by

175

GSK-3, resulting in the full phosphorylation of the entire chains.

176
177

In order to match each site to its most likely upstream kinase based on the characterized

178

substrate specificity matrices, we computed a favorability score (see Materials and

179

Methods) for each characterized kinase, for every phosphorylation site in the three

180

phosphorylation chains above (Figure 2B and Table S2). Our algorithm predicted S206

181

and S188 to be phosphorylated by SRPKs (SRPK1/2/3), which have strong preference

182

for arginine at the -3 and +3 positions, serine at the -2 and +2 positions, and proline at

183

the +1 position (Figure 2A and Figure S1). Once S206 and S188 are phosphorylated

184

and thus. primed, our algorithm predicted that, as expected, a GSK-3 family member

185

(GSK-3a/b) would sequentially phosphorylate the chain of serine/threonine every 4

186

residues toward the N-terminus (S202-T198-S194-S190-S186 and S184-S180-S176,

187

respectively).

189

Finally, since neither the SRPK or GSK-3 families score favorably for the third priming

190

site (T205), we considered additional kinase(s) that might carry this out. Assuming that

191

S202 is phosphorylated by GSK-3 as discussed above, we searched for kinases with

192

strong preference for phosphoserine or phosphothreonine at position -3 as likely kinases

193

to phosphorylate S205. The CK1 family is a second group of phosphopriming-dependent

194

protein kinases that favors strongly phosphoserine or phosphothreonine at position -3 and

195

partially select for unmodified serine at the -4 position (Figures 2A and Figure S1). In

196

parallel, our algorithm predicted T205 to be a likely phosphorylation site for CK1, when

197

primed by phosphorylation at S202 (Figure 2B and Table S2). Subsequent

198

phosphorylation at S201, S197 and S193 can be carried out either by CK1 or GSK-3.

199

Figure 2C summarizes our proposed model for the cluster of phosphorylation sites in the

200

SR-rich domain of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid.

201
202

Interestingly, the amino acids that are dominant in the substrate motif of SRPK (S188:

203

R185/S186/S190/R191;

204

phosphorylated residues and across coronaviruses are more conserved than the other

205

amino acids in that region, suggesting that those amino acids indeed play an important

206

role in directing the appropriate protein kinases to phosphorylate this region of the N

207

protein (Figure 2D).

To test our sequential phosphorylation model, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein was

212

protein band following treatment with SRPK1, indicating stoichiometric phosphorylation

213

at one or more sites of the N protein. Adding GSK-3 or CK1 without prior treatment with

214

SRPK1 had only modest effects on the phos-tag shift. To determine the amount of

215

phosphate incorporation into N protein, radioactively labeled ATP was included in the

216

phosphorylation reactions and autoradiography of N protein was measured on SDS-

217

PAGE. Treatment with SRPK, GSK-3 and CK1 increased phosphorylation of N protein to

218

a greater extent than the sum of the individual kinase reactions, consistent with our model

219

where SRPK primes the SR-region for phosphorylation by GSK-3 and CK1 (Figure 2E).

220

Importantly, adding all three kinases caused a major upward shift in the Phos-tag gel and

221

a reduced detection of protein, suggesting that the highly phosphorylated protein did not

222

efficiently enter the gel (Figure 2E). The phospho-null double mutant (S188A, S206A)

223

abolished the phos-tag shift caused by SRPK and showed reduced radioactive

224

incorporation by SRPK, GSK-3 and CK1 (Figure 2F). This is consistent with our model

225

that phosphorylation of N protein at S188/S206 by SRPK is the critical priming event for

226

extensive phosphorylation of the SR-rich domain.

227
228

We next asked how loss of SPRK proteins would affect viral replication. It has been

229

reported that SRPK1 is expressed at higher amounts in A549 cells relative to SRPK2; we

230

therefore targeted SRPK1 in our ACE2-A549 cells (Figure S3) via RNAi (Figure 3A).

231

Both the kinase RNA and protein were significantly reduced after treatment (Figure

232

3B,C), and viral RNA levels were correspondingly suppressed (Figure 3D). As an

233

orthogonal approach to validate the requirement of SRPK1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection,

234

we utilized the SRPK inhibitor SPHINX31 to block SRPK1/2 activity (38). After treatment

9

235

of A549-ACE2 cells with low micromolar concentrations of SPHINX31, which inhibit both

236

SRPK1 and SRPK2, we observed inhibition of SARS-CoV2 replication (Figure 3E,F). We

237

also utilized a second SRPK1/2 inhibitor, SRPIN340 (39), and as expected, treatment

238

decreased viral RNA and infectious viral titer in a dose dependent manner at

239

concentrations that were well tolerated by the cells (Figure 3G,H).

240
241

A549-ACE2 cell lines are an artificial SARS-CoV-2 infection system; we therefore

242

repeated the SRPK1/2 inhibitor experiments with naturally infectible Calu-3 cells (Figure

243

3I) and primary human pneumocytes. Similar to the A549-ACE2 experiments, SARS-

244

CoV-2 infection and replication was significantly inhibited as measured by

245

immunofluorescence for viral replication markers, viral RNA levels, and cell free infectious

246

viral particles (Figure 3J-N and Figure S4).

247
248

Finally, we were interested in determining if any FDA approved kinase inhibitors could be

249

repurposed to target the phosphorylation of the N protein and thereby inhibit SARS-CoV-

250

2. Although there are no drugs approved to specifically inhibit SRPK1/2, it is known that

251

the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor Alectinib, which is used clinically to treat

252

non-small-cell lung cancer, also causes significant inhibition of SRPK1/2 (17). We

253

therefore treated both A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells with Alectinib to investigate inhibition

254

of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both viral RNA and infectious titer were significantly reduced

255

in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4A-D).

257

As part of the proteomics and phosphoproteomics experiment described in Figure 1A,

258

biological triplicates of Alectinib pretreated, infected A549-ACE2 and Vero E6 cells were

259

also included together with the control and infected cells (Figure 4E). In order to verify

260

that Alectinib was indeed affecting the phosphorylation of the SR-rich domain of the N

261

protein, we analyzed the protein and phosphorylation levels upon treatment, in

262

comparison to infected untreated cells. Viral protein levels were downregulated in the

263

treated cells (Figure S5A, Table S3), supporting the hypothesis that Alectinib interferes

264

with the viral life cycle. Examination of the phosphoproteomics data revealed that the vast

265

majority of the SR-rich domain phosphorylation sites were downregulated upon Alectinib

266

treatment, while the phosphorylation levels of sites outside the SR-rich domain did not

267

decrease (Figure 4F, Figure S5B, Table S1). Additionally, we scored all the detected

268

(host and viral) phosphorylation sites by SRPK1/2/3 substrate specificity matrices and

269

examined the sites that were downregulated upon Alectinib treatment. The proportion of

270

sites which score high for the SRPK family (scoring above 90th percentile) among the

271

downregulated phosphorylation sites is significantly greater than their proportion among

272

all measured phosphorylation sites (Figure 4G, Figure S5C), further confirming that

273

Alectinib inhibits the activity of SRPKs. To demonstrate that Alectinib is capable of

274

inhibiting viral infection outside of immortalized cell lines, we treated our primary human

275

pneumocyte cultures with Alectinib and again observed strong inhibition of the virus

276

(Figure 4H,I). These data show that viral replication can be suppressed in some of the

277

most vulnerable populations of lung cells affected during severe COVID-19 disease (40),

278

at least in vitro, by treatment with the repurposed FDA-approved kinase inhibitor Alectinib.

279

Since the SR-rich domains of N proteins from diverse human coronaviruses are highly

280

conserved (41, 42), we next inquired whether the requirement for SRPK1/2 activity might

281

be broadly conserved in this family of viruses. Alectinib treatment of cells infected with

282

the alphacoronavirus 229E (which is only distantly related to betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-

283

2) inhibited the virus by more than 1,000-fold (Figure 4J). These data indicate that the

284

requirement for SRPK1/2 activity is not restricted to SARS-CoV-2 or even

285

betacoronaviruses.

DISCUSSION

288

Our study of N protein phosphorylation led to the identification of SRPK1 and SRPK2 as

289

kinases that are critical for the replication of coronaviruses as divergent as 229E and

290

SARS-CoV-2. Further, we provide evidence that the phosphorylation sites in the

291

nucleocapsid protein SR-rich domain and their surrounding sequences are also highly

292

conserved among bat coronaviruses, suggesting that these kinases may also be

293

targetable for pre-pandemic coronaviruses (Figure S6). While SRPK1 and SRPK2 are

294

expressed in most human tissues and have been implicated in a number of basal

295

processes including the regulation of transcript splicing, lipid metabolism and cellular

296

stress responses (43-55), their activity has also been previously reported as important for

297

the replication of a number of different viruses. These viruses include: hepatitis B virus,

298

human

299

cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus-1 (15, 56-63). While the mechanisms

300

underlying how SRPK1/2 contribute to the replication of these viruses differ, it is clear that

301

many viruses have evolved to take advantage of these host protein kinases.

303

Post-translational modification of viral proteins is well understood to be important for the

304

functionality of viral proteins, with phosphorylation chief among them (7, 64). At least two

305

recent reports have implicated different kinases including: growth factor receptor (GFR)

306

activated kinases, casein kinase II (CK2), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and protein

307

kinase C (PKC), as generally important for SARS-CoV-2 replication, but not necessarily

308

directly linked to N protein phosphorylation (8-10, 34, 65, 66). Previous work with the

309

related betacoronavirus SARS-CoV has shown that, at least in vitro, CDK, GSK, mitogen-

310

activated protein kinase (MAPK), SRPK1, and CK2 can phosphorylate the SARS-CoV N

311

protein (15, 67). In this work, while we characterize several of the kinases that are

312

important for phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein SR-rich domain, it is worth

313

noting that other kinases might also play key roles in the phosphorylation of other N

314

protein domains and viral proteins. Understanding the relative contributions of other

315

potential kinases to phosphorylation of different viral proteins and indeed, different

316

domains within the same protein, remains an important area of future study.

317
318

Future work will need to establish the functional role of N protein phosphorylation in the

319

SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. A recent study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein

320

phosphorylation affects its protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions through phase

321

separation regulation (16). SRPK1 phosphorylation was also reported to affect the ability

322

of the SARS-CoV N protein to multimerize and inhibit host translation, although effects

323

on viral growth were not reported (15). Additionally, the growth of both SARS-CoV and

324

mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have been reported to be suppressed after treatment with

325

GSK-3 inhibitors, presumably at least partially by affecting N protein phosphorylation. It

13

326

will also be important to define potential kinase redundancy and the effects on viral

327

replication. At least for SARS-CoV-2, it appears that SRPK1/2 are central to the regulation

328

of viral replication. It is worth noting that while our study has focused on the

329

phosphorylation of the SR-rich domain of the viral N protein, we cannot rule out that the

330

viral inhibition phenotype observed may be at least partially due to altered

331

phosphorylation of host proteins or other viral proteins. Additionally, while we have

332

provided data that SRPK1/2 inhibitors are effective in both immortalized and primary

333

human cells, future studies will be required to determine if targeting SRPK1/2 in vivo will

334

have a similar magnitude of effect. Although not definitive, favorable outcome of COVID-

335

19 was reported in two cases of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

336

administered with Alectinib (68, 69).

337
338

In conclusion, the identification of safe and efficacious anti-COVID-19 therapeutics is of

339

the highest importance due to the ongoing pandemic. Targeting host factors essential for

340

viral replication represents an approach that may help limit the emergence of viral

341

resistance. Our study characterized the activities of several kinases for which at least one

342

FDA-approved inhibitor already exists, can be used to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection in

343

a variety of in vitro systems, and may be repurposed for treating COVID-19. Nevertheless,

344

while Alectinib may have some clinical utility in the short term, continued development of

345

SRPK1/2 specific inhibitors may lead to a class of broadly acting, host-directed antiviral

346

therapeutics that could help combat the current COVID-19, and potentially future,

347

coronavirus pandemics.

All cells were obtained from ATCC and grown at 37°C in 5% CO2. 293T and A549 and

351

Huh7 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS, Glutamax, and Penicillin/Streptomycin.

352

For ACE2 introduction into A549 cells, both unmodified A549 cells and A549 cells

353

harboring Cas9 were transduced and both of the resulting lines were used for

354

experimentation. Vero E6 cells were grown in MEM media supplemented with

355

Penicillin/Streptomycin, 10% FBS, 1 mM Pyruvate, and 1X MEM NEAA. Calu-3 cells were

358

Cell culture (ISMMS)

359

Vero E6 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1586). A549 cells stably expressing the

360

SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 were previously described (71). All cells were maintained in

361

DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin 37°C in 5% CO2.

362
363

SARS-CoV-2 infections and titering (Duke)

371

FBS, 1 mM Pyruvate, 1x MEM NEAA, 0.3% Sodium Bicarbonate, Glutamax, 0.7% oxoid

372

agar). Plaque assays were incubated for 72 hrs then stained with either 0.1% Crystal

373

379

incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. After infection total volume of media was brought to 20 ml.

380

Virus was harvested after 36 hrs of infection. Viral titer of stock was determined via plaque

381

assay on Huh7 cells. A confluent monolayer of cells was infected with serial dilutions of

382

virus in complete media for 1 hr at 37°C. Virus was removed and an agar overlay was

383

added to each well (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, Glutamax, 0.5% oxoid agar).

384

Plaque assays were incubated for 72 hrs then stained with 0.1% Crystal Violet in PBS.

385

Viral infection assays took place in complete media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep,

SARS-CoV-2 infection for phosphoproteomics (ISMMS)

389

SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was deposited by the Center for

390

Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH.

391

SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in Vero E6 cells (ATCC, CRL-1586) in DMEM

392

supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential

393

Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES as previously described (70).

394

Virus stocks were filtered and cleared from cytokines and other contaminating host factors

395

by centrifugation through Amicon Ultra-15 100K Centrifugal Filter Units before use.

396

For phosphoproteomic analysis, 6×107 Vero E6 or 6×107 A549-ACE2 cells were treated

397

with 5 µM Alectinib or DMSO in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4

398

mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM

399

HEPES for 1h at 37℃ prior to infection. Cells were subsequently infected with SARS-

400

CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.5 for 24h 37℃. After two washes with PBS and removal of all cell

401

culture media, cell monolayers were lysed in lysis buffer containing 9 M urea, 20 mM

402

HEPES pH 8.0, with 2X phosphatase inhibitors (Cell Signaling Technology #5870).

403
404

Lysis, Digestion, and Preparation for Mass Spectrometry Analysis

405

Cultured cells were rinsed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and scraped into lysis

406

buffer containing 9 M urea, 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, with 2X phosphatase inhibitors (Cell

407

Signaling Technology #5870). Samples were probe tip sonicated, and subsequently

408

reduced with 5 mM DTT for 50 min at 55 °C, alkylated for 30 min with 10 mM

409

iodoacetamide, and quenched with 5 mM DTT. Samples were diluted to 2M urea with

410

digestion dilution buffer (20 mM pH 8.5 HEPES containing 1mM CaCl2) and digested at

411

37 oC with 20µg of Lysyl Endopeptidase (Wako-Chem) overnight. Samples were then

412

diluted to 1 M urea and digested for 5 hours with 20 µg of trypsin (Pierce). Following

413

digestion, peptides were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), centrifuged at 500 x g

414

for 20 min and purified over SepPak C18 columns. Following elution, peptides were

415

quantified with a MicroBCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA).

417

Total Protein Sample Preparation

418

50µg of peptides from each sample were labeled with isobaric tandem-mass-tag (TMT)

419

11 plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) in 20 mM pH 8.5 HEPES with

420

30% acetonitrile (v/v) with 250 ug of TMT reagent. The reaction was quenched for 15 min

421

by adding hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v). Samples were combined,

422

dried, purified over SepPak C18 columns, and dried again. Samples were then

423

resuspended in 40 μL of basic reverse phase (bRP) buffer A (10 mM NH4HCO2, pH10,

424

5% ACN) and separated on a Zorbax Extended C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 3.5 µm, no.

425

763750-902, Agilent) using a gradient of 10-40% bRP buffer B (10 mM NH4HCO2, pH10,

426

90% ACN). 96 fractions were collected and combined into 24 fractions for analysis. Each

427

fraction was dried and desalted over a C18 stop and go extraction tip (STAGE-Tip) prior

428

to analysis by mass spectrometry.

429
430

IMAC Phosphopeptide Sample Preparation

431

High-SelectTM Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kits from Thermo were used to

432

enrich phosphopeptides from 1mg of peptides for each sample. Following the elution from

433

the IMAC column, enriched samples were dried, labeled with TMT, and bRP fractionated

434

as described above instead with a gradient of 5-40% bRP buffer B. The resulting 24

435

fractions were desalted over a C18 STAGE-Tip.

437

LC–MS Analysis of Total Protein Fractions

438

Samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher

439

Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled with a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1200 liquid chromatography

440

(LC) pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Peptides were separated on a 100

441

μm inner diameter microcapillary column packed with ~40 cm of Accucore150 resin (2.6

442

μm, 150 Å, ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). For each analysis, we loaded

443

approximately 1 μg onto the column. Peptides were separated using a 2.5h gradient of

444

6–30% acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid with a flow rate of 550 nL/min. Each analysis

445

used an SPS-MS3-based TMT method (72, 73), which has been shown to reduce ion

446

interference compared to MS2 quantification (74). The scan sequence began with an MS1

447

spectrum (Orbitrap analysis, resolution 60,000; 350-1400 m/z, automatic gain control

448

(AGC) target 4.0 × 105, maximum injection time 50 ms). Precursors for MS2/MS3 analysis

449

were selected using a Top10 method. MS2 analysis consisted of collision-induced

450

dissociation (quadrupole ion trap; AGC 2.0 × 104; normalized collision energy (NCE) 35;

451

maximum injection time 120 ms). Following acquisition of each MS2 spectrum, we

452

collected an MS3 spectrum using a method in which multiple MS2 fragment ions are

453

captured in the MS3 precursor population using isolation waveforms with multiple

454

frequency notches (73). MS3 precursors were fragmented by HCD and analyzed using

455

the Orbitrap (NCE 65, AGC 3.5 × 105, maximum injection time 150 ms, isolation window

456

1.2 Th, resolution was 50,000 at 200 Th).

457
458

LC–MS Analysis of Phosphopeptide Enriched Fractions

459

For phosphopeptide analysis the same MS and HPLC instruments were used as

460

described above. For each analysis approximately 500 ngs of enriched peptides were

461

loaded on the column and run over a 120-minute gradient of 2-32% acetonitrile in 0.125%

462

formic acid with a flow rate of 400 nL/min. MS1 spectra were collected in the Orbitrap at

19

463

a resolution of 60,000 with a scan range of 300-1500 m/z using a AGC target of 4.0e5

464

with a maximum inject time of 25ms. Peptides for MS2 analysis were isolated using the

465

quadrupole with an isolation window of 0.5 m/z. MS2 spectra were generated using

466

Higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 40%. Fragments

467

were collected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 50,000 with a first mass of 110m/z, an

468

AGC target of 5.0e4 and a maximum injection time of 200ms.

469
470

Total Protein Data Processing and Analysis

471

Mass Spectra were processed using a Comet-base software pipeline (75, 76). Resulting

472

data were searched with a fully tryptic database containing both human Swissprot

473

consensus entries plus isoforms downloaded Feb 2020, and SARS-CoV-2 pre-release

474

entries from Uniprot (June 2020), allowing for a static modification of lysine and N-termini

475

with TMT (229.1629 Da) and carbamidomethylation (57.0215 Da) of cysteine, along with

476

variable oxidation (15.9949 Da) of methionine. Searches were performed using a 20 ppm

477

precursor ion tolerance, the product ion tolerance was set to 1.0 Th. Peptide-spectrum

478

matches (PSMs) were adjusted to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using previously

479

described linear discriminant analysis (77, 78). Filtered PSMs were collapsed to a final

480

protein-level FDR of < 1%. Protein assembly was guided by principles of parsimony to

481

produce the smallest set of proteins necessary to account for all observed peptides (75).

482

For TMT-based reporter ion quantitation, we extracted the summed signal-to-noise (S/N)

483

ratio for each TMT channel and found the closest matching centroid to the expected mass

484

of the TMT reporter ion. MS3 spectra with TMT reporter ion summed signal-to-noise ratios

485

less than 100 were excluded from quantitation (79).

487

Phosphorylation Data Processing and Analysis

488

When searching phosphorylation data, a variable modification for phosphorylation

489

(79.9663 Da) was allowed on serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Searches were performed

490

using a 20 ppm precursor ion tolerance, the product ion tolerance was set to 0.02 Th.

491

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to set a PSM FDR of < 1 %. Filtered

492

PSMs were collapsed to a final protein-level FDR of < 1%. Phosphorylation sites were

493

evaluated using an AScore method. Sites with an AScore > 13 were considered localized

494

(80). PSMs with TMT reporter ion summed signal-to-noise ratios less than 100 were

495

excluded from quantitation.

496
497

Quantification and normalization of TMT data. For each entry (protein or phosphorylation

498

site), the level in each TMT channel was calculated as the log-transformation of the ratio

499

to the median value of all 9 TMT channels (3 mock, 3 infected and 3 treated) of that entry.

500

Then, every sample was median-normalized so the log-TMT-ratio is centered at zero.

501

Phosphorylation levels were normalized by protein levels by subtracting the log-TMT-ratio

502

of the corresponding protein from the log-TMT-ratio of the phosphorylation site.

503
504

Differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis of proteins and

505

phosphorylation sites was done using Limma v3.42 package in R (81). For protein levels,

506

log-TMT-ratio was used as input data, and for phosphorylation sites – the protein-

507

normalized log-TMT-ratio was used. Since the log-TMT-ratio is normally distributed, no

508

voom-normalization was applied. Unequal variance between samples was taken into

509

account by using the “arrayWeight” function before fitting the model. P-values were

510

computed using moderated t-test, and adjusted p-values (FDR) were calculated using the

511

Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) correction. Significance for differential expression was

512

determined as adjusted P-value<0.1.

513
514

Kinase substrate specificity assays. Reagents used for the peptide library experiments

515

include: Kinase substrate library (Anaspec). Streptavidin conjugated membranes

516

(Promega). All the recombinant kinases (SRPK1/2/3, GSK-3a/b and CK1A/E were

517

obtained from SignalChem.

518

To determine the substrate motifs, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays with

519

recombinant kinases on an oriented peptide array library of design:

520

Y-A-X−5-X−4-X−3-X−2-X−1-S0/T0-X1-X2-X3-X4-G-K-K-biotin

521

in the presence of ATP[γ-32P]. Reactions were carried out in their designated buffers plus

522

20 μm ATP and 0.4 μCi of (33 nm) [γ-32P]ATP) at 30°C for 90 min. The peptides were

523

spotted onto streptavidin-coated filter sheets (Promega SAM2 biotin capture membrane)

524

and visualized by phosphorimaging on Typhoon FLA 7000. Detailed information on the

525

protocol is provided elsewhere (30, 31).

526
527

Matrix processing and substrate scoring

528

The matrices were normalized by the sum of the 17 randomized amino acids (all amino

529

acids expect for serine, threonine and cysteine), to yield a position specific scoring matrix.

530

The serine, threonine and cysteine columns were scaled by their median to be 1/17. For

531

scoring substrates, the values of the corresponding amino acids in the corresponding

532

positions were multiplied and scaled by the probability of a random peptide:

534

Score!"# % =

∏&'( P!"# % (AA, Position)

(19#Random AA))*#+,-(/'(","'#()

535
536

For the percentile score of a substrate by a given kinase, we first computed the a-priori

537

score distribution of that kinase by scoring all the reported S/T phosphorylation sites on

538

PhosphoSitePlus (82) (downloaded on January 2020) by the method discussed above.

539

The percentile score of a kinase-substrate pair is defined as the percentile ranking of the

540

substrate within the score distribution of the given. This value is being used when

541

analyzing all the detected phosphorylation sites (viral and host) for kinase enrichment.

542
543

Evolutionary conservation analysis. All reference proteomes of the Coronaviridae family

544

of viruses available on Uniprot were downloaded (82 in total, see Supplementary Table

545

S3). A BLAST search was performed over each proteome using the SARS-CoV-2

546

nucleocapsid protein as the query; the top hit of each virus was taken to be the

547

nucleocapsid. Each designated nucleocapsid was then individually aligned to the SARS-

548

CoV-2 nucleocapsid using MUSCLE. Using these alignments, the percentage identity

549

was then calculated for each position along the SARS-Cov-2 nucleocapsid. All statistical

550

analyses between different conservation of positions were performed using the Mann-

551

Whitney U test.

553

Kinase enrichment analysis. The phosphorylation sites detected in this study were scored

554

by SRPK1/2/3 substrate specificity matrices and their ranks in the known

555

phosphoproteome score distribution was determined as described above (percentile

556

score). For every assessed kinase, phosphorylation sites that ranked within the top 10

percentile within the score distribution were counted as biochemically favored sites for

558

that kinase. Towards assessing SRPK kinase motif enrichment, we compared the

559

percentage of biochemically favored sites in the downregulated peptides (log2Fold

560

Change of -0.75 and below with an FDR of >= 0.1) to the percentage biochemically

561

favored sites within the set of all detected sites in this study. Statistical significance was

562

determined using Fisher’s exact test.

563
564

Sequence logos. Normalized substrate specificity matrices were scaled to represent

565

relative probability (each position sum up to 1), and probability sequence logos were

566

generated using ggseqlogo v0.1 (83) package in R.

567
568

Plasmids. The ACE2-pLEX overexpression plasmid was generated by cloning a

569

synthesized gBlock of the ACE2 ORF (Ref. seq. NM_001371415.1) into the pLEX plasmid

570

via HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB Cat# M5520AA) and subsequent bacterial transformation.

571

Bacterial colonies were then selected and plasmid DNA isolated using the Genejet

572

Plasmid Miniprep kit (Thermo Fisher Cat# K0503). Plasmids were then sequenced via

573

Sanger sequencing to confirm successful cloning of the ACE2 ORF. Lentiviruses were

574

packaged as per standard protocols with a VSV-G envelope protein, A549 or A549-Cas9

575

cells were transduced and selected with puromycin at 2µg/mL.

580

(Qiagen) Fast-Forward protocol and plated in 6 well plates. After 2 days, cells were

581

trypsinized and replated in 24 well plates and re-transfected with siRNA (50µM) using the

582

same protocol. After 2 additional days, cells were infected at MOI 0.005 for 1h in 250µl

583

DMEM+2% FBS. After 1h of infection, 250µl DMEM+2% FBS was added to the inoculum

584

and cells were incubated for 24h. 24h post-infection the media was removed and cells

585

were lysed with 500µl TriZol. RNA was purified according to protocol below.

586
587

Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR. Cells were resuspended in TRIzol Reagent

588

(Thermo Fisher Cat #15596018) and total RNA was isolated by either phase separation

589

with chloroform and isopropanol or using the Zymo Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo

590

Cat #R2050). One-step qRT-PCR was performed using the Invitrogen EXPRESS One-

591

Step Superscript qRT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Cat #11781200) and the commercial

592

Taqman probe ACE2 (Hs01085333_m1). The SARS-CoV2 primer/probe set were

606

Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS) and incubation at 4

607

°C for 15 minutes. Chromosomal DNA was sheared by passing lysates through an insulin

608

syringe and cellular debris was removed via centrifugation (21,100g for 10 minutes at 4

609

°C). Total protein concentration of cellular lysates was determined via Bradford assay and

610

all samples were normalized to 1 µg/µL. Cellular lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE

611

using 15-20 µg total cellular protein per lane (4-20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (BioRad),

612

120 V for 1 hour). Proteins were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes

613

(90 V for 1 hour at 4 °C). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for at least 3 hours

614

using PBST containing 5% milk. For detection of SRPK1, membranes were incubated

615

with primary antibody (BD cat. no. 611072) at 0.025 µg/mL in PBST containing 5% milk

616

Figures and Legends

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is heavily phosphorylated at the SR-rich domain.
A. Diagram of the proteomics and phosphoproteomics workflow for cells infected with
SARS-CoV-2. A549-ACE2 and Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.5) and
mock infected for 24h (in biological triplicates each). Then, cells were harvested and lysed,
and proteins were cleaved into peptides using trypsin. Global protein profiling was carried
out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on an aliquot of the peptides
from each sample. The rest of the peptides were enriched for phosphorylation using
IMAC, and were analyzed by LC-MS as well. Peptides and phosphorylation sites were
mapped to the human proteome and the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
B. Phosphorylation sites on the SARS-CoV-2 N protein identified in 5 different
phosphoproteomics analyses (two in the current study and three in previously published
studies). Most of the sites at the SR-rich domain were detected in at least two
independent studies (top). Evolutionary conservation analysis of the different domains of
the N protein across 82 different coronaviruses shows that the SR-rich domain is more
conserved than the linker domain, and is as conserved as the other two functional
domains of the N protein – NTD and CTD (bottom). Mann-Whitney U test: n.s. – not
significant, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.
C. Alignment of the SR-rich domain of the N protein across 6 different human coronaviruses
(bottom), and the percentage identity of each amino acid across 82 coronaviruses in
multiple species (top). The most conserved residues are serines, threonines and arginines.
D. The conservation of the phosphorylation sites in each domain was compared to the
conservation of the other amino acids in that domain. Only in the SR-rich domain the
phosphorylation sites are significantly more conserved than the rest of the residues. The
numbers of amino acids compared in each domain are annotated above the boxes. MannWhitney U test: n.s. – not significant, *p<0.05.

Figure 2. Phosphorylation model of the N protein SR-rich domain by SRPK, GSK-3 and CK1.
A. Biochemical substrate specificity of SRPK1/2 (top), GSK-3a/b (middle) and CK1A/G
(bottom). SRPKs are selective for arginines at the -3 and +3 positions, serines at the -2 and
+2 positions, and proline at the +1 position. GSK-3s are selective for phosphoserine or
phosphothreonine at position +4. CK1s are selective for phosphoserine and
phosphothreonine at position -3 and for serine at position -4. (see Supplementary Figure
1 for substrate specificities of additional kinases from these families).
B. Favorability scores for the different phosphorylation sites at the SR-rich domain according
to the SRPK (SRPK1/2/3), GSK-3 (GSK-3a/b) and CK1 (CK1A/D/e/G1) families. SRPK family
scores the highest for S206 and S188, and once phosphorylated, those sites prime GSK-3
family to phosphorylate every serine or threonine located 4 positions toward the N
terminus (phosphorylation chains). Finally, CK1 family scores the highest for T205 where
both GSK-3 and CK1 families score high for the other sites in its corresponding
phosphorylation chain.
C. Proposed scheme for the multisite phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid SR-rich domain.
Simplified substrate consensus motifs are shown here in parenthesis, whereas detailed
logos are provided in Figure S2.

D. Evolutionary conservation across 82 different coronaviruses from multiple species shows
that the amino acids predicted to be essential for substrate specificity of the priming sites
are as conserved as the phosphorylation sites themselves, and are more conserved than
the other amino acids in the SR-rich domain. Mann-Whitney U test: n.s. – not significant,
*p<0.05, **p<0.01.

of SRPIN340 (left axis) and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was measured by qRT-PCR 24h after
infection of cells that had been treated with varying concentrations of SRPIN340 (right
axis).
L. Infectious titer was measured by plaque assay of supernatants of Calu3 cells that were
treated with SRPIN340 and infected for 48h.
M. Primary Human Type II Pneumocyte cultures were treated with SRPIN340 for 12h preinfection, then infected for 24h. Cells were then fixed and stained for SARS-CoV-2, DNA
with DAPI, and Surfactant Protein C. Scale bar=100 µm.
N. The percent of cells SARS-CoV-2 infected were quantified using 3 Images from 4 different
human donors. For all panels *p<0.05 **p<0.001 by an unpaired, student’s t-test.

Figure 4. Alectinib can be repurposed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce N
phosphorylation.
A. Cell viability was measured after A549-ACE2 cells were treated with varying
concentrations of Alectinib (left axis) and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was measured by qRTPCR 24h after infection of cells that had been treated with varying concentrations of
Alectinib (right axis).
B. Infectious titer was measured by plaque assay of supernatants of cells that were treated
with Alectinib and infected for 48h.
C. Cell viability was measured after Calu3 cells were treated with varying concentrations of
Alectinib (left axis) and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was measured by qRT-PCR 24h after
infection of cells that had been treated with varying concentrations of Alectinib (right
axis).

D. Infectious titer was measured by plaque assay of supernatants of Calu3 cells that were
treated with Alectinib and infected for 48h.
H. Diagram of Alectinib treatment and infection for proteomics and phosphoproteomics
analysis. A549-ACE2 and Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with Alectinib (5µM) for 1 h, then
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.5) and mock infected for 24h (in biological triplicates
each). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis were carried out similarly to the
workflow described in Fig. 1A.
I. Phosphorylation abundance (normalized by protein level) of the different sites on the N
protein, with and without Alectinib treatment in A549-ACE2 cells. The phosphorylation
levels of most of the SR-rich domain sites decrease upon Alectinib treatment, while
phosphorylation sites outside that domain do not change (or even increase).
P-values were computed by moderated t-test and adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg
(BH) correction. n.s. – not significant, *FDR<0.1, **FDR <0.05, ***FDR<0.01.
J. The subset of downregulated sites upon Alectinib treatment is enriched for sites that
score high for SRPK1 and SRPK2 (above 90th percentile) compared to their abundance
among all the detected cellular phosphorylation sites in A549-ACE2 cells. Denoted
p-values were computed using Fisher’s exact test.
K. Primary Human Type II Pneumocyte cultures were treated with Alectinib for 12h before
infection, then infected for 24h. Cells were then fixed and stained for SARS-CoV-2, DNA
with DAPI, and Surfactant Protein C. Scale bar=50µm.
L. The percent of cells SARS-CoV-2 infected were quantified using 4 Images from 3 different
human donors.
M. Cell viability was measured after HuH7 cells were treated with Alectinib (left axis) and
229E viral RNA was measured by qRT-PCR 24h after infection of cells that had been
treated with Alectinib (right axis). For all panels *p<0.05 **p<0.001 by an unpaired,
student’s t-test, unless otherwise stated.
