Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread
worldwide. Previous studies suggested cat could be a potential susceptible animal of
SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cats by
detecting specific serum antibodies. A cohort of serum samples were collected from
cats in Wuhan, including 102 sampled after COVID-19 outbreak, and 39 prior to the
outbreak. 15 of 102 (14.7%) cat sera collected after the outbreak were positive for the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 by indirect enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the positive samples, 11 had SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing antibodies with a titer ranging from 1/20 to 1/1080. No serological
cross-reactivity was detected between the SARS-CoV-2 and type I or II feline
infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Our data demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 has
infected cat population in Wuhan during the outbreak.

Introduction
In December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in
Wuhan, China. The pathogen was soon identified to be the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease was designated coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO) (Chen et al., 2020;
Zhou et al., 2020a). The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 mainly include
asymptomatic infection, mild-to-severe respiratory tract illness, and even death
(Huang et al., 2020). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has the higher basic
reproduction number, representing more transmissibility (Liu et al., 2020a). Within a
very short period of time, COVID-19 has quickly become a very serious threat to
travel, commerce, and human health in the worldwide (Bernard Stoecklin et al., 2020;
Ghinai et al., 2020; Iacobucci, 2020; Shim et al., 2020; Tuite et al., 2020). By Mar. 28,
2020, a total of 512,701 confirmed cases, including 23,495 deaths (4.58%), involving
202 countries, areas or territories, have been reported globally by WHO
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).
The outbreak of COVID-19 was first confirmed in Wuhan, China, possibly
associated with a seafood market. However, so far, there is no evidence that the
seafood market is the original source of SARS-CoV-2 (Guo et al., 2020). Before
SARS-CoV-2, 4 types of beta coronaviruses can infect humans, including SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV which are highly pathogenic and both originated from bats (Li et al.,
2020a; Liu et al., 2020b). Genome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2%
overall genome sequence identity with Bat CoV RaTG13, indicating that
SARS-CoV-2 could also originate from bats (Zhou et al., 2020b). The transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans was suspected to via the direct contact between
humans and intermediate host animals (Guo et al., 2020). However, it remains unclear
which animals were the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. Our previous study
showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin converting
enzyme II (ACE2), as SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2020b), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2
has the same host range as SARS-CoV. Previous report demonstrated that SARS-CoV
can infect ferrets and cats (Martina et al., 2003), implying that they might be also
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
As one of the most popular pets, cats have very close contact with humans.
Therefore, it is very important to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in cat,
especially in the outbreak areas. However, there is no survey about the prevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 in cats so far. Serological studies are suitable for the screening of
antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 in animals (Reusken et al., 2013). At present,
several methods have been applied for the antibody test of SARS-CoV-2 in human (Li
et al., 2020b). However, there is no available method for the detection of cat antibody
against the SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigate the serological prevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 in cats by an indirect ELISA and virus neutralization test, providing the
first evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats.

Results
A total of 143 cat sera were screened by indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) for antibody reactivity against recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD)
of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. From the 39 sera collected before the outbreak, whose
OD varied from 0.091 to 0.261, we set the cut-off as 0.32. As shown in Table 1 and
Figure 1, 15 cat sera (14.7%) collected after the outbreak were positive, with five
strong positive ones with OD more than 0.6. Both type I and II feline infectious
peritonitis virus (FIPV) hyperimmune sera showed no cross-reactivity with
SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein.
To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody in cat sera, all of 15
ELISA positive sera were tested by virus neutralization tests (VNT) for SARS-CoV-2.
Of which, 11 cat sera had SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with a titer ranging
from 1/20 to 1/1080 (Table 1, Figure 2A). However, 4 sera including #12, which was
ELISA strong positive with OD of 0.85, showed no neutralizing activity. And another
ELISA strong positive, #10, had very weak neutralizing activity. But strong
neutralization was observed for the other three ELISA strong positive sera, #4, #14
and #15, with neutralizing titer of 1/360 to 1/1080. Consistent with the high
neutralizing titer, the owners of Cat#4, Cat#14 and Cat#15 were diagnosed as
COVID-19 patients. Cat#1, Cat#5~9 was from pet hospitals, while Cat#2, Cat#10~13
were initially stray cats and kept in animal protection shelters after the outbreak.
Again, both type I and II FIPV hyperimmune sera were negative for VNT.
Western blot assay was also performed to further verify the existence of
SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in cat serum. As shown in Figure 2 B, #4, #14 and #15 sera
detected S and N proteins of purified SARS-CoV-2, as human convalescent serum. In
contrast, the ELISA negative cat serum and healthy human serum didn’t probe the
protein bands.
Discussion
In this study, we detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in cats in Wuhan
during the COVID-19 outbreak with ELISA, VNT and western blot. A total of 102
cats were tested, 15 (14.7%) were positive for RBD based ELISA and 11 (10.8%)
were further positive with VNT. These results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has
infected cat populations in Wuhan, implying that this risk could also occur at other
outbreak regions. Retrospective investigation confirmed that all of ELISA positive
sera were sampled after the outbreak, suggesting that the infection of cats could be
due to the virus transmission from humans to cats. Certainly, it is still needed to be
verified via investigating the SARS-CoV-2 infections before this outbreak in a wide
range of sampling. At present, there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from
cats to humans. However, a latest report shows that SARS-CoV-2 can transmit
between cats via respiratory droplets (Hualan Chen, 2020), so, a strong warning and
regulations still should be issued to block this potential transmission route.
The three cats owned by COVID-19 patients had the highest neutralization titer
(1/360, 1/360, and 1/1080, respectively). On the contrary, the sera collected from pet
hospital cats and stray cats had neutralizing activity of 1/20 to 1/80, indicating that the

high neutralization titers could be due to the close contact between cats and
COVID-19 patients. Although the infection in stray cats was not fully understood, it is
reasonable to speculate that these infections are probably due to the contact with
SARS-CoV-2 polluted environment, or COVID-19 patients who fed the cats.
In addition, we also collected nasopharyngeal and anal swabs of each cat, and
conducted SARS-CoV-2 specific qRT-PCR using a commercial kit which targeted
ORF1ab and N genes. However, no double gene positive sample was detected. The
reason might be (1) that the viral RNA load is too low to be detected; (2) as
SARS-CoV (Martina et al., 2003), the period that cat shed SARS-CoV-2 may be very
short, along with asymptomatic infection, we didn’t catch the moment of acute
infection; (3) there may be variants in the genomic sequences in cats, leading to the
failure in amplification in cat samples.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that animals produce specific
neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 under natural conditions. Our study
pointed out the risk of cats involved in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. More
studies are needed to investigate the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 from humans
to cats. Importantly, an immediate action should be implemented to keep in a suitable
distance between humans and companion animals such as cats and dogs, and strict
hygiene and quarantine measures should also be carried out for these animals.

Methods
Sample collection
A total of 102 cats were sampled from animal shelters or pet hospitals of Wuhan
between Jan. and Mar., 2020. Blood samples were collected via leg venipuncture and
sera were separated and stored at −20°C until further processing. Nasopharyngeal and
anal swabs were collected and put into tubes containing viral transport medium-VTM

(Copan Diagnostics, Brescia, Italy) (Haagmans et al., 2014). All samples were
collected under full personal-protective equipment, including head covers, goggles,
N95 masks, gloves, and disposable gowns. A set of 39 cat sera were retrieved from the
serum bank in our lab, which were collected from Wuhan between Mar. and May,
2019. Hyperimmune sera were obtained from Neuropathy Pathogen Laboratory,
Huazhong Agriculture University, with neutralization titers of 1/640 and 1/1280,
respectively, against type I and II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The
convalescent serum of a COVID-19 patient was collected from Jiangxia Tongji
hospital with the consent of the patient and a neutralization titer 1/1280.
Virus and cells
SARS-CoV-2 (IVCAS 6.7512) was isolated from a COVID-19 patient as previously
described.(Zhou et al., 2020b) Vero E6 was purchased from ATCC (ATCC®
CRL-1586™).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Antibody was tested by indirect ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (Sino
Biological Inc., China) and peroxidase conjugated goat anti-cat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA). Briefly, ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 with RBD protein (1 μg/ml,
100μl per well). After blocked with PBS containing 5% skim milk for 2 h at 37 , the
plates were added with sera at a dilution of 1: 40. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C,
the plates were washed 5 times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05%
Tween-20). A 1:20000 diluted anti-cat IgG was added and incubated for an additional
30 min. After another 5 washes, TMB Substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added
and incubated for 10 min. Then the reaction was stopped, and optical density (OD)
was measured at 450 nm. Those sera were considered positive if the OD values were
twice higher than the mean OD of the 39 sera collected between Mar and May, 2019.
Virus neutralization test (VNT)
For virus neutralization test, serum samples were heat-inactivated by incubation at
56°C for 30 min. Each serum sample was serially diluted with Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) as two fold or three fold according to the OD value and the
sample quality, mixed with equal volume of diluted virus and incubated at 37°C for 1
h. Vero E6 cells in 24-well plates were inoculated with the sera-virus mixture at 37°C;
1 h later, the mixture was replaced with DMEM containing 2.5% FBS and 0.8%
carboxymethylcellulose. The plates were fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde and stained
with 0.5% crystal violet 3 days later. All samples were tested in duplicate and
neutralization titers were defined as the serum dilution resulting in a plaque reduction
of at least 50% (Davies et al., 2005).
Western blotting assay
The total protein concentration of purified and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was
determined by Bradford protein assay (Su et al., 2018). 4 μg protein was subjected to
8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
transferred on to nitrocellulose membrane. Then viral proteins were blotted with cat
sera or human convalescent serum. Protein bands were visualized by incubation with
a goat anti-cat IgG or mouse anti-human IgG and then detected using the ECL System
(Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL, USA).
