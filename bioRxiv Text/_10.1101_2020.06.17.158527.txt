Abstract

20

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) has caused a global

21

pandemic of COVID-19 resulting in cases of mild to severe respiratory distress and significant

22

mortality. The global outbreak of this novel coronavirus has now infected >8 million people

23

worldwide with >2 million cases in the US (June 17th, 2020). There is an urgent need for

24

vaccines and therapeutics to combat the spread of this coronavirus. Similarly, the development

25

of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy are critically

26

needed. Molecular assays have been developed to determine viral genetic material present in

27

patients. Serological assays have been developed to determine humoral responses to the spike

28

protein or receptor binding domain (RBD). Detection of functional antibodies can be

29

accomplished through neutralization of live SARS-CoV2 virus, but requires significant expertise,

30

an infectible stable cell line, a specialized BioSafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility. As large numbers

31

of people return from quarantine, it is critical to have rapid diagnostics that can be widely

32

adopted and employed to assess functional antibody levels in the returning workforce. This type

33

of surrogate neutralization diagnostic can also be used to assess humoral immune responses

34

induced in patients from the large number of vaccine and immunotherapy trials currently on-

35

going. Here we describe a rapid serological diagnostic assay for determining antibody receptor

36

blocking and demonstrate the broad utility of the assay by measuring the antibody functionality

37

of sera from small animals and non-human primates immunized with an experimental SARS-

38

CoV-2 vaccine and using sera from infected patients.

45

The city of Wuhan China became the epicenter for a global pandemic in December of 2019

46

when the first cases of respiratory illnesses were reported and identified as being caused by a

47

novel betacoronavirus now referred to as SARS-CoV-2. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely

48

related to the SARS-CoV-1 virus and has a high human-to-human transmission rate(1). As of

49

May 22nd 2020, over 5,128,492 people are reported positive for viral infection of SARS-CoV-2

50

resulting in 333,489 fatalities worldwide(2). SARS-CoV-2 modes of transmission include

51

shedding of the virions in airborne droplets and close contact. Once infected, people develop

52

flu-like symptoms and severe cases can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),

53

acute respiratory failure, severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, multiple organ failure and

54

death. Quarantines around the globe have helped curb spread of the virus and as people are

55

eager to return to life as normal, development of methods and assays to aid in the detection of

56

SARS-CoV-2 and effective measurements are of utmost importance.

57
58

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on lung epithelial cells and is the

59

viral receptor for SARS-CoV-1(3). Recently, ACE2 has also been identified as a receptor utilized

60

by SARS-CoV-2(4). A 193 amino acid region on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-

61

CoV-2 termed the receptor binding domain (RBD) was found to interact with the ACE2 receptor

62

and primarily mediates cell entry(5-10). Cryo-electron microscopy was used to determine a high

63

resolution structure of the prefusion spike protein and help define the ACE2 interaction site(11,

64

12). In the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak of 2003, it was reported that high titers of protecting IgG were

65

found in the convalescent serum of patients recovering from infection(13). Early studies show

66

treating COVID-19 patients presenting with severe ARDS with convalescent plasma therapy

67

(CPT) may be beneficial(14, 15). In order to determine if a recovered patient could be re-

68

infected or if their plasma may be useful as a treatment to others, assessment of functional

69

antibody response is highly valuable. While tests for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity are being

70

deployed, they do not necessarily correlate with neutralizing immunity(16). As there are limited

71

options for rapid diagnostic of functional antibody responses, fast and simple functional assays

72

may prove to be a critical assessment tool to discriminate between potential CPT donors.

73
74

In parallel with CPT, major academic, industry and government entities are pushing for

75

therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Given this urgent need, there are numerous

76

clinical vaccine trials underway for SARS-CoV-2 in parallel(17). Through pre-clinical testing,

77

vaccine-induced functional antibody responses are being used to discriminate among potential

78

vaccine candidates. In clinical testing, the humoral responses will need to be analyzed for

79

functionality to assess immunogenicity of each vaccine. Therefore, rapid assays for detecting

80

functional IgGs in human serum for SARS-CoV-2 are essential to compare vaccine candidates

81

and to understand induced immunity.

82
83

Early into this pandemic, diagnostic tools for detecting viral genetic material were developed

84

and utilized in a real-time reverse transcription PCR assay(18). Serologic assays for detecting

85

anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are now also available(19).

86

assays can suffer from detection limits and numbers of false positives(20) and may not be

87

associated solely with protective responses. Faster and straight forward approaches which

88

detect specific interactions to reduce false positives are needed. Neutralization assays that can

89

detect functional immunity have been developed with replicating virus, but require handling in

90

specialized BSL-3 facilities, severely limiting the number of samples that can be processed.

91

Pseudovirus neutralization assays run in BSL-2 facilities were quickly developed to detect the

92

functional antibody response in sera(21). While this is a critical tool for determining protective

93

antibody titers, it requires several days for a readout and are not standardized between

94

laboratories. The pseudoviruses produced in these assays are not easily manufactured and

95

take time to express, harvest, and titer. One such approach to help augment the methods listed

96

above is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employed in a competitive manner to

However, single antigen ELISA

97

determine levels of ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies in a sample. In addition, recent advances

98

of portable and field-deployable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) devices(22) and widespread

99

availability of SPR instruments in research laboratories make SPR an additional platform for

100

measuring ACE2 receptor blocking. Here, we describe a competition ELISA assay and a SPR

101

assay developed to rapidly detect ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies in IgGs and sera of

102

vaccinated mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and non-human primates, as well as, human samples

103

from SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Results

106
107

Receptor expression and assay development

108

To detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to ACE2, we designed a soluble variant of the

109

membrane-bound human ACE2 receptor. The ectodomain of the receptor was fused to a

110

human IgG1 Fc tag (ACE2-IgHu), for purification and secondary antibody recognition. This

111

protein fusion was expressed in mammalian cells to ensure proper glycosylation and purified on

112

a protein A column. To determine that ACE2-IgHu was dimeric and a homogeneous species in

113

solution, we employed size exclusion chromatography tandem multi angle light scattering (SEC-

114

MALS). The SEC trace shows a single peak (Fig. 1A) and the MALS data determined the

115

estimated molecular weight to be 190 kDa for ACE2-IgHu, which is very close to the expected

116

molecular weight of a dimer of ACE2-IgHu at 195 kDa (Fig. 1B). We next sought to confirm the

117

functionality of ACE2-IgHu. Previous studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 with an

118

affinity range of 4-34nM(6, 11). We determined that our ACE2-IgHu binds with similar affinity to

119

the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (27.5nM) as assessed by SPR (Fig.

120

1C). Next, using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) we immobilized full-length

121

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (containing both the S1 and S2 subunits) and incubated a dilution

122

series of ACE2-IgHu (Fig. 1D). The binding curves confirmed the high affinity interaction of the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.158527; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

123

receptor for the spike protein. We further showed similar binding for two independent batches of

124

ACE2, as well as a sample that was frozen and thawed (Fig. S1A). From the binding curve, we

125

hypothesized that a reasonable concentration of ACE2 protein fusion needed to see competitive

126

blocking while still binding >90% of immobilized spike protein in the absence of blocking would

127

be around 0.1-1 ug/ml (Fig. 1D, red arrow).

128

To examine if we could construct a competition assay, we employed ACE2-IgMu (mouse Fc) to

129

act as a competitor to ACE2-IgHu. To match our initial binding ELISA format, the competition

130

ELISA assay similarly captured a His6X-tagged full-length spike protein by first immobilizing an

131

anti-His polyclonal antibody. A dilution series of the competitor (ACE2-IgMu) was pre-mixed with

132

a constant concentration of soluble receptor (ACE2-IgHu). A secondary anti-human antibody

133

conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) determines the amount of ACE2-IgHu present

134

through a TMB colorimetric readout (Fig. 2A). In order to formally determine the optimal

135

concentration of soluble receptor (ACE2-IgHu), we performed the assay at four concentrations

136

ranging from 0.01ug/ml to 10 ug/ml (Fig. 2B). The ACE2-IgHu concentration of 0.1 ug/ml (red

137

curve in Fig. 2B), was able to show a complete inhibition curve in the presence of ACE2-IgMu.

138
139

Animal IgG and serological competition

140

The proof-of-concept competition ELISA displayed a full blocking curve, so we sought to utilize

141

this assay for animals immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The same design for the

142

competition ELISA was used for this assay, replacing the ACE2-IgMu competitor with antibodies

143

induced by vaccination (Fig. 3A). In our previous work, BALB/c mice were immunized with DNA

144

plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein(23). To examine the activity of antibodies in the

145

sera, IgGs from either naïve mice or vaccinated mice 14 days post-immunization were purified

146

using a protein G column. Unlike the ACE2 control which only binds to the receptor binding site

147

(RBS) on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, antibodies from immunized

148

mice can bind to a multitude of epitopes on the spike protein including epitopes on the S1

149

subunit(which includes the RBD), S2 subunit or S1-S2 interfaces. While antibodies distal to the

150

RBS should have less effect on ACE2 binding, we hypothesized that such distal antibodies may

151

inhibit ACE2 binding directly by sterically obscuring the RBS or indirectly by causing allosteric

152

conformational shifts in the spike protein. To test this, we immobilized either the full spike

153

protein (S1+S2) or S1 alone to examine the levels of detectable blocking antibodies. A mixture

154

of ACE2-IgHu at a constant concentration of 0.1 ug/ml and a dilution series from a vaccinated

155

mouse IgG (IgGm1) or naïve mice IgG (naïve IgGm) was incubated on the plate. An anti-

156

human-HRP conjugated antibody was added to determine the ACE2 binding in the presence of

157

IgGm. As Fig. 3B illustrates, there is greater antibody blocking with the full spike protein than

158

with the S1 subunit alone (Fig. S2A).

159
160

To show the utility of this assay in samples from larger mammals, we examined receptor

161

blocking of rabbit sera from SARS-CoV-2 immunization studies. We pooled sera from five

162

rabbits two weeks post immunization in 3 groups (low dose of 1mg, high dose of 2mg and

163

naïve) as well as a Day 0 pool from all 15 animals. The IgG from these pools were purified on a

164

protein G column and used as competitors in the competition ELISA assay. To compare the

165

blocking efficacy, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each competition curve.

166

For full, uninhibited ACE2 binding, the AUC will be larger than the AUC for a competitive curve

167

(Fig. 3C). As seen with the mouse IgGs, the pooled vaccinated rabbit IgG displayed statistically

168

significant blocking of ACE2 receptor binding compared to the naïve animal pool and the Day 0

169

pool (Fig. 3D, Fig S2B). The high dose rabbits reduced ACE2 signal relative to the low dose

170

group, highlighting the utility of the assay to help discriminate between different vaccine

171

regimens. Up to this point we have analyzed purified IgGs collected from sera, however we

172

wanted to validate the use of this assay on serological samples as well. The same rabbit sera

173

pools were used as competitors in the competition ELISA assay in a dilution series to compare

174

blocking between sera and purified IgG. The rabbit sera displayed statistically significant ACE2

175

receptor blocking as we saw in the purified IgG assay (Fig. 3E, Fig. S2C).

176
177

Next, we sought to show that we could assess receptor blocking in a third animal model of

178

guinea pigs which were immunized with a SARS-CoV-2 Spike-based vaccine(23).

179

compared a pool of sera collected on day 14 post immunization to a Day 0 pool (Fig. 3F). The

180

immune pool showed significantly lower AUC signal indicating ACE2 blocking ability of the

181

immune sera. We then sought to compare how animal sera pools represent blocking ability of

182

the individual animals. The AUC was calculated for each normalized curve and plotted with the

183

immunized guinea pig pool AUC. Four of the six guinea pigs immunized against SARS-CoV-2

184

spike showed statistically significant ACE2 blocking and, importantly, the pooled sera was

185

comparable to the average AUC from all six sera samples (Fig. 3F, Fig. S2D). The competition

186

ELISA was used to analyze both the IgGs and the sera from the groups, both groups showed

187

statistically significant blocking of the ACE2 receptor in these assays (Fig. S2E, Fig. S2F).

Primate serological competition

190

With the competition ELISA assay demonstrated to be capable of measuring molecular blocking

191

of the ACE2 receptor in small animals with sera and IgG, we next altered the assay for use with

192

primate samples. In the small animal studies, the anti-human secondary was used to detect

193

soluble receptor ACE2-IgHu. However, this secondary antibody would cross-react with

194

antibodies from primates. To remedy this, an ACE2-mouse Fc fusion (ACE2-IgMu) was utilized

195

in place of the ACE2-IgHu and an anti-mouse Fc secondary antibody HRP conjugate was used

196

for detection of ACE2 binding in the presence of primate antibody inhibitors (Fig. 4A). To

197

confirm the function of the replacement ACE2-IgMu, an initial binding ELISA was performed

198

(Fig. 4B). We predicted a similar concentration was needed for optimal competition on the

199

binding curve (Fig. 4B, red arrow) and confirmed this by running a competition ELISA assay

200

using ACE2-IgHu as the competitor at varying ACE2-IgMu constant concentrations (Fig. 4C,

201

Fig. S3A). NHP sera from five animals immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike were pooled and

202

Day 0 sera from the same group of five animals were pooled as a negative control. The NHP

203

immune sera displayed appreciable ACE2 blocking compared to the naïve sera (Fig 4D, Fig.

204

S3B). Next, we examined if we could detect the presence of receptor blocking antibodies in a

205

human ICU patient with acute infection. We compared nine positive COVID-19 patients with

206

sixteen naïve donor samples taken from three years prior to the pandemic. The sera from the

207

COVID-19 patients was able to block ACE2 receptor binding with statistical significance (Fig.

208

4E, Fig. S4A). To compare healthy and COVID-19 patient samples in an independent assay,

209

we employed a pseudovirus assay we recently developed(23). Sera from the healthy donors

210

could not neutralize the virus, yet sera from COVID-19 patient samples could neutralize the

211

virus (Fig. 4F, Fig S4B, S4C). This finding is consistent with the ACE2 blocking data and we

212

show a correlation between pseudovirus neutralization ID50 and AUC for residual ACE2

213

blocking across all our datasets (Fig. 5). Thus, we have demonstrated that the ACE2

214

competition assay can be employed to measure receptor inhibition levels of human samples.

215
216

SPR-based assay for ACE2 receptor blocking

217

To quantitate blocking of the Spike-ACE2 bimolecular interaction in a second, independent

218

experiment, we developed a sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. SPR is a

219

widely used platform that does not require secondary antibodies and therefore we could use a

220

single assay format for small animals, NHPs and humans. In our assay, a CAP sensor chip is

221

used to capture single stranded DNA coupled to streptavidin. We are then able to capture

222

biotinylated spike protein to the surface of the sensor chip (Fig. 6A). In SPR, changes in

223

refractive index occurs when molecules interact with the sensor surface or proteins attach to the

224

sensor surface and these changes are reported as resonance units (RUs). Next, anti-spike

225

samples in a dilution series can be injected. After a short time, ACE2 receptor at a constant

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.158527; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

226

concentration can be injected to measure residual receptor binding. The change in RUs after

227

the second injection are a measure of ACE2 blocking.

228

To demonstrate the feasibility of this assay, we used ACE2-IgHu as both the sample

229

(ACE2sample) and the receptor (ACE2receptor). The sensorgram for this experiment shows

230

ACE2sample injections at various concentrations binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD between 0 and 125

231

seconds (Fig. 6B). At 225 seconds we inject ACE2receptor at 100nM. We observe ACE2receptor

232

binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD at the lower ACE2sample concentrations, but not at the highest

233

ACE2sample concentration. The binding signals of ACE2sample and ACE2receptor intersect close to

234

100nM, suggesting the assay is working as expected (Fig 6C). A measure of % ACE2 receptor

235

inhibition can be calculated to the dose dependence response of the sample (Fig. 6D). While

236

this experiment was done with samples containing a human Fc, this assay can be employed to

237

measure inhibition of the spike:receptor interaction with any sample regardless of species.

238
239

Discussion

240

Diagnostic methods that fast and accurately detect functional immunity in a SARS-CoV-2

241

patient or vaccinee are of critical importance during the global pandemic of 2020. Serological

242

tests are a central component of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic toolbox. Serological tests are

243

often configured to measure the presence of antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

244

This is not a sufficient measurement to determine if a donor’s blood should be used to treat

245

seriously ill patients or to determine if the donor could be re-infected. Instead, a measurement of

246

functional antibodies is required. Further, systematic studies of functional antibody responses

247

and persistence in patients presenting asymptomatic, mild and severe cases will be critical to

248

understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In this study, we developed two new assays which can aid

249

in understanding the specificity and functionality of antibodies in serum. First, we showed that

250

an ELISA-based assay could be employed to measure receptor blocking antibodies in animals

251

vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We could measure purified IgG or directly from

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.158527; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

252

sera, as pools across groups of animals or individual animals. The assay is robust as

253

exemplified by the ease of adaption to use for five different species. Importantly, the values of

254

ACE2 blocking measured in our assay correlate with pseudovirus neutralization titers, as seen

255

in Figure 5. Second, we developed an SPR assay for detecting inhibition of the ACE2 receptor

256

binding to spike protein.

257
258

Our assays focus on blocking receptor interactions as a surrogate for virus neutralization. In this

259

study we studied ACE2, because ACE2 appears to be the major receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The

260

assay could be also be used to study antibodies targeting other coronaviruses with similar

261

receptors such as SARS-CoV-1 or NL63. The Basigin receptor, as known as CD147, has been

262

demonstrated to play a role in SARS-CoV-1 infection(24) and is now hypothesized to function in

263

SARS-CoV-2 invasion of host cells(25). By engineering the ectodomain of CD147 with human

264

and murine Fc tags, these assays could easily be adapted to study antibody inhibition of

265

CD147. In addition, antibodies against other coronaviruses, such as MERS, which utilize the

266

DPP4 receptor could be studied in our assay format using a similar adaptation.

267
268

Neutralizing antibodies can target viral surface proteins to inhibit virus function. Recently, an

269

antibody (B38) was discovered that can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and has been structurally

270

defined to bind to the same site as ACE2(26). In addition, three other antibodies (H4, B5, H2) all

271

showed neutralizing activity, but B5 and H2 did not compete ACE2 completely, suggesting they

272

bind an alternative neutralizing epitope on the RBD. In another recent study, a nAb, C12.1,

273

binds the RBD spike protein, potently neutralizes and protects Syrian hamsters compared to

274

controls in a passive transfer experiment(27). Recently, a human monoclonal antibody isolated

275

from transgenic mice (47D11) has been shown to neutralize both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-

276

2(28). Probing serological responses for competition and blocking of these protective epitopes

277

could also be easily accomplished through the ELISA and SPR assays reported here.

278
279

The Spike-ACE2 interaction is also being considered as an important therapeutic target. Indeed,

280

there have been SARS-CoV-1 Spike-ACE2 inhibitors developed previously(29). To examine the

281

functionality of these small molecules beyond direct binding to the spike protein, assays such as

282

the one developed here are needed. The SPR instrument is often used for drug discovery and

283

the SPR assay could be easily adapted to examine blocking capabilities of candidate drugs. The

284

ELISA assay does not depend on the molecular identity of the competitor, so small molecule or

285

peptide inhibitors could be directly assessed in this assay.

286
287

Our study presents a new set of assays for assessing ability of antibody samples to inhibit

288

SARS-CoV-2 Spike interaction with its receptor. As with most assays, the limit of detection can

289

be an issue. In some of our samples, we saw robust blocking and in others there was minimal

290

blocking. This could be a property of the samples themselves or a limit in the ability to detect

291

ACE2 inhibition in our assays. In addition, discovering functional monoclonal antibodies can be

292

important to understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity and serological assays of functional antibodies

293

is just a first step. Indeed, a recent report observed that only a small portion of monoclonal

294

antibodies sorted from convalescent donors are neutralizing(27). Therefore, it is important to

295

continue to develop and publish assays of varying formats to detect functional antibody

296

responses in SARS-CoV-2 spike exposed people.

297
298

Conclusions

299

In a fast-moving global pandemic, we must quickly bring to bear all our immunological

300

knowledge to create new tools. Receptor-blocking assays can detect functional antibodies in

301

serum samples. Functional antibody assays can be employed widely to help study SARS-CoV-2

302

infection, create ‘immune passports’ to enable safe exit from quarantine and for assessing

303

efficacy of vaccines.

Methods

306
307

DNA design and plasmid synthesis

308
309

Protein sequences for human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (huACE2) were obtained

310

from UniProt (Q9BYF1). DNA encoding the IgG1 human Fc sequence was added to the C-

311

terminus of the huACE2 and cloned by Twist Bioscience into a modified mammalian pVax-1

312

expression plasmid to generate the recombinant plasmid, huACE2-IgHu-pVax.

313
314

Recombinant protein expression and purification

315
316

Expi293F cells were transfected with plasmid expressing huACE2-IgHu-pVax using PEI/Opti-

317

MEM. Cell supernatants were harvested 6 days post-transfection by centrifuging (4000xg,

318

25mins) and filtering (0.2um Nalgene Rapid-flow filter). Supernatants were first purified with

319

affinity chromatography using AKTA pure 25 system and HiTrap MabSelect SuRe protein A

320

column (GE healthcare, Cat# 11-0034-94) for huACE2-IgHu-pVax. The eluate fractions from the

321

affinity purification were pooled, concentrated and dialyzed into 1x PBS buffer before being

322

further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superdex 200 10/300 GL column

323

(GE healthcare). Identified SEC eluate fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1mg/mL. The

324

molecular weight and homogeneity of the purified sample were confirmed through size

325

exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC MALS) by running the sample in

326

PBS over Superose 6 increase column followed by DAWN HELEOS II and Optilab T-rex

327

detectors. The data collected was analyzed using the protein conjugated analysis from ASTRA

328

software (Wyatt technology).

SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus assay

472

The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was produced by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with 1:1 ratio

473

of DNA plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein (GenScript) and backbone plasmid pNL4-

474

3.Luc.R-E- (NIH AIDS Reagent) using GeneJammer (Agilent) in 10% FBS/DMEM enriched

475

with 1% Pennicilin/Streptomycin (D10 medium). The supernatant containing pseudovirus was

476

harvested 48 hours post-transfection and enriched with FBS to 12% total volume, sterifiltered

477

and stored at -80C. The pseudovirus was tittered using a stable ACE2-293T cell line that had

478

previously been generated(23). For neutralization assay, serially diluted samples were incubated

479

with pseudovirus at room temperature for 90 minutes and added to 10,000 ACE2-293T cells in

480

200uL TPCK media (DMEM supplemented with 1%BSA, 25mM HEPES, 1ug/ml of TPCK and 1X

481
