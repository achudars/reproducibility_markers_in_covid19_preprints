ABSTRACT
The Spike protein (S protein) is a critical component in the infection of the new coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this work was to evaluate whether peptides from S protein could
cause negative impact in the aquatic animals. The aquatic toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
peptides derivatives has been evaluated in tadpoles (n = 50 tadpoles / 5 replicates of 10 animals)
from species Physalaemus cuvieri (Leptodactylidae). After synthesis, purification, and
characterization of peptides (PSDP2001, PSDP2002, PSDP2003) an aquatic contamination has
been simulatedwith these peptides during 24 hours of exposure in two concentrations (100 and 500
ng/mL). The control group (“C”) was composed of tadpoles kept in polyethylene containers
containing de-chlorinated water. Oxidative stress, antioxidant biomarkers and neurotoxicity activity
were assessed. In both concentrations, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 increased catalase and superoxide
dismutase antioxidants enzymes activities, as well as oxidative stress (nitrite levels, hydrogen
peroxide and reactive oxygen species). All three peptides also increased acetylcholinesterase activity
in the highest concentration. These peptides showed molecular interactions in silico with
acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes. Aquatic particle contamination of SARS-CoV-2 has
neurotoxics effects in P. cuvieri tadpoles. These findings indicate that the COVID-19 can constitute
environmental impact or biological damage potential.

1. INTRODUCTION

94

Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute

95

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), an emergent beta-coronavirus threatening human

96

health, has led to a dramatic worldwide crisis and presents unprecedented global challenges

97

on everybody's daily life, social aspects, political affairs, and health measures (Chakraborty &

98

Prasenjit, 2020)

99

Remarkably, the poor and the most vulnerable people are at critical high risk, and

100

Oxfam, an international confederation of 20 NGO's already calculates that nearly 500 million

101

people worldwide may succumb to poverty resulting from the same (OI, 2020). By Dec. 27,

102

over 79.2 million cases and over 1.7 million deaths have been reported since the start of the

103

pandemic (FAO, 2020). Resulting from the same, in only 12 months, we have learned a lot

104

about SARS-CoV-2. Our ability to test for and manage COVID-19 has improved, but ongoing

105

debate remains about how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted (Editorial Lancet, 2020).

106

The most recurrent forms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission are through direct contact with

107

an infected person (Meyerowitz et al., 2020), inhaling respiratory droplets containing the

108

virus (Harrison et al., 2020), or accessing a contaminated environment where suspended

109

particles are present over longer distances and time than droplet transmission (Graham et al.

110

2020).

111

However, by reviewing the environmental threats of the virus reported so far, it is

112

concluded that the virus can survive on inanimate surfaces such as metal, glass, or plastic for

113

up to 9 days if any effective disinfection procedure with ozone, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide,

114

UV light, chlorine or its derivatives as sodium hypochlorite is not conducted in between

115

(Kampf et al. 2020).

116

Although the direct contact described above concerns meaningful, a different

117

environmental transmission source with the virus now recognized is the indirect contact

118

through the infected people's stool and urine (Chen et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Jones et al.,

119

2020). Unconventional studies support this notion by reporting positive SARS-CoV-2 viral

120

titers in domestic sewages (Pandey et al., 2020; Elsamadony et al., 2020; Polo et al., 2020).

121

So far, Sars-Cov-2 has been detected in several countries wastewaters of the American,

122

European, and Asian continents, suggesting as mandatory the monitoring of the secondary

123

transmission of the new coronavirus via wastewater (Liu et al. 2020). On a more compelling

124

perspective, strong evidence suggests that surveillance of primarily settled solids in

125

wastewater through one-step ddPCR is a solid strategy to track the spread of Covid-19 disease

126

transmission before the clinical cases break out in a particular location (Graham, 2020).

127

Moreover, following this trend can shed light on the characteristics of infection that are

128

difficult to capture in clinical investigations, such as the dynamics of infection and early viral

129

elimination (Wu et al., 2020).

130

The increase in the generation of household waste (Sharma et al., 2020; Zand& Heir,

131

2020; Urban et al., 2021), hospitals (Abu-Qdais et al., 2020; Sangkham, 2020; Yang et al.,

132

2020), and notable civil buildings (Carvalho et al., 2020; Abu-Rayash et al., 2020; Santiago et

133

al., 2020) constitute some of the environmental grounds where no information on the

134

ecotoxicological effects of SARS-CoV-2 proteic or genetic structural components impact on

135

freshwater vertebrates exists.

136

Therefore, this lack of knowledge requires urgent attention by developing studies to

137

assess how COVID-19 impacts the aquatic populations in the close vicinity of the

138

anthropogenic activities described above. Such studies may focus on supporting actions or

139

strategies on the remediation or at least mitigation of impacts in favor of conserving non-

140

target species at the edge of any Sars-Cov-2 variant.

141

The Spike (S) protein is a critical component of the new Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus found

142

on the surface of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, giving it a "crown" appearance. The S protein is a

143

granule-shaped structural protein with a length of about 1200 aa, which helps the virus bind

144

to cell receptors and mediates viral infection and pathogenesis (Coughlan, 2020). The S

145

protein plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process with

146

ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) (Huang et al., 2020). Therefore, it is not surprising

147

this ligand-receptor interaction of the S protein is the primary target to produce vaccines

148

against COVID-19, as reported in different studies (Bangaru et al., 2020; Samrat et al., 2020;

149

Keech et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020; Ravichandran et al., 2020).

150

Several in vivo platforms to dissect the cellular and molecular programs governing

151

Sars-Cov-2 viral dissemination on vertebrates are available. However, the number of aquatic

152

model animals that may support trials and provide reliable information is almost inexistent.

153

Among them, the zebrafish model represents an attractive model to explore the desired

154

effects on the context of a full vertebrate (Galindo-Villega, 2020). Unfortunately, the zebrafish

155

has not been vigorously infected in vivo trials so far by the causative agent of Covid-19

156

(Gaudin & Goetz, 2021).

157

Following a synthetic approach in previous research, we have developed three

158

peptides of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (PSPD2001, PSPD2002, and PSPD 2003)

159

after a pattern memorization phagolysosomal proteolysis (Fernandes et al. 2020). To attempt

160

to elucidate whether and how the Sars-Cov-2 influence the aquatic animals, in this study, we

161

investigate the same by adding the three produced synthetic peptides to mimic the resulting

162

Covid-19 aquatic contamination in wastewater. The tadpole Physalaemus cuvieri, is a prevalent

163

amphibian species found in many freshwater habitats throughout Brazil and South America

164

((Miranda et al., 2019; Herek et al., 2020; Araújo et al., 2020ab; Rutkoski et al., 2020). Its

165

population stability and abundance in the areas that occur (Frost 2017), good adaptability in the

166

laboratory, and early biological response justify the species' choice (Herek et al., 2020; Araújo et

167

al., 2020ab; Rutkoski et al., 2020). Previous studies using this species report the effects of water

168

pollution caused by wastewater runoff (Wrubleswski et al. 2018). Therefore, in this study, we

169

selected P. cuvieri as our choice of a translational model vertebrate.

170

From different biomarkers indicative of an imbalance in oxidation-reduction (REDOX)

171

and neurotoxicity processes, we aimed to test the hypothesis that nanometric concentrations

172

of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein fragments in water may affect the health of amphibians. We

173

believe that studies like ours are needed not only to expand our knowledge about the impacts

174

of COVID-19 on aquatic biodiversity; but also to predict the environmental impacts of the

175

recent pandemic on the populations of neotropical amphibians, which have already, over the

176

years, shown a drastic population decline (Pechmann et al., 1991; Blaustein et al., 2002;

177

Ranvestel et al., 2004; Grant et al., 2020).

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1. Synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides
2.1.1. Synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein peptides
The peptides were obtained manually using the solid phase peptide synthesis method (SPFS)
using the Fmoc strategy (Raibaut et al., 2014; Behrendt et al., 2016). The couplings were carried
out by activating the carboxyl groups of the Fmoc-amino acids with a solution of
diisopropylcarbodimide and hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), for2 h. In this step, a 2-fold excess of
Fmoc-amino acids and coupling agents in relation to the number of reactive sites in the resin was
used. Deprotection of the amino group after coupling, i.e., removal of the base labile Fmoc group
was carried out by reaction with a 20% solution of 4-methyl-piperidine in dimethylformamide
(DMF) following the exit of the protective group through the colorimetric test ninhydrin (Luna et
al., 2016), which identifies free amine groups converting the yellow solution to violet-blue after
incubation at 110 C for 3 min. The resins used for synthesis were Fmoc-Cys (Trt)-Wang, Fmoc-Thr
(TBu)-Wang, and Fmoc-Asn (Trt)-Wang for peptides Arg-Val-Tyr-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Asn-Cyso

After coupling all the amino acid residues from the peptide sequences, the chains were
removed from the solid support by acid cleavage using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 2 h [similarly
to Guy & Fields (1997)]. In addition to TFA, reaction suppressors were added according to the
sequence of each peptide. After cleavage, the peptides were precipitated with cold ether and later
extracted with 0.045% TFA solution in purified water. The solutions were lyophilized to obtain solid
crude material.

2.1.3. Purification of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein peptides
The crude compounds were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
with a reverse-phase column using different purification methods according to the retention time
obtained in a gradient program of 5 to 95% in 30 min (exploration gradient) in Analytical HPLC
(Klaassen et al.,2019). Table S1 (see “Supplementary Material”) presents a summary of the
purification methods adopted in our study. The purification solvents were water containing 0.045%
TFA (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.036% TFA (solvent B).
After collecting, lyophilizing, and weighing the pure material fractions, its yield was
calculated, obtaining 13.0% for PSPD2001, 21.4% for PSPD2002, and 18.2% for PSPD2003. The
pure and solid material was subjected to chromatographic analysis to determine the purity of the
final product. Only compounds with purity equal to or greater than 95% were considered for
biological analysis,

2.1.4. Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein peptides
The analysis of the synthesized peptides' identity was carried out in a mass spectrometer
(Metzgeret al., 1994)Thermo LCQ-fleet, with ESI-IT-MS configuration. For this, the sample
solutions were directly infused at a concentration of approximately 10 mg/L in acetonitrile/water
containing 0.1% v/v formic acid. The infusion rate was adjusted to 5.0 μL/min, and the electrospray
source was operated in a positive mode, applying 4.5 kV to the electrospray capillary.

2.2. Alignment of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein peptides
The similarities between the PSPD2001, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 peptides synthesized in
the present study were tested using the CLUSTAL W version 1.83 software [Higgins et al. (1996),
Pais et al. (2014) - http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/]. The peptides were aligned with proteins

deposited in the NCBI/BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), consisting of a set of programs
that look for similarities between different sequences. The investigated sequences' alignment was
carried out with the nucleic acid and/or protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast).
Within BLAST, the search was carried out in the “Protein blast” using as a database the “Swissprot
protein sequence (swissprot)”, algorithm - blastp (protein BLAST) and the search was restricted to
Physalaemus cuvieri (taxid:218685). The database UniProtKBSwissProt (http://www.uniprot.org/)
was used to obtain detailed information on the protein aligning with the selected peptides revealed.

2.3. Model system and experimental design
To evaluate the synthesized peptides' aquatic toxicity, we used tadpoles of the species
Physalaemus cuvieri (Leptodactylidae) as a model system. All tadpoles used came from an ovigerous
mass (containing approximately 1500 eggs), according to Pupin et al. (2010). They were collected in
a lentic environment (Urutaí, GO, Brazil) surrounded by native vegetation from the Cerrado biome,
under license no. 73339-1 of the Biodiversity Authorization and Information System
(SISBIO/MMA/ICMBio) in Brazil.
Upon arrival at the laboratory, the eggs were kept in an aquarium (40.1 x 45.3 x 63.5 cm)
containing 80 L of naturally dechlorinated water (for at least 24 h), under controlled light
conditions (light-dark cycle, 12:12 h), temperature (26 °C ± 1 °C - similar to the natural
environment) and constant aeration (maintained by air compressors), being fed once a day (ad
libitum) with commercial fish food (guarantee levels: 45% crude protein, 14% ether extract, 5%
crude fiber, 14% mineral matter and 87% dry matter). After the eggs hatched, the tadpoles
remained in these conditions until they reached stage 27G, according to Gosner (1960) (body
biomass: 70 mg ± 4.1 mg and total length: 20.1 mm ± 0.7 mm - mean ± SEM). The healthy
tadpoles (i.e., with normal swimming movements and without morphological deformities or
apparent lesions) were divided into seven experimental groups (n = 50 tadpoles / each - 5 replicates
composed of 10 animals/each. The control group (“C”) was composed of tadpoles kept in
polyethylene containers containing 50 ml of de-chlorinated water, free of any peptide. The animals
kept in water containing the peptides comprised the groups “PSPD2001”, “PSPD2002”, and
“PSPD2003”. Two concentrations were tested for each peptide (100 and 500 ng/mL, defined based
on reports that SARS-CoV-2 in sweet environments occurs in minimal concentrations (Shutler et
al., 2020; Guerrero-Latorre et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2020). The exposure period (24 h; in the static
system) was defined considering the low persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the aquatic environment
after being released with human feces (Bivins et al., 2020).We emphasize that, throughout the
exposure period, different physical-chemical parameters of the quality of the exposure waters were

2.4. Toxicity biomarkers
We evaluated peptide-induced toxicity from predictive biomarkers of REDOX imbalance
and neurotoxicity after exposure, considered classic and essential parameters in ecotoxicological
studies (Valavanidis et al., 2016). For this, pools of four animals/each composed the samples to be
analyzed. Such animals were weighed and later macerated in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), centrifuged at 13.000 rpm for 5 min (at 4 C). Thesupernatant was separated into aliquots to
be used in different biochemical evaluations. Entire bodies were used in the experiment due to the
hard time isolating specific organs from small animals. Organ-specific biochemical assessment in
tadpole requires highly accurate dissection due to their small size, making it difficult to process large
sample numbers under a time constraint (Khan et al. 2015). Organ “contamination” by organic
matter and/or by other particles consumed by tadpole can be biased at biochemical analysis applied
to organs at dissection time (Lusher et al. 2017; Guimarães et al., 2021).

2.4.1. REDOX state
2.4.1.1. Oxidative stress biomarkers
The effects of exposure to peptides on oxidative stress reactions were evaluated based on
indirect nitric oxide (NO) determination on REDOX regulated processes via nitrite measurement
(Soneja et al. 2005); thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), a predictive of lipid peroxidation
(De-Leon & Borges, 2020); production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and on hydrogen peroxide
(H O ), which plays an essential role in responses to oxidative stress in different cell types (Sies,
2017). The Griess colorimetric reaction was used to measure NO (Grisham et al., 1996). This
reaction consisted of detecting nitrite resulting from NO oxidation. TBARS levels were determined
based on procedures described by Ohkawaet al. (1979) and modified by Sachettet al. (2020), with
adaptations for conduction in microtubes and ELISA microplate reading. The reagent of 1.1,3.3tetra-ethoxy-propane was used as a standard solution in the reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA)
reactive substance, according Ro et al. (2020). In brief, this method's principle depends on the
Determination of the pink color produced by TBA interaction with malondialdehyde (MDA). The

2.4.1.2. Antioxidant response biomarkers
The activation or suppression of antioxidant activity by peptides was assessed by determining
catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activities, which are considered critical first-line
antioxidants for defense strategies against oxidative stress (Ighodaro&Akinloye, 2018; Jing et al.,
2020). While catalase activity was assessed based on Sinha et al. (1972) andMontalvão et al.
(2021). The SOD was determined according to the method described by Del-Maestro & McDonald
(1985) (initially) and adapted by Estrela et al. (2021). To assess the balance between the synthesis
of hydrogen peroxide by SOD and its decomposition by catalase, the SOD/CAT ratio was calculated
and recorded, as Liu et al. (2017).

2.4.2. Neurotoxicity
Peptide neurotoxicity was assessed by quantifying acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity,
based on the method by Ellman et al. (1961), with minor detailed modifications in Estrela et al.
(2021). AChE activity is used as a cholinergic function marker since it regulates the acetylcholine
(ACh) amount interacting with its receptors (Tougu, 2001).

2.4.3. Determination of the protein level
All results of the biochemical analyzes were expressed by the “g of proteins” of the samples.
In this case, the protein level was determined with a commercial kit (Bioténica Ind. Com. LTD,
Varginha, MG, Brasil. CAS number: 10.009.00) based on biuret reaction (Gornall et al., 1949;
Henry et al., 1957). In general, Cu ions, in an alkaline medium, react with the peptide bonds of
proteins forming the blue complex specifically with protein, and the intensity of color, measured by
an ELISA reader at a wavelength of 492 nm, is proportional to the protein concentration.

2.5. Bioinformatics in silico analysis
Seeking to predict the binding mode and affinity of the bonds between the peptides
synthesized in our study and the protein structures of the enzymes AChE, catalase, and SOD, we
performed docking and chemoinformatic screens (Kolb et al., 2009). For this, we obtained the
peptide ligand PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 in three dimensions through the web server PEP-FOLD3

(https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/PEP-FOLD3/). Protein structures and sequences
of the P.cuvieri (i.e.:Leptodactylidae) taxonomic family were not found in the biological structure
databases. Therefore, we use as target structures those from the Xenopodinae family, a family
phylogenetically close to the group of Leptodactylidae (Jetz& Pyron, 2018). The AChE and catalase
enzymes' structures were obtained using the homology construction technique with values of
similarity 65.48% and 87.14% to structures (targets) used for comparative modeling on the server
SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/), respectively. On the other hand, the structure of
the SOD was obtained by Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics protein databank
(https://www.rcsb.org) PDB code: 1XSO with 1.49Å resolution, obtained by X-ray diffraction of
Xenopodinae origin. For molecular docking simulations, AutoDock tools (ADT) v4.2 (Morris et al.,
2009) and AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 (Trott & Olson, 2010) were used. The procedure was carried out
by removing water molecules and other residues present in the target structures. A polar hydrogen
group was added to establish hydrogen bonds between the macromolecule and the ligand tested.
The grid box was chosen based on the native ligand of the macromolecules (targets). The binding
potency (ΔG affinity) was used to determine better molecular interactions. The results were
visualized using ADT and UCSF Chimera X (Pettersen et al., 2021).

2.6. Data analysis
GraphPad Prism Software Version 8.0 (San Diego, CA, USA) was used to perform the
statistical analysis. Initially, data were checked for deviations from the normality of variance and
homogeneity of variance before analysis. Normality of data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilks
test, and homogeneity of variance by the Bartlett’s test. Multiple comparisons were performed using
a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s posthoc analysis (for parametric data) or the Kruskal-Wallis test,
with Dunn’s posthoc (for non-parametric data). Correlation analysis was performed through
Pearson’s (parametric data) or Spearman’s method (non-parametric data). Besides, the regression
analysis was performed when significant differences were detected between different treatments.
Levels of significance were set at (p) less than 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptides
Our study's first stage was to synthesize and characterize the SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptides
arbitrary named PSPD2001, PSPD2002, and PSPD2003. During the peptides' cleavage, we
performed the addition of different reaction suppressors to avoid the return of the side chain
protectors present in some amino acids with a reactive side chain. The results obtained in this step

molecular mass/charge ratio (m/z) of the identified compounds, allowing us to confirm the
deprecated molecules' achievement. The spectra can be seen in Figure S1 (see “Supplementary
Material”), and Table 2 summarizes the results obtained in this step. Figure 1 also shows the

Regarding the alignment of the obtained sequences, our analyzes revealed the existence of
similarities between the nucleotide sequences of the synthesized peptides and different regions
conserved in SARS-Cov-2, whose comparisons were made from three datasets COVID, originated
from Texas (USA), Iran, and Australia (Figure 2). These data demonstrated that the peptides
PSPD2001, PSPD2002, and PSPD2003 are, in fact, part of the protein structure of the etiological
agent of COVID-19. However, the sequences obtained for P. cuvieri (taxid: 218685) showed two
main agreements belonging to five of the total of nine peptides found. The identification of possible
linear epitopes was performed by BLAST with the Swissprot protein sequence database restricted to
P. cuvieri. All peptides obtained in the sequencing were evaluated. However, only the main results
found for five peptides are being presented in Table S1, two in the form SARS-CoV-2, in addition
to the analysis made for the consensus obtained in alignment with Clustal W.

The in vivo experiments revealed that short exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptides was
able to induce significant biochemical changes in P. cuvieri tadpoles. After 24 h of exposure, we
observed that the peptides PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 (100 and 500 ng/mL) induced a significant
increase in nitrite production (the indirect measurement of NO (Soneja et al. 2005) and hydrogen
peroxide (Figure 4A-B, respectively), which in association with the higher levels of ROS (Figure
4D), suggest an increase in oxidative stress processes in the animals. The PSPD2003 peptide, in
particular, demonstrated an even more significant effect on NO production, exceeding a 30%
increase, to the control group, in both tested concentrations (100 and 500 ng/ml); almost 60%
increase in hydrogen peroxide levels in the group exposed to 500 ng/mL, and 29% ROS in the
animals treated with 100 ng/mL. However, we did not observe significant differences between the
groups regarding MDA levels (Figure S2-A), suggesting that the treatments did not intensify the
lipid peroxidation processes in the tadpoles.

Similar to the previous findings, we observed that the animals exposed to PSPD2002 and
PSPD2003 showed an increase, in a concentration-dependent manner, of the activity of the
enzymes SOD and catalase (Figure 5A-B), with these data being positively and significantly
correlated with the increase in the levels of nitrite, peroxide hydrogen and ROS (Figure 5C-D). We
also observed that PSPD2003, once again, induced more intense effects on the antioxidant activity;
there was an increase above 36% as compared to the control group for the two concentrations
tested (100 and 500 ng/mL). The levels of SOD and catalase in the tadpoles exposed to PSPD2002
fragments were 28.9% higher than those reported in the control group. However, the SOD/catalase
ratio was unaffected or decreased which indicates the relative balance between hydrogen peroxide
synthesis by SOD and its decomposition by catalase (Figure 2S-B).
These data are exciting since they corroborate previous studies that describe the critical role
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in inducing oxidative stress in COVID-19 infection [see the review
of Suhail et al. (2020)] while demonstrating that the peptides evaluated, even in a non-host
organism, can cause metabolic disorders related to the increase in reactive species. On the other
hand, the impairment of antioxidant defenses observed in several viral infections (Fraternale et al.,
2006), including COVID-19 (Baradaran et al., 2020; Polonikov, 2020; Bayindir & Bayindir, 2020;
Abouhashem et al., 2020), was not evident in the studied organism. These data also reinforce the
hypothesis that the responses to the peptide fragments tested may be different between hosts and
non-hosts of SARS-CoV-2; they also confirm the ability of peptides PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 to
induce metabolic changes that alter REDOX homeostasis towards oxidative stress in tadpoles.
The proportional increase in oxidative stress biomarkers and the activity of SOD and
catalase enzymes [two essential and indispensable molecules in cellular antioxidant defense
strategies -Nishikawa et al. (2009), Hu & Tirelli (2012) and Ighodaro & Akinloye (2018)]
reinforces our hypothesis, showing that the increase in antioxidant defenses does not seem to have
been sufficient to reduce oxidative stress. The proposition of an action mechanism explaining the
increase in these enzymes' activity is very incipient, either due to our study's pioneering nature or
the need to deepen biochemical assessments in future studies. However, it is tempting to speculate
that the interactions between PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 peptides and antioxidant enzymes
evaluated in tadpoles (confirmed by molecular docking) have induced functional changes in SOD
and catalase, similarly to what was observed by Jing et al. (2020) by exposing hepatocytes isolated
from C57BL6 mice to different concentrations of naphthalene. The data obtained from the
molecular docking reinforces our hypothesis by confirming the affinity between the PSPD2002 and
PSPD2003 peptides and the referred enzymes and the existence of interactions with residues from
all tested moorings (Figure 6). In the interactions with PSPD2002, it was possible to verify several

hydrogen bonds in the threonine mixture (T9), revealing the potencies of the binding affinities and
the central region of interaction in the active sites of the tested targets. In contrast, PSPD2003
interactions showed ≥20 hydrogen interactions in all the tested couplings, with the structures of
valine (V2) and serine (S4) (central of the peptide) considered to have the best affinity region of the
ligand.
An increase in NO production (inferred by high levels of nitrite) in tadpoles exposed to
PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 (Figure 4A) suggests that the production of this free radial gas
constitutes a standard response to the constituents of the SARS-CoV protein -2 Spike of the new
coronavirus, both in the evaluated non-host organism and in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2.
The ability of NO (both endogenous and exogenous) to inhibit the replication cycle of other viruses
in the Coronaviridae family, affecting their proteins and reducing viral RNA (Chen et al., 2004;
Keyaerts et al., 2004; Åkerström et al., 2005; Jung et al., 2010), has even motivated studies, whose
preliminary results point to its potential therapeutic use in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
(Alvarez et al., 2020). Alternatively, we cannot neglect the hypothesis of increased NO in tadpoles
due tothe innate immune response modulated by the peptides, with a consequent increase in the
production of inflammatory cytokines. In this case, studies reporting a positive correlation between
NO production and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, IL-12, and
interferon-γ) in patients with COVID-19 reinforce our hypothesis (Karki et al., 2020; Del Valle et
al., 2020; Costela-Ruiz et al., 2020).

We also evaluated the peptides' possible neurotoxicity in tadpoles exposed to the peptide
fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Interestingly, we observed that 100 ng/mL PSPD2003
induced an increase greater than 220% concerning the control group. However, at a concentration
of 500 ng/mL, all the peptides evaluated exerted an effect in the cholinergic system, causing an
increase in the activity of AChE (Figure 7). While the peptides PSPD2001 and PSPD2002 induced
increases of 219 and 553.8% in relation to AChE activity in the control group's animals,
respectively; the PSPD2003 peptide impressively induced an even more significant increase
(697.3%). Therefore, these data confirmed the initial hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
fragments induce neurotoxic effects, inferred by the stimulatory effect of the cholinergic system of
the animals evaluated, especially in those exposed to the highest concentration (500 ng/mL) of the
peptides.

Interestingly, these data differ from other studies that report suppression in AChE induced
by increased cellular oxidative stress (Flora et al., 2013; Kayode et al., 2016; Bali et al., 2019;
Ezeoyili et al., 2019; Pala et al., 2019; Ibrahim et al., 2020). In general, such studies argue that this
can occur due to the deterioration of neurotransmission and oxidative damage. Additionally, AChE

inhibition impairs oxidative phosphorylation and is followed by neuronal Ca influx and activation
of nNOS, associated with the neurons’oxidative and nitrosative injury (Milatovic et al., 2006).
However, the increased AChE activity observed in tadpoles exposed to the peptides may be related
to the activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), which has been found
beneficial in preventing inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress
syndrome in animal models [see the review of Liu et al. (2020)]. As discussed by Osman (2020),
CAP constitutes a neural mechanism that modulates inflammation through the release of
acetylcholine (ACh), that have led to increased AChE synthesis to decompose higher levels of this
neurotransmitter [see details in Tracey (2007)]. This mechanism has been reported in different
studies involving patients infected with the new coronavirus (Bonaz et al., 2020; Mazloom et al.,
2020; Pomara et al., 2020), strengthening the presumption that this mechanism may constitute
another similar physiological response between SARS-CoV-2 non-host and host organisms. Besides,
it is plausible to assume not only that the peptide composition of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
participates in the CAP activation (both in humans and in the evaluated tadpoles) but also that the
neuroimmune system of the tadpoles has an essential role in responding to exposure of peptides
PSPD2001, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003.
Alternatively, the tadpoles' cholinergic system's stimulation may also be explained by the
direct interactions between the tested peptides and AChE, whose affinity was demonstrated in the
molecular docking analysis (Figure 8). In this case, future studies will be useful to understand if
these interactions induced a significant change in the association and catalysis mechanism or
expansion of the enzyme efficiency with an increase of the substrate affinity to the active site
(increasing the catalytic constant was increased and decreasing the Michaelis constant). In both
situations, a significant increase in AChE activity can occur, either as part of a compensatory
mechanism that will aim to compensate for the enzyme's catalytic deficit or as a more efficient
response to the increased release of acetylcholine in synaptic clefts via CAP activation. The
hypothesis that increased AChE activity in these animals was associated with positive AChE gene
regulation due to Spike protein peptides' inhibitory effect needs to be tested in future studies.
Finally, it is essential to emphasize that although our study gathers clear and pioneering
evidence on the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike fragments (especially PSPD2002 and
PSPD2003) on the biochemical parameters evaluated in
tadpoles, many questions about
the consequences of the presence of these fragments in the aquatic environment remains obscure.
The evaluation of the effects of prolonged exposure to the tested peptides (in higher and lower
concentrations), the use of other experimental models (expanding the environmental
representativeness), and the use of multiple toxicity biomarkers are some future investigative

perspectives. Equally important will be to deepen the mechanisms of action of the peptides of the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein when in direct contact with non-host organisms of the new coronavirus.
Approaches of this nature can significantly expand our knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 on
the environment and the functioning of ecosystems, and support the proposal for strategies to
remedy or mitigate aquatic contamination by SARS-Cov2 particles.

4. CONCLUSIONS
From a systemic approach that included the synthesis, cleavage, purification, and alignment
of peptides to
tadpoles’ exposure to peptide fragments of Spike protein, we gathered
evidence that confirms the toxicity of viral constituents in the evaluated animal model. The
increase in predictive biomarkers of REDOX imbalance and neurotoxic action is, therefore, an
insight into how aquatic particle contamination of SARS-CoV-2 can constitute additional
environmental damage to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this sense, we strongly suggest conducting
