Abstract

26

To better understand the genetic diversity, host association and evolution of coronaviruses

27

(CoVs) in China we analyzed a total of 696 rodents encompassing 16 different species

28

sampled from Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces. Based on the reverse transcriptase PCR-based

29

CoV screening CoVs of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene,

30

we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus

31

latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys miletus, E. eleusis, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus

32

norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. Apodemus chevrieri was a particularly rich host, harboring 25

33

rodent CoVs. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of

34

CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat

35

coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan

36

Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A.

37

chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a

38

similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species

39

in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of

40

LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream

41

of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome. Recombination events were

42

also identified in the ORF1a gene of Lijiang-71. In sum, these data reveal the substantial

43

genetic diversity and genomic complexity of rodent-borne CoVs, and greatly extend our

44

knowledge of these major wildlife virus reservoirs.

1. Introduction

49

Coronaviruses (CoVs) (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are important etiological

50

agents for respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of varying severity that

51

impact a variety of animal species including humans. The first coronavirus was isolated in

52

chicken embryos in the 1930s (Hudson and Beaudette 1932). Notably, those human

53

coronaviruses described before 2002 were associated with mild influenza-like symptoms.

54

However, following the emergence of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in

55

2002/2003, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012 and COVID-19 (Corona

56

Virus Disease 2019) in 2019, their potential as human pathogens has gained increasing

57

attention. Importantly, all these diseases are associated with zoonotic CoVs, with a variety of

58

bat species recognized as important wildlife reservoirs. In addition to bats, rodents are also a

59

major zoonotic source of emerging viral diseases, including a number of important infectious

60

diseases of humans (Meerburg et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010). Indeed, rodents are highly

61

diverse and often live in close proximity to humans or domestic animals, presenting an

62

increased risk after direct or indirect exposure to rodent carcasses, faces, urine and parasites.

63

CoVs are currently classified into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,

64

Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (de Groot 2011; https://talk.ictvonline.

65

org/taxonomy/). SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, are all

66

members of genus Betacoronavirus, itself divided into the subgenera Embecovirus,

67

Hibecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Sarbecovirus. Although rodents are important

68

reservoirs for a range of zoonotic pathogens, prior to 2015 the only known rodent coronavirus

69

was mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) isolated from mice in 1949 (Cheever et al. 1949).

70

Following the discovery of four other distinct rodent coronaviruses - the alphacoronavirus

71

Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV) and the betacoronaviruses (subgenus Embecovirus)

72

ChRCoV_HKU24, Myodes coronavirus 2JL14 (MrufCoV_2JL14) and Longquan Rl rat

73

coronavirus (LRLV) – an increasing number of rodent associaed coronaviruses have been

74

identified in different countries and in a range of rodent species (Wang et al. 2015; Lau et al.

75

2015; Tsoleridis et al. 2016; Ge et al. 2017;Wu et al. 2018). Hence, rodents are important

76

reservoirs for members of the subgenus Embecovirus of betacoronaviruses and have likely

78

played a key role in coronavirus evolution and emergence.
Zhejiang province is located in the southern part of the Yangtze River Delta on the

79

southeast coast of China, from where rodent CoVs have previously been reported (Wang et al.

80

2015; Lin et al. 2017). Yunnan province is located in southern China, bordering the countries

81

of Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, and is often caused the “the Kingdom of Wildlife”. A

82

previous study from Yunnan provide identified a novel SARS-like CoV,

83

Rs-betacoronavirus/Yunnan2013, whose ORF8 was nearly identical to ORF8 of SARS-CoVs

84

(98% nt sequence identities) (Wu et al. 2016). Recently, two CoVs closely related to

85

SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in Rhinolophus sp. (i.e. horseshoe) bats sampled from

86

Yunnan province: RaTG13 (Zhou et al. 2020) and RmYN02 (Zhou et al. 2020). However,

87

few rodent CoVs has been documented in Yunnan to date. To explore the diversity and

88

characterization of CoVs in rodents, we performed a molecular evolutionary investigation of

89

CoVs in Zhejiang province and Yunnan province, China. Our results revealed a remarkable

90

diversity of CoVs in rodents.

2. Materials and Methods

93

2.1 Sample collection.

94

This study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the National Institute for

95

Communicable Disease Control and Prevention of the Chinese CDC. All animals were kept

96

alive after capture and treated in strictly according to the guidelines for the Laboratory

97

Animal Use and Care from the Chinese CDC and the Rules for the Implementation of

98

Laboratory Animal Medicine (1998) from the Ministry of Health, China, under the protocols

99

approved by the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention. All

100

surgery was performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

101

All rodents were collected in 2014 and 2015 from Lijiang and Ruili cities in Yunnan

102

province, and Longquan and Wenzhou cities in Zhejiang province, China. Sampling occurred

103

in cages using fried food as bait set in the evening and checked the following morning.

104

Animals were initially identified by trained field biologists, and further confirmed by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.245415; this version posted August 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

105

sequence analysis of the mitochondrial (mt)-cyt b gene (Guo et al. 2013). Lung samples were

106

collected from animals for the classification of rodent species and alimentary tract samples

107

were collected from animals for the detection of CoVs, respectively.

108

2.2 DNA and RNA extraction.

109

Total DNA was extracted by using the Cell & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Bioteke

110

Corporation, Beijing, China) from lung samples of rodents according to the manufacturer's

111

protocol. Total RNA was extracted from fecal samples using the Fecal total RNA extraction

112

kit (Bioteke Corporation, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA

113

was eluted in 50μl RNase-free water and was used as a template for further detection.

114

2.3 CoV detection and complete genome sequencing.

115

The mt-cyt b gene (1140 bp) was amplified by PCR with universal primers for rodents

116

described previously (Guo et al. 2013). CoV screening was performed using a previously

117

published primer set by a pan-coronavirus nested PCR targeted to a conserved region of the

118

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) gene (Wang et al. 2015). First-round reverse

119

transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted by using PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR Kit

120

Ver.2 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). A 10 μL reaction mixture contained 5 μL of 2 X 1 Step Buffer,

121

0.4 μL PrimeScript 1 Step Enzyme Mix, 0.3 μL (10μmol/l) forward primer, 0.3 μL (10μmol/l))

122

reverse primer, 3.5 μL RNase Free dH2O, and 0.5 μL of sample RNA. The PCR cycler

123

conditions for the amplification were 50°C for 30 min (reverse transcription) then 95°C for 3

124

min, 35 cycle of 94°C for 45 s (denaturation), 44°C for 45 s (annealing), 72°C for 45 s

125

(extension), then 72°C for 10 min (final extension). The PCR product was then put through a

126

second round PCR which amplify a final PCR product of approximately 450bp.

127

To recover the complete viral genome, RNA was amplified by using several sets of

128

degenerate primers designed by multiple-sequence alignments of available genome of

129

published CoVs. Additional primers were designed according to results of the first and

130

subsequent rounds of sequencing. The 5’ and 3’ end of the viral genome was amplified by

131

rapid amplification of cDNA ends by using the 5’ and 3’ Smarter RACE kit (TaKaRa, Dalian,

132

China).

133

RT-PCR products of expected size were subject to Sanger sequencing performed by the

134

Sangon corporation (Beijing, China). Amplicons of more than 700 bp were sequenced in both

135

directions. Sequences were assembled by SeqMan and manually edited to produce the final

136

sequences of the viral genomes. Nucleotide (nt) sequence similarities and deduced amino

137

acid (aa) similarities to GenBank database sequences were determined using BLASTn and

138

BLASTp.

139

2.4 Phylogenetic analysis.

140

CoV reference sequences sets representing the RdRp, S and N genes were downloaded from

141

GenBank. Both partial RdRp gene sequences and complete amino acid sequences of the

142

RdRp, S and N genes were used to infer phylogenetic trees. All viral sequences were aligned

143

using the MAFFT algorithm (Katoh and Standley 2013). After alignment, gaps and

144

ambiguously regions were removed using Gblocks (v0.91b) (Talavera and Castresana 2007).

145

The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution was determined using jModelTest version 0.1

146

(Posada 2008). Phylogenetic trees were generated using the maximum likelihood (ML)

147

method implemented in PhyML v3.0 (Guindon et al. 2010).

148

2.5 Genome recombination analysis

149

Potential recombination events in the history of the LRNV, LRLV and ChRCoV_HKU24

150

were assessed using both the RDP4 (Martin et al. 2010) and Simplot (v.3.5.1) programs. The

151

RDP4 analysis was conducted based on the complete genome sequence, using the RDP,

152

GENECONV, BootScan, maximum chi square, Chimera, SISCAN and 3SEQ methods within

153

RDP4. Putative recombination events were identified with a Bonferroni corrected P-value

154

cut-off of 0.01. Similarity plots were inferred using Simplot to further characterize potential

155

recombination events, including the location of possible breakpoints.

3. Results

158

3.1 Collection of rodents, and the detection of CoV RNA

159

During 2014 and 2015 a total of 696 rodents from 16 different species were captured in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.245415; this version posted August 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

160

Lijiang city, Ruili city, Yunnan province and Longquan city, Wenzhou city, Zhejiang province

161

(Figure 1 and Table 1). RT-PCR was performed to detect CoVs RNA based on partial RdRp

162

sequences. PCR products of the expected size were amplified from one A. agrarius collected

163

from Longquan and two R. norvegicus sampled from Wenzhou; 25 A. chevrieri, two A.

164

latronum, three Eothenomys miletus from Lijiang; two B. indica, one E. eleusis, one R.

165

andamanesis, and two R. tanezumi from Ruili. Overall, 5.6% of rodents were CoV positive.

166

All these sequences exhibited close sequence similarity to published CoVs. Specifically, two

167

CoVs sampled from B. indica and one from R. andamanensis in Ruili shared 92.9%-96.0%

168

nucleotide (nt) sequence similarity with LRLV; 21 CoVs from one A. agrarius in Longquan,

169

one E. eleusis and two R. tanezumi in Ruili, as well as one E. miletus, two A. latronum, 12 A.

170

chevrieri in Lijiang had 93.2%-98.4% nt sequence similarity to Longquan-343 and ChRCoV

171

HKU24; 17 CoVs from two R. norvegicus in Wenzhou, one A. latronum, two E. miletus, and

172

12 A. chevrieri in Lijiang had 83.3%-98.9% nt sequence similarity to LRNV.

173

3.2 Host range of rodent associated CoVs

174

To better understand the relationship between viruses, their hosts and their geographic

175

distribution, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of partial RdRp (381bp) (Figure 2A). In

176

total, 17 virus samples were identified as members of the genus Alphacoronavirus while 22

177

belonged to the genus Betacoronavirus. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed three different

178

clades of rodent-borne CoVs: (i) the first clade fell within the genus Alphacoronavirus and

179

contained a variety of viruses including LRNV; (ii) the second clade contained members of

180

the subgenus Embecovirus (genus Betacoronavirus) including LRLV; (iii) the third clade also

181

fell withing the subgenus Embecovirus and contained ChRCoV_HKU24. Notably, all three

182

clades contained viruses closely related to CoVs previously identified in rodents from

183

Zhejiang province, China.

184

The data generated here, along with that published previously, indicate that a total of 37

185

different species of rodents from nine different countries are currently known to harbor CoVs

186

(Figure 2). Notably, every virus clade contained different rodent species, sometimes even

187

from different subfamilies, such that there was no rigid host restriction in rodent CoVs

188

(Figure S1). Indeed, LRNV has been identified in 15 different species in rodents, comprising

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.245415; this version posted August 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

189

A. agrarius, A. chevrieri, A. latronum, Chinchilla lanigera, Eothenomys fidelis, E. miletus, M.

190

agrestis, M. arvalis, M. glareolus, M. rufocanus, M. rutilus, R. lossea, R. nitidus, R.

191

norvegicus, and R. sikkimensis. In addition, multiple CoVs can be carried by the same rodent

192

species. For example, two Rattus species - R. lossea and R. norvegicus - were found to carry

193

three species of rodent-borne coronavirus. This is in contrast to previous studies in which

194

individual CoVs were associated with a single species or genera, including Carollia,

195

Eptesicus, Miniopterus, Scotophilus, and Rhinolipus bats (Anthony et al.2013; Drexler et

196

al.2010; Fischer et al.2016; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2015).

197

3.3 Characterization of viral genomes

198

To better characterize the CoVs found in this study, complete or nearly complete genome

199

sequences data for the three variants of LRNV (Lijiang-71, Lijiang-170, Wenzhou-83) and

200

four variants of ChRCoV_HKU24 (Lijiang-41, Lijiang-53, Ruili-874, Longquan-723) as well

201

as the single variant of LRLV (Ruili-66) were obtained by assembly of the sequences of the

202

RT-PCR products from the RNA directly extracted from the individual specimens.

203

The three genomes of LRNV shared 77.5%-92.4% nt sequence similarity with each

204

other. The genome sizes of Wenzhou-83, Lijiang-71 and Lijiang-170 were 28599, 29147 and

205

27563 nt, respectively, with the G+C contents of 40.29%, 39.35% and 40.21%. The genomes

206

of Wenzhou-83, Lijiang-71, Lijiang-170 had 97.7%, 92.3% and 77.6% overall nucleotide

207

identity with LRNV Lucheng-19, respectively. The genome organization was similar to that

208

of other LRNVs and had the characteristic gene order 5’-replicase ORF1ab, spike (S),

209

envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)-3’. Strikingly, however, a major difference

210

among these LRNVs is the additional ORF(s) encoding nonstructural (NS) proteins and

211

located between ORF1ab and S gene (Figure 3). According to the presence and quantity of

212

non-structural proteins, the virus can be divided into three genomic variants: (i) the first

213

variant comprised Lijiang-170 and AcCoV-JC34 in which no NS protein was observed; (ii)

214

the second variant contains Ruian-83, Lucheng-19 and RtRl-CoV/FJ2015 for which there is a

215

putative NS2 gene between their ORF1ab and S gene. The putative NS2 gene lengths for

216

Ruian-83, Lucheng-19 and RtRl-CoV/FJ2015 were 825, 828 and 825 nt, respectively, with

217

93.5-94.8% sequence identity; (iii) the third variant comprises Lijiang-71,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.245415; this version posted August 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

218

RtClan-CoV/GZ2015 and RtMruf-CoV-1/JL2014 and contains two putative non-structural

219

proteins - NS2 and NS2b – located between the ORF1ab and S gene. The putative NS2 gene

220

of the third variant is 828 nt in length, with 82.9-88.9% sequence identity. Similarly, the

221

putative NS2b has a gene length of 462 nt and exhibits 77.5-96.3% sequence identity among

222

these three viruses. Strikingly, a blastp search reveals that the NS2b encodes a putative

223

nonstructural protein of 153 amino acid residues in length that has no amino acid sequence

224

similarity to other coronaviruses; rather, this sequence exhibits ~43% amino acid identity to

225

the C-type lectin-like protein within the rodent Microtus ochrogaster genome. Hence, this

226

pattern suggests that the NS2b gene may have originally been acquired from the host genome

227

during evolutionary history. Moreover, the amino acid sequence identity between Lijiang-170,

228

Lijiang-71, Ruian-83 and LRNV was greater than 90% in RdRp, E, and M genes (as expected

229

from members of the same species), but only 70%-88% in ADRP, 3CLpro, ORF1ab and S

230

(Table 2). Further analysis of the characteristics of Lijiang-170, for which a complete genome

231

sequence is available, shows that it has similar transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) to

232

AcCoV-JC34 (Table 3). Hence, Lijiang-170 and AcCoV-JC34 may represent a novel subtype

233

of LRNV that exhibits marked differences to the prototype strain Lucheng-19.

234

In contrast, Lijiang-53, Lijiang-41, Ruili-874, Longquan-723 were most closely related

235

to ChRCoV_HKU24, exhibiting 94.0%-96.1% nt sequence similarity. Strikingly, the length

236

of nsp3 in Lijiang-41 differed from those of ChRCoV_HKU24 as a result of a 75 nt deletion.

237

Ruili-66 was most closed to LRLV and shared 92.7% nt sequence similarity with

238

Longquan-370 and Longquan-189 of LRLV found in Longquan.

239

3.4 Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences

240

To better understand the evolutionary relationships among the CoVs described here and those

241

identified previously, we estimated phylogenetic trees based on the amino acid sequences of

242

the RdRp, S and N proteins. The analysis of all three proteins from the LRNV clade again

243

suggests that LRNV can be divided into two phylogenetic subtypes (I and II); indicated on

244

Figure 4). Indeed, there was a clear division phylogenetic between the subtype I and II LRNV

245

sequences in the RdRp, S and N amino acid trees, and while intra-subtype (I or II) sequences

246

shared high nucleotide sequence identities (92.4% - 97.7%), inter-subtype sequence identity

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.245415; this version posted August 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

247

was only ~77.5%. Notably, this phylogenetic analysis also suggested that clade LRNV had a

248

recombinant evolutionary history: while the LRNV clade formed a distinct lineage in the

249

RdRp and N gene trees (although with little phylogenetic resolution in the latter), it clustered

250

with Rhinolophus chevieri coronavirus HKU2, BtRf-AlphaCoV/YN2012 and Sm-CoV X74

251

in the S gene tree. In contrast, the clade 2 and clade 3 rodent CoVs were consistently closely

252

related to LRLV and ChRCoV_HKU24 in the RdRp, S and N amino acid trees.

253

3.5 Recombination.

254

Multiple methods within the RDP program (Martin et al. 2010) identified statistically

255

significant recombination events in Lijiang-71 (p <3.05×10-23 to p <7.11×10-13) (Figure 5).

256

When Lijiang-71 was used as the query for sliding window analysis with

257

RtClan-CoV/GZ2015 and Lucheng-19 as potential parental sequences, four recombination

258

breakpoints at nucleotide positions 8,188, 8,636, 9,030 and 11,251 in the sequence alignment

259

were observed. This pattern of recombination events is further supported by phylogenetic and

260

similarity plot analyses (Figure 5). Specifically, in the major parental region (1-8,187,

261

8,637-9,029 and 11,252-29,349), Lijiang-71was most closely related to RtClan-CoV/GZ2015,

262

while in the minor parental region (8188-8636 and 9,030-11,251) it was more closely related

263

to Lucheng-19.

4. Discussion

266

We screened CoVs in 696 rodents from 16 different species sampled at four sites in Zhejiang

267

and Yunnan provinces, China. Overall positivity rates were approximately 6%, although they

268

ranged from 10.2% in Lijiang city to only 1.3% in Zhejiang province. The latter is lower than

269

the CoV detection rates described in a previous study undertaken in Zhejiang province

270

despite the use of similar methodologies (Wang et al., 2015). We found that A. chevrieri had a

271

relatively high CoV detection rate (25/194, 12.89%) in Lijiang city, Yunnan province,

272

consistent with a previous study showing that A. chevrieri had a high detection rate of CoV

273

(21/98, 21.4%) in Jianchuan county, also in Yunnan province (Ge et al. 2017). As A. chevrieri

274

is a dominant species in Lijiang city, such a high coronavirus infection rate highlights the

275

need for ongoing surveillance.

276

Our analysis of rodent-borne CoVs revealed that all currently recognized viruses fall

277

into six groups - LRNV, LRLV, ChRCoV_HKU24, Myodes coronavirus 2JL14, HCoV_OC43,

278

MHV and unclassified members of the genus Embecovirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on

279

the partial RdRp gene reveals that coronaviruses from different countries (China, UK,

280

Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherland, Poland, South Africa and Thailand) group together

281

with no obvious geographic pattern. Indeed, at least 37 different rodent species are known to

282

carry coronaviruses, such that they have an extensive host range in these animals, and with

283

frequent cross-species transmission. A growing number of rodent species are found to carry

284

members of the genus Embecovirus, indicating that rodents indeed played an important role

285

for Embecovirus spread and evolution, and are the likely reservoir hosts for the human

286

coronavirus HKU1 (Woo et al. 2005).

287

Our analysis also provided evidence for multiple variants of rodent-borne CoVs in the

288

genus Alphacoronavirus that different in the genome organization. For example, although

289

Lijiang-170 had greatest sequence similarity to LRNV variant Lucheng-19, it does not

290

contain a NS2 between ORF 1b and S gene as observed in most other alphacoronaviruses.

291

More striking was that three viruses (Lijiang-71, RtClan-CoV/GZ2015 and

292

RtMruf-CoV-1/JL2014) had a putative nonstructural protein of 153 amino acids located

293

downstream of NS2 that likely resulted from a past horizontal gene transfer event involving

294

the rodent host genome. In addition, inter-virus recombination events were identified in

295

Lijiang-71. Such mechanisms of genetic transfer may ultimately lead to the creation of novel

296

viruses, perhaps with variable phenotypic properties (Su et al. 2016).

297

In conclusion, our study revealed a high diversity of CoVs circulating in rodents from

298

Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces, China, including the discovery of a putative novel viral

299

subtype and new rodent host species. Undoubtedly, the larger scale surveillance and analyses

300

of CoV infections in rodents is required to better understand their genetic diversity, cellular

301

receptors, inter-host transmission and evolutionary history.
