Abstract

15

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of human

16

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The virus

17

rapidly spread globally, resulting in a public-health crisis including more than one million cases

18

and tens of thousands of deaths. Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of

19

commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in

20

infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit

21

polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV

22

nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins

23

by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established

24

RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established

25

a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-

26

sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we

27

developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in

28

the same FFPE section. These reagents and assays will accelerate COVID-19 pathogenesis

29

studies in humans and in COVID-19 animal models.

Introduction

31

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agents of human

32

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), initially emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in

33

December 2019 (1-3). As of April 9, 2020, 1,436,198 cases of COVID-19, including 85,522

34

deaths have been reported worldwide (4).

35

SARS-CoV-2 has a nonsegmented, linear, positive-sense, multicistronic genome and produces

36

enveloped virions (5). The virus is classified as a betacoronavirus (Nidovirales: Coronaviridae)

37

together with the other two highly virulent human pathogens severe acute respiratory syndrome

38

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (6).

39

The SARS-CoV-2 genomes shares 79.6% and 50.0% nucleotide sequence identity with the

40

genomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively (5). Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2

41

virions use their spike (S) glycoproteins to engage host-cell angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2

42

(ACE2) to gain entry into host cells and host-cell transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)

43

for S priming (7).

44

Bats are speculated to be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 because numerous other

45

betacoronaviruses are of chiropteran origin (8, 9). However, although the COVID-19 pandemic

46

may have begun with a bat-to-human transmission event, it appears that close to all human

47

infections trace back to respiratory droplets produced by infected people and fomites (respiratory

48

droplet landing sites) (10, 11). Human infections lead to various degrees of disease severity,

49

ranging from asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms to fatal pneumonia. Older patients or

50

patients with chronic medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming critically ill with poor

51

prognosis (12). The most common symptoms and clinical signs of COVID-19 are fever, cough,

52

dyspnea, and myalgia with medium incubation period of 4 days (13-15). Ground-glass opacity is

53

the most common radiologic finding on chest CT upon admission (13-15). Bilateral diffuse

54

alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage and edema, interstitial fibrosis and inflammation, and type

55

II pneumocyte hyperplasia are observed in post-mortem human lungs (16-18).

56

At the time of writing, there are no animal models that truly mimic the disease spectrum and

57

pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, small animals (e.g., human ACE2 transgenic laboratory

58

mice (19), cats (20), domestic ferrets (20, 21), golden hamsters (22)), and nonhuman primates

59

(e.g., rhesus monkeys (23, 24), crab-eating macaques (25)), are used to study SARS-CoV-2

60

infection as alveolar damage, interstitial inflammation, and viral shedding occur in these animal

61

models to various degree. It is hoped that further development of these and other animal models

62

will help overcome the current roadblock to evaluating the efficacy of candidate medical

63

countermeasures (MCMs) against and the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

64

Detection of viral antigen using IHC or IFA techniques and detection of viral nucleic acids using

65

ISH within infected, but inactivated, human or animal model tissues greatly facilitates detection

66

of viral infection and thereby pathogenesis and MCM efficacy studies. These techniques become

67

paramount in particular for studies of a potential pathogen that does not cause overt, or causes

68

only mild, disease, such as SARS-CoV-2 in the currently available animal models. Viral antigen-

69

based immunostaining has been used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen in both post-mortem human

70

and animal tissues (1, 16, 22, 25). However, the antibodies used in these studies were produced

71

in-house and therefore are not commonly available. Identification and characterization of

72

commercially available anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and ISH assays that can be used to detect

73

SARS-CoV-2 in FFPE tissues are therefore critically needed.

Results

81

Identification of antibodies suitable for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by IHC and IFA in FFPE

82

specimens. To identify antibodies that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in human and animal

83

tissues, we searched for commercially available SARS-CoV antibodies that recognize epitopes

84

that are likely conserved in SARS-CoV-2. We identified six antibodies, including three rabbit

85

polyclonal antibodies, against SARS-CoV S, one rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV

86

nucleocapsid protein (NP), and one rabbit and one mouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-

87

CoV NP that may cross react with SARS-CoV-2 (Supplemental Table 1). Additionally, we also

88

identified a rabbit monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 S (Supplemental Table 1). To

89

evaluate whether these six antibodies can recognize SARS-CoV-2 in FFPE specimens, we

90

performed IHC on FFPE pellets of Vero 76 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. We identified one

91

rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV S (Sino Biological, Chesterbrook, PA, USA;

92

#40150-T62-COV2) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV NP (Sino Biological,

93

40143-MM05) that did not stain uninfected, but stained SARS-CoV-2-infected FFPE cell pellets

94

(Figure 1A–D). Furthermore, we did IFA using these two antibodies. Interestingly, in

95

comparison to relatively concentrated detection of SARS-CoV-2 NP (red) in cytoplasmic

96

membrane, the SARS-CoV-2 S (green) is more confined in perinuclear inclusion bodies (Figure

97

1E).

98

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by ISH in FFPE tissues. We have previously reported the

99

development of RNAscope ISH assays to detect various high-consequence viruses including

100

Ebola virus (EBOV; Filoviridae: Ebolavirus), Marburg virus (MARV; Filoviridae:

101

Marburgvirus), Lassa virus (LASV; Arenaviridae: Mammarenavirus), and Nipah virus (NiV;

102

Paramyxoviridae: Henipavirus) in FFPE animal tissues (26-29). Here we report the successful

use of the RNAscope ISH assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in FFPE cell pellets using three

104

probes: two probes binding the SARS-CoV-2 positive-sense (genomic) RNA and one probe

105

binding the negative-sense (replicative intermediate) RNA (Figure 2A–F, Supplemental Table 2).

106

As expected, the forty ZZ positive-sense RNA probe 2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 positive-sense

107

RNA resulted in a stronger signal than the twenty ZZ positive-sense RNA probe 1 (Figure 2A–

108

D). Interestingly, in contrast to the wide cytoplasmic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 positive-sense

109

RNA (Figure 2B and D), SARS-CoV-2 negative-sense (replicative intermediate) RNA, detected

110

using negative-sense RNA probe 1 was more specifically localized in perinuclear inclusion

111

bodies (Figure 2F).

112

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 replication in FFPE specimens using mFISH. Single-stranded RNA

113

viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, have to generate a replicative intermediate RNA as a template to

114

synthesize progeny genomic RNAs. We have previously reported the use of mFISH to detect

115

EBOV, MARV, and NiV replication in FFPE tissues (26, 28, 29). Here, we tested mFISH to

116

detect SARS-CoV-2 replication in FFPE specimens using positive-sense RNA probe 2 and

117

negative-sense RNA probe 2 (Supplemental Table 2). Consistent with the RNAscope ISH

118

results, positive-sense viral RNA was widely distributed in the cytoplasm, whereas negative-

119

sense RNA (replicative intermediate) was confined to perinuclear inclusion bodies (Figure 3A–

120

B).

121

Dual staining to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section. To more

122

precisely detect SARS-CoV-2, we developed a dual staining assay to recognize both SARS-

123

CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section. IHC was performed using the identified

124

rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV S antibody following ISH using positive-sense RNA probe 2.

Discussion

128

As worldwide infectious disease researchers are racing to understand the pathogenesis of and to

129

develop and evaluate MCMs against COVID-19 to contain the ongoing pandemic, assays that

130

determine SARS-CoV-2 distribution in tissues and specific cellular targets of infection are

131

urgently needed. Here we evaluated commercial reagents and assays to detect SARS-CoV-2

132

antigens or RNA in FFPE specimens. We identified one rabbit polyclonal antibody and one

133

mouse monoclonal antibody that reacts with SARS-CoV-2 S and N, respectively, and

134

demonstrated that these two antibodies can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 by IHC and IFA in

135

FFPE specimens. Additionally, we characterized two RNAscope ISH assays that can be used to

136

detect SARS-CoV-2 positive- and negative-sense RNAs in FFPE specimens. Furthermore, we

137

developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 S and RNA in the

138

same FFPE section. These reagents and assays are all commercially available and therefore can

139

be applied readily to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both human and animal FFPE tissues.

140

Detection of viral antigen by IHC and IFA has been widely used to detect infection of

141

high-consequence viruses, including SARS-CoV, EBOV, MARV, LASV, and NiV in human and

142

animal FFPE tissues (26, 28-32). Although various antigen retrieval methods can help to restore

143

the immunoreactivity of epitopes in FFPE tissues, in our experience it remains more challenging

144

to identify antibodies that binds their targets in FFPE tissues compared to frozen section tissues.

145

The FFPE specimen-compatible rabbit and mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies we

146

characterized here can be used to map the cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 in various organs

147

using multiplex IFA in addition to detecting viral infection. RNAscope ISH is a relatively novel

148

ISH platform with high-sensitivity and low-background due to its unique “ZZ” probe design

149

(33). This platform has been widely used to detect viruses both in human and animal tissues (27,

150

34-36). Single-stranded RNA viruses have to produce a replicative intermediate, antigenomic

151

RNA, as a template to synthesize new genomic RNAs. Presence of such replicative intermediate

152

RNA in tissues indicates ongoing viral replication (26, 28, 29). The commercially available

153

RNAscope ISH assays, including chromogenic and fluorescent assays, we characterized here,

154

can be applied to detect viral RNA in both human and animal tissue samples. The dual staining

155

we developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section can more

156

precisely detect SARS-CoV-2 because a positive IHC or ISH signal alone may originate from

157

remaining free viral antigen or degenerating RNA fragments rather than from viral particles.

158

Because SARS-CoV-2-infected animal tissues were not available at the time of this study, we

159

were restricted to evaluate FFPE pellets of Vero 76 cells as a surrogate. However, we prepared

160

FFPE cell pellets using the same process used for FFPE tissues preparation. Additionally, FFPE

161

cell pellets have been widely used to evaluate antibodies and ISH assays and other reagents for

162

FFPE tissue analysis and have been largely predictive of reactivity with genuine tissues (33, 37,

163

38). We are therefore confident that the SARS-CoV-2 IHC, ISH, mFISH, and dual staining

164

assays we developed and characterized will be highly useful to study pathogenesis of SARS-

165

CoV-2 infection in both human and animal models.

Methods

167

Cells and virus. Grivet (Chlorocebus aethiops) Vero 76 kidney epithelial cells (American Type

168

Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA; #CRL-1587) were maintained in Eagle’s minimum

169

essential media (EMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with

170

10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), 1% GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher

171

Scientific) and1% non-essential amino acid solution (MilliporeSigma, Temecula, CA, USA), at

172

37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain (GenBank

173

#MN985325.1) was obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC,

174

Atlanta, GA, USA). Virus was added to Vero 76 cell cultures in T-75 flasks in biosafety level 3

175

(BSL-3) containment at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Cells were then incubated for 1

176

h for virus adsorption, washed with EMEM, and maintained in EMEM with 10% FBS. Cells

177

were fixed at 24 h post-inoculation in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and then moved

178

from the BSL-3 to a BSL-2 suite. Uninfected Vero 76 were processed as a control.

179

Cell pellet embedding. Fixed cells were scraped off flasks after being rinsed twice in PBS

180

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Scraped cells were spun down at 2,500 rpm and the pellets were

181

mixed with liquefied Histogel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pellets were solidified at 4°C and

182

further processed for paraffin embedding using an automated Tissue Tek VIP processor (Sakura

183

Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA).

184

IHC. IHC was performed using the Envision system (Dako Agilent Pathology Solutions,

185

Carpinteria, CA, USA). Briefly, after deparaffinization, peroxidase blocking, and antigen

186

retrieval, sections were covered with a primary antibody at a 1;1000, 1:2000, or 1:4000 dilution

187

(Supplemental Table 1) and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Subsequently, sections

189

Slides were rinsed and a brown chromogenic substrate DAB solution (Dako Agilent Pathology

190

Solutions) was applied for 8 min. The substrate-chromogen solution was rinsed off the slides,

191

and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and rinsed. The sections were dehydrated,

192

cleared with Xyless II (Valtech, Brackenridge, PA, USA), and then coverslipped.

193

IFA. After deparaffinization and reduction of autofluorescence, tissues were heated in citrate

194

buffer, pH 6.0 (MilliporeSigma), for 15 min to reverse formaldehyde cross-links. After rinsing

195

with PBS, pH 7.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), sections were blocked overnight with CAS-Block

196

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 5% normal goat serum (MilliporeSigma) at 4°C. Sections

197

were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV S (Sino Biological,

198

#40150-T62-COV2) at dilution 1:500 and mouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV NP

199

(Sino Biological, 40143-MM05) at a dilution 1:500 for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing in

200

PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20, MilliporeSigma), sections were incubated with secondary goat

201

IgG Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and with goat IgG Alexa Fluor 561-

202

conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections

203

were cover-slipped using VECTASHIELD antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Vector

Microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and processed using open-source ImageJ software

206

(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

ISH. To detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in FFPE tissues, ISH was performed using the

208

RNAscope 2.5 HD RED kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA) according to the

209

manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, forty ZZ ISH probes (#854841, positive-sense RNA probe

(Supplemental Table 2). Tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, underwent a series of

215

ethanol washes and peroxidase blocking, and were then heated in kit-provided antigen retrieval

216

buffer and digested by kit-provided proteinase. Sections were exposed to ISH target probe pairs

217

and incubated at 40°C in a hybridization oven for 2 h. After rinsing, ISH signal was amplified

218

using kit-provided Pre-amplifier and Amplifier conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and incubated

219

with a Fast Red substrate solution for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were then stained

220

with hematoxylin, air-dried, mounted, and stored at 4°C until image analysis.
