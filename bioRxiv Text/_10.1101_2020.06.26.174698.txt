Abstract

20

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the

21

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has infected millions within just a few months and is continuing to

22

spread around the globe causing immense respiratory disease and mortality. Assays to monitor

23

SARS-CoV-2 growth depend on time-consuming and costly RNA extraction steps, hampering

24

progress in basic research and drug development efforts. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-

25

PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication

26

kinetics from a small amount of cell culture supernatants. Using this assay, we screened the

27

activities of a number of entry, SARS-CoV-2- and HIV-1-specific inhibitors in a proof of concept

28

study. In line with previous studies which has shown that processing of the viral Spike protein by

29

cellular proteases and endosomal fusion are required for entry, we found that E64D and

30

apilimod potently decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants with

31

minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found that macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA similarly

32

decreased viral RNA in supernatants suggesting that entry may additionally be mediated by an

33

alternative pathway. HIV-1-specific inhibitors nevirapine (an NNRTI), amprenavir (a protease

34

inhibitor), and ALLINI-2 (an allosteric integrase inhibitor) modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2

35

replication, albeit the IC50 values were much higher than that required for HIV-1. Taken together,

36

this facile assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to mid-

37

throughput screens to identify chemical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and be applicable to a broad

38

number of RNA and DNA viruses.

Importance

43

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the

44

COVID-19 pandemic, has quickly become a major global health problem causing immense

45

respiratory disease and social and economic disruptions. Conventional assays that monitor

46

SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture rely on costly and time-consuming RNA extraction

47

procedures, hampering progress in basic SARS-CoV-2 research and development of effective

48

therapeutics. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in

49

cell culture supernatants that does not necessitate RNA extraction, and is as accurate and

50

sensitive as existing methods. In a proof-of-concept screen, we found that E64D, apilimod, EIPA

51

and remdesivir can substantially impede SARS-Cov-2 replication providing novel insight into

52

viral entry and replication mechanisms. This facile approach will undoubtedly expedite basic

53

SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to screening platforms to identify therapeutics against

54

SARS-CoV-2 and can be adapted to numerous other RNA and DNA viruses.

63

Observation

64

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the

65

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is continuing to cause substantial morbidity and mortality around

66

the globe (1, 2). Currently, there are no clinically approved countermeasures available for

67

COVID-19 and the lack of a simple assay to monitor virus growth that can be used in basic

68

SARS-CoV-2 research as well as drug screens is slowing progress in this area. Current Q-RT-

69

PCR methods to quantify SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants rely on time-

70

consuming and costly RNA extraction protocols (3). In this study, we developed a facile Q-RT-

71

PCR assay that bypasses the RNA extraction steps, can detect viral RNA from as little as 5 µL

72

of cell culture supernatants and works equally well with TaqMan and SYBR-Green-based

73

detection methods.

74

A widely used assay to measure virus growth in the retrovirology field relies on determining the

75

activity of reverse transcriptase enzyme from a small amount of cell culture supernatants (4),

76

and we reasoned that we could adapt this approach to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth. First, we

77

tested whether the more stringent lysis conditions used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 would

78

interfere with the subsequent Q-RT-PCR step and affect the broad dynamic range obtained

79

typically from purified RNAs. To do so, 5 µL of serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 N-specific RNA

80

standards were mixed with 2x RNA lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 50 mM KCl, 100 mM TrisHCl

81

pH7.4, 40% glycerol, 0.4 U/µL of SuperaseIN (Life Technologies)), followed by addition of 90 µL

82

of 1X core buffer (5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 20 mM KCl and 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.3). 8.5 µL of the

83

diluted samples were each added in a reaction mix containing 10 µL of a 2x TaqMan RT-PCR

84

mix, 0.5 µL of a 40x Taqman RT enzyme mix (containing ArrayScript™ UP Reverse

85

Transcriptase, RNase Inhibitor), and 1 µL of primer/probe mix (2 µM Taqman Probe (/5’-

86

FAM/TCAAGGAAC/ZEN/AACATTGCCAA/3’ Iowa Black FQ/) and 10 µM each of SARS-Cov-2

88

GACTGCCGCCTCTGCTC)) in a final reaction volume of 20 µL. The reactions were ran using

89

the following cycling parameters: 48 oC for 15 min, 95oC for 10 min, 50 cycles of 95oC for 15sec

90

and 60oC for 1 min of signal acquisition. We found that the modified sample preparations did not

91

impact the sensitivity, efficiency or the dynamic range of the Q-RT-PCR assay as evident in the

92

virtually identical cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained for a given RNA concentration and the

93

similar slopes of linear regression curves (Fig. 1A).

94

To determine whether this approach would work equally well for virus preparations, 100 µL of

95

virus stock (1.4x105 pfu) was lysed via the addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 40

96

mM TrisHCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT, 0.4 U/µL SuperIN

97

RNase Inhibitor, 0.2% NP-40. RNA was then extracted using the Zymo RNA clean and

98

concentratorTM-5 kit and was serially diluted afterwards. In parallel, 5 µL of virus stock and its

99

serial dilutions prepared in cell culture media were lysed in 2X RNA lysis buffer and processed

100

as above. Samples were analyzed by Q-RT-PCR alongside with RNA standards. We found that

101

the modified assay performed equivalently well, if not better, with a similarly broad dynamic

102

range (Fig. 1B).

103

We next used this assay to monitor virus growth on infected Vero cells. Supernatants containing

104

virus collected at various times post infection were either used to extract viral RNA or subjected

105

to Q-RT-PCR directly as above. The modified assay yielded virtually identical number of

106

copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants even at low concentrations of viral

107

RNAs (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these results suggest that RNA extraction from cell culture

108

supernatants can be bypassed without any compromise on the sensitivity or the dynamic range

109

of Q-RT-PCR detection.

110

Next, we wanted to test whether this assay could work equally well with SYBR-Green-based

111

detection methods. In addition to the N primer pair used in the above TaqMan-based assays,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.26.174698; this version posted June 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

112

we utilized the N2 primer set designed by CDC and targeting the N region of the SARS-CoV-2

113

genome (F: 5’-TTACAAACATTGGCCGCAAA and R: 5’- GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA). Serially

114

diluted RNA standards were processed in RNA lysis and core buffers, and 7.5 uL of each

115

dilution was used in a 20 uL SYBR-Green Q-RT-PCR reaction containing 10µL of a 2X

116

POWERUP SYBR Green mix (Life Technologies ref: A25742), 1.25units/ µL of MultiScribe

117

Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems), 1X random primers and 0.25 µM each of F and R

118

primers. Both primer pairs yielded reasonably broad dynamic ranges, but were modestly less

119

sensitive than TaqMan-based assays with a detection limit of ~3500 RNA copies/mL (Fig. 1D).

120

In the following experiments, we decided to use the N2 primer set as it appeared to have a

121

modestly enhanced sensitivity and efficiency overall (Fig. 1D).

122

One immediate application of this simplified assay is screening platforms given the ability to

123

determine virus growth in small quantities of cell culture media. To demonstrate this, we next

124

conducted a proof-of-concept drug screen to validate the antiviral activities of various

125

compounds that have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 replication as well as

126

non-specific entry inhibitors (Table S1). Vero E6 cells plated in 96-well plates were infected in

127

the presence of varying concentrations of the indicated compounds. Viral RNA in cell culture

128

supernatants was quantified by the SYBR-Green-based Q-RT-PCR assay as above at 6, 24

129

and 48 hpi. Compound cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel by the RealTime-Glo™ MT Cell

130

Viability Assay (Promega). While viral RNA was at background levels at 6 hpi (data not shown),

131

we found that, at 24hpi, remdesivir (inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, (5)), E64D

132

(inhibitor of the endosomal protease cathepsin B, K and L), and apilimod (PIKfyve inhibitor

133

resulting in endosomal trafficking defects, (6, 7)) substantially decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral

134

RNAs in supernatants (Fig. 2). IC50 values of these compounds (2.8 µg/mL (remdesivir), 3.3 µM

135

(E64D) and 12nM (apilimod)) were within the same range of published IC50 values of these

136

compounds (6-8) (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained at 48 hpi, albeit E64D and apilimod

137

appeared to be less potent at this time point either due to virus overgrowth or compound

138

turnover (data not shown). We found that EIPA, which inhibits Na+/H+ exchanger and

139

macropinocytosis, substantially decreased viral RNA in supernatants at sub-cytotoxic levels

140

(Fig. 2D), suggesting that macropinocytosis may contribute to viral entry and/or subsequent

141

steps in virus replication. HIV-1 specific inhibitors nevirapine, amprenavir and ALLINI-2

142

modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication without apparent cytotoxicity at high concentrations,

143

albeit the concentrations required for this inhibition were much higher than those that inhibit

144

HIV-1 (Fig. S1). Overall, these findings demonstrate that this miniaturized assay can be adapted

145

for screening platforms and support previous reports which demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2

146

entry is dependent on processing of the Spike protein by cellular proteases and requires

147

endosomal fusion (7, 9, 10).

148

In conclusion, we have developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay to monitor the kinetics of

149

SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants bypassing the time consuming and costly RNA

150

extraction procedures. This facile assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research,

151

might be amenable to mid- to high-throughput screens to identify chemical inhibitors of SARS-

152

CoV-2 and can be applicable to the study of numerous other RNA and DNA viruses.
