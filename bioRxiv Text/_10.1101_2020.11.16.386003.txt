Abstract

25

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),

26

the pathogen responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has devastated

27

public health services and economies worldwide. Despite global efforts to contain the

28

COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused

29

an upward death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only

30

one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (Remdesivir) and a

31

monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab), but no vaccines, are available for the

32

treatment of SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the

33

use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To

34

overcome this limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant

35

(r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc)

36

reporter genes. Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be

37

easily detected via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation

38

between reporter gene expression and viral replication. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2

39

expressing reporter genes have comparable plaque sizes and growth kinetics to those

40

of wild-type virus, rSARS-CoV-2/WT. We used these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2

41

to demonstrate their feasibility to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or antiviral

42

drugs. Our results demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 represent an

43

excellent option to identify therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, where

44

reporter gene expression can be used as valid surrogates to track viral infection.

45

Moreover, the ability to manipulate the viral genome opens the feasibility of generating

Importance

49

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that

50

causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly impacted the human

51

health and economic status worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify effective

52

prophylactics and therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and

53

associated COVID-19 disease. The use of fluorescent- or luciferase-expressing reporter

54

expressing viruses has significantly advanced viral research. Here, we generated

55

recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus and mCherry) or luciferase

56

(Nluc) reporter genes and demonstrate that they represent an excellent option to track

57

viral infections in vitro. Importantly, reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 display similar

58

growth kinetics and plaque phenotype that their wild-type counterpart (rSARS-CoV-

59

2/WT), demonstrating their feasibility to identify drugs and/or neutralizing antibodies

60

(NAbs) for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Henceforth, these reporter-

61

expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be used to interrogate large libraries of compounds

62

and/or monoclonal antibodies (MAb), in high-throughput screening settings, to identify

63

those with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

72

Late in 2019, a previously unknown coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome

73

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Wuhan, China (1). Since then, SARS-

74

CoV-2 has become responsible for the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019

75

(COVID-19) (1). As of November 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide and it has

76

been responsible of over 40 million confirmed cases and around 1.1 million deaths (2).

77

To date, only one United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved

78

therapeutic antiviral drug, Remdesivir, and a monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab)

79

are available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections (3). No FDA-approved

80

prophylactics (vaccines) are currently available against SARS-CoV-2.

81

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA Betacoronavirus that belongs

82

to the Coronaviridae family. Prior to SARS-CoV-2, only six coronavirus (CoVs) species

83

were known to cause disease in humans (4). Of the six, four human (h)CoVs are

84

prevalent and responsible of causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals

85

(hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-HKU1) (4, 5). The two other CoVs,

86

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East

87

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been associated with severe

88

illness and significant morbidity and mortality (6). SARS-CoV was responsible for an

89

outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002-2003 in Guangdong Province,

90

China, with a fatality rate of around 9.5% (7). MERS-CoV was responsible for an

91

outbreak of severe respiratory disease in 2012-2013 in the Middle East, with a fatality

92

rate of around 30% (4, 5, 8). SARS-CoV-2 has a viral genome of approximately 30,000

93

nucleotides in length and high similarity to that of SARS-CoV (~79%) and lower to

94

MERS-CoV (~50%), with an overall fatality rate of 3.4%, but can as high as 49% in

95

critically ill patients, making the COVID-19 pandemic rival that of the “Spanish flu” in

96

1918-1919 (9-13).

97

Studying SARS-CoV-2 in laboratories require the use of secondary approaches to

98

identify the presence of virus in infected cells. The ability to generate recombinant

99

viruses using reverse genetics approaches represents a powerful tool to answer

100

important questions in the biology of viral infections, including mechanisms of viral

101

infection, pathogenesis and disease. In addition, the use of reverse genetics techniques

102

have offered the possibility to generate recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes

103

for their use in cultured cells or in vivo models of infection where reporter gene

104

expression can be used as a valid surrogate the identify the presence of the virus in

105

infected cells (14, 15). Importantly, these reporter-expressing recombinant viruses also

106

represent an excellent tool for the easy and rapid identification of drugs for the

107

prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of viral infections, by allowing high-throughput

108

screening (HTS) approaches to interrogate large libraries of biologicals exhibiting

109

antiviral activity.

110

Several manuscripts have described the ability to generate recombinant (r)SARS-

111

CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (mNeonGreen and GFP) or bioluminescent (Nluc)

112

reporter genes (16-18). However, these reverse genetics protocols require laborious in

113

vitro assembly and transcription steps prior to transfecting cells, an inconvenience that

114

should be considered due to the laborious nature and restraint of these methods. Here,

115

we describe the generation and characterization of replication-competent rSARS-CoV-2

116

expressing fluorescent Venus or mCherry, or bioluminescent Nluc reporter genes using

117

our recently described bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based reverse genetics

118

approach (19, 20). In Vero E6 cells, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes have

119

similar growth kinetics and plaque phenotype than that of wild-type virus (rSARS-CoV-

120

2/WT). Importantly, we have observed a correlation between reporter gene expression

121

and viral replication (19), and infected cells can be easily detected, without the need of

122

secondary approaches, based on reporter gene expression. Using these reporter-

123

expressing rSARS-CoV-2, we have developed fluorescent-based microneutralization

124

assays that can be used to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and/or antivirals. The

125

neutralization titers and inhibitory activities of NAbs or antivirals, respectively, obtained

126

in our reporter-based microneutralization assays were similar to those observed in

127

classical microneutralization assays using rSARS-CoV-2/WT (21). These results

128

demonstrate that our reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 represent an excellent tool for

129

studying the biology of the virus and for the identification of therapeutics for the

130

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and also for in vivo studies. Furthermore, because of reporter

131

gene expression, these rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes represent an ideal

132

option to screen large libraries of biologicals to identify those with antiviral activity. Our

133

results also demonstrate the feasibility of generating rSARS-CoV-2 expressing foreign

134

genes that could be used to generate vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2

135

infections and/or associated COVID-19 disease.

Generation of pBeloBAC11-SARS-CoV-2 encoding reporter genes

154

The pBeloBAC11 plasmid (NEB) containing the entire viral genome of SARS-CoV-2

155

has been previously described (19, 22). Briefly, the entire genome sequence of SARS-

156

CoV-2

157

synthesized (Bio Basic) in five fragments and cloned into pUC57 plasmids containing

158

unique restriction sites. Silent mutations were introduced to the spike (S) and matrix (M)

159

genes to remove BstBI and Mlul restriction sites, respectively, that were used for the

160

assembly of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid. These

161

nucleotide changes were also used as genetic markers to distinguish the natural

162

USA/WA1/2020 and the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (19). The five fragments containing

163

the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome were assembled into the pBeloBAC11 using standard

164

molecular biology techniques. To remove the 7a gene and introduce the Venus,

165

mCherry, or Nluc reporter genes, the region flanking the 7a viral gene and each

166

individual reporter genes were amplified by extension and overlapping PCR using

167

specific oligonucleotides in a shuttle plasmid. The modified 7a viral genes were inserted

168

into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid containing the remaining SARS-CoV-2 viral genome

169

using BamHI and RsrII restriction sites to generate pBeloBAC11-SARS-CoV-2-

170

del7a/Venus, pBeloBAC11-SARS-CoV-2-del7a/mCherry, and pBeloBAC11-SARS-CoV-

171

2-del7a/Nluc for the rescue of rSARS-CoV-2-Venus, rSARS-CoV-2-mCherry and

172

rSARS-CoV-2-Nluc, respectively. Plasmids and pBeloBAC11 constructs were validated

173

by Sanger sequencing (ACGT Inc).

174

Rescue of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes

175

The rSARS-CoV-2/WT and rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes were rescued

176

as previously described (19, 20). Briefly, confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (1.2 x

177

181

media was replaced with post-infection media (DMEM with 2% FBS) and, 24 h later,

and rSARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent Venus and mCherry, cells were submerged in

280

10% neutral buffered formalin at 4ºC for 16 h for fixation and viral inactivation. Cells

281

were washed with 100 μl/well of PBS three times, permeabilized with 100 μl/well of

282

0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 15 min and blocked with 100 μl/well

283

of 2.5% BSA in PBS at 37°C for 1 h. Next, cells were staining with the anti-NP MAb 1C7

284

(1μg/mL) in 1% BSA PBS at 37°C for 1 h. After incubation with the primary MAb, cells

285

were washed with PBS three times, and a secondary fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-

286

conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako; 1:200) in 1% BSA were added to cells for 1 h at

287

37°C. Cell nuclei were stained with 4’’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Research

288

Organics). Viral infections were determined using fluorescent images of each well and

289

quantified using a cell image analysis software, Cell Profiler (Broad Institute). In the

290

case of cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2 expressing Nluc, tissue culture supernatants

291

were collected at 48 h post-infection and Nluc expression was measured using a

292

luciferase assay and a Synergy LX microplate reader (BioTek). Individual wells from

293

three independent experiments conducted in quadruplicates were used to calculate the

294

average and standard deviation (SD) of viral inhibition using Microsoft Excel software.

To test the neutralizing activity of 1212C2, a human MAb recently described to

299

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (27), confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (96-plate format, 4

300

× 104 cells/well, quadruplicates) were infected with ~100-200 PFU of rSARS-CoV-2/WT

301

or rSARS-CoV-2 expressing Venus, mCherry, or Nluc for 1 h at 37°C. After viral

302

adsorption, cells were washed and incubated with 100 µL of infection media (DMEM 2%

303

FBS) containing 3-fold serial dilutions (starting concentration of 500 ng) of 1212C2 or

304

PBS, and 1% avicel (Sigma-Aldrich). Infected cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 h for

305

rSARS-CoV-2/WT, or rSARS-CoV expressing Venus or mCherry, and 48 h for rSARS-

306

CoV-2 expressing Nluc. After viral infections, cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2/WT and

307

rSARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent Venus and mCherry were submerged in 10%

with PBS and incubated with a secondary fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-conjugated

Genetic stability

326

Vero E6 cells (1.2 x 106 cells/well, 6-well plate format, triplicates) were infected (MOI

327

of 0.01) with rSARS-CoV-2-Venus or -mCherry P3 stocks and after 1 h viral adsorption,

328

virus inoculum was replaced with infectious media (DMEM 2% FBS). The cells were

329

incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 until 70% cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. Then,

330

tissue culture supernatants were collected and diluted 100-fold in infectious media and

331

used to infect fresh Vero E6 cells (1.2 x 106 cells/well, 6-well format, triplicates) for two

332

additional passages (P5). Venus- and mCherry-expressing plaques (~50 counted

333

plaques per viral passage) were evaluated by immunostaining and fluorescent protein

334

expression. Viral plaques were imaged under a fluorescence microscope (EVOS M5000

Results

353

Generation of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes

354

The pBeloBAC11 plasmid encoding the full-length viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 was

355

previously described (19). To generate the reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2, the 7a

356

open reading frame (ORF) was substituted with Venus, mCherry, or Nluc gene in the

357

pBeloBAC11 plasmid encoding the remaining viral genome to produce pBeloBAC11-

358

SARS-CoV-2-del7a/Venus, -del7a/mCherry, or -del7a/Nluc plasmids for viral rescues.

359

We then used our previously described BAC-based reverse genetics approach to

360

rescue rSARS-CoV-2-Venus, -mCherry, and -Nluc (Figure 1A).

361

We confirmed the rescue of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing -Venus, -mCherry, or -Nluc

362

reporter genes by RT-PCR using total RNA from mock-, rSARS-CoV-2/WT- or rSARS-

363

CoV-2 reporter virus-infected cells using primers specific for the viral NP, the ORF7a

364

region, or the individual reporter genes (Figure 1B). As expected, primers specific for

365

SARS-CoV-2 NP amplified a band of ~1260 bp from the RNA extracted from rSARS-

366

CoV-2-infected but not mock-infected cells (Figure 1B). Amplified bands using primers

367

in the ORF7a region resulted in the expected ~566 bp in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-

368

2/WT and ~ 920, 911, and 815 bp in the case of cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2-

369

Venus, -mCherry and -Nluc, respectively, based on the different size of the reporter

370

genes (Figure 1B). Primers specific for the reporter genes only results in the RT-PCR

371

amplification of bands from cells infected with the respective reporter-expressing

372

rSARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1B). These results demonstrate that substitution of the viral

373

ORF7a for Venus, mCherry, or Nluc genes results in the successful recovery of rSARS-

374

CoV-2 containing these reporter genes.

375

Characterization of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes

376

Next, we characterize the reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 by evaluating the

377

expression levels of Venus, mCherry, or Nluc in cell cultures, and compared them to

378

those of cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Figure 2). The rSARS-CoV-2 expressing

379

Venus and mCherry were directly visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Figure

380

2A). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a MAb against SARS-CoV NP was

381

used to detect rSARS-CoV-2/WT infection (Figure 2A). As expected, Venus or mCherry

382

expression were only observed in Vero E6 cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2 expressing

383

Venus or mCherry, respectively, but not in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Figure

384

2A). Importantly, only cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2-Venus or rSARS-CoV-2-

385

mCherry were detected using green or red filters, respectively (data not shown). As

386

expected, the viral NP was detected in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2-WT, -Venus, or

387

-mCherry (Figure 2A). Expression of Nluc in rSARS-CoV-2-Nluc-infected cells was

388

evaluated from tissue culture supernatants at 48 h post-infection (Figure 2B). High

389

levels of Nluc expression were detected in culture supernatants of cells infected with

17

390

rSARS-CoV-2-Nluc but not from mock or rSARS-CoV-2/WT infected cells (Figure 2B).

391

These results demonstrate that Vero E6 cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2-Venus, -

392

mCherry, or -Nluc expresses the corresponding reporter genes and that viral infections

393

can be detected by fluorescence (rSARS-CoV-2-Venus or -mCherry) or luciferase

394

(rSARS-CoV-2-Nluc) without the need of antibodies that were required for the detection

395

of rSARS-CoV-2/WT.

396

We next evaluated reporter protein expression levels by Western blot assay using

397

cell lysates from either mock, rSARS-CoV-2-WT, or rSARS-CoV-2-Venus, -mCherry, or

398

-Nluc infected cells using MAbs against the viral NP, the reporter genes, or actin as a

399

loading control (Figure 2C). As expected, reporter gene expression was detected in cell

400

lysates of cells infected with the respective reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 but not

401

from mock or rSARS-CoV-2-WT infected cells. Viral NP expression was detected in cell

402

lysates from all virus-infected cells, but not mock-infected cells (Figure 2C).

403

Next, we assessed reporter gene expression over a period of 96 h in cells that were

404

mock-infected (data not shown) or cells infected with WT or reporter-expressing rSARS-

405

CoV-2 (Figure 3). Venus and mCherry expression levels were determined using

406

fluorescence microscope (Figure 3A), while Nluc activity in tissue culture supernatants

407

from infected cells was detected using a luminometer (Figure 3B). Venus and mCherry

408

expression were detected as early as 24 h post-infection and fluorescent protein

409

expression increased over time until 96 h post-infection where a decrease in

410

fluorescence was observed because of CPE caused by viral infection (brightfield, BF)

411

(Figure 3A). Similar CPE, but not fluorescent expression, was also observed in cells

412

infected with rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Figure 3A). Levels of Nluc expression were also

413

detected as early as 24 h post-infection and increase in a time-dependent matter

414

(Figure 3B).

415

To assess whether deletion of 7a ORF and insertion of reporter genes compromised

416

viral fitness in cultured cells, we compared growth kinetics of reporter-expressing

417

rSARS-CoV-2 to those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Figure 3C). We found all the reporter-

418

expressing rSARS-CoV-2 exhibited similar growth kinetics and peak viral titers of

419

infection to that of rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Figure 3C), suggesting that deletion of the 7a

420

ORF and insertion of the reporter genes did not significantly affect viral fitness, at least

421

in cultured cells. These results also support previous findings with SARS-CoV where

422

deletion of the 7a ORF and insertion of reporter genes did not impact viral fitness in vitro

423

(28, 29). These results were further confirmed when we evaluate the plaque phenotype

424

of the rSARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent reporter genes and compared them to

425

those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Figure 3D). Similar plaque sizes were observed in Vero E6

426

cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2/WT and rSARS-CoV-2 expressing Venus or mCherry

427

(Figure 3D). Notably, Venus-positive or mCherry-positive plaques were only detected in

428

cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2-Venus or -mCherry, respectively, and not in rSARS-

429

CoV-2/WT infected cells (Figure 3D). Importantly, fluorescent plaques overlapped with

430

those detected by immunostaining using the SARS-CoV NP 1C7 MAb. Similar to the

431

growth kinetics data, we found no significant differences in the plaque size of reporter-

432

expressing rSARS-CoV-2 compared to rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Figure 3D).

A reporter-based microneutralization assay for the identification of antivirals

434

To determine the feasibility of using our reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 for the

435

identification of antivirals, we evaluated the ability of Remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2

19

436

in reporter-based microneutralization assays (Figure 4). Remdesivir has been

437

previously described to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and is the only FDA-approved

438

antiviral for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (3, 21, 30). The EC50 of Remdesivir against

439

rSARS-CoV-2-Venus (Figure 4A, 1.07 µM), -mCherry (Figure 4B, 1.78 µM), or Nluc

440

(Figure 4C, 1.79 µM) were similar to those obtained with rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Figure 4D,

441

1.51 µM) and values previously reported in the literature (21). This demonstrates the

442

feasibility of using these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 and the reporter-based

443

assay to easily identify compounds with antiviral activity based on fluorescent or

444

luciferase expression and without the need of MAbs to detect the presence of the virus

445

in infected cells.

446
447

A reporter-based microneutralization assay for the identification of NAbs

448

We next evaluate the feasibility of using our reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV in a

449

reporter-based microneutralization assay to identify NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. As

450

proof of concept, we used a human MAb (1212C2) which we have recently described to

451

potently bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vitro and in vivo (27). The

452

NT50 of 1212C2 against rSARS-CoV-2-Venus (Figure 5A, 1.94 ng), -mCherry (Figure

453

5B, 5.02 ng), or Nluc (Figure 5C, 3.67 ng) were similar to those observed with rSARS-

454

CoV-2/WT (Figure 5D, 4.88 ng), and recently reported values (27).

455

Genetic stability of rSARS-CoV-2 in vitro

456

The genetic stability of reporter-expressing recombinant viruses is important to

457

demonstrate their viability in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. To evaluate the ability of our

458

rSARS-CoV-2 to maintain fluorescent reporter gene expression, viruses were

459

consecutively passaged in Vero E6 cells and Venus and mCherry expression were

460

determined by plaque assay using fluorescent microscopy (Figure 6A). To that end, we

461

evaluated fluorescent expression of over 40 plaques before immunostaining with an

462

anti-SARS-CoV NP MAb 1C7. We found the Venus and mCherry fluorescent

463

expression from our rSARS-CoV-2 was genetically stable with nearly 100% of the

464

plaques analyzed under a fluorescent microscope (Figure 6A). We also evaluated the

465

complete genome sequences of the reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 used in our

466

studies (P3) with those of additional passages (P4 and P5) using next generation

467

sequencing (Figure 6B). In the case of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus (Figure 6B, top), few

468

variants were found at low frequencies after two additional passages (P5), indicating no

469

significant changes and/or deletions in the viral genome. However, for rSARS-CoV-

470

2/mCherry (Figure 6B, middle), variants containing a mutation at position 21,784 in the

471

S gene was found in our viral stock (P3) and the frequency of this mutation increased

472

after additional passages (P4 and P5). Two additional mutations at positions 23,525 and

473

24,134 (bot in the S gene) were also found at P5. In the case of rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc

474

(Figure 6B, bottom) a mutation at position 24,755 (S gene) was found in our viral stock

475

(P3). Frequency of this mutation increased up to 100% after 2 additional passage (P5).

476

Other, less abundant, mutations at positions 13,419 (nsp12, RNA dependent RNA

477

polymerase), 23,525 (S gene), and 26,256 (envelop, E, gene) were also found after the

478

additional 2 passages (P5) (Figure 6B, bottom). It is possible that these mutations are

479

most likely due to viral adaptation to Vero E6 cells but since different mutations were

480

found in the three reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2, it is also possible that these

481

mutations are related to the nature of the reporter gene. In any case, these results

Discussion

495

Reporter-expressing viruses represent a powerful tool for both basic research and

496

translational studies (14, 15, 31-34). Several research groups, including ours, have

497

previously described recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes to easily study the

498

biology of viral infections, to evaluate the efficacy of antivirals or NAbs, and for in vivo

499

studies in validated animal models (35-49).

500

Both fluorescent and luciferase proteins have been used to generate reporter-

501

expressing viruses. However, the innate and differing properties of reporter genes

502

dictate which one might be inserted into a recombinant virus. While fluorescent proteins

503

provide an efficient way to track viral infections using microscopy, luciferase proteins

504

are more readily quantifiable and therefore more amenable to HTS studies (14, 15, 50).

22

505

For this reason, in this study we generated rSARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent

506

(Venus and mCherry) or luciferase (Nluc) proteins (Figure 1). These reporter genes

507

were selected based on either their distinctive fluorescent properties (Venus and

508

mCherry) or because of their small size, stability, high bioluminescence activity, and

509

ATP-independency (Nluc) (51).

510

Although reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 similar to those reported here have

511

been recently described (16-18), this is the first report of a replicating competent

512

rSARS-CoV-2 expressing mCherry. Recombinant viruses expressing a red fluorescent

513

protein represent an advantage over those expressing GFP or mNeonGreen (16-18) in

514

that many genetically modified cell lines and/or animals express green fluorescent

515

proteins. Another limitation of green fluorescent proteins during in vivo imaging is the

516

absorption of the fluorophores’ excitation and emission by hemoglobin and

517

autofluorescence of tissues (52-55). Recombinant viruses expressing red fluorescent

518

proteins represent a better option to combine with genetically modified GFP-expressing

519

cell lines and/or animals and, based on their reduced autofluorescence background, to

520

more accurately capture the dynamics of viral infection and replication.

521

Reporter-expressing replicating competent viruses can be used to monitor viral

522

infections, assess viral fitness, evaluate and/or identify antivirals and/or NAbs, where

523

reporter gene expression can be used as a valid surrogate for viral detection in infected

524

cells. Expression of Venus, mCherry, or Nluc from our rSARS-CoV-2 were confirmed

525

by directly visualizing fluorescence expression under a fluorescent microscope (Venus

526

and mCherry) or luciferase activity (Nluc) using a microplate reader (Figures 2 and 3).

527

Western blot analyses using specific antibodies against each of the reporter genes

528

further confirm expression from their respective rSARS-CoV-2 (Figures 2 and 3).

529

Notably, despite deletion of the 7a ORF and insertion of a reporter gene, the three

530

reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 displayed similar growth kinetics and plaque

531

phenotype than their WT counterpart (Figure 3). As expected, viral infection was

532

visualized in real time, without the need of secondary approaches (e.g. MAbs) to detect

533

the presence of the virus in infected cells. Overall, reporter gene expression displayed

534

similar kinetics that correlated with levels of viral replication, further demonstrating the

535

feasibility of using these reporter genes as a valid surrogate of assess viral infection.

536

Therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections is currently limited to the use of

537

Remdesivir (3), and despite significant global efforts, there is no preventative vaccine

538

for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Notably, there is a possibility, similar to the

539

situation with other respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza), of the emergence of drug-

540

resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants that will impose a significant challenge to the currently

541

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (56). Thus, it is imperative to not only discover new

542

antivirals and other therapeutic approaches but also prophylactics for the treatment of

543

SARS-CoV-2 infections. To that end, rapid and sensitive screening assays to identify

544

compounds with antiviral activity or to assess efficacy of vaccine candidates for the

545

therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections, respectively, are

546

urgently needed. In this study, we demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2

547

represent an excellent option for the rapid identification and characterization of both

548

antivirals (Figure 4) and NAbs (Figure 5) for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic

549

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Importantly, EC50 (antivirals) and NT50 (NAbs)

550

obtained with our reporter-expressing viruses were comparable to those obtained using

rSARS-CoV-2/WT or described by others in the literature (17, 21, 27), demonstrating

552

the feasibility of using our reporter-based microneutralization assays for the rapid

553

identification of antivirals or NAbs (Figures 4 and 5, respectively). Furthermore, our

554

results indicate that reporter-expressing Venus, mCherry, and Nluc rSARS-CoV-2 are

555

stable up to 5 passages in vitro in Vero E6 cells, including expression of the reporter

556

gene (Figure 6). To date, we have not yet conducted studies to evaluate the feasibility

557

of using these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 in vivo. It is possible, and similar to

558

other respiratory viruses, that rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes could also be

559

used to study the biology of viral infections in validated animals of viral infection.

560

Our SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics based on the use of BAC have allowed us to

561

rescue rSARS-CoV-2/WT (19) and rSARS-CoV-2 stably expressing reporter genes. In

562

the case of our reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2, we removed the 7a ORF and

563

substituted it for various reporter genes without a significant impact in viral replication.

564

The feasibility of removing viral genes and insert reporter genes demonstrate the

565

genetic plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and open the possibility of generating

566

recombinant viruses expressing other genes of interest for the development of SARS-

567

CoV-2 vaccines that could be used for the control of the currently ongoing COVID-19

568

pandemic.

649

cells were infected with ~25 PFU of WT (left), Venus (middle), and mCherry (right)

650

expressing rSARS-CoV-2. At 72 h post-infection, plaques were observed under a

651

fluorescent microscope to detect Venus or mCherry expression. In the case of rSARS-

652

CoV-2/WT infected cells, images correspond to fluorescent filters to detect Venus (left)

653

or mCherry (right) expression. Thereafter, viral plaques were detected using the 1C7

654

655

percentage of viral plaques expressing fluorescent proteins (Venus or mCherry).
