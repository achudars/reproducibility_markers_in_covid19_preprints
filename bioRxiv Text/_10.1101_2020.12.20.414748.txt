ABSTRACT

49

The continual emergence of novel coronavirus (CoV) strains, like SARS-CoV-2, highlights the

50

critical need for broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines against this family of viruses.

51

Coronavirus spike (S) proteins share common structural motifs that could be vulnerable to

52

cross-reactive antibody responses. To study this phenomenon in human coronavirus infection,

53

we applied a high-throughput sequencing method called LIBRA-seq (Linking B cell receptor to

54

antigen specificity through sequencing) to a SARS-CoV-1 convalescent donor sample. We

55

identified and characterized a panel of six monoclonal antibodies that cross-reacted with S

56

proteins from the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated a

57

spectrum of reactivity against other coronaviruses. Epitope mapping revealed that these

58

antibodies recognized multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S, including the receptor binding

59

domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and S2 subunit. Functional characterization

60

demonstrated that the antibodies mediated a variety of Fc effector functions in vitro and

61

mitigated pathological burden in vivo. The identification of cross-reactive epitopes recognized by

62

functional antibodies expands the repertoire of targets for pan-coronavirus vaccine design

63

strategies that may be useful for preventing potential future coronavirus outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION

65

The emergence of a novel coronavirus (CoV) SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19,

66

has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, threatening the lives of billions and imposing an

67

immense burden on healthcare systems and the global economy. SARS-CoV-2, the seventh

68

coronavirus known to infect humans, is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus which includes

69

the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, as well as endemic variants OC43-CoV

70

and HKU1-CoV1. Recent coronavirus outbreaks and the threat of future emerging zoonotic

71

strains highlight the need for broadly applicable coronavirus therapeutic interventions and

72

vaccine design approaches2.

73

Coronaviruses utilize the homotrimeric Spike (S) protein to engage with cell-surface receptors

74

and enter host cells. S consists of two functional subunits: S1 and S2. S1 facilitates attachment

75

to target cells and is composed of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding

76

domain (RBD), whereas S2, which encodes the fusion peptide and heptad repeats, promotes

77

viral fusion3,4. To facilitate cell entry, human coronaviruses employ different host factors;

78

however, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 both utilize the cell-surface receptor, angiotensin

79

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)5. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 S shares 76% amino acid identity with

80

SARS-CoV-1 S1. Furthermore, S serves as a dominant antibody target and is a focus of

81

countermeasure development for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection6,7. S

82

proteins from the Betacoronavirus genus share multiple regions of structural homology and thus

83

could serve as targets for a cross-reactive antibody response8. Identifying cross-reactive

84

antibody epitopes can inform rational design strategies for vaccines and therapies that target

85

multiple highly pathogenic coronaviruses, which will be of value both for the current and

86

potential future outbreaks.

87

Numerous potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, including

88

multiple candidates currently in clinical trials for prophylactic and acute treatment of COVID-199–

89

13.

90

cross-reactive antibodies has focused primarily on the RBD epitope. This has resulted in the

91

identification of a number of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV-1 cross-reactive antibody

92

candidates12,14,15. However, the diversity of epitopes and functions beyond virus neutralization

93

have not been extensively explored for cross-reactive antibodies16–18. Evidence of Fc effector

94

function contributing to protection in vivo against SARS-CoV-119 and SARS-CoV-220 suggests

95

that the role of antibodies beyond neutralization (“extra-neutralization” functions) may be a

With the goal of achieving cross-neutralization, investigation of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV-1

96

crucial component of protection and an important consideration in vaccine design strategies for

97

coronaviruses17,21–23. Defining the genetic features, epitope targets, and Fc effector functions of

98

cross-reactive antibodies can provide insights into current therapeutic strategies and may

99

provide alternative approaches for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection.

100

In this study, we investigated antibody cross-reactivity across the Betacoronavirus genus at

101

monoclonal resolution. To do this, we applied LIBRA-seq (Linking B Cell receptor to antigen

102

specificity through sequencing), a recently developed high-throughput antibody screening

103

technology that allows for determination of B cell receptor sequence and antigen reactivity

104

simultaneously for many single B cells24. From a convalescent SARS-CoV-1 donor sample, we

105

identified and characterized SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV-1 cross-reactive human antibodies that

106

target multiple, distinct structural domains of S, mediate Fc effector functions, and mitigate

107

pathological burden in vivo. A better understanding of the epitope specificities and functional

108

characteristics of cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies may translate into strategies for current

109

vaccine design efforts and additional measures to counteract potential future pandemic strains.

RESULTS

111

LIBRA-seq Applied to a SARS-CoV-1 Convalescent Donor

112

To identify cross-reactive antibodies to multiple coronavirus antigens, LIBRA-seq was applied to

113

a PBMC sample from a donor previously infected with SARS-CoV-1 over ten years prior to

114

sample collection. The antigen screening library consisted of eight oligo-tagged recombinant

115

soluble antigens: six coronavirus trimer antigens (SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV-1 S, MERS-CoV

116

S, MERS-CoV S1 (with foldon domain), OC43-CoV S, HKU1-CoV S) and two HIV trimer

117

antigens from strains ZM197 and CZA97 as negative controls (Figure 1A). After the antigen

118

screening library was mixed with donor PBMCs, antigen positive B cells were enriched by

119

fluorescence activated cell sorting and processed for single-cell sequencing (Supplemental

120

Figure 1A). After bioinformatic processing, we recovered 2625 cells with paired heavy/light

121

chain sequences and antigen reactivity information (Supplemental Figure 1B). Overall, LIBRA-

122

seq enabled rapid screening of PBMCs from a patient sample, with recovery of paired

123

heavy/light chain sequences and antigen reactivity for thousands of single B cells.

124
125

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 Cross-reactive Antibodies

126

With a goal of identifying antibodies that were cross-reactive to multiple coronavirus S proteins,

127

we prioritized lead candidates based on their sequence features and LIBRA-seq scores. We

128

selected 15 antibody candidates that exhibited diverse sequence features and utilized a number

129

of different variable genes for expression and characterization (Figure 1B, Supplemental

130

Figure 1C). These antibodies displayed a broad range of somatic hypermutation levels (83-

131

98%) and a variety of CDRH3 and CDRL3 lengths (6-24 and 5-12 amino acids, respectively)

132

(Supplemental Figure 1C). Antibodies 46472-1, 46472-2, 46472-3, 46472-4, 46472-6, and

133

46472-12 showed binding to SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S by ELISA (Figure 1C-D,

134

Supplemental Figure 1D). Further, antibodies 46472-6 and 46472-12 bound to S proteins from

135

endemic OC43-CoV and HKU1-CoV, albeit generally at lower levels (Figure 1C-D,

136

Supplemental Figure 1D). Although the six monoclonal antibodies showed reactivity by ELISA

137

to the MERS antigen probe used in the LIBRA-seq screening library, antibody binding to other

138

independent preparations of this protein was inconsistent, so we could not definitively confirm

139

MERS S reactivity. Overall, the application of the LIBRA-seq technology enabled the

140

identification of a panel of cross-reactive antibodies that recognize the S antigen from multiple

141

coronaviruses.

142
143

Cross-reactive Coronavirus Antibodies Target Diverse Epitopes on S

144

To elucidate the epitopes targeted by the cross-reactive antibodies, we performed binding

145

assays to various structural domains of S as well as binding-competition experiments. First, we

146

assessed antibody binding to the S1 and S2 subdomains of SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies 46472-1,

147

46472-2, 46472-3, and 46472-4 bound to the S2 domain, whereas 46472-6 and 46472-12

148

recognized the S1 domain but targeted different epitopes, the NTD and RBD, respectively

149

(Figure 2A-C, Supplemental Figure 2A-B). Although 46472-12 bound to the RBD, it did not

150

compete with ACE2 for binding to SARS-CoV-2 S (Supplemental Figure 2C). To determine

151

whether the antibodies targeted overlapping or distinct epitopes, we performed competition

152

ELISA experiments and found that the S2-directed antibodies 46472-1, 46472-2, and 46472-4

153

competed for binding to S (Figure 2D). This pattern was observed for both SARS-CoV-2 and

154

SARS-CoV-1 S. Of note, this competition group did not include S2-directed antibody 46472-3,

155

revealing the identification of multiple cross-reactive epitope targets on S2 (Figure 2D). Further,

156

binding assays with glycan knockout mutants and mannose competition experiments revealed

157

no notable glycan dependence for antibody reactivity to S (Supplemental Figure 2D-E). Lastly,

158

we measured antibody autoreactivity, and found that with the exception of 46472-6 binding to

159

Jo-1, none of the antibodies showed autoreactivity against the tested antigens (Figure 2E).

160

Together, these data suggest that these cross-reactive antibodies are coronavirus-specific and

161

target multiple, diverse epitopes on the S protein (Figure 2F).

162
163

Functional Characterization of Cross-reactive Coronavirus Antibodies

164

Next, we characterized our cross-reactive antibody panel for functional activity. Although none

165

of the antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 (Supplemental Figure 3A-B), all six

166

antibodies demonstrated a range of Fc effector functions. Notably, all antibodies showed

167

antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) in vitro for SARS-CoV-2 S (Figure 3A). In

168

particular, antibody 46472-12 which targets RBD showed greater ADCP activity compared to

169

the other cross-reactive antibodies and the SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 cross reactive RBD

170

antibody control, CR302225 (Figure 3A, Supplemental Figure 3C). Further, we tested and

171

confirmed ADCP activity against SARS-CoV-1 for two antibodies, 46472-4 and 46472-12,

172

illustrating that these antibodies can mediate antiviral function against multiple coronaviruses

173

(Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure 3D). In a coated SARS-CoV-2 S assay (see Methods), the

174

cross-reactive antibodies also mediated trogocytosis, an Fc-mediated immune function defined

175

by the removal of cell membrane proteins from S-coated and opsonized cells to effector cells,

176

which results in rapid cell death and antigen transfer26 (Figure 3C, Supplemental Figure 3E).

177

Interestingly, only the S2-targeting antibodies in our panel (46472-1, 46472-2, 46472-3, and

178

46472-4) mediated trogocytosis for cell-surface expressed SARS-CoV-2 S (Figure 3D,

179

Supplemental Figure 3F). Lastly, none of the antibodies promoted complement deposition

180

(ADCD) (Figure 3E, Supplemental Figure 3G). Together, these results revealed that although

181

this cross-reactive antibody panel is non-neutralizing, the six antibodies are capable of

182

mediating a spectrum of Fc effector functions.

183
184

Since non-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with Fc effector function activity have not been

185

extensively characterized in vivo, these results prompted us to test antibodies 46472-4 and

186

46472-12 for prophylaxis in a murine infection model using a mouse-adapted virus strain

187

(SARS-CoV-2 MA)27,28(Figure 4A). Although there were no differences in survival and viral load

188

between experimental and control groups, the hemorrhage scores (see Methods) for 46472-4

189

and 46472-12 were similar to positive control CR3022, and all three groups were lower than the

190

scores for isotype control 2D22 (p<0.01, ordinary one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons),

191

suggesting a reduction in pathological burden (Figure 4B, Supplemental Figure 4A-B). To

192

evaluate the in vivo effect of these antibodies in a more stringent challenge model in 12-month

193

old BALB/c mice, we increased the viral dose from 1x103 to 1x104 PFU. In this experiment, mice

194

that received antibody 46472-12 exhibited the best survival rate (4/5 at day 4), compared to all

195

other treatment groups (including CR3022 as a positive control and DENV-2D22 as a negative

196

control), although statistical significance was not achieved (Figure 4C, Supplemental Figure

197

4C). There were no significant differences in viral load between groups; however, the surviving

198

animals from the 46472-4 and 46472-12 groups showed lower hemorrhagic pathology scores in

199

harvested mouse lungs compared to the negative control treatment group (p<0.001, ordinary

200

one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons) (Figure 4D, Supplemental Figure 4D). Notably,

201

animals treated with the positive control, CR3022, had higher hemorrhage scores than animals

202

treated with 46472-4 and 46472-12 (p<0.001, ordinary one-way ANOVA with multiple

203

comparisons), although the statistical analysis may be limited by the small numbers of surviving

204

animals for some of the groups (Figure 4D). Together, the in vivo experiments suggest these

205

cross-reactive antibodies could contribute to counteracting coronavirus infection in prophylaxis.

206
207

DISCUSSION

208

Here, we described a set of cross-reactive Betacoronavirus antibodies isolated from a

209

convalescent SARS-CoV-1 donor. The antibodies targeted diverse epitopes on S, including the

210

S2 subdomain as well as the RBD and NTD on S1, and were shown to be functional in vitro.

211

Additionally, two of these antibodies were tested and demonstrated activity in vivo, displaying a

212

reduction in lung hemorrhage score, while effects on viral load were not definitive. Although the

213

precise in vivo effects of these antibodies have not been elucidated, the Fc effector function

214

profiles in the absence of neutralization points to a potential role for extra-neutralization activity

215

in the reduction of pathological burden. Evidence of protection associated with Fc effector

216

function in SARS-CoV-119, SARS-CoV-220,21 (also described in Atyeo et al. 2020, available at

217

SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3612156), and other infectious diseases including influenza,

218

Ebola, and HIV, motivates further investigation into its contribution for the treatment of COVID-

219

1929–32.

220
221

Given the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the potential for future zoonotic coronavirus

222

pathogens to emerge, coronavirus vaccine and therapeutic development is of paramount

223

importance33–36. Antibodies that can cross-react with multiple coronavirus variants are primary

224

targets as potential broadly reactive therapies. Such antibodies can further reveal cross-reactive

225

epitopes that will serve as templates for the development of broadly protective vaccines.

226

Understanding the spectrum of cross-reactive epitopes targeted by human antibodies, as well

227

as the functional role that such antibodies have in preventing and treating coronavirus infection,

228

are therefore critical for medical countermeasure development. In particular, the identification of

229

functional cross-reactive antibodies that target diverse epitopes on S will present a viable

230

avenue for pan-coronavirus vaccine design strategies.

a C-terminal monomeric human IgG Fc-tag and an 8x HisTag (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1) were

309

transiently transfected into FreeStyle293F cells (Thermo Fisher) using polyethylenimine. The

310

coronavirus trimer spike antigens were in a prefusion-stabilized (S-2P) conformation that better

311

represents neutralization-sensitive epitopes in comparison to their wild-type forms37. Two hours

312

post-transfection, cells were treated with kifunensine to ensure uniform glycosylation.

313

Transfected supernatants were harvested after 6 days of expression. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1

324

polyethylenimine transfection reagent and cultured. FreeStyle F17 expression medium

325

supplemented with pluronic acid and glutamine was used. The cells were cultured at 37°C with

326

8% CO2 saturation and shaking. After 5-7 days, cultures were centrifuged and supernatant was

327

filtered and run over an affinity column of agarose bound Galanthus nivalis lectin. The column

328

was washed with PBS and antigens were eluted with 30 mL of 1M methyl-a-D-

329

mannopyranoside. Protein elutions were buffer exchanged into PBS, concentrated, and run on a

330

Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL Sizing column on the AKTA FPLC system. Fractions

331

corresponding to correctly folded protein were collected, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and

332

antigenicity was characterized by ELISA using known monoclonal antibodies specific to each

333

antigen. Avitagged antigens were biotinylated using BirA biotin ligase (Avidity LLC).

334
335

For binding studies, SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro S, SARS-CoV-1 S, SARS-CoV-2 RBD, SARS-CoV-

336

1 RBD, and MERS-CoV RBD constructs were expressed in the transient expression system

337

previously mentioned. S proteins were purified using StrepTrap HP columns and RBD

338

constructs were purified over protein A resin, respectively. Each resulting protein was further

339

purified to homogeneity by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column.

340
341

SARS-CoV-2 S1, SARS-CoV-2 S1 D614G, SARS-CoV-2 S2, and SARS-CoV-2 NTD truncated

342

proteins were purchased from the commercial vendor, Sino Biological.

(SARS-CoV-2 S), TGACCTTCCTCTCCT (SARS-CoV-1 S), ACAATTTGTCTGCGA (MERS-

351

CoV S), TCCTTTCCTGATAGG (MERS-CoV S1), CAGGTCCCTTATTTC (HKU1-CoV S),

352

TAACTCAGGGCCTAT (OC43-CoV S), CAGCCCACTGCAATA (CZA97), and

353

ATCGTCGAGAGCTAG (ZM197). Oligos were ordered from IDT with a 5’ amino modification

354

and HPLC purified.

355
356

For each antigen, a unique DNA barcode was directly conjugated to the antigen itself. In

357

particular, 5’amino-oligonucleotides were conjugated directly to each antigen using the Solulink

358

Protein-Oligonucleotide Conjugation Kit (TriLink cat no. S-9011) according to manufacturer’s

359

instructions. Briefly, the oligo and protein were desalted, and then the amino-oligo was modified

360

with the 4FB crosslinker, and the biotinylated antigen protein was modified with S-HyNic. Then,

361

the 4FB-oligo and the HyNic-antigen were mixed together. This causes a stable bond to form

362

between the protein and the oligonucleotide. The concentration of the antigen-oligo conjugates

363

was determined by a BCA assay, and the HyNic molar substitution ratio of the antigen-oligo

364

conjugates was analyzed using the NanoDrop according to the Solulink protocol guidelines.

365

AKTA FPLC was used to remove excess oligonucleotide from the protein-oligo conjugates,

366

which were also verified using SDS-PAGE with a silver stain. Antigen-oligo conjugates were

367

also used in flow cytometry titration experiments.

368
369

Antigen specific B cell sorting

370

Cells were stained and mixed with DNA-barcoded antigens and other antibodies, and then

371

sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). First, cells were counted and viability

372

was assessed using Trypan Blue. Then, cells were washed three times with DPBS

373

supplemented with 0.1% Bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were resuspended in DPBS-BSA

374

and stained with cell markers including viability dye (Ghost Red 780), CD14-APC-Cy7, CD3-

375

FITC, CD19-BV711, and IgG-PE-Cy5. Additionally, antigen-oligo conjugates were added to the

376

stain. After staining in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature, cells were washed three

377

times with DPBS-BSA at 300 g for five minutes. Cells were then incubated for 15 minutes at

378

room temperature with Streptavidin-PE to label cells with bound antigen. Cells were washed

379

three times with DPBS-BSA, resuspended in DPBS, and sorted by FACS. Antigen positive cells

380

were bulk sorted and delivered to the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics

381

(VANTAGE) sequencing core at an appropriate target concentration for 10X Genomics library

382

preparation and subsequent sequencing. FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo.

383
384

Sample preparation, library preparation, and sequencing

385

Single-cell suspensions were loaded onto the Chromium Controller microfluidics device (10X

386

Genomics) and processed using the B-cell Single Cell V(D)J solution according to

387

manufacturer’s suggestions for a target capture of 10,000 B cells per 1/8 10X cassette, with

388

minor modifications in order to intercept, amplify and purify the antigen barcode libraries as

389

previously described24.

390
391

Sequence processing and bioinformatic analysis

392

We utilized and modified our previously described pipeline to use paired-end FASTQ files of

393

oligo libraries as input, process and annotate reads for cell barcode, UMI, and antigen barcode,

394

and generate a cell barcode - antigen barcode UMI count matrix24. BCR contigs were processed

395

using Cell Ranger (10X Genomics) using GRCh38 as reference. Antigen barcode libraries were

396

also processed using Cell Ranger (10X Genomics). The overlapping cell barcodes between the

397

two libraries were used as the basis of the subsequent analysis. We removed cell barcodes that

398

had only non-functional heavy chain sequences as well as cells with multiple functional heavy

399

chain sequences and/or multiple functional light chain sequences, reasoning that these may be

400

multiplets. Additionally, we aligned the BCR contigs (filtered_contigs.fasta file output by Cell

401

Ranger, 10X Genomics) to IMGT reference genes using HighV-Quest38. The output of HighV16

402

Quest was parsed using ChangeO39 and merged with an antigen barcode UMI count matrix.

403

Finally, we determined the LIBRA-seq score for each antigen in the library for every cell as

404

previously described24.

406

Antibody Expression and Purification

407

For each antibody, variable genes were inserted into custom plasmids encoding the constant

408

region for the IgG1 heavy chain as well as respective lambda and kappa light chains (pTwist

409

CMV BetaGlobin WPRE Neo vector, Twist Bioscience). Antibodies were expressed in Expi293F

410

mammalian cells (ThermoFisher) by co-transfecting heavy chain and light chain expressing

411

plasmids using polyethylenimine transfection reagent and cultured for 5-7 days. Cells were

412

maintained in FreeStyle F17 expression medium supplemented at final concentrations of 0.1%

413

Pluronic Acid F-68 and 20% 4mM L-Glutamine. These cells were cultured at 37°C with 8% CO2

414

saturation and shaking. After transfection and 5-7 days of culture, cell cultures were centrifuged

415

and supernatant was 0.45 μm filtered with Nalgene Rapid Flow Disposable Filter Units with PES

416

membrane. Filtered supernatant was run over a column containing Protein A agarose resin

417

equilibrated with PBS. The column was washed with PBS, and then antibodies were eluted with

418

100 mM Glycine HCl at 2.7 pH directly into a 1:10 volume of 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Eluted

419

antibodies were buffer exchanged into PBS 3 times using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units

420

and concentrated. Antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Additionally, antibodies 46472-1,

421

46472-2, 46472-3, 46472-4, 46472-6 and 46472-12 were assessed by size exclusion

422

chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL Sizing column with the AKTA FPLC

423

system.

(~1 ml per antibody) of CHO cell cultures using the Gibco ExpiCHO Expression System and a

429

protocol for deep 96-well blocks (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In brief, synthesized antibody-

430

encoding DNA (~2 μg per transfection) was added to OptiPro serum free medium (OptiPro

431

SFM), incubated with ExpiFectamine CHO Reagent and added to 800 µl of ExpiCHO cell

432

cultures into 96-deep-well blocks using a ViaFlo 384 liquid handler (Integra Biosciences). The

433

plates were incubated on an orbital shaker at 1,000 r.p.m. with an orbital diameter of 3 mm at

434

37 °C in 8% CO2. The next day after transfection, ExpiFectamine CHO Enhancer and ExpiCHO

435

Feed reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to the cells, followed by 4 d incubation for

436

a total of 5 d at 37 °C in 8% CO2. Culture supernatants were collected after centrifuging the

437

blocks at 450g for 5 min and were stored at 4°C until use. For high-throughput microscale

438

antibody purification, fritted deep-well plates were used containing 25 μl of settled protein G

439

resin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) per well. Clarified culture supernatants were incubated with

440

protein G resin for mAb capturing, washed with PBS using a 96-well plate manifold base

441

(Qiagen) connected to the vacuum and eluted into 96-well PCR plates using 86 μl of 0.1 M

442

glycine-HCL buffer pH 2.7. After neutralization with 14 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, purified mAbs

443

were buffer-exchanged into PBS using Zeba Spin Desalting Plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

444

and stored at 4°C until use.

454

dilution in 1% milk in PBS-T to the plates, which were incubated for one hour at room

455

temperature. Goat anti-mouse secondary was used for SARS-CoV-1 specific control antibody

456

240CD (BEI Resources). Plates were washed three times with PBS-T and then developed by

457

adding TMB substrate to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for ten

458

minutes, and then 1N sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction. Plates were read at 450 nm.

459

Data are represented as mean ± SEM for one ELISA experiment. ELISAs were repeated 2 or

460

more times. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.0.0. For

461

antibody 240CD, the following reagent was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH:

464

Competition ELISA

465

Competition ELISAs were performed as described above, with some modifications. After coating

466

with antigen and blocking, 25 μl of non-biotinylated competitor antibody was added to each well

467

at 10 μg/ml and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. Then, without washing, 75 μl biotinylated

468

antibody (final concentration of 1 μg/ml) was added and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After

469

washing three times with PBS-T, streptavidin-HRP was added at 1:10,000 dilution in 1% milk in

470

PBS-T and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed and substrate and

471

Mannose competition

485

Mannose competition ELISAs were performed as described above with minor modifications.

486

After antigen coating and washing, nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% FBS

487

diluted in PBS for 1 hour at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% FBS-PBST +/- 1M D-(+)-

488

Mannose starting at 10 μg/ml with a serial 1:5 dilution and then added to the plate for 1 hour at

489

RT. After washing, antibody binding was detected with goat anti-human IgG conjugated to

490

peroxidase and added at 1:10,000 dilution in 5% FBS in PBS-T to the plates. After 1 hour

491

incubation, plates were washed and substrate and sulfuric acid were added as described above.

RTCA Neutralization Assay

501

To assess for neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019 n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020

502

(obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a gift from N. Thornburg), we

503

used the high-throughput RTCA assay and xCelligence RTCA HT Analyzer (ACEA Biosciences)

504

that has been described previously11. After obtaining a background reading of a 384-well E-

505

plate, 6,000 Vero-furin cells40 were seeded per well. Sensograms were visualized using RTCA

506

HT software version 1.0.1 (ACEA Biosciences). One day later, equal volumes of virus were

507

added to antibody samples and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. mAbs were tested in

508

triplicate with a single (1:20) dilution. Virus–mAb mixtures were then added to Vero-furin cells in

509

384-well E-plates. Controls were included that had Vero-furin cells with virus only (no mAb) and

510

media only (no virus or mAb). E-plates were read every 8–12 h for 72 h to monitor virus

511

neutralization. At 32 h after virus-mAb mixtures were added to the E-plates, cell index values of

512

antibody samples were compared to those of virus only and media only to determine presence

513

of neutralization.

515

Nano-luciferase Neutralization Assay

516

A full-length SARS-CoV-2 virus based on the Seattle Washington isolate and a full-length

517

SARS-CoV virus based on the Urbani isolate were designed to express luciferase and was

518

recovered via reverse genetics and described previously41,42. Viruses were titered in Vero E6

519

USAMRID cells to obtain a relative light units (RLU) signal of at least 10X the cell only control

520

background. Vero E6 USAMRID cells were plated at 20,000 cells per well the day prior in clear

521

bottom black walled 96-well plates (Corning 3904). Neutralizing antibody serum samples were

522

tested at a starting dilution of 1:40 and were serially diluted 4-fold up to eight dilution spots.

523

Antibody-virus complexes were incubated at 37C with 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Following incubation,

524

growth media was removed and virus-antibody dilution complexes were added to the cells in

525

duplicate. Virus-only controls and cell-only controls were included in each neutralization assay

526

plate. Following infection, plates were incubated at 37C with 5% CO2 for 48 hours. After the 48

527

hour incubation, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured via Nano-Glo Luciferase

528

Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer specifications. SARS-CoV and SARS-

529

CoV-2 neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction in RLU

530

was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells.

SPR

533

His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 was immobilized to a NiNTA sensorchip to a level of ~150

534

RUs using a Biacore X100. Serial dilutions of purified Fab 46472-12 were evaluated for binding,

535

ranging in concentration from 1 to 0.25 μM. The resulting data were fit to a 1:1 binding model

536

using Biacore Evaluation Software.

Fc Effector function Assays

538

Antibody-dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP)

539

Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) was performed using biotinylated SARS-

540

CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 S coated fluorescent neutravidin beads as previously described43.

541

Briefly, beads were incubated for two hours with antibodies at a starting concentration of

542

50μg/ml and titrated five fold. CR3022 was used as a positive control while Palivizumab was

543

used as a negative control. Antibodies and beads were incubated with THP-1 cells overnight,

544

fixed and interrogated on the FACSAria II. Phagocytosis score was calculated as the

545

percentage of THP-1 cells that engulfed fluorescent beads multiplied by the geometric mean

546

fluorescence intensity of the population in the FITC channel less the no antibody control.

547
548

Antibody-dependent Cellular Trogocytosis (ADCT)

549

ADCT was performed as described in and modified from a previously described study26.

550

HEK293T-ACE2 expressing cells were pulsed with SARS-CoV-2 S protein (10μg/ml) for 75

551

minutes or HEK293T cells transfected with a SARS-CoV-2 spike pcDNA vector were surface

552

biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin as recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-

553

thousand cells per well were incubated with antibody for 30 minutes starting at 25μg/ml and

554

titrated 5 fold. CR3022 was used as a positive control with Palivizumab as a negative. Following

555

a RPMI media wash, these were then incubated with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester

556

(CFSE) stained THP-1 cells (5 X104 cells per well) for 1 hour and washed with 15mM

557

EDTA/PBS followed by PBS. Cells were then stained for biotin using Streptavidin-PE and read

558

on a FACSAria II. Trogocytosis score was determined as the proportion of CFSE positive THP-1

559

cells also positive for streptavidin-PE less the no antibody control.

560
561

Antibody-dependent Complement Deposition (ADCD)

562

Antibody-dependent complement deposition was performed as previously described44. Briefly

563

biotinylated SARS-Cov-2 S protein was coated 1:1 onto fluorescent neutravidin beads for 2

564

hours at 37 degrees. These beads were incubated with 100ug/ml of antibody for 1 hour and

565

incubated with guinea pig complement diluted 1 in 50 with gelatin/veronal buffer for 15 minutes

566

at 37 degrees. Beads were washed at 2000g twice in PBS and stained with guinea pig C3b-

567

FITC, fixed and interrogated on a FACSAria II. Complement deposition score was calculated as

568

the percentage of C3b-FITC positive beads multiplied by the geometric mean fluorescent

569

intensity of FITC in this population less the no antibody or heat inactivated controls.

Antibody Prophylaxis - Murine Model of Infection

572

12-month old female BALB/c mice (BALB/cAnHsd; Envigo, stock number 047) were treated with

573

200 µg mAb intraperitoneally (i.p.) 12 hours prior to virus inoculation. The next day, mice were

574

administered intranasally with 1x103 PFU or 1x104PFU of SARS-CoV-2 MA10, respectively.

575

Mice were monitored daily for weight loss, morbidity, and mortality, and after four days one lung

576

lobe was taken for pathological analysis and the other lobe was processed for qPCR and viral

577

load determination as previously described28. Gross pulmonary hemorrhage was observed at

578

time of tissue harvest and scored on a scale of 0 (no hemorrhage in any lobe, normal pink

579

healthy lung) to 4 (complete hemorrhage in all lobes of the lung, completely dark red lung).

580
581

For viral titer and hemorrhage score comparisons, an ordinary one-way ANOVA test with

582

multiple comparisons was performed using Prism software, GraphPad Prism version 8.0.

ACE2 Binding Inhibition Assay

585

Wells of 384-well microtiter plates were coated with purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-2P

586

ectoprotein at 4°C overnight. Plates were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk and 2% normal goat

587

serum in DPBS-T for 1 hr. Purified mAbs were diluted two-fold in blocking buffer starting from 10

588

μg/mL in triplicate, added to the wells (20 μL/well), and incubated at ambient temperature.

589

Recombinant human ACE2 with a C-terminal FLAG tag protein was added to wells at 2 μg/mL

590

in a 5 μL/well volume (final 0.4 μg/mL concentration of ACE2) without washing of antibody and

591

then incubated for 40 min at ambient temperature. Plates were washed, and bound ACE2 was

592

detected using HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody and TMB substrate. ACE2 binding without

593

antibody served as a control. The signal obtained for binding of the ACE2 in the presence of

594

each dilution of tested antibody was expressed as a percentage of the ACE2 binding without

595

antibody after subtracting the background signal.

597

Computational Identification of Residue-level Knockout Mutants

598

Potential cross-reactive epitopes were identified based on sequence and structural homology.

599

Reference sequences for each Coronavirus S were obtained either from NCBI for SARS-CoV-2

600

(YP_009724390.1) and MERS-CoV (YP_009047204.1) or from Uniprot for SARS-CoV-1

601

(P59594) of the spikes was then obtained using MUSCLE45 and the amino acid similarity to

602

SARS-CoV-2 at each residue position was calculated using the BLOSUM-62 scoring matrix46.

603

These scores were then used to color each residue position on the SARS-CoV-2 S structure

604

(PDB ID: 6VSB) in PyMOL (Schrodinger, version 2.3.5) in order to visualize surface patches

605

and linear epitopes with structural homology. These conserved regions were then visualized on

606

the other human coronavirus spike structures by retrieving them from the Protein Databank

607

(SARS-CoV-1: 5X5B, MERS-CoV: 5W9I) and aligning them to the SARS-CoV-2 S structure.

608

Finally, the residue N165 was part of a conserved surface patches and was mutated to alanine

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

613

ELISA error bars (standard error of the mean) were calculated using GraphPad Prism version

614
