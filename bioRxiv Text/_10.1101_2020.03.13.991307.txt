ABSTRACT
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 100,000 people
worldwide with over 3,000 deaths since December 2019. There is no cure for COVID-19 and the
vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. Here we demonstrate a CRISPRCas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells), for viral
inhibition that can effectively degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV)
genome in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a group of CRISPR RNAs
(crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs for cleaving SARSCoV-2. The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for H1N1 IAV. Our
bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all
coronaviruses. The PAC-MAN approach is potentially a rapidly implementable pan-coronavirus
strategy to deal with emerging pandemic strains.

INTRODUCTION
The world is currently faced with a pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has
no vaccine or cure. It is predicted the development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent
COVID-19 will take one year to 18 months, by which time it is likely that several hundreds of
thousands to millions of people may have been infected. With a rapidly growing number of
cases and deaths around the world, this emerging threat requires a nimble and targeted means
of protection. Since coronaviruses causing COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are able to suddenly transfer to
humans from diverse animal hosts that act as viral reservoirs, there is a pressing need to
develop methods to combat other potential coronaviruses that may emerge in the future1–3. A
recent report further showed two strains (L and S) of SARS-CoV-2 with different genome
sequences are circulating and likely evolving, further highlighting the need for a pan-coronavirus
vaccination strategy4.
The novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 belongs to a family of positive-sense RNA viruses,
which typically infect the upper and lower respiratory tracks and cause disease by direct
cytotoxic effects and the induction of host cytokines disease 5. The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is
likely similar to closely related coronaviruses such as the virus that causes SARS, in which the
virus enters the cell, releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm, and synthesizes negativesense genomic and subgenomic RNAs from which viral mRNAs and a new copy of the positive
sense viral genome are synthesized (Fig. 1A)6,7. Whereas traditional vaccines work by priming
the human immune system to recognize viral proteins or weakened viruses and decrease viral
entry into cells8, the alternative antiviral approach we propose here relies on a CRISPR-based
system for recognizing and degrading the intracellular viral genome and its resulting viral
mRNAs (Fig. 1B). Targeting the positive-sense genome and viral mRNAs to simultaneously
degrade viral genome templates for replication and viral gene expression would be expected to
robustly limit viral replication.
To inhibit RNA viruses in human cells, we used the CRISPR-Cas13d system derived from
Ruminococcus flavefaciens XPD3002, a recently discovered RNA-guided RNA
endonuclease9,10. Cas13d employs CRISPR-associated RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a
customizable 22 nucleotide (nt) spacer sequence that can direct the Cas13d protein to specific
RNA molecules for targeted RNA degradation. The high catalytic activity of Cas13d in
mammalian cells provides a potential mechanism for targeting SARS-CoV-2 for specific viral
RNA genome degradation and viral gene expression inhibition. Because of its small size (967
amino acids), high specificity, and strong catalytic activity, we chose Cas13d rather than other
Cas13 proteins to target and destroy RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus
(IAV)10–12.
In this work, we developed a Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells (PAC-MAN)
strategy as a form of genetic intervention to target SARS-CoV-2, IAV, and potentially all
sequenced coronaviruses. We created a bioinformatic pipeline to define conserved regions
across the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and target these regions using CRISPR-Cas13d for viral
genome degradation and viral gene inhibition. At the time of paper submission, there is no
widely available laboratory strains of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we tested our approach using
synthesized fragments of SARS-CoV-2, as well as with live H1N1 IAV. We designed and
screened a panel of crRNA pools targeting conserved viral regions and defined the most
effective crRNAs. We demonstrated the ability of our approach to cleave SARS-CoV-2
fragments and to reduce the replication of IAV in human lung epithelial cells. Our bioinformatics

analysis revealed a group of six crRNAs that can target 91% of sequenced coronaviruses, as
well as a group of 22 crRNAs able to target all sequenced coronaviruses. The potential pancoronavirus protection using CRISPR-Cas13d offers an alternative and complementary
approach over traditional pharmaceuticals or vaccines. Through the use of crRNA pools
targeting different regions of the same virus or different strains of coronavirus, this system could
possibly buffer against viral evolution and escape, as well as enable rapid development and
deployment against emerging viruses. When combined with an effective delivery platform, PACMAN is a promising strategy to combat not only coronaviruses including that causing COVID-19,
but also a broad range of other genera of viruses.

anti-COVID-19. (A) A hypothetical life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 based on what is known about
other coronavirus life cycles. SARS-CoV-2 virions bind to the ACE2 receptor on the surface
of cells via interactions with the Spike protein. Upon viral release, the positive strand RNA
genome serves as a template to make negative strand genomic and subgenomic templates,
which are used to produce more copies of the positive strand viral genome and viral
mRNAs. (B) Cas13d can inhibit viral function and replication by directly targeting and
cleaving all viral positive-sense RNA.

RESULTS
Computational design and analysis of targetable regions on SARS-CoV-2
To create effective and specific crRNA sequences to target and cleave SARS-CoV-2, we first
performed a bioinformatic analysis by aligning published SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 47
patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes at the single-nucleotide resolution level.
SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded RNA genome with ~30,000 nucleotides that encodes 12
putative, functional open reading frames13–15. Our analysis found regions with a high
conservation between 47 SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes (Fig. 2A). The
two highly-conserved regions respectively contain the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRP) gene in the polypeptide ORF1ab region, which maintains the proliferation of all
coronaviruses, and the Nucleocapsid (N) gene at the 3’ end of the genome, which encodes the
capsid protein for viral packaging.

To target highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 regions, we generated an in silico collection of all
3,802 possible crRNAs (Supplemental Fig. 1). After excluding crRNAs either predicted to have
potential off-target binding (≤1 mismatch) in the human transcriptome or having poly-T (≥4 Ts)
sequences that may prevent crRNA expression, we obtained a collection of 3,203 crRNAs
(Supplemental Table 1). We designed and synthesized 40 crRNAs, with 20 crRNAs each
targeting the conserved sequences of the RdRP and N genes (Supplemental Table 2). Our
rationale for densely targeting these two regions was to significantly reduce both viral genomic
RNA and mRNA templates for expressing essential viral proteins and to minimize the risk of
loss of targeting activity by mutational escape.
CRISPR PAC-MAN is capable of inhibiting coronavirus fragment expression in human
lung epithelial cells
To evaluate whether Cas13d is effective for targeting SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we created two
reporters expressing synthesized fragments of SARS-CoV-2 fused to GFP (SARS-CoV-2-F1
and SARS-CoV-2-F2; Fig. 2B, Supplemental Table 3). As SARS-CoV-2 appears to mainly
infect respiratory tract cells in patients5, we chose to use human lung epithelial A549 cells as a
model cell line. We created a stable A549 cell line expressing Cas13d through lentiviral
infection, followed by sorting for the mCherry marker that was co-expressed with Cas13d (Fig.
2C).
We first investigated which regions of the SARS-CoV-2 fragments were most susceptible to
Cas13d-mediated targeting and cleavage. To do this, we transfected or transduced the SARSCoV-2 reporters into Cas13d A549 cells that had been transduced with pools of four crRNAs
targeting either RdRP or N gene regions (Fig. 2D, see Methods). We chose to evaluate the
effectiveness of our system using a pool of crRNAs, since in the context of live viral infection,
this would prevent the possibility of escape from inhibition due to a mutation involving a single
crRNA target site. A total of ten groups (G1-G10) were tested for all 40 crRNAs (Supplemental
Table 2). Twenty-four hours after SARS-CoV-2 reporter transfection, we performed flow
cytometry to examine levels of GFP protein expression and collected RNA from cells to perform
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine mRNA transcript abundance.
We observed that most RdRP-targeting crRNA pools were able to repress reporter expression
to some extent compared to the control, and one pool targeting the middle of the SARS-CoV-2-

F1 RdRP region (G4; SARS-CoV-2 genome coordinates 13,784-14,149) was able to repress
GFP by 86% (p = 2x10-6) (Fig. 3A, S2A-B, Supplemental Table 4). One pool of N genetargeting crRNAs (G8; SARS-CoV-2 genome coordinates 28,803-29,034) was able to
substantially repress SARS-CoV-2-F2 GFP, causing a 71% decrease in expression (p = 2x10-7)
(Fig. 3B, S2A-B, Supplemental Table S4). Our qRT-PCR analysis showed consistent results
at the RNA level, with G4 and G8 inhibiting their respective reporter mRNA abundance by 83%
(p = 3x10-11) and 79% (p = 2x10-12) (Fig. 3A-B, Supplemental Table S4). The variations in the
ability of different crRNA pools to repress the SARS-CoV-2 reporters are likely due to RNA
secondary structure inherent in the SARS-CoV-2 genome or differences in binding affinities for
each crRNA sequence composition.

We next independently validated the performance of adjacent crRNA pools when SARS-CoV-2F1 or -F2 was introduced via lentiviral transduction. We argue that this approach, in which the
lentivirus-derived RNA serves as a PAC-MAN target prior to lentivirus integration into DNA,
mimics the crRNA targeting conditions that would apply for natural COVID-19 infection. We
tested on a few selected crRNA pools, including the 3 best groups G4, G5, and G8 and one less
efficient group G1, with a lentiviral multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. Our results revealed
similar patterns to our SARS-CoV-2 transfection experiments, with the best groups (G4, G5, G8)
able to repress their reporters by 69%, 71%, and 60% (p = 7x10-6, 10-3, 3x10-6 for G4, G5, G8,
respectively) (Fig. 3C). qRT-PCR analysis also showed consistent results, with G4, G5, and G8
repressing 70%, 68%, and 49% of RNA abundance (p = 8x10-8, 4x10-6, 10-4 for G4, G5, G8
respectively) (Fig. 3D).
We further validated the effectiveness of Cas13d-mediated repression of SARS-CoV-2 reporters
by co-transfecting each reporter with a pool of 5 crRNAs tiled along the whole fragment,
compared to a pool of 5 non-targeting control crRNAs (Table S2). We found that the RdRPtargeting crRNAs were able to repress SARS-CoV-2-F1 GFP by 81% (p = 0.01), while Ntargeting crRNAs were able to repress SARS-CoV-2-F2 GFP by 90% (p = 5x10-4) (Fig. 3E,
S3A). We also did an analysis of the extent to which expression of Cas13d or crRNAs affected
SARS-CoV-2 GFP reporter inhibition. Our analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition was
more sensitive to crRNA concentration in our samples, while lower Cas13d expression only
moderately decreased inhibitory activity (Fig. S3B). Thus, maintaining a high level of crRNA
concentration is likely a determining factor for more effective SARS-CoV-2 sequence targeting
and cleavage.
These data together suggest: 1) Cas13d PAC-MAN can be an effective system to target and
degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences in human cells and 2) proper design of crRNAs are important
for obtaining a high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.
CRISPR PAC-MAN is able to inhibit IAV infection in human lung epithelial cells
Since we do not yet have access to live SARS-CoV-2 virus, as a proof-of-concept we elected to
test the CRISPR-Cas13d strategy on inhibiting H1N1 IAV, a RNA virus with a similar tropism as
SARS-CoV-2 for respiratory tract epithelial cells. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, which has only a
single, continuous RNA genome, the IAV genome is contained in 8 negative-sense RNA
segments, in which each plays an important role in packaging the viral RNA into budding
virions16,17.
To create crRNAs targeting a broad range of IAV strains, we aligned all complete IAV genomes
retrieved from the Influenza Research Database and searched for the most conserved regions
(Supplemental Table 5). Our analysis and the work of others showed that the segment ends
are highly conserved for all 8 segments16–21. The segment ends are potentially attractive regions
for targeting with Cas13d because of the potential to inhibit a broad range of IAV strains and
because of the previous evidence that interfering with the packaging of one segment encoded
on the segment ends can decrease the packaging efficiency of other segments and overall
virion packaging18,22–25. Using sequence representation from ~140 different strains of influenza,
we designed crRNAs that could be robust across as many different IAV strains as possible. Our
bioinformatics analysis resulted in 6 crRNAs targeting highly conserved genome regions for
each of the 8 IAV segments, for a total of 48 crRNAs (Supplemental Table 6).

To test the efficiency of IAV-targeting crRNAs, we performed a screen of our crRNA pools in the
stable Cas13d A549 cell line to determine which were most effective at inhibiting IAV infection
(Fig. 4A). To do this, we transfected a pool of 6 crRNAs targeting a given IAV genome segment.
Two days after crRNA transfection, the Cas13d A549 cells were challenged with PR8-mNeon, a
strain of H1N1 IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) engineered to express the mNeonGreen gene, a
fluorescent reporter protein (hereafter referred to as PR8-mNeon) at an MOI of 2.5 or 5.026–28. At
approximately 18 hours post-challenge, the cells were analyzed for IAV infection through flow
cytometry and microscopy. We examined the percentage of cells that were mNeon positive for
each segment-targeting crRNA pool and calculated the fold-change compared to cells
transfected with a pool of non-targeting crRNAs).

Out of all crRNAs, the crRNA pool targeting segment 6 (S6) delivered the most consistent and
robust results across different MOIs (72% reduction for MOI = 2.5 and 52% reduction for MOI =
5; Fig. 4B, S4). Additionally, the segment 4 (S4) pool also showed moderate but consistent
inhibition. To verify Cas13d-mediated inhibitory effects on S4 and S6, we further tested at a
lower MOI of 0.5, which showed better inhibition of IAV across samples (e.g., 79% reduction
using crRNAs targeting S6; Fig. S5). This confirms consistent inhibitory activity of IAV by
Cas13d when targeting these two segments. There is a possible trend of greater inhibition at
lower viral titers, suggesting that Cas13d PAC-MAN could be a particularly effective strategy for
prevention of new infections, which typically occurs from exposure to a low level of virus.
We further characterized the S6-targeting crRNA pool. S6 encodes the gene neuraminidase
(NA), which releases budding virions from the host cell 16. We performed microscopy
quantification of mNeon+ cells and found that mNeon expression was reduced by 62% (p = 10-5)
and 73% (p = 5x10-9) with an MOI of 2.5 and 5, respectively, with S6-targeting crRNAs (Fig. 4C)
and this trend was corroborated by flow cytometry (Fig. 4D). Together, our data show that
Cas13d PAC-MAN is able to target highly conserved viral regions and robustly inhibit viral
replication in human lung epithelial cells.
Cas13d PAC-MAN as a potential pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy
In the past two decades, multiple variants of coronavirus, including those causing COVID-19,
SARS and MERS, emerged from animal reservoirs and infected humans, each time causing
significant disease and fatalities1–3. Thus, the design of a strategy that could broadly prevent
and target viral threats, including all coronavirus strains that currently reside in animals, would
be a valuable resource. We asked whether it is possible to design a minimal number of crRNAs
that could target a majority of known coronaviruses found in both humans and animals.
To do this, we analyzed all known coronavirus genomes (3,051) to identify all possible crRNAs
that can target each of those genomes, ending up with approximately 6.48 million possible
crRNAs (Fig. 5A, S6). We then refined our list to define the smallest number of crRNAs that
could target all known coronavirus genomes with zero mismatches. We found that just two
crRNAs could target ~50% of coronavirus genomes, including those causing COVID-19, SARS,
and MERS; 6 crRNAs were able to target ~91% of coronavirus genomes; and 22 crRNAs
covered all sequenced coronaviruses with no mismatches (Fig. 5B, Supplemental Table 7).
The ability to use a relatively small number of crRNAs to broadly target most or all coronavirus
strains further highlights the uniqueness of our approach in contrast to traditional
pharmaceutical or vaccination approaches.
As a resource, we provide a map to show how our top 6 crRNAs (PAC-MAN-T6) targeted the
coronavirus phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5A, red box). Beta coronaviruses, the genus of viruses
causing COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, were mostly covered by 3 crRNAs (crRNA 1-3), while
the other genera were covered by these three plus the remaining 3 crRNAs. Altogether, the
PAC-MAN-T6 can target all known human coronavirus with broad coverage against other
animal coronaviruses.
The minimal set of six crRNAs also included one crRNA (designated crRNA-N18f) that we
validated. A recent work analyzed 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and indicated that there are two
major types (L and S) of SARS-CoV-2 existing with different viral signature sequences4. To
verify whether crRNA-N18f can target all L and S strains, we retrieved a set of 202 recently
sequenced SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data

(GISAID). Notably, crRNA-N18f targets all 201 genomes, with only one SARS-CoV-2 sequence
carrying a single mismatch mutation (Supplemental Table 8). This suggests that our approach
can robustly target multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains, but also suggests the potential need to use a
pool of crRNAs to avoid mutational escapes.

DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES
CRISPR-Cas13 emerged as a natural bacterial defense against bacteriophages, a powerful
antiviral system that is able to use sequence-specific crRNAs to protect host bacterial cells from
infections29. Here, we have repurposed the RNA-guided RNA endonuclease activity of Cas13d
in mammalian cells against emergent viral targets, SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, in our PAC-MAN
strategy. This expands the applications of CRISPR-Cas13 systems in addition to their uses for
diagnostics such as SHERLOCK and live-cell imaging30–33. Prior work showed Cas13a/b
systems could inhibit ssRNA viruses including influenza, which is consistent with our observed
high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 reporter and IAV inhibition using the PAC-MAN approach31. We
demonstrated that Cas13d-based genetic targeting can effectively target and cleave the RNA
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 fragments and IAV in lung epithelial cell cultures. Our bioinformatics
analysis also suggested a minimal pool of 6 crRNAs able to target over 90% of sequenced
coronaviruses. While this strategy is a proof-of-concept and will require further testing using
replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and validation in animal models before clinical tests
in humans, it represents a unique approach to implement a rapid and broad antiviral defense in
humans against emerging pathogens for which there are no effective vaccines.
For both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, we found highly conserved regions of the viral genomes to
target with Cas13d. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these genome regions encode the RdRP and
Nucleocapsid proteins, which are essential for coronavirus replication and function13,34. RdRP is
responsible for catalyzing the replication of all viral mRNAs and Nucleocapsid binds to genomic
RNA, protecting it and serving as one of the two main structural proteins in virions. Targeted
inhibition of these proteins could have an outsized effect on disabling virus production and
function, in addition to reducing viral load through degradation of the viral genome itself. For
IAV, the crRNAs that showed the best viral inhibition target the conserved ends of the segment
S6 that encodes Neuraminidase (NA), a viral surface protein essential for mediating budding of
new virions35. Prior mutation analysis has shown that mutating the packaging signals of one
segment end leads to decreased packaging of other segments, indicating that there is a
cooperative mechanism for packaging the IAV genome18. Thus, by inhibiting a single IAV
genome segment, we could reduce the overall packaging of IAV in a synergistic fashion.
Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP gene and IAV NA gene that we targeted in our study are also
the targets of two antiviral drugs, Remdesivir and Oseltamivir. Remdesivir, created by Gilead
Sciences (development code GS-5734), is an RdRP inhibitor that was developed to treat Ebola
and Marburg virus infections and has been reported to have antiviral activity against MERS and
SARS36–38. Remdesivir is already administered for COVID-19 through compassionate use
requests, and clinical trials for its use against COVID-19 have already started in the U.S.
(clinical trial ID NCT04280705) and China. Oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu), is an antiviral
medication for treating and preventing IAV that acts as an inhibitor of NA, thereby preventing the
egress of new viral particles39. It will be interesting to see if these drugs could be used in
combination with Cas13d PAC-MAN to synergistically cripple viral function and replication.
While we demonstrate that the PAC-MAN system is able to exhibit strong repression of viral
sequences in an in vitro setting, it must be coupled with an effective in vivo delivery system for
therapeutic use. There are several potential strategies that could be employed for transient in
vivo expression of CRISPR components. Cas13d and its cognate crRNAs could be delivered as
RNAs within polymers or lipid nanoparticles, perhaps with chemical alterations to increase
stability40. In addition, a DNA-based liposomal delivery strategy, such as the recently developed
HEDGES platform is also attractive41. Yet another strategy would be to deliver a

ribonucleoprotein complex containing purified Cas13d assembled with crRNAs42,43. All of these
could potentially be used both as a therapeutic and as a prophylactic measure.
If the delivery barriers are overcome and a strategy like this is able to be used therapeutically,
there are many potential benefits over traditional vaccines. Traditional vaccines rely on priming
the immune system through exposure to viral proteins or peptides often derived from surface
proteins that exhibit a high rate of mutation, which increased the chances of viral evasion of the
host immune response44. In contrast, here we have demonstrated a genetic strategy that is able
to target highly conserved regions, which would be expected to make it much more unlikely for
the virus to escape inhibition through mutation. In addition, the ability of Cas13d to process its
own crRNAs from a crRNA array means that multiple crRNAs targeting different regions (e.g.
Fig. 3E, and PAC-MAN-T6 in Fig. 5A) could be delivered simultaneously9, further reducing the
chances of viral escape. As a further advantage, we demonstrate a potential pan-coronavirus
strategy to target not only viruses that circulate in humans, but also those that currently are
found in animal reservoirs that might transfer to humans to cause disease. If the crRNAs
targeting these viruses can be tested and validated before they ever infect humans, we can
greatly accelerate the development of countermeasures for future emergent threats.
In summary, our PAC-MAN strategy represents a potentially powerful new approach for
inhibiting viral function and replication, and we envision it could be useful for a diverse array of
circulating and emergent viral threats.

COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Genome Sequences Collection
47 complete SARS-CoV-2 assemblies were downloaded from
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/2019-ncov-seqs/) on February 21, 2020. All the other
3,108 Coronavirinae complete genome sequences were downloaded from ViPR (Virus
Pathogen Resource) database on February 21, 2020. After excluding very short genomes, we
collected in total 3,051 Coronavirinae virus genomes. 202 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
were downloaded from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data;
https://www.gisaid.org/).
High-throughput crRNA Design
We developed a full computational workflow to design crRNAs for the Cas13d system. To
design all possible crRNAs for the three pathogenic RNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,
and MERS-CoV), the reference genomes of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, along with SARS-CoV-2
genomes derived from 47 patients were first aligned by MAFFT using the --auto flag. crRNA
candidates were identified by using a sliding window to extract all 22 nt sequences with perfect
identity among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We annotated each crRNA candidate with the
number of mismatches relative to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes, as well as the GC
content. 3,802 crRNA candidates were selected with perfect match against the 47 SARS-CoV-2
genomes and with ≤1 mismatch to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV sequences. To characterize the
specificity of 22nt crRNAs, we ensured that crRNA do not target any sequences in the human
transcriptome. We used Bowtie 1.2.2 to align crRNAs to the human transcriptome (HG38;
including non-coding RNA) and removed crRNAs that mapped to the human transcriptome with
fewer than 2 mismatches.
Computational identification of minimal set of crRNAs for pan-coronavirus targeting
We maximized the vertical coverage of pooled crRNAs to target a maximal set of the 3,051
Coronavirinae viruses with a minimal set of crRNAs. A sliding window was used to extract all
unique 22 nt sequences in the Coronavirinae genomes, yielding 6,480,955 unique crRNA
candidates. A hash table was used to map each crRNA candidate to the number of
Coronavirinae genomes that it targets with a perfect match. A greedy algorithm was used to
identify a minimal set of covering crRNAs. In each iteration, the crRNAs were sorted in
descending order by the number of genomes targeted. The crRNA that targeted the most
genomes was added to the minimal set of crRNAs, and all of the genomes it targeted were
removed from the hash table values. If multiple crRNAs were tied for targeting the most
genomes, the crRNAs were ranked by the length and quantity of stretches of repeated
nucleotides, and the lowest ranking crRNA (i.e. the one with the fewest, shortest stretches of
repeated nucleotides) was added to the set of minimal crRNAs. Using this approach, a set of 22
crRNAs was identified that was able to target all 3150 Coronavirinae virus genomes (including
47 SARS-CoV-2). The phylogenetic tree and the associated annotations were generated by the
Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL v5.5; https://itol.embl.de/).
Conservation Plot Creation
All the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were aligned with the SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV NCBI Refseq sequences by MAFFT using the --auto flag. The alignment was
visualized using the Geneious Prime software (Geneious 2020.0.4; https://www.geneious.com).

A consensus nucleotide (which is shared by >50% of non-gap characters at the given position)
was assigned to each position in the alignment. Not every position has a consensus nucleotide.
The percent conservation at each position was calculated as the percentage of sequences
matching the consensus at that position. To aid interpretation, the resulting plot of percentage
conservation was smoothed using a moving average with a window size of 1,001 bp centered at
each position. Positions corresponding to gap characters in the SARS-CoV-2 reference
sequence were omitted.
Design and cloning of RdRP- and Nucleocapsid-targeting crRNAs
The crRNA plasmids were cloned using standard restriction-ligation cloning. Forward and
reverse oligos for each spacer (IDT) were annealed and inserted into backbone using T4 DNA
Ligase (NEB). Assembled oligos were either inserted into a pHR or pUC19 backbone, obtained
and modified from Addgene (#121514 and #109054, respectively). Spacer sequences for all
crRNAs can be found in Supplemental Table 2 and 6.
Design and cloning of SARS-CoV-2 reporters
To clone SARS-CoV-2 reporters, pHR-PGK-scFv GCN4-sfGFP (pSLQ1711) was digested with
EcoR1 and Sbf1 and gel purified. The PGK promoter and sfGFP were PCR amplified from
pSLQ1711 and gel purified. The SARS-CoV-2-F1 and SARS-CoV-2-F2 fragments were
synthesize from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). At last, the PGK, sfGFP, and SARS-CoV2-F1/F2 fragments were inserted into the linearized pSLQ1711 vector using In-Fusion cloning
(Takara Bio).
Lentiviral packaging and stable cell line generation
On day 1, one confluent 100mm dish (Corning) of HEK293T cells were seeded into three
150mm dishes (Corning). On day 2, cells were ~50-70% confluent at the time of transfection.
For each dish, 27.18 μg of pHR vector containing the construct of interest, 23.76 μg of dR8.91
and 2.97 μg of pMD2.G (Addgene) were mixed in 4.5 mL of Opti-MEM reduced serum media
(Gibco) with 150 μL of Mirus TransIT-LT1 reagent and incubated at room temperature for 30
minutes. The transfection complex solution was distributed evenly to HEK293T cultures
dropwise. On day 5, lentiviruses are harvested from the supernatant with a sterile syringe and
filtered through a 0.22-μm polyvinylidene fluoride filter (Millipore).
For A549 cells, lentivirus precipitation solution (Alstem) was added and precipitated as per the
manufacturer’s protocol. One well of a 6-well plate (Corning) of A549 cells at ~50% confluency
were transduced with the precipitated lentivirus. After 2-3 days of growth, the cell supernatant
containing virus was removed and the cells were expanded. Cells were then sorted for
mCherry+ cells using a Sony SH800S cell sorter.
SARS-CoV-2 reporter challenge experiments
Fig. 3A-3D: On day 1, A549 cells stably expressing were seeded at a density of 60,000 cells
per well in a 12-well plate. On day 2, cells were transduced with pooled crRNAs targeting
specific regions on SARS-CoV-2 (Supplemental Table S2). On day 3, cells were switched to
fresh medium with Puromycin at 2 ug/mL. Twenty-four hours after Puromycin selection, cells
with transfected crRNAs were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 reporter plasmids or SARS-CoV-2
reporter lentivirus. Twenty-four hours after transfection or 48 hours after transduction, cells were
tested using flow cytometry on a Beckman-Coulter CytoFLEX S and qRT-PCR on a Biorad

CFX384 real-time system. Statistical analyses were done using a two-sided t-test with unequal
variance in Excel to calculate p values.
Fig. 3E: On day 0, 30,000 wildtype A549 cells and 30,000 A549 cells stably expressing Cas13d
(hereafter referred to as Cas13d A549) were plated in 24-well plates (Corning). On day 1,
Cas13d A549 cells were transfected with two pools of five crRNAs targeting the two SARS-CoV2 reporters or a non-targeting crRNA along with the respective SARS-CoV-2 reporters in an
equimolar ratio using Mirus LT1 reagent (50 μL Opti-MEM reduced serum media, 0.136 μg
crRNA pool, 0.364 μg SARS-CoV-2 reporter, 1 μL Mirus LT1 per well). Wildtype cells were
transfected with either the crRNA pools or SARS-CoV-2 reporter plasmids as compensation
controls. GFP expression was measured on day 3 by flow cytometry on a Beckman-Coulter
CytoFLEX S instrument. Statistical analyses were done using a two-sided t-test with unequal
variance in Excel to calculate p values.
Transduction of SARS-CoV-2 reporter plasmid
On day 0, Lenti-X 293T cells (Takara Bio) were seeded to 1:6 from a 100 mm dish in a 150 mm
dish. The following day, Lenti-X 293T cells were transfected with 27.18 μg of SARS-CoV-2
reporter, 23.76 μg of dR8.91 and 2.97 μg of pMD2.G (Addgene) in 4.5 mL of Opti-MEM reduced
serum media (Gibco) with 150 μL of Mirus TransIT-LT1 reagent. 30,000 Cas13d A549 and
wildtype A549 cells were also seeded in 24-well plates. On day 2, A549 cells were transfected
with pools of targeting crRNAs or a non-targeting guide (50 μL Opti-MEM reduced serum media,
0.5 μg crRNA pool, 1 μL Mirus LT1 per well). On day 3, lentiviruses are harvested from the
supernatant with a sterile syringe and filtered through a 0.22-μm polyvinylidene fluoride filter and
precipitated with lentivirus precipitation solution and resuspended in 7 mL DMEM media. The
media on the cells was replaced with either fresh media for the compensation controls or 0.5 mL
virus-containing media at the following dilutions for the experimental conditions: undiluted, 1/2
dilution, 1/3 dilution, and 1/4 dilution. On day 4, the media on all the cells was replaced with 0.5
mL fresh DMEM. On day 5, cells were measured by flow cytometry and assessed for GFP
knockdown. Statistical analyses were done using a two-sided t-test with unequal variance in
Excel to calculate p values.
Generation and titering of PR8 mNeon IAV
The PR8 mNeon IAV was generated by insertion of the mNeon fluorescent gene into segment 4
of the H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 strain (Nicholas Heaton’s Lab, Duke University) as previously
described (Heaton et al., 2017). The PR8-mNeon virus was propagated in chicken eggs, and
harvested allantoic fluid containing the virus was titered using MDCK plaque assays, and frozen
in aliquots for later use.
IAV challenge experiments
3.1x106 Cas13d A549 cells were plated in two 100 mm dishes. The following day, the cells were
transfected with 15 μg pooled crRNAs targeting the IAV genome or non-targeting controls
(Supplemental Table 6) in 1.5 mL Opti-MEM reduced serum media and 30 μL Mirus LT1
reagent. After approximately 24 hours, the transfected Cas13d A549 cells were dissociated and
re-plated in 24-well plates at a density of 15-20,000 cells/well and incubated overnight. Flow
cytometry was performed on excess cells to quantify the transfection efficiency. Cells were
challenged overnight with mNeonGreen expressing H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 at an MOI of
2.5 and 5. Uninfected cells were included as a negative control. An independent two-tailed T
test was used to calculate the p values and statistics in Fig. 4C-D.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Real-time qRT-PCR was performed to quantify RNA abundance. For each sample, total RNA
was isolated by using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen Cat# 74134), followed by cDNA
synthesis using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Cat# 1708890). qRT-PCR primers were
ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Quantitative PCR was performed using the
PrimePCR assay with the SYBR Green Master Mix (BioRad), and run on a Biorad CFX384 realtime system (C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler), according to manufacturers’ instructions. Cq
values were used to quantify RNA abundance. The relative abundance of the SARS-CoV-2
fragments was normalized to a GAPDH internal control.
Microscopy
Microscopy for SARS-CoV-2 experiments was performed on a Nikon TiE inverted confocal
microscope equipped with an Andor iXon Ultra-897 EM-CCD camera and 405 nm, 488 nm, 561
nm and 642 nm lasers, using the 20x PLAN APO air objective (NA = 0.75). Image were taken
using NIS Elements version 4.60 software. Microscopy for IAV experiments was performed on a
Keyence BZ-X810 microscope equipped with a GFP and Texas Red filter was used to obtain
images with a 20X objective lens.
Flow Cytometry
A549 cells that express Cas13d and are transfected with crRNAs and challenged with PR8
mNeon virus were washed with 1X PBS, treated with 1X Trypsin EDTA and fixed in 1.6%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes. Cells were washed with FACS buffer (1X PBS, 0.3%
BSA, 1mM EDTA). BD Accuri C6 plus flow cytometer was used to collect raw data. Raw data
were processed with Cytobank (BD) software.
