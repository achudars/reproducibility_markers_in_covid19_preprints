ABSTRACT
Mpro, also known as 3CLpro, is the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and, as
such, is essential for the viral life cycle. Two studies have each screened and ranked in
30

silico more than one billion chemical compounds in an effort to identify putative inhibitors
of Mpro. More than five hundred of the seven thousand top-ranking hits were synthesized
by an external supplier and examined with respect to their activity in two biochemical
assays: a protease activity assay and a thermal shift assay. Two clusters of chemical
compounds with Mpro inhibitory activity were identified. An additional five hundred

35

molecules, analogues of the compounds in the two clusters described above, were also
synthesized and characterized in vitro. The study of the analogues revealed that the
compounds of the first cluster acted by denaturing Mpro and might denature other proteins
as well. In contrast, the compounds of the second cluster targeted Mpro with much greater
specificity and enhanced its melting temperature, consistent with the formation of stable

40

Mpro -inhibitor complexes. The most active compounds of the second cluster exhibited IC50
values between 4 and 7 μM and their chemical structure suggests that they could serve as
leads for the development of potent Mpro inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION
45
At the end of December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown etiology was
reported by the Chinese health authorities. A novel coronavirus was isolated from human
airway epithelial cells and identified as the cause of a disease, now referred to as COVID19, that produces a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath
50

and loss of smell and taste as the most common ones [1]. On 11 March 2020, the World
Health Organization declared the outbreak as a pandemic. As of December 1, 2020, the
coronavirus pandemic has already infected more than 64 million people and caused more
than 1.5 million deaths (www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

55

The identified novel coronavirus, first named 2019-nCoV and then SARS-CoV-2, is very
similar to SARS-CoV (aka SARS-CoV-1) [2]. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positivesense, single-stranded RNA viruses; the size of their genome is about 30,000 nucleotides
and encodes at least six open reading frames (ORFs) [3]. Two large ORFs, ORF1a and
ORF1b give rise to polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. A main protease (Mpro,

60

also called 3C-like protease) and a papain-like protease (PLpro) process the polyproteins
pp1a and pp1ab into 16 nonstructural proteins, which are important for synthesis of viral
RNA and structural proteins (envelope, membrane, spike and nucleocapsid proteins). The
three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has been described by several groups [49], revealing that the N-terminus of Mpro contains two domains (domain I, residues 10-99;

65

and domain II, residues 100-184) that adopt a chymotrypsin-like fold. The active site is
located at the cleft formed between these domains and contains a Cys145-His41 catalytic
dyad. A total of five protein segments comprising residues 25-27 and 44-50 from domain I
and residues 140-143, 165-168 and 188-190 from domain II form the walls of the active
site.

70
The Mpro protease is essential for the viral life cycle and is also among the most highly
conserved proteins in the coronavirus family. For example, the Mpro proteases of SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are 96% identical at the amino acid sequence level and their
active sites are 100% identical [4]. For the above reasons, Mpro is considered to be a good
75

target for the development of novel treatments for COVID-19. Effective inhibitors of SARSCoV-2 Mpro could impact the course of COVID-19, but, more importantly, they might
prevent possible future pandemics caused by other Betacoronaviruses.

80
The conservation of Mpro extends beyond the coronavirus family. Thus, GC376, one of the
most potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, was originally developed as an inhibitor of the
3CLpro of Norwalk virus, a member of the calicivirus family [10]. GC376 and the related
85

compounds GC373 and GC375 are dipeptidyl compounds with different warheads [10-12].
The electrophilic warheads allow these inhibitors to form covalent bonds with the thiol
group of the active site cysteine. GC376 inhibits the main proteases of picornaviruses,
caliciviruses and coronaviruses [10] and is being developed for the treatment of cats
infected with feline coronavirus [13]. GC376 also inhibits the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 with an

90

IC50 of 30 ± 8 nM [14,15].
Another potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, PF-00835231, was developed originally as
an inhibitor of the Mpro of SARS-CoV-1 [16]. PF-00835231 is structurally related to GC376,
but features a different N-capping group and uses a hydroxy-methyl-ketone as warhead to

95

form a covalent bond with the active site cysteine; it has an impressive in vitro IC50 of 0.27
± 0.1 nM [16]. However, efforts to develop this compound for treatment of COVID-19 in
humans suggest that a continuous intravenous infusion of a prodrug would be needed to
achieve effective doses in the plasma of human patients [17].

100

Additional efforts to develop SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors include screening by X-ray
crystallography of a library of very small chemical compounds (referred to as fragments) to
identify compounds that bind Mpro [18,19]. These hits can be used as starting points to
develop Mpro inhibitors.

105

Finally, many groups have used the reported crystal structure of Mpro to identify inhibitors
by in silico screening. Two of these studies screened more than one billion compounds
[20,21]. As our group participated in one of these endeavors, we followed upon this work
by examining whether some of the top hits could actually inhibit the protease activity of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in vitro. We describe here our experience and the identification of three

110

structurally related inhibitors that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in vitro with IC50 values between
4.2 and 7.4 μM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
115

Protein expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
The Mpro construct [4] provided by Rolf Hilgenfeld was transformed into E. coli strain BL21Gold (DE3) (Agilent). Transformed clones were picked to prepare pre-starter cultures in 2
mL YT medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), at 37°C for 8 h. The pre-starter culture was
then inoculated into fresh 120 mL YT medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated at

120

37°C overnight. The next day, the starter culture was inoculated into 1,600 mL YT medium
with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 37°C until OD600 reached a value between 0.6
and 0.8. 1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was then added to induce the
overexpression of Mpro at 30°C for 5 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at
8260 x g, 4°C for 15 minutes, resuspended in Binding Buffer (25 mM BTP pH6.8; 300 mM

125

NaCl; 2 mM DTT; 1 mM EDTA; 3% DMSO) and then lysed using an Emulsiflex-C3
homogenizer (Avestin). The lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 137,088 x g, 4°C
for 1 h and loaded onto a HisTrap FF column (Cytiva) using an Äkta protein purification
system (Cytiva). When all the supernatant containing Mpro had passed through the column,
the column was washed with 80 mL binding buffer to remove non-specifically bound

130

proteins and then Mpro was eluted using an imidazole gradient (0-500 mM) in Binding
Buffer. The Mpro fractions were concentrated using 3 kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters
(Merck Millipore) and the Mpro protein was further purified by size exclusion
chromatography using a HiLoad Superdex 200 column (Cytiva) attached to a SMART
protein purification system (Pharmacia).

135

Compounds
482 compounds, referred to as parent compounds, were selected from lists of highranking, based on in silico screens, putative Mpro inhibitors (Supplementary Tables 1-4).
After evaluating the activity of these compounds in vitro, we selected an additional 578
140

compounds that were analogues of a few active parent compounds (Supplementary
Tables 5-7). All the above compounds were purchased from Enamine, their purity was ≥
90% and most of them were synthesized on customer’s demand. The compounds were
dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 2 mM and were stored at -20°C. GC376 was
purchased from BPSBioscience.

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity assay
Mpro protease assays were performed in duplicate in Falcon 384-well optilux flat bottom,
TC-treated microplates (Corning) in a final volume of 10 μL. Mpro protease, at a final
concentration of 100 nM, was preincubated for 20 min at room temperature (RT) with the
150

compounds in assay buffer (5 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.01% Triton, 2 mM
DTT) under gentle agitation. The FRET substrate, HiLyte-Fluor488ESATLQSGLRKAK(QXL520)-NH2 (Eurogentec), was then added at a final concentration
of 500 nM and incubated for 2 min at RT with gentle agitation prior to the start of
fluorescence measurement. Compounds and FRET substrate were dispensed with an

155

acoustic liquid dispenser (Gen5-Acoustic Transfer System; EDC Biosystems). The
fluorescence intensity was measured kinetically for 7 cycles, every 10 min at 22°C, using a
Spark 10M microplate reader (Tecan) and excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and
528 nm, respectively.

160

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro thermal shift binding assay
The binding of the compounds to Mpro was monitored by differential scanning fluorimetry
(DSF). Mpro protease thermal shift assays were performed in duplicate in LightCycler 480
multiwell plates 96, white (Roche) in a final volume of 20 μL. Mpro protease, at a final
concentration of 1 μM, was preincubated for 20 min at room temperature (RT) under

165

gentle agitation with the compounds (final concentration: 20 μM) in assay buffer (10 mM
HEPES pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl). Protein melting was monitored using 1000X SYPRO
Orange (Sigma) binding dye. Compounds and SYPRO Orange were dispensed with an
acoustic liquid dispenser (Gen5-Acoustic Transfer System; EDC Biosystems).
Fluorescence (excitation wavelength: 465 nm; emission wavelength: 580 nm) was

170

measured over a temperature gradient ranging from 20 to 95 °C, with incremental steps of
0.05 °C/s and 11 acquisitions per °C. The melting curves and peaks were obtained using
the melting temperature (Tm) calling analysis of the LightCycler 480 Software (release
1.5.1.62; Roche).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Development of a FRET-based assay for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity

The plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease with a C-terminal His-tag was kindly
provided by Rolf Hilgenfeld [4]. Mpro was expressed in E. coli strain BL21-Gold (DE3) and
180

the recombinant protein was purified in two steps by affinity and size exclusion
chromatography (Fig. 1a).
The protease activity of purified Mpro was studied using a FRET-based assay suitable for
high throughput analysis. The FRET substrate peptide contains at its N-terminus a dye

185

(HiLyte-Fluor488), whose fluorescence is quenched by a C-terminal quencher (QXL520).
Cleavage of the peptide by Mpro leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity. The assay
was carried out in 384-well plates in a reaction volume of 10 μL with the protease and
fluorogenic substrate at final optimized concentrations of 100 nM and 500 nM,
respectively. The fluorescence intensity was measured kinetically every 10 min in a

190

microtiter plate-reading fluorimeter in the presence or absence of the Mpro inhibitor GC376
[10-12]. In the absence of the inhibitor, the fluorescence intensity increased linearly during
the first 60 min of the reaction, whereas in the presence of 40 μM GC376 no increase in
fluorescence intensity was observed (Fig. 1b). The substrate and inhibitor were dispensed
using an acoustic liquid dispenser, which allowed compounds to be dispensed directly

195

from the stock solution plates.

Validation of putative SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors identified by in silico
screens
We described recently two in silico screens of one billion compounds using Mpro as a
200

target [20]. The first screen, hereafter referred to as screen 1A, used the three-dimensional
coordinates of Mpro described by Jin et al [5] (pdb id: 6lu7). The second screen, hereafter
referred to as screen 1B, used the coordinates of Mpro described by Dai et al [3] (pdb id:
6m0k), except that different rotamers were used for residues S46, M49 and C145, in the
hope of expanding the active site and capturing a larger repertoire of chemical compounds

205

[20]. Comparison of the top 1,000 hits identified by screens 1A and 1B, revealed an
overlap of only 12 compounds.
From screen 1A, 3,808 top-ranking hits were evaluated and 195 compounds thereof were
chosen to be synthesized (Table S1). Main selection criteria included drug-likeness and

210

chemical diversity. From screen 1B, 3,851 top hits were evaluated and 226 compounds
thereof were selected for chemical synthesis (Table S2). In addition, guided by the results

of a crystallographic fragment screen [19] that showed a fragment containing a nitrile
group deep in the active site of Mpro (pdb id: 5r82), we identified all the nitrile-containing
compounds among the top 20,000 hits of screens 1A and 1B. This list included 253
215

compounds, 45 of which were synthesized (Table S3). Finally, we also ordered synthesis
of 12 of the top 15 hits from screen 1A and of 8 of the top 15 hits from an in silico screen
of 1.3 billion compounds conducted by Ton et al [21], hereafter referred to as screen 2
(Table S4).

220

All the above compounds, 486 in total, were assayed at a final compound concentration of
40 μM for their ability to inhibit the protease activity of Mpro. From the 207 compounds
selected from the hits of screen 1A (Table S1 and first 12 compounds of Table S4), only
weak inhibitors of Mpro were identified and none of them were pursued further. From the
226 compounds selected from the hits of screen 1B (Table S2), one compound,

225

Z1037455358, was particularly active (Fig. 2a,c); whereas from the 45 nitrile-containing
compounds selected from the hits of screens 1A and 1B (Table S3), the structurallyrelated compounds Z637352244 and Z637352642 (both from screen 1A) appeared
promising (Fig. 2a,c). Finally, from the 8 compounds selected from the hits of screen 2
(bottom 8 compounds of Table S4), two structurally-related compounds,

230

ZINC000636416501 and ZINC000373659060, were weakly active (Fig. 2b,c). We decided
to investigate further the compounds cited above by having synthesized or ordering, when
commercially available, analogous compounds based on similarity and substructure
searches.

235

Characterization of a cluster of nitriles and a diamino-quinazoline singleton
We first focused our effort on the two structurally-related compounds Z637352244 and
Z637352642 (Fig. 2c). These two compounds were identified by screen 1A and have in
common a nitrile, a functional group which is also present in a fragment that was found to
bind Mpro by crystallographic screening [18]. To identify more potent compounds, we

240

ordered 301 analogues, most of which were chemically synthesized for this project (Table
S5). As expected, several of the analogues inhibited Mpro, when tested at a final
concentration of 40 μM (Fig. 3a). We determined the IC50 concentrations of the original
compounds and of the five most promising analogues. The parent compounds
Z637352244 and Z637352642 exhibited IC50 values of 16 and 96 μM, respectively (Fig.

245

3b,c). Three analogues, Z56785964, Z637450230 and Z56786187, showed IC50 values

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.409441; this version posted December 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this

between 13-17 μM, whereas two analogues, Z2239054061 and Z637352638, had IC50
values of 6.7 and 7.5 μM, respectively (Fig. 3b,d). We will refer to this family of compounds
as the cluster of nitriles.
250

We next focused our efforts on compound Z1037455358, which was identified by screen
1B and which contained a diamino-quinazoline core. The IC50 of this compound was 19
μM (Fig. 3e). We obtained 108 analogues of this compound (Table S6), but none of them
were more potent than the parent compound and, therefore, none of them were further
pursued. However, we retained the parent compound for further analysis and we will refer

255

to it as the diamino-quinazoline singleton.
To continue validation of the nitrile cluster and the diamino-quinazoline singleton, we
examined their effect in a thermal shift assay (TSA). Briefly, Mpro protease, at a final
concentration of 1 μM, was incubated for 20 min with the inhibitors at a final concentration

260

of 20 μM; the melting temperature of Mpro was then determined. Compounds that bind to
Mpro should enhance its melting temperature [22]. Indeed, GC376 increased the melting
temperature of Mpro by 19°C (Fig. 4a). Surprisingly, the parent nitrile-containing
compounds Z637352244 and Z637352642 decreased the melting temperature of Mpro by
2-3°C (Fig. 4a). Three of their analogues, Z637352638, Z2239054061 and Z56785964,

265

decreased the melting temperature of Mpro even more, by 8-11°C. Of the remaining two
analogues, Z56786187 decreased the melting temperature of Mpro by 4°C, whereas
Z637450230 had no effect on the melting temperature (Fig. 4a). Compound Z1037455358,
the diamino-quinazoline singleton, also led to a modest decrease in the melting
temperature of Mpro (Fig. 4b).

270
The observed decrease in the melting temperature of Mpro by the above compounds was
of concern, as it could indicate that these compounds were inhibiting the protease activity
of Mpro by acting as unspecific denaturing agents. We reasoned that, if this was the case,
then the compounds would lose inhibitory activity when the protease assay was performed
275

in the presence of non-specific proteins that could serve as a sink for compound
sequestration. Indeed, the parent nitrile-containing compound Z637352244, its analogues
Z56786187 and Z637450230, and the Z1037455358 singleton all lost activity when the
protease assay was performed in the presence of 1 μg cell lysate (Fig. 5). In contrast, the
previously described inhibitor GC376 maintained activity in the presence of the lysate and,

280

interestingly, so did compounds ZINC000373659060 and ZINC000636416501 (Fig. 5),
which were identified by the second in silico screen (screen 2) [21] .

Characterization of a cluster of dihydro-quinolinone compounds
Compounds ZINC000373659060 and ZINC000636416501 are structurally related to each
285

other and contain a dihydro-quinolinone core (Fig. 2b). Encouraged by the fact that the
activity of these two compounds was not affected by the presence of cell lysate, we
obtained 157 analogues (Table S7) and examined their ability to inhibit the protease
activity of Mpro. Three analogues were found to be significantly more potent than the parent
compounds (Fig. 6a). Specifically, compounds Z228770960, Z393665558 and

290

Z225602086 had IC50 values of 4.2, 5.9 and 7.4 μM, respectively (Fig. 6b). Importantly, all
three analogues retained their inhibitory activity against Mpro in the presence of a cell
lysate (Fig. 6c).
The parent ZINC000373659060 and ZINC000636416501 compounds and their three

295

active analogues were then examined for their ability to modulate the melting temperature
of Mpro in the thermal shift assay. The parent compounds did not affect the melting
temperature of Mpro (Fig. 7a). However, the analogues increased the melting temperature
of Mpro (Fig. 7b); the most active analogue, Z228770960, induced the greatest increase in
melting temperature (1.2°C; Fig. 7b). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that

300

the analogues inhibit Mpro by binding to its active site and stabilizing the protein, as
predicted by the docking software that led to the identification of the parent compounds
ZINC000373659060 and ZINC000636416501 (Fig. 8).

Prospects
305

COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our society and this is likely to continue for
several additional months. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has
proceeded with great speed, as compared to previously developed ones. Yet, despite their
rapid development, the vaccines will become available only about one year after it became
clear that COVID-19 was spreading as a pandemic and it will take several months to

310

vaccinate a significant fraction of the population.
It is interesting to note that the active site of the Mpro protease of SARS-CoV-2 is identical
to that of SARS-CoV-1 and very similar to those of the proteases of many other members

of the coronavirus family. Indeed, the best SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors are actually
315

compounds that were originally identified as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-1 Mpro [16,17,23].
However, these compounds were not developed to the point that they could be used to
treat COVID-19 patients, because the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic was short-lived and the
interest in developing agents that could treat SARS waned. In retrospect, it appears that
this decision was a mistake.

320
The analogues that we have identified here are not potent enough to treat COVID-19
patients and their toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile is unknown. However, they have
drug-like features and, therefore, the potential to be developed into drugs. In fact, these
compounds might be the first class of compounds developed de novo against SARS-CoV325

2 Mpro [23]. In addition, whereas the majority of Mpro inhibitors form covalent complexes
with the catalytic cysteine, the compounds that we have identified are non-covalent
inhibitors, lacking a highly reactive electrophile, which might make it easier to develop
them for oral administration, a prerequisite for responding to a pandemic. For these
reasons, we intend to proceed with the development of these compounds, not to impact

330

the evolution of the current pandemic, but to better prepare ourselves for the next one.

HisTrap FF column. The horizontal ticks indicate the positions of migration of the
molecular weight markers. The purified Mpro protein migrates at about 30 kDa,
consistent with its molecular weight. b. The protease activity of Mpro was monitored
by a FRET-assay, as described in the text. In this experiment, fluorescence was
measured every 10 min over a period of 120 min. GC376, a previously-described
Mpro inhibitor, whose structure is shown, was examined at a final concentration of 40
μM. RFU, relative fluorescence units.
