Abstract
2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the pathogen of Corona Virus Disease
2019. Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical
diagnosis. However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent
quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to
“The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)”
issued by National Health and Commission of China and “The Experts’ Consensus on
Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV” released by Chinese Society of Laboratory
Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56oC or higher to inactivate the
viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids
were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the
virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results
showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of
56 oC for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 oC for 5 minutes
when the samples were preserved by Hank’s solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions
currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be
unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 oC or higher if the samples were
preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We
therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of
high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a
sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic
acids from high temperature inactivation damage.

1. Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or
2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the pathogen of Corona Virus Disease 2019
[1]. Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical
diagnosis. However, the false negative rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in clinical
practice is very high, and the positive rate is only 30-50% [2]. False negative
detection means missed detection, which will lead to not only the delayed diagnosis of
suspected patients, but also the 2019-nCoV carriers becoming the potential sources of
virus infection. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the detection rate of
2019-nCoV nucleic acid clinically.
Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) technology is mainly
used to detect the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. The quality of nucleic acid template is
admittedly one of the key factors affecting the detection efficiency. According to
“The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)”
issued by National Health and Commission of China [3] and “The Experts’ Consensus
on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV” released by Chinese Society of Laboratory
Medicine [4], the human samples must be placed in 56oC for at least 45 minutes or
higher for shorter time to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from
virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated.
However, 2019-nCoV is a single stranded RNA virus. Theoretically, the progress
of killing the viruses with high temperature will damage the integrity of their RNA
genomes in the samples, thus improperly reducing the amount of target viral
templates, and eventually leading to high false negative rate of the virus detection. In
this study, we employed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a kind of
coronavirus, as a model virus to test the above hypothesis and our results
demonstrated that the virus inactivation progress by high temperature damaged the
detectable template of the coronavirus seriously.

1.36 × 106 HEK293T cells (ATCC, USA), 1.5 µL Porcine Transmissible Gastroenteritis
and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Vaccine (Strain WH-1R + Strain AJ1102-R, Wuhan Keqian
Biological. Company, Ltd.) or 1 ng λDNA (3010, Takara, Japan) were suspended and mixed
together using 1.5 mL of sample preservation medium (R503, Vamzye, China) or 1.5 mL
Hank’s solution.

2.2 Extraction of nucleic acid
Nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) was extracted using a commercial kit (RC311-C1, Vazyme)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 500 µL samples preserved in R503 was
first added into a 1.5 ml EP tube containing 200 µL of absolute ethanol and 200 µL samples
preserved in Hank’s solution was added into a 1.5 ml EP tube containing 500 µL lysis buffer.
The mixture was vortexed thoroughly and then transferred into a column placed onto a 2 mL
EP collection tube. After centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000×g, the column was placed onto a
fresh 2 mL EP collection tube, followed by adding 600 µL washing buffer and then centrifuge
for 30 sec at 12,000×g. Washing step was repeated once. The column was placed onto a new
2 mL collection. After centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000×g, the column was then placed onto a
1.5 ml collection tube. 100 µL and 40 µL elution buffer was added into the center of the
membrane of column collected the sample prepared by R503 and Hank’s solution
respectively and then centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × g to collect the nucleic acid. The

4 µL of nuclease-free H2O were mixed and then vortexed briefly. The mixture was heated in
PCR instrument to denature the nucleic acid for 2 min and then subjected to 1.2% agarose gel
electrophoresis separation on ice for 7-10 min together with the standard DNA marker
(MD103, Vazyme).

3. Results
3.1 The integrity of nuclei acids of the 293T cells preserved in Hank’s solution was
damaged seriously after the sample was incubated under 56oC or above high
temperature
To test whether the virus inactivation progress by high temperature would
disrupt the detectable template of the coronavirus, we performed a series of
experiments using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a kind of coronavirus, as
a model. Briefly, we mixed the 293T cells and PEDV coronavirus (RNA virus) and
phage DNA (DNA virus) together using Hank’s solution and then divided the mixture

into five groups. Three groups were incubated at 56oC for 30, 45 and 60 minutes,
respectively. The fourth was incubated at 92 oC for 5 minutes, and the fifth group was
stored at 4oC as no inactivation control. After the high-temperature inactivation was
completed, nucleic acids (including DNA and RNA) were extracted by conventional
methods, and subjected to run 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared with the
samples stored at 4 oC, both the DNA and RNA in the samples either incubated at 56
o

C for 30 - 60 minutes or 92 oC for 5 minutes were degraded. The 28 S and 18 S RNA

bands became indistinct and invisible in all high-temperature inactivation group and
almost no electrophoretic bands could be observed in the group of 92oC inactivation
(Fig. 1A).

3.2 The detectable amount of the porcine coronavirus preserved in Hank’s solution
was reduced seriously after the sample was incubated under 56oC or above high
temperature
To understand the effect of the virus inactivation progress with the temperature
higher than 56oC on the integrity of viral nucleic acid, we quantitated the amount of
PEDV coronavirus after inactivation by qRT-PCR. Compared with the CT (threshold
cycle value) of the control group that the sample was stored at 4 oC (31.94 ± 0.10),
the mean value of CT (32.94 ± 0.18) in the group incubated at 56 oC for 30 minutes
was increased by 0.996 (P< 0.01; Fig 1B; Fig. S1A, Table S1) while the mean value
of CT (36.84 ± 0.37) in the group treated with 92 oC for 5 minutes was increased by
4.8947 (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1C; Fig. S1A, Table S1). The results suggest that only 50.11%
of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation progress of incubation at 56
o

C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% of the detectable viral templates left after the

inactivation progress of incubation at 92 oC for 5 minutes.

3.3 R503 solution was able to partially protect the integrity of nuclei acids of the
293T cells from being disrupted in the virus inactivation progress under 56oC or
above high temperature

disrupting during the inactivation progress with high temperature, R503 (Vazyme,
China) was used to prepare the samples instead of Hank’s solution. We then
performed the same viral inactivation experiments as using Hank's solution.
Compared with the control group that the sample was stored at 4 oC, both DNA and
RNA in the samples incubated at 56 oC for 30 - 60 minutes also displayed obvious
degradation, among which the 28 S and 18 S bands of total RNA of human cells were
obviously smeared, and the large bands of genomic DNA became weaker while there
were almost no visible genomic DNA and 28 S RNA bands in the sample incubated at
92 oC for 5 minutes (Fig 1D). However, the degradation of nucleic acid during the
inactivation progress was not as serious as that of the samples prepared by Hank's
solution. The results suggest that R503 should have a significant protective effect of
both total RNA and genomic DNA from degradation.

3.4 The detectable amount of the porcine coronavirus preserved in R503 solution was
not changed after the sample was incubated under 56oC or above high temperature
To determine the effect of the inactivation progress with temperature higher than
56oC on the integrity of viral nucleic acid in the samples prepared with R503, we
examined the amount of porcine PEDV coronavirus by qRT-PCR as above.
Compared with the CT (31.64 ± 0.10) of the control group that the sample was
stored at 4 oC, the mean value of CT (31.31 ± 0.17) of the group incubated at 56 oC
for 30 minutes had no significant change. The difference of CTs between the two
groups was less than 0.5 (Fig. 1E; Figure S1B; Table S1). Moreover, the mean value
of CT (31.43 ± 0.08) in the group incubated at 92 oC for 5 minutes was also not
changed significantly. The difference of CTs between the two groups was less than
0.5 either (Fig. 1F; Fig. S1B; Table S1). These results showed that the inactivation
progress with the temperature higher than 56 oC did not significantly affect the
detectable template of viral nucleic acid when it was prepared with R503, suggesting
that the fragmented viral RNA could still be good for using as a template for
qRT-PCR even if the viral nucleic acid was degraded.
In order to understand the advantage of R503 over common isotonic solution in

protecting the detectable amount of coronavirus RNA from disrupting, we first
compared the difference of the detectable amount of coronavirus RNA between the
two samples that are prepared with R503 and Hank’s solution and stored at 4 oC. The
results showed that the detectable amount of the viral RNA in the two prepared
solutions was similar (Fig. 1G, Table S1), and the difference between the mean values
of their CT was less than 0.5 (31.64 ± 0.10 vs 31.95 ± 0.10). The results suggest that
there is no significant difference in the amount of detectable viral RNA templates
between the samples prepared by either R503 or Hank’s solutions that were stored at
4 oC.
When the samples were incubated at 56 oC for 30 minutes, however; the CT of
detected PEDV virus was 31.31 ± 0.17 in the samples prepared by R503 and 32.94
± 0.18 in the ones prepared by Hank's solution, respectively. The mean value of CT
of detected virus in Hank's solution was 1.6305 higher than that in R503 (P < 0.0001;
Fig. 1H, Table S1). The results suggest that the detectable templates of viruses in the
samples prepared by Hank's solution was only 32.30% of R503 solution after the
samples were inactivated at 56 oC for 30 minutes to kill the virus.
Furthermore, after inactivation at 92 oC for 5 minutes, the CT of detected PEDV
virus in the two preservation solutions were 31.43 ± 0.08 (R503) and 36.84 ±
0.37 (Hank's), respectively. The mean value of CT of detected virus in the samples
prepared by Hank's solution was 5.4125 higher than that prepared by R503 (P <
0.0001; Figure 1I, Table S1). The results reveal the detectable amount of virus in the
samples prepared by Hank's solution was only 2.35% of R503 solution after the
samples were inactivated at 92 oC for 5 minutes to kill the virus.

3.5 The detectable amount of phage λ DNA was also reduced after the sample
preserved in R503 was incubated under 56oC or above high temperature
In addition to the disruptive effect of the virus inactivation with high temperature
on the detection of RNA virus, the detectable amount of the viral DNA (λ phage) in
the samples was also significantly affected. qPCR results (Fig. S1C, Table S1)
showed that mean value of CT (23.55 ± 0.20) of detectable virus in the samples

incubated at 56oC for 30 minutes was increased by 0.5230 (P < 0.01) compared with
the CT (23.02 ± 0.15) of the samples stored at 4oC. The mean value of CT (25.58 ±
0.21) was increased by 2.5572 (P < 0.0001) in the sample incubated at 92oC for 5
minutes.
Furthermore, we examined the amount of phage DNA in the sample prepared
with R503 after high temperature treatment by qPCR. The results (Fig. S1D, Table S1)
showed that the mean value of CT (21.71 ± 0.04) in the sample prepared by R503
and incubated at 56 oC for 30 minutes had no significant change compared with that
in the control group (21.61 ± 0.06) (the difference between the two was less than
0.5). The mean value of CT (22.90 ± 0.26) was increased by 1.2880 in the sample
that was inactivated at 92 oC for 5 minutes, suggesting that 92 oC treatment
significantly reduced the detectable amount of DNA viruses in sample even prepared
by R503.

4. Discussion
In conclusion, our results show that virus inactivation with temperature higher
than 56 oC result in the degradation of viral nucleic acids seriously, which will lead to
the artificial shortage of detectable templates of viral nucleic acids in samples, and
finally lead to false negative of clinical detection in some samples. Preserved with the
optimized solution such as R503, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be
kept unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 oC or higher for killing the
viruses although the integrity of cellular nucleic acids were obviously disrupted. The
results suggest that if the samples were prepared with an optimal solution, the
detectable numbers of viral templates would be unchanged because virus inactivation
progress with high temperature does not erase all the RNA but leave small fragments
of nucleic acids that are good enough for using as the template for qRT-PCR detection.
If it is true for 2019-nCoV, preparing the human samples with the optimal solution
can not only keep the clinical inspectors from virus infection by inactivating the virus
using 56oC or higher as normal, but also improve the detection sensitivity of viral
nucleic acid in the sample, leading to avoiding or at least reducing false negative

results of detection.
Recently, Chen reported that the inactivation by incubating the sample with 56oC
for 30 min to kill the virus had no significant effect on the detection of 2019-nCoV by
qRT-PCR [5]. However, combining the limitations such as only two samples tested
and higher amount of virus in the two samples as the authors discussed in their
researches, and our experimental evidences that the virus inactivation by high
temperature did reduce the detectable amount of the porcine coronavirus template
seriously, it is highly recommended to carry out systematic investigation on the
impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids
and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of
2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.
