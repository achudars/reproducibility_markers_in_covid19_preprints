the target cell.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious public health, social,
and economic damage worldwide and effective drugs that prevent or cure
COVID-19 are urgently needed.

Approved drugs including Hydroxychloroquine,

Remdesivir or Interferon were reported to inhibit the infection or propagation of
severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), however,
their clinical efficacies have not yet been well demonstrated.

To identify drugs

with higher antiviral potency, we screened approved anti-parasitic/anti-protozoal
drugs and identified an anti-malarial drug, Mefloquine, which showed the highest
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity among the tested compounds.

Mefloquine showed

higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity than Hydroxychloroquine in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and
Calu-3 cells, with IC50 = 1.28 µM, IC90 = 2.31 µM, and IC99 = 4.39 µM in
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.

Mefloquine inhibited viral entry after viral attachment to

Combined treatment with Mefloquine and Nelfinavir, a replication

inhibitor, showed synergistic antiviral activity.

Our mathematical modeling based

on the drug concentration in the lung predicted that Mefloquine administration at a
standard treatment dosage could decline viral dynamics in patients, reduce
cumulative viral load to 7% and shorten the time until virus elimination by 6.1 days.
These data cumulatively underscore Mefloquine as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 entry
inhibitor.

(Cortegiani et al., 2020), given their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and the

TMPRSS2-overexpressed VeroE6 cells and human lung-derived Calu-3 cells.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection of severe acute
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread into a
worldwide since it was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and
caused severe damage to public health, the economy, and society in many
countries and areas.

Several therapeutic drug candidates, including Remdesivir

(RDV), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), Lopinavir and Interferon, have been undergone
clinical trials with drug-repurposing approaches (Touret et al., 2020), of which
treatment efficacies have yet been fully demonstrated.

New drug choices for both

therapeutic and prophylactic use against COVID-19 are urgent needs.
Chloroquine and its derivative, HCQ, are used clinically as anti-malarial drugs
(Sinha et al., 2014).

These drugs (particularly the less toxic HCQ) were expected

to be COVID-19 drug candidates from the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic
ability to reduce pathogenesis caused by the related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and
human coronavirus OC43 in vivo (Keyaerts et al., 2009; Weston et al., 2020; Wang
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020).

However, despite over 30 randomized controlled

trials or observational studies in different countries, no consensus demonstrates a
sufficient anti-COVID-19 effect of these drugs (Geleris et al., 2020; Rosenberg et
al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020a).

Therefore, the FDA revoked the

emergency use of chloroquine and HCQ for COVID-19 treatment in June 2020.
The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo experimental data and the clinical
outcomes reported to date is not well understood.

Possibilities include differences

in drug sensitivities among cell types used in experiments (see 4. Discussion) and
the insufficient potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of these drugs: The
concentrations of HCQ required for 50% and 90% virus reduction (IC50, IC90),
determined in vitro (i.e., several µM), is higher than an achievable in plasma value in
clinical settings (1-2 µM at the maximum) (McLachlan et al., 1993; Touret et al.,
2020; Liu et al., 2020; Hattori et al., 2020) (see 4. Discussion).

Thus, identifying

another drug with a higher antiviral potential at the maximum drug concentration
based on clinical data is a probable approach to improving the treatment efficacy.
In this study, from a cell-based functional screening of FDA/EMA/PMDA-approved
anti-parasitic/anti-protozoal drugs, we identified Mefloquine (MFQ), a derivative of
HCQ originally used for anti-malarial therapy and prophylaxis (Sinha et al., 2014),

Importantly,

our mathematical modeling predicted that MFQ administration (1,000 mg, once per
day) could decline viral dynamics in patients to significantly reducing the
cumulative viral load and shortening the period until virus elimination in clinical
concentration ranges.

Our data provide foundational evidence that proposes MFQ

as an alternative drug for anti-COVID-19 treatment.

2. Materials and Methods
Information for Materials and Methods are described in Supplementary

Information .

3.1. Identification of Mefloquine as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2
infection.
In this study, we mainly used VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, which is established by
overexpressing transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in VeroE6 cells (Nao
et al., 2019; Matsuyama et al., 2020), and human lung epithelial-derived Calu-3
cells in a part of experiments, as SARS-CoV-2 infection models.

First, we examined

the dose dependency of HCQ for antiviral activity by a cytopathic effect (CPE)
assay: VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.001
for 1 h, washed to remove unbound virus, and incubated for an additional 48 h (Fig.
1A).

SARS-CoV-2 propagation in the cells exhibited an intensive cytopathic effect

(Fig. 1B, panel b), as reported (Matsuyama et al., 2020).

HCQ protected cells

from SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathology completely at the concentration of 32
µM, remarkably but not completely at 16 µM, and very little at 8 µM (Fig.1B, panels
c-e).
Aiming to identify drugs with greater anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential than HCQ, we
employed 5 µM for drug screening, a concentration at which HCQ had no CPE
suppression.

As a drug library, we used approved anti-parasitic/anti-protozoal

drugs for following two reasons; 1) In addition to Chloroquine and HCQ, some drugs
such as Ivermectin, Atovaquone and quinoline derivatives were reported to
demonstrate antiviral activities against other RNA viruses (Cifuentes Kottkamp et
al., 2019; DeWald et al., 2019; Mastrangelo et al., 2012; Al-Bari, 2015).

anti-parasitic/anti-protozoal drugs at 5 µM by the CPE assay (Fig. 1A,

Supplementary Materials and Methods). By following the scheme shown in Fig. 1A,
cells at 48 h post-inoculation were fixed, stained with DAPI, and counted to
quantify surviving cell numbers.

The graph in Fig. 1C shows survival cell numbers

relative to that of DMSO-treated cells as a control, and survival cell number relative
to that of non-infected cells are shown in Fig. S1.

In this screening, HCQ,

Chloroquine and Ivermectin had little effect, while MFQ remarkably protected cells
from the virus-induced CPE, with a more than 57-fold increase in surviving cells
over those of the vehicle control (Fig. 1C).

(PRQ),

as

a

reference.

Cytopathogenicities at 48 h and the viral N protein expression at 24 h after virus
inoculation (a time before showing CPE) were examined during treatment with each
compound at 8 µM (Fig. 1D, E): MFQ completely protected cells from viral
propagation-induced CPE and reduced the production of viral protein (lane 4),
whereas HCQ weakly exerted an antiviral effect (lane 3), and PRQ had little antiviral
effect (lane 5).

To examine whether the observed antiviral effects depend on cell

types or are generally reproduced beyond cell types, we used a human lung
epithelial cell line, Calu-3, and found the robust antiviral activity of MFQ against
SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to much lower HCQ activity (Fig. 1F, Supplementary

Materials and Methods).

Therefore, we focused on MFQ as a potential

anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in subsequent analyses.

3.2. Antiviral profile of Mefloquine and other quinoline derivatives.
To profile the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of compounds, we quantified viral RNA
released into the culture supernatant in addition to cell viability at 24 h after virus
inoculation upon treatment at varying concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 µM) of
HCQ, PRQ, MFQ, and other related compounds, Quinine and Quinidine, that possess
a quinoline ring (Fig. 2A–C).

The 90% and 99% maximal inhibitory concentrations

(IC90 and IC99) and 50% maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) are shown.

All

the compounds had no remarkably cytotoxicity at any examined concentration (Fig.
2C).

HCQ and MFQ demonstrated antiviral activities in a dose-dependent manner,

cleavage by host proteases, either TMPRSS2 on the plasma membrane or

marginal antiviral effects at all concentrations examined, suggesting that the
hydroxyl and amino groups in the side chain of MFQ and/or that the position of the
side chain on the quinoline ring are important for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.
The octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) values of MFQ, HCQ, Quinine,
Quinidine and PRQ were calculated to be 4.34, 2.87, 2.48, 2.4, and 1.47,

and

Crippen,

1987),

the

higher

hydrophobicity of MFQ, possibly due to the two trifluoromethyl groups, may be
related to its high antiviral activity.

3.3. Mefloquine inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 entry process after virus-cell attachment.
SARS-CoV-2 attaches to target cells by the binding of viral Spike protein to its
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

It is then subjected to Spike

cathepsins in the endosomes, followed by the membrane fusion and the sorting to
the site of replication (entry phase).

Viral RNA then replicates and assembles with

viral structural proteins to produce progeny virus (replication phase) (Fig. 3A)
(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lebeau et al., 2020).
We next addressed which step in the viral life cycle MFQ inhibits by a series of
assays.

The time-of-addition analysis, in which compounds are treated at different

times, is used to evaluate the phase of viral entry and replication separately (Wang
et al., 2020).

As previously reported (Wang et al., 2020), compounds were

treated at three different time points (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Materials and

Methods), either throughout the assay (a; whole life cycle, 1 h during virus
inoculation + 24 h after inoculation), for the initial 3 h (b; entry phase, 1 h during
virus inoculation + 2 h after inoculation), or for the last 22 h (c; post-entry phase,
including replication).

In this analysis, RDV, a reported replication inhibitor (Wang

et al., 2020), had no inhibitory effect when applied during the initial 3 h (Fig. 3B,
lane 5), but it decreased viral RNA in the post-entry phase (Fig. 3B, lane 6).

By

contrast, MFQ remarkably reduced viral RNA levels to under 3% when applied at the
entry phase (Fig. 3B, lane 8), but showed much lower antiviral activity (to 24%)
when treated after the first round of viral entry (Fig. 3B, lane 9).

The viral RNA

reduction by MFQ in lane 9 was likely to the inhibition of second round of infection
and thereafter of the produced virus, which occurred during the 22 h.
suggest that MFQ inhibits the entry process of SARS-CoV-2.

We further examined the virus entry using a pseudovirus carrying the Spike

but not the following processes.

After washing the unattached virus and

compounds, we extracted and quantified the viral RNA on the cell surface.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus attached the surface of the cell was drastically
reduced in the presence of heparin, an entry inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2, used as a
positive control (Tandon et al., 2020; Tree et al., 2020), while that was not
affected

by

MFQ

treatment

(Fig.

3C).

However,

MFQ

inhibited

the

post-attachment phase, ranging from the membrane fusion to virus production (Fig.
3D):

Virus-attached cells were prepared by incubation with a large amount of

virus (MOI of 1.5, more than 1,000-fold higher than used in other normal infection
assay) at 4°C for 1 h followed by washing.

The cells were transferred to 37°C for

6 h in the presence or absence of compounds to induce membrane fusion and
quantified.

MFQ clearly reduced the viral RNA levels to almost the same as those

when treatment with E-64d, a lysosomal/cytosolic cysteine protease inhibitor
reported to inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020)
(Fig. 3D).

protein derived from SARS-CoV-2 or the envelope proteins of hepatitis C virus
(HCV), another RNA virus unrelated to coronavirus (Fig. 3E, Supplementary

Materials and Methods). These pseudoviruses can evaluate the entry mediated by
these Spike or envelope proteins (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Bartosch et al., 2003).
The pseudovirus assay showed that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-dependent viral entry was
significantly inhibited by the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat, and by MFQ to similar
levels to those of E-64d (Fig. 3E, left).

However, the assay sensitivity itself was

relatively lower than the SARS-CoV-2 infection assay.

Meanwhile, HCV

envelope-mediated entry was not affected by MFQ, in contrast to the reduced
entry caused by bafilomycin A1, a reported HCV entry inhibitor (Fig. 3E, right).
These results cumulatively suggest that MFQ inhibited the post-attachment
SARS-CoV-2 Spike-dependent entry process.

Combination treatment with multiple agents with different modes of action is a
strategy to improve the outcome of antiviral treatments, including those against
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV (Koizumi et al., 2017; Shen et al.,
2008).

We, therefore, examined the combination of MFQ and a representative

anti-SARS-CoV replication inhibitor, Nelfinavir (NFV) (Yamamoto et al., 2004).
NFV has been suggested to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication thorough binding with
the SARS-CoV-2 main protease by docking simulation (Ohashi et al., 2020).
Following the experimental scheme in Fig. 1A, we treated cells with paired
compounds at varying concentrations for 24 h and quantified viral RNA in the
cultured supernatant by real-time RT-PCR in addition to cell viability by a high
content image analyzer (Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Viral RNA levels

were reduced by a single treatment of either MFQ or NFV in a dose-dependent
manner, and these was further reduced by combination treatment without any
cytotoxicity (Fig. 4A).

Bliss independence-based synergy plot showed a

synergistic antiviral effect in wide concentration ranges, especially at higher doses
(Fig. 4B, orange indicates synergistic effect).

3.5. Mathematical prediction of the Mefloquine treatment in clinical settings.
Clinical

pharmacokinetics

data

for

MFQ,

including

the

maximum

drug

concentration (Cmax) in the plasma, half-life, area under the curve for drug
concentration, and the distribution to the lung, are reported (Desjardins et al.,
1979; Karbwang and White, 1990; Jones et al., 1994).

Mathematical modeling

combined with pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the viral dynamics model
described in Materials and Methods (Ohashi et al., 2020) predicted the
dynamics of viral load after MFQ administration (1,000 mg, once) in patients (Fig.
5A, red) and the corresponding time-dependent antiviral activity of MFQ (Fig. 5B).
The high antiviral potential and the long half-life of MFQ (more than 400 h)
(Desjardins et al., 1979; Karbwang and White, 1990) were predicted to exert a
continuous antiviral effect and a resulting decline of viral load (Fig. 5A).
Cumulative viral load, which is the area under the curve for the viral load over the
time course, was calculated to be reduced by 6.98% (Fig. 5C).

The time until the

viral load declines beneath the detectable level is 15.2 days without treatment, but
it was calculated to be shortened to 9.10 days after MFQ treatment (Fig. 5D).
These analyses predict the effectiveness of MFQ to reduce the viral load at clinical
drug concentrations.

4. Discussion
Given the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and the in vivo effect on the related
coronaviruses (Ko et al., 2020; Weston et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Liu et al.,
2020), Chloroquine and HCQ have been expected to be effective as anti-COVID-19
drugs.

However, accumulative data have not provided sufficient evidence

supporting a preferable clinical outcome (Funnell et al., 2020).

The IC50, IC90 and

IC99 for HCQ calculated in this study were 1.94, 7.96 and 37.2 µM, respectively,
consistent with the IC50 values at µM ranges examined in other studies (Liu et al.,
2020; Touret et al., 2020; Gendrot et al., 2020; Hattori et al., 2020).
Pharmacokinetics analyses in healthy volunteers receiving oral administration of
200 mg HCQ demonstrated a Cmax in the blood of 0.49-0.55 µM (McLachlan et al.,
1993), lower than the concentration ranges having significant anti-SARS-CoV-2

proteases,

Recently, it has been

reported that the sensitivity to viral entry inhibitors such as Chloroquine, HCQ and
a TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat depends on cell types, so that recommended not to
rely only on widely used Vero cell line, but to use rather TMPRSS2-complemented
Vero cells, Calu-3 cells or presumably primary respiratory/lung cell culture in an
air-liquid interface system or organoids as a more physiologically relevant model for
airway epithelial cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Suzuki et al., 2020).

Due to the

poor availability of primary cells, we employed VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells in
this study, and discovered that MFQ inhibited the viral entry more potently than
HCQ in these TMPRSS2-expressing cells.

Importantly, standard MFQ treatment

given to healthy volunteers achieved a plasma Cmax of 4.58 µM with a long half-life
(more than 400 h) (Karbwang and White, 1990), which is within concentration
ranges exerting significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro.

Moreover, it has

been reported that the MFQ concentration in the lung was over 10-fold that of the
blood in MFQ-treated human participants (Jones et al., 1994), expecting an even
higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of MFQ.

Our mathematical model analysis (Fig. 5)

quantified this prediction, demonstrating a clear reduction in both cumulative viral

cells) with a single readout (viral RNA or CPE) at only one experimental condition
without mechanistic analysis.

In the present study, in addition to the comparing

the activity of MFQ with HCQ and other analogs side-by-side, we characterized the
modes of action and combination treatments.

Furthermore, we addressed the

clinical antiviral efficacy of MFQ by mathematical prediction, a significant scientific
novelty.

Our time-of-addition, virus-cell attachment, post attachment and

pseudovirus assays suggest that MFQ inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 entry phase after
attachment, including the viral Spike cleavage/membrane fusion and the following
translocation to the replication complex.

Detailed analysis of the mode of action is

the object of future studies.

but without an in vivo infection model.

To date, SARS-CoV-2 studies have used

models including hACE2-transgenic mice, ferrets, cats, hamsters, nonhuman
primates and mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (Bao et al., 2020;
Jiang et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020;
Golden et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Richard et al., 2020; Sia et al.,
2020; Imai et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Rockx et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020;
Yu et al., 2020b; Gu et al., 2020).

However, except for antibodies or vaccine

candidates, there are very limited reports at present successfully confirming the
reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in these models by treatment with drug
candidates (Park et al., 2020).

At this time, however, proposing an additional

treatment choice with significant antiviral evidences is urgently demanded to
combat COVID-19.

Interestingly, MFQ showed a synergistic effect combined with

a replication inhibitor for SARS-associated coronavirus, NFV (Yamamoto et al.,
2004; Ohashi et al., 2020) (Fig. 4).

These data would prospect better clinical

outcomes by combined drugs with different modes of action, as used with antiviral
therapy against HIV and HCV (Koizumi et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2008).
inhibition of viral entry, MFQ is also expected for prophylactic use.

Given the

Its long half-life

of approximately 20 days is advantageous for achieving a long-lasting antiviral
state by a single oral administration.

Consequently, our analysis highlights the

anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency of MFQ, of which efficacy is expected to be further
evaluated in the future through in vivo or clinical testing.

Compounds were treated at three different times: (a) w hole:

throughout the assay for 25 h, (b) entry: for the initial 3 h to evaluate the effect
on the viral entry process and (c) post-entry: for the last 22 h to evaluate the
effect on viral replication/re-infection.

VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were exposed to virus at an

MOI of 0.001 at 4°C for 5 min with 50 µM MFQ or 100 U/mL Heparin, a SARS-CoV-2
After washing the unbound virus,

cell surface-attached virus was extracted and quantified by real-time RT-PCR.
Post-attachment assay.

(D)

For evaluating the activity after virus attachment, from

membrane fusion to virus secretion, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells preincubated with the
virus at an MOI of 1.5 at 4°C for 1 h to allow virus attachment were treated with
compounds for 6 h at 37°C.

Extracellular viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR.

E-64d, a cysteine protease inhibitor, was used as a positive control.
