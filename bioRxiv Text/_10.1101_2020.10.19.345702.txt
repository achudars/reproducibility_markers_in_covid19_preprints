Abstract

27

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging and highly

28

transmissible disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-

29

CoV-2). Understanding the microbiomes associated with the upper respiratory tract infection

30

(URTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 diseases has clinical

31

interest. We hypothesized that the diversity of microbiome compositions and their genomic

32

features are associated with different pathological conditions of these human respiratory tract

33

diseases (COVID-19 and non-COVID; URTI and COPD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 21

34

whole metagenome sequences (WMS) including eleven COVID-19 (BD = 6 and China = 5), six

35

COPD (UK = 6) and four URTI (USA = 4) samples to unravel the diversity of microbiomes, their

36

genomic features and relevant metabolic functions. The WMS data mapped to 534 bacterial, 60

37

archaeal and 61 viral genomes with distinct variation in the microbiome composition across the

38

samples (COVID-19>COPD>URTI). Notably, 94.57%, 80.0% and 24.59% bacterial, archaeal and

39

viral genera shared between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples, respectively, however, the

40

COVID-19 related samples had sole association with 16 viral genera other than SARS-CoV-2.

41

Strain-level virome profiling revealed 660 and 729 strains in COVID-19 and non-COVID

42

sequence data, respectively and of them 34.50% strains shared between the conditions. Functional

43

annotation of metagenomics sequences of thevCOVID-19 and non-COVID groups identified the

44

association of several biochemical pathways related to basic metabolism (amino acid and energy),

45

ABC transporters, membrane transport, replication and repair, clustering-based subsystems,

46

virulence, disease and defense, adhesion, regulation of virulence, programmed cell death, and

47

primary immunodeficiency. We also detected 30 functional gene groups/classes associated with

48

resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds (RATC) in both COVID-19 and non-COVID

microbiomes. Furthermore, a predominant higher abundance of cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance

50

(CZCR) and multidrug resistance to efflux pumps (MREP) genes were detected in COVID-19

51

metagenome. The profiles of microbiome diversity and associated microbial genomic features

52

found in both COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI) samples might be helpful for

53

developing the microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and non-COVID

54

respiratory diseases. However, future studies might be carried out to explore the microbiome

55

dynamics and the cross-talk between host and microbiomes employing larger volume of samples

56

from different ethnic groups and geoclimatic conditions.

Introduction

61

The pneumonia like respiratory illness (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe

62

Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan city of

63

China in December, 2019. The disease unprecedentedly spread across 216 countries and/or

64

territories of the globe within months (He et al., 2020; Hoque et al., 2020a; Petersen et al., 2020;

65

Rahman et al., 2020a). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic as a public

66

health emergency of international concern. Metagenomic RNA sequencing of COVID-19

67

suspected patient’s sample suggested the etiology as a new RNA virus belonging to Coronaviridae

68

and later designated as SARS-CoV-2 (Hoque et al., 2020a; Lam et al., 2020). This virus can easily

69

undergo mutation and recombination to adapt diverse environment (Islam et al., 2020), and thus

70

survive by altering a wide host range causing constant and long-term health threats (Paules et al.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.19.345702; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

71

2020). Furthermore, COVID-19 has not only devastated the public health, but also posed an

72

immense impact on human activities at the societal, economical, and geopolitical levels.

73

The human health services have also been adversely affected by the prevalence,

74

recognition, and management of other non-COVID respiratory diseases including upper

75

respiratory tract infection (URTI), asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

76

(Stolz et al., 2019; Lippi and Henry, 2020). Although, SARS-CoV-2 affects different people in

77

different ways, most common clinical features include fever, dry cough, tiredness, sore throat,

78

diarrhea, difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, and loss of speech

79

or movement (Hoque et al., 2020a; Islam et al., 2020), many of these symptoms are common in

80

URTI and COPD. The inhaled SARS-CoV-2 virus particle likely binds to epithelial cells in the

81

nasal cavity, starts replicating, migrates down the respiratory tract along the conducting airways,

82

and a more robust innate immune response is triggered (Mason, 2020). Therefore, it can assume

83

that during this propagation, migration and immune response, the microbiomes throughout the

84

respiratory airways could be altered or changed, and some of them can further aggravate the

85

disease process. Recent meta-analysis demonstrated that COPD is the most strongly predictive

86

comorbidity of COVID-19 severity, and is associated with more than five-fold increased risk of

87

COVID-19 infection (Lippi and Henry, 2020). Therefore, patients with a history of non-COVID

88

respiratory diseases such as URTI, asthma and COPD, would be anticipated to have an increased

89

risk of infection (Halpin et al., 2020).

90

The use of whole metagenome sequencing (WMS), which generates simultaneously

91

genome reads from both prokaryotic cells and viruses, has promoted the microbiome studies

92

effectively by recovering bacterial, archaeal, viral and phage genomes from metagenomes of

93

ecological and clinical samples (Mathieu et al., 2018; Hoque et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019; Hoque

94

et al., 2020b; Hoque et al., 2020c). However, only limited studies have been carried out using high-

95

throughput metagenomics sequencing of the of SARS-CoV-2 infected samples (Lam et al., 2020;

96

Wahba et al., 2020). Using this approach, the taxonomic and functional compositions of

97

microbiomes, and the host-microbiomes interactions could be revealed in COVID-19 and non-

98

COVID respiratory disease (URTI and COPD)-associated microbiomes.

99

Human health is the outcome of the complex interactions between the inhabiting

100

microbiome and its human host (Kumpitsch et al., 2019). The compositional and functional

101

perturbations of the microbiome can occur at different body sites, and thus, the microbiome

102

dysbiosis can reduce the beneficial and/or commensal bacteria, and favors growth of the

103

opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (Kumpitsch et al., 2019; Hoque et al., 2020b). During COVID-

104

19, and non-COVID respiratory diseases (URTI and COPD), a paradigm shifts in microbiome

105

compositions and their diversity might be observed due to the emergence of particular dominant

106

bacteria in lungs and/or respiratory tract (Hahn et al., 2018; Mathieu et al., 2018; Wypych et al.,

107

2019). The microbial community of the respiratory tract and lung is continually being renewed

108

and replaced, and displays greater variations in both taxonomic composition and diversity

109

(Mathieu et al., 2018; Wypych et al., 2019). Even though bacteria, archaea, viruses, and

110

bacteriophages represent a significant part of the respiratory tract associated microbial

111

communities, to get a deeper understanding of these microbes remains challenging due to the

112

difficulties in their isolation, identification, and characterization. Viruses are essential constituents

113

of microbial communities contributing to their homeostasis and evolution. The viral community

114

in the human gut microbiome is dominated by bacteriophages (Dutilh et al., 2014). Phages can

115

modulate the structure and function of a bacterial community through horizontal gene transfer

116

(HGT), thereby altering the bacterial phenotypes including virulence, antibiotic resistance, and

117

biofilm formation (Huddleston, 2014; Hoque et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019). Moreover, phage-

118

induced alterations could pose potential health risks by influencing bacterial pathogenicity and

119

antibiotic resistance (Zheng et al., 2019).

120

A large body of literature is available on characterization of the clinical features of the

121

COVID-19 patients, the genomic features including structure, composition, evolution, and

122

genome-wide variations in different strains of SARS-CoV-2, and to develop effective vaccine

123

candidates and therapeutics to halt this pandemic disease (Chen et al., 2020; Hoque et al., 2020a;

124

Huang et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2020a; Rahman et al., 2020b; Rahman et al., 2020c). Moreover,

125

several preliminary studies suggested that the composition of a person’s gut microbiome may be

126

predictive of developing severe symptoms of SARS-CoV2 infections (Chen et al., 2020; He et al.,

127

2020). However, little is known about the potential role of nasopharyngeal and lung microbiomes,

128

and their biological mechanisms for the variable susceptibility to the respiratory diseases. To

129

address the above unresolved question, we investigated the composition, and diversity of

130

microbiomes associated with COVID-19, and non COVID diseases (URTI and COPD). We

131

identified core respiratory microbiota which predicted the proteomic biomarkers of COVID-19

132

and non-COVID respiratory diseases using high throughput metagenomics sequencing of 21

133

samples. We conducted further metabolomics analysis to unravel potential biological mechanisms

134

linking microbiome changes, SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, and host disease state. This reports

135

for the first time describe the association of a diverse groups of microbiotas (bacteria, archaea and

136

viruses) and their concomitant genomic features in COVID-19 and non-COVID (URTI and

137

COPD) diseases, and discusses their roles the pathophysiology of these diseases.

140

The nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients presenting with potential

141

COVID-19 infections following the guidance of the Director General of Health Services of

142

Bangladesh. A single dry swab was inserted through one nostril straight back (NOT upwards),

143

along the floor of the nasal passage up to the posterior wall of the nasopharynx, and rubbed against

144

and above the nasal turbinate. The swab was rotated a few times against the nasal wall before

145

removing. A second swab was used to abrade the tonsils and pharynx. The swabs were placed in

146

sample collection vial containing normal saline, and preserved at -80 °C until further use for RNA

147

extraction. The confirmatory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections were made by RT-qPCR (Péré

148

et al., 2020).

149

RNA extraction, metagenomics library preparation and sequencing

150

We further intended to characterize the microbial community present along with the SARS-

151

CoV-2 virus in the nasopharyngeal specimens of COVID-19 patients through whole metagenome

152

sequencing (WMS). We utilized total RNA-Seq approach for metagenomics study, and total RNA

153

was extracted from five (n=5) COVID-19 positive patients using TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent

154

following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from isolated total RNA

155

using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s

156

instructions where first strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase

157

(Thermo Fisher), and random primers (Visnovska et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020). Paired-end (2 x

158

150 bp reads) sequencing of the RNA library was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500

159

platform. RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing were carried out at the Basic and

160

Applied Research on Jute Project, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

162

In addition to our five COVID-19 metagenome sequences, we retrieved six (n=6) Chinese

163

COVID-19 metagenome sequences from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology

164

Information) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (Accession numbers: SRX7705831-

165

SRX7705836), four (n=4) shotgun metagenome sequences of human URTI belonged to CDC,

166

USA from the NCBI (Accession numbers: SRR10252885, SRR10252888, SRR10252889 and

167

SRR10252892 under bio-project: PRJNA573045), and six (n=6) metagenome sequences of human

168

COPD from the European Nucleotide Archive, UK (Accession numbers: ERR2732537,

169

ERR2732541, ERR2732559, ERR2732558, ERR2732551 and ERR2732550 under bio-project:

170

PRJEB14074). Therefore, the current metagenome study included 21 sequences including 11

171

COVID-19 (BD=5, China=6) and 10 non-COVID (USA=4, UK=6) sequences to investigate the

172

microbiome diversity and composition, and metabolic functional potentials associated with

173

COVID 19 (BD and China), and non-COVID respiratory diseases (COPD; UK and URTI; USA).

174

Taxonomic mapping, classification, diversity and community analysis

175

The shotgun WMS data were analyzed using the assembly-based hybrid method MG-

176

RAST (release version 4.1) (Glass et al., 2010). The paired-end FASTQ files were concatenated

177

and filtered through BBDuk (Stewart et al., 2018) (with options k = 21, mink = 6, ktrim = r, ftm =

178

5, qtrim = rl, trimq = 20, minlen = 30, overwrite = true) to remove Illumina adapters, known

179

Illumina artifacts, and phiX. Any sequence below these thresholds or reads containing more than

180

one ‘N’ were discarded. In the current study, 46.04 million reads in two metagenomes with an

181

average of 2.19 million reads per sample passed the quality control steps (Supplementary Data 1).

182

The trimmed sequences were uploaded to the MG-RAST server with properly embedded metadata

183

and were subjected to optional quality filtering with dereplication and host DNA removal, and

184

finally screening for taxonomic and functional assignment. Alpha diversity (diversity within

185

samples) was estimated using the observed species, and Shannon diversity indices (Koh, 2018)

186

MG-RAST read assignments and counts. To visualize differences in bacterial diversity, principal

187

coordinate analysis (PCoA; at genus level) was performed based on the Bray-Curtis distance

188

method (Beck et al., 2013). Taxonomic abundance was determined by applying the ‘‘Best Hit

189

Classification’’ option using the NCBI database as a reference with the following settings:

190

maximum e-value of 1x10-30; minimum identity of 80% for bacteria, 60% for archaea and viruses,

191

and a minimum alignment length of 20 as the set parameters. A ‘target’ genome library was

192

constructed containing all viral sequences from the NCBI RefSeq Release 201 database

193

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information)

194

Kraken 2 (Wood et al., 2019), and the metagenomics reads were then aligned against the target

195

library using the BWA algorithm (Jaillard et al., 2016). Finally, the PathoScope 2 was used for

196

strain level taxonomic assignment of the viruses (Hong et al., 2014). In all of the bioinformatics

197

analysis, the Chinese sequences were used only as forward sequences.

198

Functional profiling of the microbiomes

208

prokaryotic metagenomes available in MG-RAST database for statistical analyses. The gene

209

counts were normalized by dividing the number of gene hits to individual taxa/function by total

210

number of gene hits in each metagenome to remove bias due to differences in sequencing efforts.

211

To identify differentially abundant SEED or KEGG functions, and resistance to antibiotics and

212

toxic compounds (RATCs) across the four sampling locations (BD, China, UK and USA),

213

statistical tests were applied with non-parametric test Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test at different

KEGG and SEED subsystems levels IBM SPSS (SPSS, Version 23.0, IBM Corp., NY, USA).

215

Results

216

Microbiome diversity and compositions in COVID-19 and non-COVID samples

217

The COVID-19 disease significantly affected the diversity (Shannon estimated alpha

218

diversity, P=0.036, Kruskal-Wallis test) and composition (Bray-Curtis distance estimated beta

219

diversity, P=0.021, Kruskal-Wallis test) of respiratory tract microbiome (Fig. 1). The rarefaction

220

curves showed that sequencing depth was sufficient to capture the entire microbial diversity among

221

the samples of the study (Fig. S1). Both the number of identified microbial taxa and Shannon

222

estimated alpha diversity were significantly higher in COVID-19 samples (BD and China) than

223

the non-COVID (UK and USA) samples (Fig. 1A). The principal coordinate analysis based on

224

Bray-Curtis distances showed distinct separations among the four sampling locations (Bangladesh,

225

China, USA, and UK) (Fig. 1B). Notably, the COVID-19 related samples (BD and China)

226

remained more similar than the URTI and COPD-associated samples from the USA and UK (Fig.

227

1B). Moreover, across the non-COVID respiratory diseases (URTI and COPD)-associated samples

228

of UK and USA, all of the samples clustered more closely than those of COVID-19 samples (BD

229

and China) indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infections are associated with diverse secondary

230

microbial communities (Fig. 1B).

231

The composition of COVID-19 (BD and China) and non-COVID respiratory disease

232

(URTI; USA and COPD; UK)-related microbiomes at the domain level was dominated by bacteria,

233

with a relative abundance of >99.50, followed by archaea (~ 0.3%), and viruses (~0.2%) (Data

234

S1). Twenty-eight bacterial phyla were identified in COVID-19 (BD and China), and non-COVID

235

(UK and USA) metagenomes including 28, 10, 28 and 27 phyla in BD, China, UK and USA

236

samples, respectively (Data S1). A total of 534 bacterial genera were detected across the four

237

sample locations including 527, 306, 512 and 443 in BD, China, UK and USA samples,

238

respectively (Fig. 2A, Data S1). About 95% (505/534) of the detected bacterial genera shared in

239

both COVID-19 and non-COVID diseases, and only 22 genera had unique association with

240

COVID-19 disease (Fig. 2 A, Data S1). In addition to bacteria, 60 archaeal and 61 viral genera

241

were detected, and of them 48, 10, 60 and 31 archaeal genera (Fig. S2B), and 31, 5, 36 and 18 viral

242

genera (Fig. S2C) were identified in BD, China, UK and USA, respectively. Of the detected

243

archaeal genera, majority of the genera (80.0%) were found to be shared in both sample groups,

244

and only 20.0% (12/60) archaeal genera had unique association with non-COVID diseases (Fig.

245

2B, Data S1). Similarly, 26.23% and 49.18% of the detected viral genera had unique association

246

with COVID-19 and non-COVID diseases, respectively, and 24.59% genera were found to be

247

shared between the conditions (Fig. 2C, Data S1). The strain level profiling of the viral

248

communities revealed 1032 strains including 660 and 729 in the COVID-19 and non-COVID

249

samples, respectively (Fig. 2 D, Data S1). Of the identified strains, 303 in COVID-19 and 373 in

250

non-COVID respiratory disease samples, respectively had unique associations, and 34.50% strains

251

were found to be shared between the conditions (Fig. 2 D, Data S1).

253

The composition of bacterial phyla across the two metagenome groups varied significantly

254

(P=0.037, Kruskal-Wallis test). This diversity was represented by the predominant bacterial phyla

255

of Proteobacteria (35.59%), Tenericutes (18.09%), Actinobacteria (17.42%), Cyanobacteria

256

(11.23%), Firmicutes (7.60%), and Bacteroidetes (6.20%) in the COVID-19 metagenome, and

257

Firmicutes (56.47%), Bacteroidetes (14.59%), Actinobacteria (14.12%), and Fusobacteria

258

(2.38%) in non-COVID samples (Fig. 3; Data S1). The rest of the phyla in four geographic

259

locations had relatively lower abundances (< 1.0%) (Data S1).

260

The composition and relative abundance of the bacteria significantly differed (P = 0.029,

261

Kruskal-Wallis test) at the genus level between COVID-19 (BD and China) and non-COVID (UK

262

and URTI) disease samples. Remarkably, most of the genera had higher relative abundances in the

263

COVID-19 samples compared to the non-COVID samples (Data S1). Importantly, Staphylococcus

264

(10.39%), Nostoc (6.70%), Anabaena (4.86%), Mycobacterium (3.02%), Cyanothece (2.51%),

265

Bradyrhizobium (2.32%), Actinomyces (1.81%), Pseudomonas (1.80%), Propionibacterium

266

(1.56%), Corynebacterium (1.52%), Rhodopseudomonas (1.30%), Nodularia (1.27%),

267

Burkholderia (1.25%), Micrococcus (1.23%), Acinetobacter (1.18%), Methylobacterium (1.15%),

268

Streptomyces (1.14%), Rhodococcus (1.09%), and Rhodobacter (1.00%) were the most abundant

269

genera in COVID-19 samples (Fig. 4, Data S1). Conversely, Prevotella (18.20%), Streptococcus

270

(17.35%), Veillonella (12.64%), Rothia (9.70%), Actinomyces (7.97%), Neisseria (2.55%),

271

Fusobacterium (2.13%), Lactobacillus (1.97%), Atopobium (1.53%), Megasphaera (1.45%),

272

Porphyromonas (1.41%), Bacteroides (1.34%), Peptostreptococcus (1.28%), Clostridium

273

(1.24%), and Bifidobacterium (1.05%) were the predominantly abundant genera in non-COVID

274

(COPD and URTI) samples of the UK and USA (Fig. 4, Data S1). The rest of the genera detected

in both COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory disease group had less than 1.00% relative

276

abundances (Data S1).

277

Differences in archaea and viruses in COVID-19 and non-COVID samples

278

The archaeal and viral fractions of microbiomes in COVID-19 (BD and China), and non-

279

COVID respiratory disease (COPD; UK and URTI; USA)-samples were concomitantly detected.

280

The composition and relative abundance of these two domains varied significantly (P = 0.017,

281

Kruskal-Wallis test) between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples (Data S1). Among the

282

identified

283

Methanocaldococcus (17.76%), Thermococcus (10.30%), Methanothermobacter (8.28%),

284

Haloarcula (7.77%), Staphylothermus (6.01%), Natronomonas (5.38%), Ferroglobus (3.52%),

285

Caldivirga (3.38%), Halobacterium (2.83%), Natrialba (2.18%), Methanosphaerula (2.08% and

286

Picrophilus (2.02%) were the predominantly abundant genera in COVID-19 samples (Fig. 5, Data

287

S1). Conversely, Methanobrevibacter (10.84%), Methanococcus (10.17%), Methanocorpusculum

288

(6.97%),

289

Methanosaeta (2.55%), Archaeoglobus (2.48%), Methanospirillum (2.40%) and Methanoculleus

290

(2.26%) were the most abundant archaeal genera in the non-COVID respiratory disease associated

291

samples (Fig. 5, Data S1). Though the rest of the archaeal genera had lower relative abundances

292

(< 2.0%) across the samples of both categories, however, their abundances always remained higher

in COVID-19 related BD and non-COVID associated UK (COPD) samples (Fig. 5, Data S1).

while the relative abundance of this genus was 39.78% in the non-COVID samples. In addition,

Siphovirus (33.17%), Alphapapillomavirus (12.01%) and Myovirus (7.16%) were the most

298

predominant viral genera in non-COVID samples (Fig. 6, Data S1). Rest of the viral genera

299

detected across the both sample groups had lower relative abundances (<1.0%) (Data S1). The

300

COVID-19 samples from BD and China had sole association of 16 viral genera (other than

301

betacoronavirus), and of them, Tombusvirus, Victorivirus, Partitivirus, Chrysovirus and Totivirus

302

were the most abundant genera (Data S2).

303

Complex microbial communities can harbor multiple strains of the same species which was

304

evident in the present study since the strains of associated viral genera varied significantly (P =

305

0.033, Kruskal-Wallis test) between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples. The relative

306

abundances of the identified viral strains also varied between the sample categories since the

307

COVID-19 related samples had the single most predominantly abundant (63.78%) strain of

308

SARS-CoV-2, and this strain was not detected in the non-COVID samples. The COVID-19 related

309

samples of BD and China also possessed Choristoneura fumiferana granulovirus (13.17%),

310

Shamonda orthobunyavirus (3.64%) and Tupaiid betaherpesvirus 1 (1.46%) (Fig. 7A, Data S1).

311

On the other hand, Simbu orthobunyavirus (13.26%), Proteus phage VB_PmiS-Isfahan (11.37%),

312

Mycobacterium phage Enkosi (9.22), BeAn 58058 virus (8.27%), Kaisodi virus (5.00%),

313

Mycobacterium phage Phrux (3.33%), Beilong virus (2.88%), Mollivirus sibericum (2.77%),

314

Oxbow virus (2.21%) and Micromonas sp. RCC1109 virus MpV1 (2.1%) were the top abundant

315

viral strains in non-COVID samples of UK and USA (Fig. 7B, Data S1). Phylogenetic analysis

316

revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 strain found in COVID-19 patients showed neighboring

317

relationship to SARS Coronavirus Tor2, Beihai hermit crab virus 4 and Penicillium

318

aurantiogriseum partitivirus 1 (Fig. 7A).

320

By comparing the number of genes assigned to each KEGG pathway among the groups,

321

we found a series of significant differences (P=0.006, Kruskal-Wallis test) that lead to the

322

functional divergence in the COVID-19 (BD and China), and non-COVID respiratory disease

323

(COPD; UK and URTI; USA)-associated microbiomes. In the comparative analysis of predicted

324

KEGG orthology (KO), we found that the COVID-19 associated microbiomes harbored relatively

325

higher abundance of genes coding for amino acid metabolism (55.23%; BD=63.79% and

326

China=76.67%), energy metabolism (11.01%; BD=9.81% and China=12.22%), membrane

327

transport (68.00%; BD=62.09% and China=73.90%), ABC transporters (67.89%; BD=89.91% and

328

China=65.87%), replication and repair (28.74%; BD=23.25% and China=34.23%), flagellar

329

assembly (42.22%; BD=35.31% and China=49.13%), and primary immunodeficiency diseases

330

(56.18%; BD=71.11% and China=63.24%) compared to the non-COVID related microbiomes of

331

COPD (UK) and URTI (USA)-associated metagenomes (Fig. 8A, Data S2). On the other hand, the

332

non-COVID respiratory disease (COPD and URTI)-associated microbiomes had over expression

333

of genes coding for oxidative phosphorylation (61.30%; UK=67.22% and USA=55.38%), signal

334

transduction (50.91%; UK=46.08% and USA=75.74%), infectious diseases (59.95%; UK=67.11%

335

and USA=52.79%), bacterial chemotaxis (53.79%; UK=85.00% and USA=22.58%), and bacterial

microbiomes (Fig. 8A, Data S2).

The SEED subsystems in the COVID-19 (BD and China) and non-COVID (COPD; UK

339

and URTI; USA)-related microbial communities significantly (P=0.024, Kruskal-Wallis test)

340

varied. The COVID-19 related microbiomes had relatively higher abundance of genes encoding

341

for pathogenicity islands (21.55%; BD=18.69% and China=24.42%), clustering-based subsystems

342

(21.15%; BD=22.23% and China=20.07%), regulation of virulence (20.34%; BD=24.41% and

347

stress (48.75%; UK=41.89%, USA=65.60%), periplasmic stress (6.49%; UK=10.40%,

349

(2.88%; UK=1.70%, USA=4.06%), and phages, prophages and transposable elements (1.26%;

351

352

microbiomes (Fig. 8B, Data S2).

353

Differences in resistomes composition in microbiomes of COVID-19 and non-COVID

354

samples

355

The resistome analysis of the COVID-19 (BD and China) and non-COVID (UK and USA)-

356

associated microbiomes, the SEED module of the MG-RAST pipeline provided a comprehensive

357

scenario. Using SEED, 150,146 reads mapped to 30 resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds

358

(RATC) functional groups across the sample across the four geographic regions, with different

359

relative abundances (Data S2). The RATC genes were classified into two unique groups such as

360

antibiotic resistance (n=17) and toxic metal resistance (n=13) group. Among the RATC functional

361

groups, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance (CZCR) had higher relative abundances in COVID-19

362

microbiomes (23.69%; BD=25.85%, China=21.53%) compared to non-COVID (10.34%;

363

UK=11.75%, USA=8.92%) microbiomes (Fig. 9, Data S2). Moreover, the RATC functional genes

associated microbiomes than the non-COVID respiratory disease (COPD and URTI) causing

microbiomes (Fig. 9; Data S2). Conversely, gens coding for resistance to fluoroquinolones (RFL)

378

(2.07%; UK=2.91%, USA=1.23%) were found to be over expressed in the COPD and URTI-

379

associated non-COVID microbiomes (Fig. 9, Data S2). Rest of the RATC genes detected in both

metagenomes also varied in their relative abundances.

382

The present study represents a proof-of-concept to decipher changes in microbiome

383

compositions and diversity in COVID-19 (BD and China), and non-COVID related chronic

384

obstructive pulmonary disease; COPD (UK), and upper respiratory tract infection; URTI (USA).

385

Several recent studies showed that COVID-19 is associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiomes

386

(Dhar and Mohanty, 2020; Zuo et al., 2020). Respiratory tract especially lung microbiome is more

387

dynamic and transient than that of the gastrointestinal tract because of bidirectional movement of

388

air and mucus (Huffnagle et al., 2017). This makes it plausible that SARS-CoV-2 infections could

389

lead to abnormal inflammatory reactions to worsen the symptoms of COVID-19. The microbiome

390

diversity (alpha and beta diversity) measures revealed higher microbial diversity in COVID-19

391

samples which remained more similar than the URTI and COPD-associated samples from the USA

392

and UK. Regardless of higher taxonomic abundances, the COVID-19-associated microbiomes

393

remained inconsistent and fluctuates more within BD and China metagenomes than those of UK

394

and USA samples. In a recent study, Zou et al. (2020) reported that loss of salutary species in

395

COVID-19 persisted in most patients despite clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and is associated

396

with a more long-lasting detrimental effect to the gut microbiome.

397

In the present study, although the dominant microbial phyla showed no significant

398

difference between two groups, COVID-19 still affected the prevalence of some microbes

399

belonging to Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria corroborating the recent findings of Khatiwada

400

and Subedi (2020). To be specifically, in COVID-19 samples of BD and China, the abundance of

401

Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, and Cyanobacteria were significantly higher. Conversely,

402

Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria were the predominant phyla in

403

COPD and URTI samples of UK and USA, respectively. These findings are accorded with

404

previous studies of respiratory tract disease associated microbiome dysbiosis (Singh et al., 2017;

405

Hahn et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). The healthy respiratory tract and lungs microbiomes are mostly

406

represented by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla (Khatiwada and Subedi, 2020)

407

suggesting inclusion of other predominant opportunistic phyla such as Tenericutes,

408

Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria in the COVID-19 metagenomes of BD and

409

China. The COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI)-patients had an enrichment of

410

pathogenic and commensal bacteria, indicating a degree of microbial changes in diseased states.

411

We demonstrated that in the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, some genera including

Staphylococcus, Nostoc, Anabaena, Mycobacterium, Cyanothece, Bradyrhizobium, Actinomyces,

413

Pseudomonas,

414

Burkholderia, Micrococcus, Acinetobacter, Methylobacterium, Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, and

415

Rhodobacter had higher relative abundances compared to the non-COVID samples. The changes

416

in the composition and relative abundances of the microbiomes in the respiratory tract is associated

417

with many vital body functions such as immune regulation and pathogenesis (Kumpitsch et al.,

418

2019), and might be associated with the COVID-19 exacerbations.

Corynebacterium,

Rhodopseudomonas,

Nodularia,

419

The pathophysiology of an inflammation plays an important role in destroying the invading

420

microbes, and thereby protecting the commensal organisms (Hoque et al., 2020b), but unregulated

421

inflammation is an underlying cause of many chronic diseases like COPD. Our findings

422

demonstrated that the non-COVID related COPD and URTI patients had the higher relative

423

abundance of certain dominant bacterial genera including Prevotella, Streptococcus, Veillonella,

424

Rothia, Actinomyces, Neisseria, Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Atopobium, Megasphaera,

425

Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium, and Bifidobacterium. The

426

inflammatory mediators are associated with parts of dominant microbiome in in the lungs, which

427

suggesting that inflammation might impair the structure of growth environment of microbiome

428

and the microbiome changes might in turn promoted the COPD (Ditz et al., 2020) and URTI (Man

429

et al., 2017) inflammations. The upper respiratory tract is generally considered to be a major

430

reservoir for potential pathogens, including Streptococcus, Veillonella, Pseudomonas,

431

Clostridium, Rothia, and Neisseria, to expand and subsequently spread towards the lungs, which

432

could potentially lead to a chronic infection like COPD (Man et al., 2017; Ditz et al., 2020). The

433

findings of the present study suggested that bacteriome composition in COVID-19 and non-

434

COVID associated COPD and URTI might be similar at phylum level, however, could vary

435

significantly at genus and strain levels which might be related to the age, gender, weight, food

436

habit, and different living environment (Wang et al., 2018). Thus, establishing and maintaining a

437

balanced microbiota in the COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory disease (URTI and COPD)

438

samples that is resilient to pathogenic expansion and invasion could prove vital for respiratory

439

health. Moreover, 94.57% bacterial genera including Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium,

440

Burkholderia, Prevotella, Streptomyces, Neisseria, Acidovorax, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus,

441

Erythrobacter, and Bacteroides shared between COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI)

442

metagenomics data suggesting their diverse role in the pathophysiology of human diseases (Man

443

et al., 2017; Ditz et al., 2020; Khatiwada and Subedi, 2020). However, the mechanisms for the

444

pathophysiology of COVID-19 and other respiratory tract diseases (non-COVID) as well as

445

specific host-microbiome interactions supporting the changes in microbiome compositions, are

446

considered below and not well-established.

447

Viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial and archaeal infections, which

448

often have a more severe clinical course (Brundage, 2006; Yildiz et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2020;

449

Zuo et al., 2020). Until now, most of the respiratory tract disease associated microbiomes reported

450

so far are limited to bacteriome composition (Man et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019;

451

Ditz et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020) while a plethora of other concomitant microbial components

452

including archaea and viruses could also be detected (Koskinen et al., 2017; Hoque et al., 2019;

453

Hoque et al., 2020b). Unlike bacteria, the diversity and composition of archaea and viruses always

454

remained much lower in COVID-19 and non-COVID (URTI and COPD) samples. The COVID-

455

19 and non-COVID related COPD samples had higher number of archaeal and viral genera with

456

significantly varied relative abundances. Among the identified archaeal components of the

457

microbiomes, the methanogenic archaea Methanosarcina was the most abundant genus in both

458

sample groups. Most methanogenic archaea coexist and interact closely with anaerobic bacteria

459

(Hoque et al., 2020b). Methanogenic archaea utilize low molecular weight compounds, such as H2

460

+ CO2, formic acid, or acetate, and therefore have symbiotic relationships with the producers of

461

these substrates. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the presence or increase in level of

462

methanogenic archaea alters the composition of the polymicrobial community thus resulting in

463

changes in virulence of the flora (Maeda et al., 2013; Hoque et al., 2020b). The viral fraction of

464

the microbiome was largely dominated by Betacoronavirus genus in the COVID-19 related

465

samples of BD and China. Conversely, the virome fraction of the non-COVID (URTI and COPD)

466

samples were mostly represented by the genera belonged to the order Caudovirales which consists

467

of the three families of tailed bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) infecting bacteria and archaea

468

(Hoque et al., 2019; Hoque et al., 2020b). The host range of Caudovirales is very broad and

469

includes all major bacterial phyla found in our samples: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria

470

and Actinobacteria. This corresponded with an increased relative abundance of these bacterial taxa

471

in COPD and URTI metagenomes. Moreover, the presence of few predominating viral genera both

472

in COVID-19 and non-COVID samples suggests that the crucial differences might be occurring at

473

the strain level, and most of the genus identified in each sample were represented by a single strain.

474

The COVID-19 related samples were dominated by a strain of betacoronavirus, the Severe Acute

475

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (not detected in non-COVID samples).

476

Notably, the other predominant viral species/strains in COVID-19 and non-COVID samples were

477

mostly represented by bacteriophages including Proteus phage VB_PmiS-Isfahan, Mycobacterium

478

phage Enkosi, Mycobacterium phage Phrux. Bacteriophages are naturally occurring viruses that

479

use bacteria as hosts, and play an extremely important part in allowing relatively harmless bacteria

480

to become pathogens (Huddleston, 2014; Hoque et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019). Recent scientific

481

researches provide evidence that bacteriophages are overlooked human pathogens, implied in the

482

triggering, and worsening of a number of human diseases (Zheng et al., 2019). The COVID-19

483

causing SARS-CoV-2 strain showed neighboring relationship to human classic coronavirus, the

484

SARS Coronavirus isolate Tor2 (SARS-CoV Tor2) corroborating with the recent findings of Hou

485

(2020) and Konno et al. (2020) (Hou, 2020; Konno et al., 2020). However, our current findings

486

demonstrated that archaea and viruses (other than SARS-CoV-2) neither cause COPD and URTI

487

directly nor play a role in the initiation of the disease process, but later, when bacterial infection

488

of the respiratory tract occurs, they replicate in the immune and epithelial cells, and may act as a

489

predisposing factor as well as a primary etiological agent for more severe URTI, and prolonged

490

disease like COPD.

491

The functional metabolome analyses provided a promising opportunity for studying

492

microbial-host interactions, and has uncovered significant differences in microbial metabolic

493

functions in COVID-19 (BD and China) and non-COVID (COPD; UK and URTI; USA) samples.

494

In this study, the COVID-19 associated microbiomes harbored relatively higher abundance of

495

genes coding for metabolism (amino acid and energy), ABC transporters, membrane transport,

496

replication and repair, clustering-based subsystems, virulence, disease and defense, adhesion,

497

regulation of virulence, programmed cell death, and primary immunodeficiency diseases

498

compared to non-COVID microbiomes. However, the specific role of these metabolic pathways

499

in the pathophysiology of the COVID-19 disease is not clearly explored still now. The metabolic

500

activities related to virulence and immunosuppression have profound impact on SARS-CoV-2

501

infections as evidenced earlier from the SARS and MERS outbreaks (Thng et al., 2020). Most

502

recently, investigators comprehensively queried the impact of the microbiome on the metabolome

503

throughout the body, and found that that the microbiota affected the metabolomics of every organ

504

(Hoque et al., 2020b; Lee-Sarwar et al., 2020; Quinn et al., 2020). The observed increased

505

abundance of genes associated with primary immune diseases (e.g., adenosine deaminase) in

506

COVID-19 and COPD pathogens is responsible for inhibition of T cell maturation and

507

lymphocytic proliferation, very low CD4 count, cell-to-cell communication and therefore could be

508

used as a selective marker for COVID-19 and COPD diagnosis (Hoque et al., 2019). We identified

509

several genes as being differentially expressed in COVID-19 microbiomes that were involved in

510

bacterial physiology, such as the bacterial secretion system by which pathogenic bacteria to secrete

511

virulence factors for host invasion (Depluverez et al., 2016). ABC transporters, which contribute

512

to substrate transport across the bacterial membrane and are related to antibiotic resistance

513

(Wilson, 2016; Zhang et al., 2020), were also enriched with differentially expressed genes in the

514

COVID-19 microbiomes.

515

The abundance and diversity of the antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC) genes in the

516

human respiratory microbiome remain poorly characterized. The microbiomes (especially

517

bacterial community) within this potential reservoir are becoming more resistant. In the context of

518

SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, interactions between the virus, the host, and resident bacteria with

519

pathogenic potential are known to complicate and worsen disease, resulting in coinfection and

520

increased morbidity and mortality of infected individuals. Recent study on antimicrobial resistance

521

and host-microbiome interaction during influenza virus infection revealed that antimicrobial

522

resistance plays important roles in the pathogenesis of influenza-associated bacterial secondary

523

infection (Zhang et al., 2020) supporting our present findings. Although we may not have a

524

complete record of past antibiotic use because antibiotics taken over-the-counter are often not

525

reported, it is also possible that some of the RATC genes overexpressed in COVID-19 samples are

526

unrelated to antibiotic use by the individuals in which these were detected and could be the result

527

of transmission of antibiotic resistant strains between individuals. Transmission of multidrug

528

resistant bacteria both within the human population and between environmental reservoirs and

529

humans is known to occur (Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2018). Some of the RATC functional groups

530

identified across the four sample locations are simply associated with multidrug resistant efflux

531

pumps that naturally function to extrude toxins and chemicals from the bacteria (Alvarez-Ortega

532

et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2020), and thus antimicrobial resistance is a secondary effect during viral

533

infections like SARS-CoV-2. However, the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its

534

interaction with the host metabolism should be investigated in a broader aspect to fully elucidate

535

the role of metabolic functional potentials in COVID-19.

536

Conclusions

537

Our metagenomics analyses revealed that COVID-19 had significant effect on the diversity

538

and composition of respiratory tract microbiomes of human. Furthermore, the COVID-19

539

associated microbiomes are rich in diversity, composition and functional capacity compared to the

540

non-COVID respiratory disease (COPD and URTI)-related microbial communities. The

541

identifiable changes in the microbiome diversity, composition and associated genomic features

542

demonstrated in this study might be associated with the development, treatment, and resolution of

543

COVID-19 disease. It also highlights the importance of understanding these associations in

544

individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus and possibly other respiratory viruses. The shared

545

bacterial, archaeal and viral genera detected in this study suggest that respiratory tract disease

546

associated microbiomes could have a profound impact on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2

547

infection and severity of the disease. Moreover, the predominantly abundant bacterial pathogens

548

along with the archaea and bacterial viruses (phages) could have important contribution for the

549

generation of immune responses against viral attack, and this secondary microbial community

550

might affect the outcome of COVID-19 disease. The correlations of the microbiome composition

551

and functional metabolomics in the progression of COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory disease

552

(COPD and URTI) determined in this study are also evidenced by the differences in the relative

553

abundances of the genes associated with resistomes (RATC) and several metabolic functional

554

pathways among them. Future studies should investigate cross-talks between host and respiratory

555

tract microbiomes in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, and correlate with the severity of this

556

disease. Furthermore, such studies would also be enhanced by the inclusion of gut microbiomes

557

sampling in addition to the COVID-19 sampling for direct testing of microbial transfer across the

558

gut-lung axis.

the RATC genes according to metagenome is shown by different colored ribbons and the relative
abundances these genes are represented by inner blue colored bars. Part of the RATC functional
groups are shared among microbes of the four metagenomes (BD, China, UK and USA), and some
are effectively undetected in the microbiomes of the other metagenomes. Abbreviations- CZCR:
