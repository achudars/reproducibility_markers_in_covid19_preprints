Abstract
Covid-19 is the most devastating pandemic of the past 100 years. A zoonotic transfer
presumably at a wildlife market introduced the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2
(sarbecovirus; beta-coronavirus), to humans in late 2019. Meanwhile, the mechanistic
details of the infection process have been largely elucidated, and structural models explain
binding of the virial spike to the human cell surface receptor ACE2. Yet, the evolutionary
trajectory that gave rise to this pathogen is poorly understood. Here we scan SARS-CoV-2
protein sequences in-silico for innovations along the evolutionary lineage starting with the
last common ancestor of coronaviruses. Substantial differences in the sets of proteins
encoded by SARS-CoV-2 and viruses outside sarbecovirus, and in their domain
architectures, indicate divergent functional demands. By contrast, sarbecoviruses
themselves are almost fully conserved at these levels of resolution. However, profiling
spike evolution on the sub-domain level using predicted linear epitopes reveals that this
protein was gradually reshaped within sarbecovirus. The only epitope that is private to
SARS-CoV-2 overlaps with the furin cleavage site. This lends phylogenetic support to the
hypothesis that a change in strategy facilitated the zoonotic transfer of SARS-CoV-2 and its
success as a human pathogen. Upon furin cleavage, spike switches from a “stealth mode”
where immunodominant ACE2 binding epitopes are largely hidden to an “attack mode”
where these epitopes are exposed. The resulting reinforcement of ACE2 binding extends
the window of opportunity for cell entry. SARS-CoV-2 variants fine-tuning this mode
switch will be particularly threatening as they optimize immune evasion.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoV) are common human and animal pathogens (Narayanan, et al. 2015;
Weiss and Navas-Martin 2005), which had historically been associated with only
considerably mild symptoms. Following two global CoV outbreaks associated with severe
acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-1 (2002) and MERS-CoV
(2012), respectively, CoVs are acknowledged as potent emerging human pathogens
(Coleman and Frieman 2014). With SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent of COVID19
(Zhou, et al. 2020b), the first coronavirus has entered the top ranks of human viral
pathogens. In only 12 months, the WHO reported worldwide 85.5 million confirmed
infections and 1.8 million deaths (https://covid19.who.int), and the socio-economic impact
is unprecedented.
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 belong to the subgenus sarbecovirus within the betacoronaviruses (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
2020). Sarbecoviruses are prevalent in bats (Hu, et al. 2017; Li, et al. 2005), and it is
general consensus that horseshoe bats act as natural reservoirs of these viruses (Cui, et al.
2019; Zhou, et al. 2020b). While SARS-CoV-1 presumably used civets as a jumping host
(Guan, et al. 2003; Li, et al. 2005; Wu, et al. 2005), the closest known relatives to SARSCoV-2 are two bat viruses. RaTG13 was isolated already in 2013 from the intermediate
horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus affinis (Zhou, et al. 2020b), and only recently RmYN02 was
identified via a metagenomics sequencing of viruses isolated from the Malayan horseshoe
bat, R. malayanus (Zhou, et al. 2020a).
The SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises 10 non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs;
Figure 1A). Four ORFs encode the structural building blocks of the virus, the nucleocapsid

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428808; this version posted January 29, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

phosphoprotein (N), the membrane glycoprotein (M), the surface glycoprotein (spike), and
the envelope protein (E). A fifth ORF holds the information for the polyproteins 1a and
1ab, which are post-translationally cleaved into 16 sub-units comprising the replication
machinery of the virus (de Wit, et al. 2016; Narayanan, et al. 2015; Ziebuhr, et al. 2000).
The precise functions of the proteins encoded by the remaining ORFs are only partly
understood, and it is assumed that they play a role in fine-tuning host interaction (Issa, et al.
2020; Li, et al. 2020a; Liu, et al. 2014; Miorin, et al. 2020; Morante, et al. 2020).
Of all proteins encoded in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the spike has received most attention.
The 1273 amino acid long, heavily glycosylated protein (Walls, et al. 2020; Walls, et al.
2016) mediates the primary interaction of the virus with its host (Walls, et al. 2020; Walls,
et al. 2017) and thus is the main target of the human immune response (Shrock, et al. 2020).
Like its ortholog in SARS-CoV-1 (Lan, et al. 2020; Li, et al. 2003) the spike interacts via
its receptor binding domain (RBD), and the receptor binding motif (RBM) therein, with the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor of the host cell (Lan, et al. 2020; Letko,
et al. 2020; Walls, et al. 2020; Wrobel, et al. 2020). The spike is organized as a homotrimer (Turonova, et al. 2020; Wrapp, et al. 2020). In each chain, the RBD can either point
down or up. Spike is in a ‘closed’ state when all RBDs are down, and it is ‘open’ when at
least one RBD is up (Wrobel, et al. 2020). During the infection process, spike can be
proteolytically cleaved into the receptor binding domain (S1) and the fusion domain (S2)
(Hoffmann, et al. 2020b; Jaimes, et al. 2020; Shang, et al. 2020a) by furin, a human
endoprotease active at multiple compartments within the trans-Golgi network and also on
the cell surface (Molloy, et al. 1999). The resulting destabilization of the trimer shifts the
balance of the receptor conformation towards an open state, which increases the binding
affinity to human ACE2 by three orders of magnitude (Wrobel, et al. 2020). Proteolytic

cleavage by the TMPRSS2 protease activates the fusion of the viral envelope with host
membranes (Hoffmann, et al. 2020a; Hoffmann, et al. 2020b; Shang, et al. 2020a; Walls, et
al. 2017). Although the initial furin cleavage is not strictly required for the infection process
(e.g. (Turonova, et al. 2020)), it enhances cell entry (Shang, et al. 2020a). Structural
analyses of the spike and of its interaction with ACE2 have meanwhile revealed the
position and identity of the residues in the receptor-binding domain that are responsible for
the tight binding between the two proteins (Lan, et al. 2020; Liu, et al. 2020; Mehdipour
and Hummer 2020; Shang, et al. 2020b; Wrobel, et al. 2020). Among all known animal
sarbecoviruses, the RBM of the pangolin virus spike shows the highest similarity (98.6%)
to RBM of SARS-CoV-2 (Liu, et al. 2020). Since pangolins are known reservoirs for betacoronaviruses, it was suspected that a recombinant between a pangolin virus and a bat virus
gave rise to SARS-CoV-2 (Lam, et al. 2020; Li, et al. 2020b; Liu, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al.
2020). However, more recently evidence accumulated that RaTG13 secondarily modified
the RBM in its spike (Boni, et al. 2020). This does not preclude pangolins as the jumping
host, but evidence in favor of a direct transmission from bats has accumulated (Boni, et al.
2020).
Since the first reported case of Covid-19 in late 2019, the understanding of how SARSCoV-2 interacts with the human host, and how the virus evolves in the human lineage
(Korber, et al. 2020) has substantially increased. Yet, the evolutionary trajectory that turned
an animal virus into a potent human pathogen remains obscure. Here we present a highresolution phylogenetic profiling analysis of the proteins encoded in the SARS-CoV-2
genome across representatives covering the diversity of the coronaviridae. Our results
reveal that sarbecoviruses are distinct from other members of the beta-coronaviruses both
with respect to the set of encoded proteins and of their domain architectures. On this level

of resolution, changes within the sarbecoviruses are scarce and provide no information
about the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. This picture changes when we use predicted linear
T-cell epitopes to scan the spike surface for genetic innovation. Here, we see a prominent
signal pointing towards a gradual reshaping of spike during virus evolution, which sheds
light on the evolutionary making of this pathogen.

Methods
Data collection
A collection of 279 virus genomes covering the currently known diversity of coronaviridae
was downloaded from the RefSeq, GenBank, ViPR, and GISAID databases (Shu and
McCauley 2017). The taxon sampling includes four subgenera of the beta-coronaviruses,
i.e., sarbecovirus harboring SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, together with closely related
strains isolated from pangolins, bats and civets, hibecovirus, nobecovirus, merbecovirus,
and embecovirus. Representatives from the alpha-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviridae
complement the taxon sampling. The list of taxa is provided in Table S1.
Phylogenetic profiling and feature architecture comparison
Phylogenetic profiles of the 10 ORFs annotated in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 were
generated with the targeted ortholog search tool fDOG (www.github.com/BIONF/fDOG)
(Ebersberger, et al. 2014) using the strain ASM985889v3 (RefSeq Assembly accession
GCF_009858895.2) as the seed. Linear protein features were annotated in the following
way: Pfam (Pfam v.33.1) (El-Gebali, et al. 2019) and SMART (Letunic, et al. 2009)
domains were annotated with hmmsearch from the HMMER package (Finn, et al. 2015),
low complexity regions were predicted with flps (Harrison 2017) and SEG (Wootton and
Federhen 1993), signal peptides with SignalP (Petersen, et al. 2011), transmembrane

domains with tmhmm (Sonnhammer, et al. 1998), and coiled-coil conformations with
COILS2 (Lupas, et al. 1991). The resulting feature architectures (FA) were compared
pairwise between the seed proteins and each of their orthologs, and feature architecture
similarity scores (FAS scores)(Koestler, et al. 2010) were computed with GreedyFAS
v.1.4.8 (https://github.com/BIONF/FAS) integrated into the fDOG package. FAS score
ranges between 0 (FAseed and FAortholog are disjunct) and 1 (FAseed = FAortholog). Featureaware phylogenetic profiles were visualized and analyzed with PhyloProfile v.1.4 (Tran, et
al. 2018).
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction
For maximum likelihood (ML) tree reconstruction, multiple sequence alignments of the
orthologous groups for S, N, and ORF1ab were created with mafft-linsi (Katoh and Toh
2008), respectively. ML trees for the individual alignments were computed with RAxML
(Stamatakis 2014), allowing the software to automatically select the best fitting substitution
model (Option PROTGAMMAAUTO). Branch support was assessed with 100 bootstrap
replicates. The viral phylogeny was then computed from the individual gene trees with
ASTRAL III (Zhang, et al. 2018).
Epitope prediction
Spike proteins were scanned for the presence of linear T-cell epitopes using the consensus
epitope prediction approach (Moutaftsi, et al. 2006; Wang, et al. 2008) provided via the
Immune Epitope Database website (http://www.iedb.org/)(Vita, et al. 2019). Major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) anchor residues in the antigen were predicted by using
the models based on reference sets for class I (Greenbaum, et al. 2011) and II (Weiskopf, et
al. 2013). The two sets were compiled such that the represented alleles cover > 97% (MHCI) and >99% (MHC-II) of the general population provided by the Allele frequency net

database (Gonzalez-Galarza, et al. 2020). Linear epitopes were filtered using a percentile
rank cutoff of 0.1 and considered homologous if the aligned region in the orthologous
sequence predicts binding affinity to the same MHC allele. Epitopes were classified
according to their node of innovation and visualized on a 3D model of the full length,
glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein embedded in a membrane (Sikora, et al. 2020)
(publicly available at 10.5281/zenodo.4442942), using the Visual Molecular Dynamics
(VMD) software v.1.9 (Humphrey, et al. 1996).
Surface accessibility analysis
Surface accessibility of the spike was reported in (Sikora, et al. 2020), and is based on an
extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a viral envelope patch
containing 4 spike proteins in realistic conditions. The analysis considers the spike’s
structural flexibility and the steric dynamic shielding by the glycans that cover the spike
surface. Accessibility analyses were done once with spikes in the conformation with 2
RBDs down and one up, and once with all RBDs down. The analysis’ raw data is publicly
available on 10.5281/zenodo.4442942.

Results
We used an evolutionary approach to shed light on the trajectory that ultimately gave rise to
SARS-CoV-2. The phylogenetic profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins across coronaviridae
(Figure 1) reveal a coronavirus core genome comprising only four ORFs (M, N, S, and the
P1). We find orthologs to the envelope protein, an essential structural and functional
constituent of the shell of all coronaviruses (Mukherjee, et al. 2020; Schoeman and Fielding
2019), only in the alpha- and beta-CoV. However, identifying distant orthologs for short
proteins—the envelope protein has a length of only 75aa—is difficult (Jain, et al. 2018),

and even more so since a conserved domain that is characteristic for the envelope protein in
alpha- and beta-CoV is missing in the envelope protein of gamma- and delta-CoV
(Schoeman and Fielding 2019). Thus, a limited sensitivity of the ortholog search (Jain, et
al. 2019) likely explains why we failed to establish orthology relationships between the
envelope proteins across all coronaviridae. A multi-gene phylogeny (Figure 2) recovers the
four genera alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-CoV as monophyletic clades, respectively, and
midpoint rooting places the alpha- and beta-coronaviruses as sister clades. Within betaCoV, embecoviruses branch off first, followed by the merbecoviruses, which harbors with
MERS the so far most aggressive human pathogen within the beta-coronaviruses (Petersen,
et al. 2020). Nobecovirus and hibecovirus represent the closest relatives of sarbecovirus.
Sarbecoviruses themselves are represented by three distinct lineages. The bat coronavirus
BM48-31 branched off prior to the diversification of the monophyletic clades harboring
SARS and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Within the latter clade, the bat virus RaTG13 is
placed stably as the closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2, followed by RmYN02, and the
paraphyletic pangolin viruses from Guangdong and Guangxi, respectively. Two further bat
viruses represent the early branching lineages in this clade. Considering the distribution of
viral hosts, the phylogeny reveals that only bat viruses cover the full phylogenetic diversity
of sarbecoviruses (Figure 2).
Arranging the presence/absence pattern of orthologs to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins
according to the reconstructed tree shows that sarbecoviruses are not only phylogenetically
but also genetically distinct from other coronaviruses (cf. Fig. 1B). ORFs 6 - 10 are
confined to this sub-genus. Only ORF3a, which was previously considered as unique to
sarbecovirus (Issa, et al. 2020) has an ortholog at the correct position between the spike and
the envelope protein also in the hibecovirus representative. The emergence of the

sarbecovirus sub-genus during beta-coronavirus diversification coincides with a complete
exchange of the accessory gene set. Within sarbecovirus the gene set is stable. ORF10
encoding a 38 amino acid long polypeptide, whose orthologs are confined to SARS-CoV-2
seems a notable exception. Yet, a closer look revealed that almost identical sequences exist
in representatives of all sarbecovirus lineages (100% coverage, 99% - 82% id; Figure S1),
which are not annotated as an ORF. It was proposed that ORF10 might be a spurious gene
prediction because no transcript could be detected in RNAseq data (Kim, et al. 2020).
However, in the light of its maintenance and conservation throughout sarbecoviral
evolution this assessment should be re-considered. In either case, the alleged gene gain of
SARS-CoV-2 reduces to a difference in gene annotation.
Evolution of protein feature architecture
The remarkably stable gene set reveals that neither the acquisition nor the loss of genes is a
driving force of sarbecovirus evolution. We therefore increased the resolution to the level
of linear features annotated along the individual proteins, such as Pfam domains,
transmembrane regions, secondary structures or low complexity regions. The comparison
of the resulting feature architectures (Koestler, et al. 2010) between orthologs revealed a
more differentiated evolutionary pattern. Among the beta-CoV core proteins, we see
lineage-specific variations in their architectures on the genus and sub-genus level for three
proteins (E, N, and S). The differences are mainly due to the differential presence of
regions enriched with a particular amino acid, and of secondary-structure elements (see
Figure S2 for the spike). In particular, terminal low complexity regions are often involved
in protein-protein interactions (Coletta, et al. 2010), and it will be interesting to see whether
the differences detected here do have functional consequences. For the non-structural
proteins (NSPs) contained in the polyprotein 1ab, we largely see a similar picture (Figures

S3, Table S2), where overall differences are mainly due to lineage-specific gains or losses
of low complexity regions. This agrees with the notion that the enzymatic activity and
functional domains of essential NSPs are conserved across CoV diversity (Snijder, et al.
2003; Thiel, et al. 2003). However, there are two notable exceptions, NSP1 and NSP3.
NSP1 is involved in shutting down the translation of host mRNAs to free capacities for the
production of viral proteins (Narayanan, et al. 2015; Tanaka, et al. 2012). The phylogenetic
profiling yielded NSP1 orthologs only in beta-CoV but not in the other genera. This is in
line with previous findings that alpha- and beta-CoV NSP1s share no significant sequence
similarity (Connor and Roper 2007; Jansson 2013), and with the absence of NSP1 in
gamma- and delta-CoV (Snijder, et al. 2003; Woo, et al. 2010). Within beta-CoV, no
orthology relationships could be established to MERS NSP1. Despite the existence of
individual conserved motifs (Figure S4), MERS NSP1 has diverged beyond recognition as
an ortholog. This pronounced change in sequence goes hand in hand with a different mode
of action. Other than NSP1 of SARS-CoV-1, MERS NSP1 does not form a stable complex
with the 40S ribosomal subunit to block the translation of host mRNAs. Instead, it inhibits
selectively the translation of mRNAs transcribed in the nucleus but not of viral mRNAs
that are transcribed in the cytoplasm (Lokugamage, et al. 2015). NSP3, the second protein
with a notable change in its feature architecture, is a large transmembrane protein. It forms
the core of a pore complex that spans both membranes of the cytosolic vesicle where viral
genome replication takes place (Wolff, et al. 2020). NSP3 is suspected to play a key role in
the transfer of messenger RNAs from the replication compartments to the cytosol. A
comparison of the feature architectures for this protein reveals two major changes during
beta-CoV evolution (Figure S5). NSP3 of embecovirus, as well as of all alpha-, gamma-,
and delta-CoVs in our analysis harbor two CoV_peptidase domains representing papain-

like protease (PLPro) domains that are used to release NSP3 from the polyprotein (Lei, et al.
2018). The N-terminal peptidase domain, PLPro-1 was lost after the split of the embecovirus
lineage. This finding is in line with previous reports (Lei, et al. 2018; Neuman 2016), but
the functional implication of this domain loss is still unclear. The second major change is
the gain of the Pfam domain bCoV_SUD_C (PF12124) in the last common ancestor of the
sarbecoviruses. This domain is involved in the binding of single-stranded RNA (Johnson, et
al. 2010). Its emergence in the sarbecoviruses provides an initial indication that the precise
ways how mRNA export is mediated has been changed during beta-coronavirus evolution.
Orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins are, with one exception, absent outside
sarbecovirus and their evolutionary origins remain elusive. The feature architecture
comparisons of ORF3a, which is represented by an ortholog in hibecovirus, provides
unprecedented insights into the evolutionary origins of this protein (Figure 3). ORF3a
forms a homo-tetrameric ion channel (Issa, et al. 2020; Lu, et al. 2006), it is pro-apoptotic
and localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum – Golgi compartment (Issa, et al. 2020;
Minakshi, et al. 2009). The sarbecovirus orthologs consistently display 3 transmembrane
domains in their N-terminal half, together with a bCoV_viroporin Pfam domain (PF11289)
spanning the full protein. The hibecovirus ortholog of ORF3a displays also three
transmembrane domains. Instead of the bCoV_viroporin domain, its central part displays a
weak similarity to the CoV_M Pfam domain (PF01635; e-value: 0.25). This domain is
otherwise characteristic for the membrane protein M, which interacts with the spike and the
envelope protein to form the virus envelope at the endoplasmatic reticulum – Golgi
intermediate compartment (ERGIC, (Ujike and Taguchi 2015)). Notably, the length of M is
similar to that of ORF3a in sarbecovirus and hibecovirus, it shares with ORF3a of both subgenera the presence of three transmembrane domains in its N-terminal half, and with

hibecovirus ORF3a the presence of the CoV_M Pfam domain. Eventually, both M and
ORF3a act at the same sub-cellular localization, the ERGIC. Together, this lets us
hypothesize that ORF3a emerged by a duplication of M in the last common ancestor of
sarbecovirus and hibecovirus and subsequently diversified in sequence, domain
architecture, and function.
Similar to the findings on the gene level, we observe for the entire gene set remarkably
conserved feature architectures within the sarbecoviruses (cf. Figures 1B and S3). Of the
three lineage-specific changes, two represent losses of low-complexity regions in the
proteins encoded by ORFs 6 and 7A. The third event, however, is a loss of an N-terminal
signal peptide in SARS-CoV-1 due to a 39 amino acid long deletion (Figure S6) that is
otherwise prevalent in the sarbecoviruses. The protein encoded by ORF8 is involved in
envelope protein regulation, cell death, viral replication, and suppression of the interferon
response from the host (Wong, et al. 2018). ORF8 deletions in SARS-CoV-1 have been
associated with attenuated replication, probably as a consequence of the virus’ adaptation to
the human host (Muth, et al. 2018). Meanwhile, lineage-specific deletions in ORF8
emerged also in SARS-CoV-2 (Gamage, et al. 2020; Rambaut, et al. 2020; Su, et al. 2020),
which suggests that ORF8 might be a general way to fine-tune virus activity within the
human host.
Evolution of the epitope landscape
The comparison of feature architectures between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their orthologs
within and outside sarbecorvirus revealed a number of differences, likely with functional
consequences. However, there is still no indication that any of the underlying changes have
contributed to the evolutionary emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Spike, while modified in the
course of sarbecovirus evolution (Jaimes, et al. 2020; Lan, et al. 2020; Walls, et al. 2020;

Wrobel, et al. 2020; Zhou, et al. 2020a), displays a fully conserved domain architecture
within sarbecovirus. We therefore scanned the spike for changes on the sub-domain level.
Epitopes are short structural elements exposed on the protein surface that are visible to, and
recognized by, antibodies and other proteins of the host. The epitope landscape of the spike
should therefore reveal the interface via which the virus interacts with the host, not only in
eliciting immune response (Ng, et al. 2020; Shrock, et al. 2020; Zhang, et al. 2020a) but
also during the infection process.
The consensus epitope prediction approach (Moutaftsi, et al. 2006; Wang, et al. 2008)
resulted in nine linear epitopes (LE) along the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Figures
4A and S7). With the exception of LE3, all are located in the S1 domain of the spike, and
LE9 identifies the furin cleavage site that separates S1 from S2. LE2,4-6 reside in the RBD,
and LE6 overlaps with the RBM therein.
However, the spike protein is heavily glycosylated, and the glycans shield a considerable
fraction of the protein from interactions with host molecules (Casalino, et al. 2020; Sikora,
et al. 2020; Watanabe, et al. 2020; Wintjens, et al. 2020; Yang, et al. 2020). Since structural
information was not considered in the prediction procedure, we integrated the position of
the 9 epitopes with surface-accessibility information from a recent structural and physicsbased modeling approach (Sikora, et al. 2020). This analysis suggests that LE3 is
inaccessible in spike’s pre-fusion conformation (Fig. S8), while LEs 1, 4 and 7 are surface
exposed but partially covered by glycans (Table S3). Complementary evidence for the
accessibility of the linear epitopes comes from various experimental studies. All LEs,
except for LE4, overlap with experimentally confirmed epitopes resulting from a study
exploring the humoral response in Covid-19 patient sera (Shrock, et al. 2020)(Figs. 4B and
S7). LE3 is a cross-reactive epitope that is identified by antibodies against the spikes of

SARS-CoV-2 and of common cold viruses (HCoV) (Ng, et al. 2020). LE6 and LE8 overlap
with the epitopes of two neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,
CB6 (Shi, et al. 2020) and 4A8 (Chi, et al. 2020), respectively, and LE7 is a “popular”
epitope against which antibodies are detected in many Covid-19 patients (Shrock, et al.
2020). Taken together, there is sufficient evidence that the predicted LEs are exposed at
least at some point during infection, and thus potentially participate in the interaction with
the host.
Epitope scans in the spike orthologs revealed that the number of linear epitopes shared with
the SARS-CoV-2 spike decreases with the evolutionary distance (Figures 4 and S7).
Secondary epitope losses are rare, with the exception of RmYN02, where a recombination
event (Zhou, et al. 2020a) removed most of the ancestral epitopes. The LE analysis
provides the first indication of a step-wise remodeling of the spike protein surface on the
evolutionary lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5). The four epitopes located in the
RBD (LE2,4-6), which establishes the connection to ACE2, are of particular interest. Three
of them (LE2,5,6) overlap with predicted B-cell epitopes that are at most partly shielded by
glycans (Wintjens, et al. 2020). LEs 2 and 4, which correspond to the N- and C-termini of
the RBD are present in almost all sarbecoviruses. LE5, which directly flanks LE2, is
confined to the SARS-CoV-2 clade. LEs 4 and 5 are absent in the spikes of the GX
pangolin viruses due to substitutions of otherwise fully conserved amino acid (Figure 4C).
Together with the overall rarity of secondary epitope losses, it is tempting to speculate that
these losses adapt the spike to the pangolin host. Notably, LE6 at the tip of the RBD (Figs.
5), which harbors four contacting residues to human ACE2 (Y449, Y453, L455, F456;
(Lan, et al. 2020)) is present in RaTG13 and pangolin viruses. Thus, the virus was already
preadapted to binding to human ACE2 long before its zoonotic transfer to humans.

Interestingly, LE6 is partly occluded when the RBD is down (Table S3; Fig. S9), which
appears to be the preferential conformation of the spike in RatG13 and the pangolin viruses
(Antoni, et al. 2021). It becomes fully exposed upon the conformational destabilization of
the S trimer induced by the proteolytic cleavage (Wrobel, et al. 2020)(Fig. S9). Thus, LE9 –
representing the furin cleavage site – allowed SARS-CoV-2 to carry into effect the binding
capacity provided by an otherwise occluded RBM. This makes the acquisition of LE9 the
key innovation underlying the zoonotic transfer of SARS-CoV-2, and its subsequent
success in spreading through the human population.
Discussion
In the past two decades, two human pandemics, SARS and COVID-19, emerged from
zoonotic transfers of sarbecoviruses. This sub-genus of the beta-coronaviruses infects a
broad range of mammalian species. However, they are preferentially found in horseshoe
bats (Zhou, et al. 2020b), and thus far only viruses isolated from bats span the full known
phylogenetic diversity of the sarbecoviruses (our study, (Boni, et al. 2020; Zhou, et al.
2020a; Zhou, et al. 2020b)). Bats tolerate the infection with viruses that are lethal in other
mammals (Schountz 2014). They found means to counteract the immune-modulatory
effects of viral proteins, which otherwise result in a pro-inflammatory cytokine response
that is associated with immunopathology, the main reason for severe and fatal outcomes of
Covid-19 (Irving, et al. 2021; Perlman and Netland 2009) (for a review see (Banerjee, et al.
2020)). Consequently, bats presumably provide the main evolutionary playground for many
pathogenic viruses, and in particular for sarbecoviruses (see Supplementary Discussion).
Here we have investigated the innovations on the protein level that distinguish SARS-CoV2 from other coronaviruses to shed light on the evolutionary trajectory transforming an
animal virus into a human pathogen.

Genetic innovation on the sub-domain level
The phylogenetic profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 protein set revealed that the sub-genus
sarbecovirus is genetically distinct from all other coronaviruses. Differences in the feature
architecture in particular of NSP1 and NSP3, which are present also outside sarbecovirus
indicate a functional divergence of these proteins during coronavirus evolution. Within the
sarbecoviruses, however, neither changes in gene set composition nor of feature domain
architecture drive evolutionary diversification directing the attention to more subtle
changes. Whole genome alignments of sarbecoviruses have meanwhile provided detailed
information about sequence conservation/divergence patterns on a per-base resolution
along a genome, and within coding regions in particular for the spike (Boni, et al. 2020; Li,
et al. 2020b; Liu, et al. 2020). Yet, a substantial proportion of the spike is inaccessible
either because the residues are buried or because they are shielded by glycans (Casalino, et
al. 2020; Sikora, et al. 2020; Turonova, et al. 2020), such that most mutations are not
visible to the host. The functional relevance of sequence changes outside sites of known
function is difficult to assess. Comparative studies on the protein structure level (e.g.
Wrobel, et al. (2020)) integrated with molecular dynamics simulations (Sikora, et al. 2020)
provide a more direct view on relevant changes and similarities. Yet, the computational
demand of such approaches renders them inappropriate for comparative studies across
many taxa. With the phylogenetic profiling of predicted linear epitopes we present an
approach of intermediate resolution that can be used for rapidly scanning protein surfaces
for lineage specific changes on a sub-domain level.
Molecular dynamics simulations considering the glycan shield (Sikora, et al. 2020)
integrated with viral epitope profiling (Shrock, et al. 2020) indicate that except LE4 all
predicted linear epitopes are visible to the host at some point during infection. LEs 1, 3, and

7 are B-cell immunodominant, although structural inspections suggest that they are in the
case of LE3 fully, and of LEs 1 and 7 partly inaccessible (Table S3; Fig. S8). However,
protein surface accessibility assessments are based on the spike in pre-fusion conformation
(Sikora, et al. 2020). Some epitopes will be exposed by spike’s reorganization to the postfusion conformation. Short-lived intermediate structures along this reorganization have thus
far eluded both experimental and simulation approaches (Cai, et al. 2020; Wrobel, et al.
2020). The phylogenetic profiling of linear epitopes presented here therefore complements
structure-based approaches. It has the potential to uncover "blind spots" of the structurebased accessibility analyses due to partial knowledge of the full conformational landscape.
Evolution of the epitope landscape
The epitope landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the product of a gradual
remodeling during sarbecovirus evolution (Figs. 4, 5). A comparison of SARS-CoV-1 with
SARS-CoV-2 reveals that both pathogens display largely distinct sets of epitopes on their
spike surface (Figs. S7 and S10). This is in congruence with the observation that only few
human antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 (Pinto, et al. 2020),
and that cross-reacting antibodies are largely confined to the S2 domain of the spike where
only one of our LEs is located (Ng, et al. 2020). In essence, the substantial overhaul of
epitope landscapes on the two viral lineages underlines that SARS-CoV-2 is not just an
evolutionarily refined version of SARS-CoV-1, which is congruent with their distinct
placement in the virus phylogeny.
Our approach has one natural limitation that is shared with experimental epitope profiling
studies (Ng, et al. 2020; Shrock, et al. 2020). Structural epitopes that emerge from the
spatial proximity of non-adjacent peptides in the amino-acid sequence in the folded protein
are not considered. It is for this reason that we miss a shared epitope between SARS-CoV-1

and SARS-CoV-2 that is recognized by the same antibody (Pinto, et al. 2020). Although the
restriction to linear epitopes comes at the cost of a reduced sensitivity, it renders our
approach scalable and independent of the availability of accurate 3D-models of the proteins
under study. It thus can be rapidly applied to any novel variant of SARS-CoV2, as well as
on any newly emerging human pathogen.
Epitope function balances immunodominance
The interaction of the virus with its host requires that the pathogen exposes parts of the
spike epitopes—most prominently the RBD and the RBM therein—to establish contact
with the ACE2 (Lan, et al. 2020; Walls, et al. 2020). The resulting epitopes should be
highly immunogenic, and their evolutionary emergence and subsequent fate must be
determined by a trade-off between their relevance for virus function, and the counterselective pressure imposed by the host immune system. For LE9, representing the furin
cleavage site, and LE6, which harbors four contact residues to ACE2, the balance between
risk and payoff of the epitope is clearly in favor of the latter. Both are critical for the
infection process (Hoffmann, et al. 2020b; Lan, et al. 2020; McCallum, et al. 2020; Shang,
et al. 2020a). It is still unclear why the other epitopes are maintained. In particular, the
presence of LEs 3 and 8 should be strongly counter-selected. Both are detected by
neutralizing human antibodies (Chi, et al. 2020; Ng, et al. 2020). LE8 is present also in
RaTG13 and in viruses from the Guangdong pangolins, which suggests that selection could
have acted long enough to eradicate the epitope. LE3, which is located in the S2 domain of
the spike, is even more compelling. This epitope is present in all sarbecovirus spikes except
that of RmYN02, and it shows cross-reactivity to antibodies formed against human CoV
(Ng, et al. 2020). We see two possible explanations for the presence of these epitopes in the
SARS-CoV-2 spike: Selection in bats and possible intermediate hosts was more permissive,

for which indeed evidence exists (Banerjee, et al. 2020), and the evolutionary time under
new and more rigorous selective regime in humans was too short to drive the loss of this
epitope. Alternatively, LE8 and even more so the conserved LE3 may play essential roles in
spike’s function that requires its presence despite opening a flank to the host’s immune
system. It is tempting to speculate that the same is true for the other epitopes, in particular
for LEs that are common to the spikes of all sarbecoviruses. Such evolutionarily stable
epitopes could represent preferred targets for the design of therapeutic interventions against
a broad spectrum of sarbecoviruses. In fact, targeting epitopes on the conserved stalk of
influenza viruses is a promising strategy for a universal vaccine development
(Nachbagauer, et al. 2021).
Key innovations in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2
RaTG13 and the GD pangolin viruses share all but one linear epitope with SARS-CoV-2.
Our finding integrates perfectly with the recent observation that the spike protein isolated
from the GD pangolin virus binds human ACE2 with about 10-fold higher affinity than the
pangolin ACE2 (Antoni, et al. 2021). Together, this suggests that the spike in the common
ancestor of these viruses was largely pre-adapted to humans, and presumably only subtle
adjustments were required to optimize for human infection. Thus, the more groundbreaking innovation that allowed this pre-adapted virus to cross the species barrier and to
become a highly successful human pathogen was not, as one could naively expect, the
emergence of novel binding sites to the human cell surface receptor. Instead, it was a better
control of when to find spike’s RBDs in an open state, thus exposing pre-existing binding
sites.
The spike of the animal viruses appears to reside mainly in the closed conformation with all
RBDs down (Antoni, et al. 2021; Zhang, et al. 2020b). This renders the RBM, which is

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428808; this version posted January 29, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

represented in our analysis by LE6, largely inaccessible (cf. Table S3). Comparative cryoEM analyses revealed that the un-cleaved spike trimer of SARS-CoV-2 is substantially
more stable than its counterpart in RaTG13 (Wrobel, et al. 2020). This re-enforces the
blocking of the RBM (cf. Fig. S9) and reduces binding affinity of spike to ACE2. However,
at the same time, it hides the contained epitopes from the host immune system (Shang, et al.
2020a). With the furin cleavage site (LE9), SARS-CoV-2 has acquired a trait that is long
known to be connected to pathogen virulence (Molloy, et al. 1999). Within CoV, furin
cleavage sites are sporadically occurring in CoV, e.g. in MERS (Gierer, et al. 2013; Millet
and Whittaker 2014), and in the murine coronavirus (MHV) (de Haan, et al. 2004), both
viruses with a high mortality. This trait allows the virus to turn the hiding of the RBM in
which the visibility of the virus for the host immune system is reduced – a strategy also
known as “conformational masking” (Shang, et al. 2020a) – into a facultative “stealth
mode”. The few RBDs still pointing up (Wrobel, et al. 2020) serve as ‘scouts’. They scan
the environment and establish the initial albeit weak interaction with the host cell, which
however is sufficient for the surface-located furin (Hoffmann, et al. 2020b; Molloy, et al.
1999; Shang, et al. 2020a) to cleave the spike at the furin cleavage site. The resulting
destabilization of the trimer allows more RBDs to point upwards, which reinforces the
binding to ACE2 by several orders of magnitude (Wrobel, et al. 2020). This extends the
window of opportunity for spike processing necessary cell entry. The resulting higher
immunogenicity of the spike in the “attack mode” presumably becomes irrelevant, as the
virus then rapidly enters the host cell and by that evades the immune system.
Interestingly, with the D614G variant (Isabel, et al. 2020) we seem to have witnessed even
a fine-tuning of this process. D614G swept within months through the SARS-CoV-2
population worldwide, which is indicative of a higher infectivity of this virus variant

(Korber, et al. 2020). This substitution results in a constitutively more open conformation
of the RBD (Turonova, et al. 2020), which increases the ACE2 binding capability of the uncleaved S-protein (Yurkovetskiy, et al. 2020), but seems to still keep the balance between
epitope exposure in the RBD and immunogenicity. On the contrary, it was recently shown
that loss of the furin cleavage site attenuates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity (Johnson, et al.
2021). In the light of these findings, it is likely that any mutations further fine-tuning the
conformational dynamics of the spike are particularly threatening and should be included
into the monitoring and risk-assessment of novel SARS-CoV-2 variant. The recently
detected variant B1.1.7, which is substantially more infective than other SARS-CoV-2
strains, may fall in this category. It harbors a mutation in LE9 covering the furin cleavage
site (P681H) (Rambaut, et al. 2020), and it will be interesting to see if and to what extent
this affects the conformational dynamics of the spike and adds to the infectivity of this
strain.

Conclusions
Phylogenetic profiling is a rapid and low-cost approach to embed a pathogen into its
evolutionary background and to screen for genetic innovations that caused its emergence.
Here we could show that the implicit scanning of protein surfaces, via the prediction of
linear T-cell epitopes, provides the necessary resolution to capture how SARS-CoV-2
gradually evolved from its common ancestor shared with other sarbecoviruses. Our findings
suggest that the epitope landscape of the S-protein, the primary interface of virus-host
interaction, was largely molded in bats. A change in strategy was the key innovation that
contributed to the success of SARS-CoV-2. The acquisition of the furin cleavage site in
combination with a higher stability of the S-protein trimer allowed the virus to evolve a

‘stealth mode’ where epitopes in the RBM are largely hidden from the host immune system
and are exposed only shortly before endocytosis. This allows the virus to maintain and
gradually optimize an epitope landscape that was initially formed in an environment where
the selective pressure imposed by the immune system was less pronounced. Strategies to
monitor and prevent the emergence of SARS-CoV-3 should therefore concentrate on
species fulfilling at least two requirements: Their ACE2 receptor should be similar to that
of humans, and their immune system is permissive enough to let the virus explore the
epitope landscape of its surface proteins. In this context, the phylogenetic profiling of
predicted linear epitopes can be routinely applied even when no protein structures are
available, and it will be interesting to see how the extension of the catalogue beyond T-cell
epitopes affects the resolution.

Figure 5. Predicted linear epitopes annotated on a full-length model of a spike glycoprotein
of SARS-CoV-2. The structural model (Sikora, et al. 2020) represents the trimeric spike in
a prefusion state embedded in a lipid bilayer (lipid tails marked gray and phosphate
headgroups green). The epitopes in the surface representation (color coded according to the
node of innovation, as stated in figure 3B) are overlaid with the chain in the "up"
conformation (blue cartoon). Realistic glycan coverage is shown as turquoise licorice. The
remaining two chains in the "down" conformation are shown as light-blue transparent
surfaces, with corresponding glycans transparent gray. The epitope color resembles that of
Fig. 4
