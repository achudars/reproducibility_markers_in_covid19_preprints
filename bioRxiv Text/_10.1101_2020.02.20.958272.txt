Multiscale Simulations of New Coronavirus

ABSTRACT

2

The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from

3

China and caused more than one million death globally since December 2019. This new

4

virus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the

5

same receptor called Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the

6

coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years

7

ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their

8

surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind

9

stronger to ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2. However, function of a bio-system is often under

10

kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a

11

structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from SARS-CoV-

12

2, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of

13

S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results

14

suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is

15

consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this

16

difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model

17

which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate

18

immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and

19

receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher

20

level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides,

21

from the molecular level, one possible explanation that this new pandemic by far spread

22

much faster than SARS.

Multiscale Simulations of New Coronavirus

Introduction

2

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged at the end of year 2019

3

from Wuhan, a city in China, as a new pandemic [1, 2]. It has been found that the disease

4

is caused by a new member of coronavirus family, SARS-CoV-2 [3, 4]. Like others in the

5

same virus family, such as the coronavirus causing SARS [5, 6], SARS-CoV-2 is a single

6

and positive-stranded RNA virus enveloped by lipid bilayer. The virus can capture and

7

enter host cells in human through targeting specific receptors on their surface. Upon entry,

8

the viral genome is released through membrane fusion. The released RNA genome of the

9

virus is then replicated and translated into various types of viral proteins. The replicated

10

RNA genome and synthesized viral proteins are finally assembled together into new

11

viruses, before they escape and attack other cells [7, 8]. As a result, the infections of

12

SARS-CoV-2 normally come with the similar symptoms as SARS, including fever,

13

respiratory difficulty and pneumonia [9, 10]. Different from SARS, however, the new

14

COVID-19 seems to have longer incubation period and thus is more contagious [11]. The

15

disease has caused more than 43 million confirmed cases with at least 1 million death

16

globally, according to the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on October

17

27th 2020. Therefore, the development of vaccine or therapeutic treatment for this

18

ongoing public health crisis is highly demanding [12, 13].

19

Almost all the coronaviruses recognize their host cells through spike (S) proteins

20

[14, 15]. S-protein is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of viral envelop as homo-

21

trimers [16]. Each S-protein further consists of two subunits. The S1 subunit includes a

22

region called receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is used to target receptors in host

23

cells, while the S2 subunit regulates the membrane fusion between virus and host cells

24

[17]. These roles of S protein suggest that it could be a key target for vaccine and

25

therapeutics developed to neutralize virus infection by blocking their invasion [18].

26

Moreover, it has been confirmed in a recent report that the new virus SARS-CoV-2 uses

27

the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as SARS coronavirus [19]. The atomic structures of

28

complex between human ACE2 and the RBD regions from S-protein of SARS-CoV have

29

been obtained by x-ray crystallography [17]. It was also shown that the sequence of S-

30

protein from SARS-CoV shares more than 70% identity with the S-protein from SARS3

CoV-2 [6]. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the new coronavirus uses the

2

similar binding interface with ACE2 as SARS to enter host cells of human. The obvious

3

follow-up questions are: whether the 30% variations in sequences between S-protein of

4

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS can cause any difference in their binding to ACE2? Moreover,

5

does this difference lead into any functional impacts on the life cycles of these viruses in

6

host cells?

7

Comparing with the time-consuming and labor-expensive experimental studies,

8

computational modeling serves as an ideal alternative approach to carry out fast tests on

9

biological systems under the conditions that are currently inaccessible in the laboratory

10

[20-26]. Therefore, here we developed a multiscale computational strategy to compare

11

the process of recognition between the SARS-CoV and host cells with the interactions

12

between the new coronavirus and host cells. A mesoscale model is used to simulate the

13

process in which the coronaviruses are captured by ACE2 receptors on cell surface. We

14

further constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and RBD of

15

SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, so that the rate of their association can be estimated by a coarse-

16

grained Monte-Carlo simulation and further compared with the binding of S-protein from

17

SARS-CoV. Our simulation indicates that association of the new virus to the receptor is

18

slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently.

19

We integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a simple

20

mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay

21

with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association

22

between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining

23

a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study

24

therefore explains, from the molecular level, why the new COVID-19 disease is by far

25

more contagious than SARS. In summary, this multiscale model serves as a useful

26

addition to current understanding for the spread of coronaviruses and related infectious

27

agents.

Multiscale Simulations of New Coronavirus

brief, within a three-dimensional simulation box, the plasma membrane is represented by

2

a flat surface below the extracellular region. The area of the square is 1 Î¼m2, while the

3

height of the simulation box is 500 nm. A number of ACE2 receptors (200) are initially

4

placed on the membrane surface (pink in Figure 1a). They are represented by rigid

5

bodies of cylinders and their binding sites are located on top of the cylinders (red dots in

6

Figure 1a). The height of each cylinder is 10nm and its radius is 5nm. On the other hand,

7

space above the plasma membrane represents the extracellular region. A number of

8

coronaviruses are located in this area (golden in Figure 1a). Each virus is simplified as a

9

spherical rigid body with a given radius (40nm). Trimeric S-proteins are uniformly

10

distributed on the spherical surface of each virus (green dots in Figure 1a). Each S-

11

protein can interact with an ACE2 receptor on plasma membrane. After any S-protein on

12

one virus forms an encounter complex with a receptor, we assume that the host cell is

13

captured by the virus. The dissociation between the virus and the receptor is not

14

considered in the system, because we also assume that, after the association between S-

15

protein and ACE2, the virus can enter the cell through membrane fusion. Following the

16

initial random configuration, the diffusion of receptors and viruses, as well as their

17

association, were simulated by a diffusion-reaction algorithm until the system reached

18

equilibrium. The detail process of the simulation is specified in the Methods.

19

Before the rigid-body simulation, in order to provide a more realistic estimation

20

on the binding between ACE2 and different coronaviruses, we specifically compared the

21

S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 with the S-protein from SARS. We applied our previously

22

developed residue-based kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) method to simulate the associate

23

processes of these two systems. In detail, the atomic coordinates of the complex between

24

human ACE2 and the RBD domain from the S-protein of SARS are taken from the PDB

25

id 2AJF [17]. In parallel, the structural model of the complex between human ACE2 and

26

the RBD domain from the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 was computationally constructed,

27

following the procedure described in the Methods. The structural comparison of these

28

two protein complexes is shown in Figure 1b. For both systems, 500 trajectories based

29

on their complex structures were generated by the KMC simulation which algorithm is

30

specified in the Methods. In the initial conformation of each trajectory, S-protein and

31

receptor were separated and placed with a random position relative to each other in which

the distance between their binding interfaces is fallen within a given cutoff value dc of 20

2

Ã. At the end of each trajectory, receptor and viral protein either form an encounter

3

complex through their binding interface observed in the complex structure, or diffuse

4

away from each other. Based on the simulation results collected from all the 500

5

trajectories, we counted how many times an encounter complex can be formed by the end

6

of the simulation time, which gives the probability of association. As a result, the

7

comparison of calculated probabilities of association for both systems is plotted in Figure

8

2a.

9

The figure shows that probability of association between ACE2 and the S-protein

10

from SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably lower than the probability of association between

11

ACE2 and the S-protein from SARS. Specifically, among the 500 simulation trajectories

12

of SARS system, we found that 8 of them successfully formed encounter complexes,

13

while among the 500 simulation trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 system, only 2 of them

14

successfully formed encounter complexes. This result suggests that the association of the

15

S-protein from SARS to the receptor is about four times faster than the association of the

16

S-protein from SARS-CoV-2. The different of association rate from our simulation,

17

interestingly, is confirmed by the experimental data that was measured very recently by

18

Dr. McLellanâs lab [27]. Using surface plasma resonance (SPR), they showed that the

19

association rate ka of binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain and ACE2 equals

20

1.36Ã105M-1s-1, while the rate between SARS RBD domain and ACE2 equals

21

3.62Ã105M-1s-1. Therefore, the experimental evidence indicated that the association of the

22

S-protein from SARS to the receptor is about three times faster than the association of the

23

S-protein from SARS-CoV-2, which is quantitatively consistent with our simulation

24

results.

25

We then fed the information derived from the structure-based simulations into the

26

rigid-body model. Two specific simulation systems were compared. A relatively fast rate

27

of association between receptors and S-proteins on viral surfaces was adopted in the first

28

system to represent the binding process of SARS, while a relatively slow rate of

29

association between receptors and S-proteins on viral surfaces was adopted in the second

30

system to represent the binding process of SARS-CoV-2. All the other parameters such as

diffusion constants and concentrations in both systems remain the same. As a result, the

2

total numbers of viruses that were captured by host cells are plotted in Figure 2b as a

3

function of simulation time. Without surprise, the figure shows that although almost all

4

viruses were attached to the cell surfaces by the end of both simulations, the kinetic

5

process in the SARS system is much faster than the SARS-CoV-2 system, which is

6

resulted from the difference in the association rate between receptors and their

7

corresponding S-proteins. This leads into the fact that during the early stage of

8

simulations, more SARS viruses attach to host cells than SARS-CoV-2. For instance,

9

when the simulations in both systems reached the first 105 nanoseconds, there have

10

already been more than 40 SARS viruses attached to the cell surfaces. In contrast, there

11

were less than 20 viruses attached to the cell surfaces within the same amount of time in

12

the SARS-CoV-2 system. Considering that the function of a bio-system is often under

13

kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control [28, 29], we suggest that this time-dependent

14

behavior is biologically more relevant. In reality, not all the viruses have the opportunity

15

to find their target receptors on host cells. Many of them will be recognized and removed

16

by our innate immune system. Therefore, the capability of how fast a specific type of

17

coronavirus can target its receptors is especially critical to the process of its invasion, as

18

well as the follow-up stages in its life cycle.

19

In order to further explore the impacts of our rigid-body simulation results on the

20

rest process of virus infection after they invade into host cells, we proposed a

21

mathematical model to delineate a simplified version of viral life cycle including its

22

replication and packaging in host cells, the inflammatory signaling pathways due to the

23

detection of foreign pathogens, and the follow-up inflammatory responses which lead to

24

the apoptosis of infected cells and the removal of viruses by the recruitment of immune

25

cells. The model can be summarized by the diagram shown in Figure 3. Specifically,

26

coronavirus [V] can turn healthy cells [H] into infected cell [In] by binding to the

27

receptors ACE2 on their surfaces. The RNA genome [m] is then released from bound

28

virus [Vb], and then translated into different viral proteins. These proteins and replicated

29

RNA are further packaged together as [P] in cytoplasm and finally escape from infected

30

cells. On the other side, in order to avoid viral spread, our innate immune system triggers

31

inflammatory signaling pathways in the infected cells [30]. For instance, the viral RNAs

can be detected by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) [31]. The RNA binding of RLRs

2

receptors initiates the signaling cascade by interacting with the mitochondrial antiviral-

3

signaling (MAVS) protein [32]. The aggregation of MAVS on the surface of

4

mitochondria will trigger the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway that turns on gene expression of

5

specific cytokines [S] to stimulate the inflammatory responses [33, 34]. The inflammation

6

of host organism leads to the apoptosis of infected cells and the removal of virus by

7

recruited immune cells such as microphages. In summary, the change of concentration for

each variable in above system can be described by following set of ordinary differential

equations (ODE).

and ka represent rates of viral protein translation, assembly and releasing. Equation (5)

2

describes the stimulation of inflammatory signaling by viral RNA. The parameters sS, Km,

3

and dS in the equation represent the maximal activation rate, the saturation coefficient and

4

the rate of degradation of inflammatory signals. Equation (6) gives how infected cells

5

change in the system, while the parameters in the equation dI, and KI indicate the rate and

6

saturation coefficient of cell apoptosis that is stimulated by inflammatory signals. Finally,

7

equation (7) suggests that the variation of total virus in the system depends on the release

8

of newly packaged virus from infected cells, the binding of free virus to the healthy cells,

9

and the immune response triggered by inflammatory signals. The parameters dV and KV in

10

the equation give the maximal rate and saturation coefficient immune cells used to kill

11

virus. Altogether, we solved above ODEs numerically by a stochastic simulation

12

algorithm. The brief introduction of the simulation algorithm will be specified in the

13

Methods.

14

Given predefined weights for all the simulation parameters and the initial values

15

for each element, the dynamics of the system is evolved as a function of time. The

16

simulation results of the mathematical model are summarized in Figure 4. As shown by

17

the red curve in Figure 4a, the change of free virus in the system can be divided into

18

three stages. It first decreases from its initial value. After reaching the minimal level, the

19

number of virus then bounces back in the second phase until it drops again and finally

20

vanishes at the end of the third phase. Relative to the free virus, the number of virus

21

captured by host cells equals 0 at the beginning of the simulation. It increases in the first

22

stage and diminishes in the second, as shown by the blue curve in the figure. In the third

23

phase, very few viruses bound to host cells are detected in the system. Corresponding to

24

the change of virus, the number of healthy cells is plotted as the black curve. The curve

25

shows that the level of healthy cells reduces from the beginning and rises only after all

26

free viruses are removed from the systems. Based on these kinetic profiles, the dynamics

27

of the system can thus be interpreted as follows. In the first stage of simulation, free

28

viruses invade into the healthy cells by binding to the receptors on their surface. We

29

suggest that this stage corresponds to the incubation period. In the second stage, new

30

viruses are assembled in and released from the infected cells. At the same moment, the

31

viral genomes left in the infected cells stimulate the immune response. As a result, the

total amount of virus is gradually lowered in the third phase, indicating that these viruses

2

are cleared up by the innate immune system. After the removal of all viruses, the healthy

3

cells in the system grow again, representing the recovery of the patient.

4

We further incorporated the results derived from the rigid-body simulations into

5

the mathematical model to compare the viral life cycle in SARS and COVID-19. The

6

rigid-body simulation suggests that SARS-CoV binds to receptor ACE2 faster than 19-

7

nCoV, given the same amount of time. Therefore, we applied the mathematical model to

8

two comparative systems. A relatively fast viral binding rate kb was adopted in the first

9

system to represent the binding process of SARS, while a relatively slow rate was

10

adopted in the second to represent the binding process of SARS-CoV-2. All the other

11

parameters such as diffusion constants and concentrations in both systems remain the

12

same. As a result, the kinetic profiles indicating the changes of free virus level along with

13

the simulation time in these two systems are shown in Figure 4b. The figure suggests

14

that the first stage in the simulation of SARS-CoV-2 (red curve) is longer than the

15

simulation of SARS (black curve). This is consistent with the clinical observation that the

16

incubation period of COVID-19 could be as long as 14 days, while the incubation period

17

is normally from 2 to 7 days. More interestingly, we found that the level of free virus at

18

the end of the first period in the simulation of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively higher than the

19

corresponding level of free virus in the simulation of SARS. Considering that a patient

20

can contain a higher level of new coronavirus during his or her incubation period which

21

is also longer than SARS, our simulation gives the insights about why COVID-19 is more

22

contagious and spread faster than SARS [11]. Finally, when both simulations came to

23

their third phases, we found that the total amount of virus of SARS is higher than SARS-

24

CoV-2. This gives possible explanation about why the symptoms in most COVID-19

25

patients are relatively mild and not as severe as the symptoms in SARS patients [35].

26

In summary, it is important to point out that the life cycles of different

27

coronaviruses can also be caused by many other factors such as the difference in the

28

assembling pathways of these viruses. Additionally, the infectious response of each

29

individual is also a case-dependent issue, relying on the expression levels of ACE2

30

receptors and the heterogeneity of immune response in different patients. Nevertheless,

our multiscale computational model highlights the potential role of binding kinetics

between human receptor and S-proteins from different coronavirus in, and provided the

possible mechanism from the molecular level to their impacts on, regulating the

dynamics of the entire viral life cycle.

Conclusions

6

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has drawn substantial attention especially after

7

it spread to more than 200 countries and became a Public Health Emergency of

8

International Concern (PHEIC) [2, 36, 37]. The pandemic is caused by a new type of

9

positive-stranded RNA virus, known as SARS-CoV-2. Similar as the coronavirus that

10

leads to SARS, it has been confirmed that the S-protein in SARS-CoV-2 also mediates its

11

recognition with the human receptor ACE2. However, the differences of receptor binding

12

in these two virus systems and their underlying implications are not well understood. It

13

has been found that the kinetic aspect of binding between biomolecules in many

14

biological systems is usually more important to their functions. Here, using

15

computational structural prediction and coarse-grained simulations, we first have

16

compared the association rate of binding between ACE2 and the S-protein from SARS-

17

CoV with binding between ACE2 and the S-protein from SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with

18

the experimental data obtained very recently, we found association of the new virus to the

19

receptor is slower than SARS. We further interrogate the impact of this result on the

20

difference in viral life cycle between SARS and COVID-19. By incorporating the

21

information derived from coarse-grained simulations into a mathematical model, we

22

found that the slower association between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 can result in longer

23

incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration

24

in human body. This multiscale modeling framework, therefore, can offer one possible

25

molecular mechanism to explain why this new infectious disease spreads much faster

26

Multiscale Simulations of New Coronavirus

1

The atomic structures of complex between ACE receptor and different viral S-

2

proteins are needed for the simulations of their association. The structural models of these

3

protein complexes were prepared as follows. The complex structure between human

4

ACE2 and the RBD domain from the S-protein of SARS was determined by the x-ray

5

crystallography experiment (PDB id 2AJF) [17]. On the other hand, the structural model

6

of the complex between human ACE2 and the RBD domain from the S-protein of SARS-

7

CoV-2 was constructed by computational modeling. In detail, the atomic structure of

8

SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain was first predicted by I-TASSER [38] based on the

9

newly released sequence of SARS-CoV-2 [39]. In parallel, the backbone model of the

10

complex between human ACE2 and the RBD domain from SARS-CoV-2 S-protein was

11

generated using the template-based structure prediction tool COTH [40, 41]. We then

12

superimposed the predicted atomic coordinates of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain

13

onto its relative backbone position in the complex model, and also aligned the atomic

14

coordinates of human ACE2 from the crystal structure onto the relative backbone

15

position in the complex model. As a result, the structural comparison of these two protein

16

complexes is plotted in Figure 1b.

17

Estimate the association between ACE2 and S-protein by kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation

18

A previously developed kinetic Monte-Carlo algorithm [42] was used to simulate

19

the association between S-protein and ACE2. A coarse-grained model of protein

20

structures is used. Each residue in a protein is represented by its CÎ± atom and the

21

representative center of its side-chain. The simulation starts from an initial conformation,

22

in which two proteins in the complex are separated and placed randomly. Following the

23

initial conformation, each protein diffuses randomly within one simulation step. A

24

physics-based scoring function containing electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic effect

25

is used to guide the diffusions of proteins during simulations. Based on the calculated

26

energy, Metropolis criterion is applied to determine if the corresponding diffusional

27

movements can be accepted or not. The simulation trajectory will be terminated if an

28

encounter complex is successfully formed through the corresponding interface observed

29

in the constructed model of native protein complexes. Otherwise, above simulation

30

procedure will be repeated until it reached the maximal time duration. This method was

applied to study the association between ACE2 and both S-proteins from the two virus

2

systems. For each system, 500 trajectories are carried out. Each trajectory starts from a

3

relatively different initial conformation, but the initial distances between the binding

4

interfaces of S-proteins and receptors in all trajectories are below 20Ã. The probabilities

5

of association were then derived and compared based on counting how many encounter

6

complexes formed among these trajectories in the two systems.

7

Model the cellular attachment of coronavirus by rigid-body diffusion-reaction algorithm

8

As described in the Results, a rigid-body (RB) based model is constructed to

9

simulate the binding between coronaviruses and cell surface receptors ACE2 on plasma

10

membrane. Given the model representation and a randomly-generated initial

11

configuration (Figure 2a), the dynamics of the system is evolved by following a

12

diffusion-reaction algorithm [43-45]. Viruses or receptors are selected by random order

13

for stochastic diffusion within each simulation time step. A virus is free to diffusion

14

throughout the simulation box, while diffusions of membrane-bound receptors are

15

confined to the plasma membrane. Periodic boundary conditions along both x and y

16

directions are applied. Moreover, viruses are not allowed to move below the plasma

17

membrane. If any virus moves beyond the top of the simulation box, it will be bounced

18

back. The amplitude and probability of translational and rotational movements for viruses

19

and receptors are determined by its corresponding diffusion constant. Association

20

between viruses and receptors are followed after diffusions. Association is triggered if the

21

distance between any S-protein in a virus and the binding site of a receptor is below a

22

predetermined cutoff value. The probability to trigger the association is determined by

23

the association rate, which was estimated by the kinetic Monte-Carlo method described in

24

the previous section. Assuming that viruses can enter the cell through membrane fusion

25

after they associate with ACE2, the dissociation between the virus and the receptor is not

26

considered in the system. Finally, as above diffusion-reaction process iterates in both

27

Cartesian and compositional spaces, the system will finally reach equilibrium.

Multiscale Simulations of New Coronavirus

1

We use the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) developed by Gillespie to

2

model the processes of biochemical reactions from equation (1) to equation (7) [46]. The

3

algorithm starts from the initiation of time and populations of each species in the

4

simulation system. Within each simulation step, the rates for all reactions are re-estimated

5

by the given parameters and updated population of corresponding species. One of these

6

reactions is then randomly selected based on the calculation of their relative weights.

7

Finally, populations for the corresponding species are updated. The simulation moves

8

forward to the next step by adding the system time with Ï, in which

9

random variable with the average value equals the reciprocal of the summation for all the

10

reactions. Above process is iterated so that the populations of each species in the system

11

evolve along the simulation time. The values of all parameters in the simulation were

12

chosen to be within the biologically meaningful range. The choice of these parameters

13

does not qualitatively affect the general dynamic patterns of the system.

Figure 1: A mesoscopic model is constructed to simulate the kinetic process about how

7

viruses are captured by the cell surface receptors on plasma membrane (a). The plasma

8

membrane is represented by a flat surface below the extracellular region, which contains

9

a number of ACE2 receptors (pink). The space above the plasma membrane represents

10

the extracellular region which contains a number of coronaviruses (golden). Each virus is

11

simplified as a spherical rigid body with trimeric S-proteins uniformly distributed on its

12

surface (green dots). Each S-protein monomer can interact with an ACE2 receptor on the

13

plasma membrane. The rate of their association was estimated by Monte-Carlo

14

simulations based on the structure models of complexes between ACE2 and RBD

15

domains from S-proteins of different coronavirus (b). The proteins in the figure are coded

16

by different color index.

17

Figure 2: We used structure-based kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the

18

association between ACE2 and S-proteins from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. For each

19

system, 200 simulation trajectories were generated. Based on these trajectories, the

20

calculated probabilities of association are plotted in (a). We found that the association

21

between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S-proteins (right column) is faster than the association

22

between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (left column). We then fed the information

23

into the rigid-body-based simulations. The simulations show the total numbers of viruses

24

that were captured by host cells increased as a function of simulation time (b). Moreover,

25

we found that during the early stage of simulations, more SARS-CoV (black curve)

26

attach to host cells than SARS-CoV-2 (red curve).

viruses by the recruitment of immune cells. The meaning of each variable in the diagram

is specified on the right. The system can further be described by a set of ordinary

differential equations, as written from Equation (1) to Equation (7) in the main text.

Figure 4: Given predefined weights for all the rate parameters and the initial values for

6

each variable in the model, the dynamics of the system is evolved as a function of time by

7

solving the mathematical model numerically with a stochastic simulation algorithm. The

8

figure suggests that the dynamics of the system can be divided into three stages (a). We

9

further applied the model to two comparative systems. A relatively fast viral binding rate

10

kb was adopted in the first system to represent the binding process of SARS, while a

11

relatively slow rate was adopted in the second to represent the binding process of SARS-

12

CoV-2. As shown in (b), we found that the first stage in the simulation of SARS-CoV-2

13

(red curve) is longer than the simulation of SARS (black curve), while the level of free

14

virus at the end of the first period in SARS-CoV-2 is relatively higher than the

15

corresponding level of free virus in SARS.
