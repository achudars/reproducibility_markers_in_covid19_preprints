Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19, firstly reported from Chinese Wuhan in December 2019, has spread to
many other countries in the last few weeks1, and has caused almost 80 000 infections and more than
2000 people died. The virus spreads so quickly that it has attracted the globe attention, and rapid
diagnosis is one of the effective ways to prevent and control the diseases.
Chest CT and RT-PCR has been used for the clinical diagnosis of the coronavirus pneumonia2, 3,
however, chest CT needs CT equipment and put the professional operator at risk of infection, and
RT-PCR has high professional and technical requirements for operators.
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can amplify nucleic acids under isothermal
conditions4, and it had the advantages over real-time PCR assays in specificity sensitivity, cost
effectiveness and rapidity5, 6, 7. The objective of this study was to develop the one-pot real-time
RT-LAMP assay and the one-pot visual RT-LAMP assay for diagnosis of the pneumonia caused by
COVID-19, which would be suitable for use at less developed areas.
Materials and Methods
Primer design for RT-LAMP assays
The RT-LAMP primers targeting the N gene of COVID-19 (GenBank accession No. MN997409.1)
were designed using PrimerExplorer V5 (http://primerexplorer.jp/e/) and Oligo 7 (Molecular Biology
Insights, Inc. Colorado Springs, CO, USA) software packages. The primer sequences are GCC AAA
AGG CTT CTA CGC A (F3), TTT GGC CTT GTT GTT GTT GG (B3), TCC CCT ACT GCT GCC
TGG AGT TTT CGG CAG TCA AGC CTC TTC (FIP), TCC TGC TAG AAT GGC TGG CAA TTT
TTT TTG CTC TCA AGC TGG TTC A (BIP), CGA CTA CGT GAT GAG GAA CGA (LF) and
GCG GTG ATG CTG CTC T (LB), Table 1, and the length of the targeted sequence was 233 bp.
Preparation of nucleic acid samples
The N gene (GenBank accession No. MN997409.1) of COVID was chemically synthesized and
cloned into pUC57 plasmid (herein referred to as pUC57-N DNA) by General Biosystems (Anhui)
Co., Ltd, the pUC57-N DNA was used as the template for optimization of the RT-LAMP system, as
well as for determination of sensitivity.
Optimization of the real-time RT-LAMP reaction remperature
The real-time RT-LAMP assay with above designed RT-LAMP primers was performed in a 50-μL
reaction mixture containing 0.8 mM each of forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer
(BIP), 0.2 mM each of forward outer primer (F3) and backward outer primer (B3), 0.4 mM of forward
loop primer (LF) and backward loop primer (LB), 1.2 mM dNTPs, 1× Bst DNA Polymerase Buffer
(Zhengzhou Shenxiang Industrial Co., Ltd, China), 1 ×EvaGreen, 1 ×Rox, 1 pg pUC57-N DNA, and
25 U Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase 3.0 (New England Biolabs, Inc., MA, USA) 8, 9. The reaction
mixtures were heated at 55°C, 57°C, 59°C and 61°C for 50 min (30 s per cycle), individually. The
amplification plot and melt curve were obtained using a StepOneTM System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA).
Effect of inhibitors in blood samples on amplification efficiency of RT-LAMP assays
Because the RNA extraction step was omitted, the effect of inhibitors in blood samples on the
amplification efficiency of the RT-LAMP assays was to be determined. 10 µL, 7.5µL, 5 µL and 2.5
µL pork blood samples (purchased from Xuchang Market, China) free of COVID-19 were dissolved
in 10 µL 2019-nCoV-Fast-Sample Nucleic Acid Releasing Agent, respectively, which were added to
above 50 µL real-time RT-LAMP reaction system and heated at the optimized temperature for 50 min
(30 s per cycle) in StepOneTM System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Sensitivity Determination of the Real-Time RT- LAMP Assay and the Visual RT-LAMP Assay
The analytic sensitivities of the newly developed real-time RT-LAMP assay and visual RT-LAMP
assay were determined with pUC57-N DNA ranging from 2-0.02 fg, and the reaction mixtures were
heated at the optimal temperature for 60 min in a StepOneTM System (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) or in a water bath, when water bath was used, the reaction tube was sunk into water.

The 50-μL reaction mixture contained 0.8 mM each of forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner
primer (BIP), 0.2 mM each of forward outer primer (F3) and backward outer primer (B3), 0.4 mM of
forward loop primer (LF) and backward loop primer (LB), 1.2 mM dNTPs, 1× Bst DNA Polymerase
Buffer (Zhengzhou Shenxiang Industrial Co., Ltd, China), 0.1 mM MnSO4, 0.1 mM 4-(2-pyridylazo)
resorcinol, 5 µL pork blood samples free of COVID-19, 10 µL 2019-nCoV-Fast-Sample Nucleic
Acid Releasing Agent (Hunan Shengxiang Biology Technology Co., Ltd, China), 25 U Bst
DNA/RNA Polymerase 3.0 (New England Biolabs, Inc., MA, USA), and pUC57-N DNA of 2-0.02
fg9.
Stability and Repeatability Tests of the Real-Time LAMP Assay
The stability and the repeatability of the real-time LAMP system were tested with one-month interval.
The test was carried out at the optimized temperature determined as described above with four
positive controls (1 pg pUC57- N DNA) and four negative controls (ddH2O) in a StepOneTM System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Results and Analysis
Optimization of the real-time RT-LAMP reaction temperature
For the RT-LAMP reaction, as shown in Figure 1, all positive controls (with pUC57- N DNA as
template) had amplification, and the results of all negative controls (DNA template substituted by
ddH2O) were negative at 55°C, 57°C, 59°C and 91°C, however, there was no significant difference in
the amplification efficiency, and 59°C was temporarily was selected for the subsequent experiments.

2019-nCoV-Fast-Sample Nucleic Acid Releasing Agent was added to 50 µL the reaction system.
Effect of inhibitors in blood samples on the RT-LAMP amplification assays
The effect of inhibitors in blood samples on the amplification efficiency had been determined, as
Figure 2 indicated, when the real-time RT-LAMP reaction system was added with 10 µL blood
samples dissolved in 10 µL 2019-nCoV-Fast-Sample Nucleic Acid Releasing Agent (Hunan
Shengxiang Biology Technology Co., Ltd, China), there was no amplification; when 7.5 µL blood
samples and 10 µL 2019-nCoV-Fast-Sample Nucleic Acid Releasing Agent added, there was slight
amplification; when 5µL or 2.5 µL blood samples dissolved in 10 µL 2019-nCoV-Fast-Sample
Nucleic Acid Releasing Agent added, there was acceptable effect on the real-time RT-LAMP reaction.
Therefore, the blood sample volume of 5µL was selected for 50 µL one-pot real-time or visual
RT-LAMP reaction.
Sensitivity of the one-pot real-time or visual RT-LAMP assay
The detection limits of the one-pot real-time RT-LAMP assay and the one-pot visual RT-LAMP assay
were determined using pUC57-N DNA ranging from 2-0.02 fg at 59 °C for 60 min in a StepOneTM
System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) or in a water bath. The detection limits of both
the one-pot real-time RT-LAMP assay and the one-pot visual RT-LAMP assay were found to be ≥
0.2 fg pUC57-N DNA (Figure 3), which was equivalent to ≥ 6 copies.

Stability and Repeatability of the Real-Time LAMP Assay
The stability and the repeatability of the real-time LAMP system were tested with one-month interval.
As shown in Figure 4, the reactions of four positive controls were positive with the same
amplification plot and melt curve, while the reactions of all negative controls were negative with the
same melt curve. This demonstrated that the newly established real-time LAMP assay was robust and
repeatable.

Discussion
The one-pot real-time RT-LAMP assay and one-pot visual RT-LAMP assay for detection of
COVID-19 were established in the study, and the detection limit was ≥ 6 copies. Although the
specificity of the established RT-LAMP assays had been not determined, they were still considered to
be highly specific for following reason. Upon alignment in DNA Data Bank of Japan, the target
sequence of established RT-LAMP assays had 100% identities (233/233) with that of 35 COVID-19
strains, and had 88% identities (207/233) with that of 52 congeneric SARS Coronavirus strains,
among which there were 12 bp on the RT-LAMP primers, it was reported that 3 bp primer-template

mismatches extend the detection time from 21 min to 47 min10, therefore, the established RT-LAMP
assays were theoretically highly specific.
The Bst DNA/RNA Polymerase 3.0 (New England Biolabs, Inc., MA, USA) had been used in the
study. The enzyme has faborable perforance of both amplification and reverse transcription activity,
so it can use either DNA or RNA as template 11,12, no reverse transcriptase is needed, and the
estalished assays can be directly used for detection of the RNA virus.
The nucleic acid extraction had been omitted in the established one-pot real-time or visual RT-LAMP
assays, which had greatly reduced the infection risk of the operators. Furthermore, it was
recommended the visual RT-LAMP assay over the real-time RT-LAMP assay, one of four Negative
Controls in above sensitivity determination of the real-time RT-LAMP assay had amplification, while
all four Negative Controls of the visual RT-LAMP assay had no amplification, because the aerosol
that may leak was washed by water in water bath, the false positive rate caused by aerosol of the
real-time RT-LAMP assay was higher than that of the visual RT-LAMP assay which sunk the reaction
tube in water.
Conclusion
This study had established the one-pot real-time RT-LAMP assay and one-pot visual RT-LAMP assay
for the detection of COVID-19, and provided the rapid, reliable and sensitive tools for facilitating
preliminary and cost-effective prevention and control of COVID-19.
