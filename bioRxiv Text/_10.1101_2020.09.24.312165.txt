Abstract

27
28

Pathogenic coronaviruses represent a major threat to global public health. Here, using a

29

recombinant reporter virus-based compound screening approach, we identified several

30

small-molecule inhibitors that potently block the replication of the newly emerged severe

31

acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two compounds, nitazoxanide and

32

JIB-04 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of 4.90 μM and

33

0.69 μM, respectively, with specificity indices of greater than 150. Both inhibitors had in

34

vitro antiviral activity in multiple cell types against some DNA and RNA viruses, including

35

porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. In an in vivo porcine model of coronavirus

36

infection, administration of JIB-04 reduced virus infection and associated tissue pathology,

37

which resulted in improved body weight gain and survival. These results highlight the

38

potential utility of nitazoxanide and JIB-04 as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and

39

other viral pathogens.

INTRODUCTION

42
43

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented global

44

morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic destabilization. Thus, there is an urgent unmet

45

need to develop safe and effective countermeasures to combat the disease and provide

46

immediate treatment. Multiple efforts are underway to identify candidate drugs that inhibit

47

the replication of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1-

48

5), the cause of COVID-19 (6, 7). So far, several small-molecule inhibitors that interfere

49

with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry have been identified, including transmembrane serine

50

protease inhibitors camostat (8) and nafamostat (9), and endosomal inhibitors including

51

chloroquine and derivatives (9), E-64d (8), apilimod (10), and 25-hydroxycholesterol (11).

52

Drug screens and structural studies also revealed compounds that target SARS-CoV-2

53

viral enzymes such as the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (12-14) and the

54

main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) (15-17). Here, utilizing a fluorescent SARS-

55

CoV-2 virus and an imaging-based screen approach, we identified several known and

56

previously unknown broadly antiviral compounds that successfully inhibit SARS-CoV-2

57

replication.

58
59

RESULTS

60
61

To identify small molecules with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, we performed a screen with a

62

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 that encodes mNeonGreen as a reporter of infection (18) and

63

an in-house collection of ~200 compounds that comprise FDA-approved drugs, well-

64

defined broad-spectrum antivirals, and investigational new drugs. We identified

65

molecules with stronger antiviral efficacy (>44.8% inhibition) than the positive controls

66

chloroquine and remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1A and

67

Dataset S1).

69

We selected two small molecules for detailed characterization: [2-[(5-nitro-1,3-thiazol-2-

70

yl)carbamoyl]phenyl] acetate (nitazoxanide, abbreviated as NTZ), an FDA-approved drug

71

for treatment of diarrhea caused by Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum

72

infections (19), and 5-chloro-N-[(E)-[phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methylidene]amino]pyridin-2-

73

amine (JIB-04 E-isomer), a pan-Jumonji histone demethylase inhibitor (20) (Fig. S1A).

74

NTZ was chosen based on its broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several respiratory

75

viruses (rhinovirus A, influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus and respiratory

76

syncytial virus) (https://drugvirus.info/) and safety profile in humans. NTZ is currently

77

being tested in clinical trials for COVID-19 in Mexico and Brazil (ClinicalTrials.gov

78

identifiers: NCT04341493; NCT04348409). However, no pre-clinical data is published to

79

support an in vitro inhibitory function. JIB-04 was picked for its stronger anti-SARS-CoV-

80

2 activity than NTZ (Fig. S1B). Moreover, it has not been reported as an antiviral molecule

81

before and several histone demethylases were recently uncovered in a CRISPR/Cas9

82

genetic knockout screen of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency factors (21).

83
84

We confirmed that pre-treatment of cells with either NTZ or JIB-04 for 1 hr inhibited the

85

replication of a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain) by

86

viral antigen staining in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1B). In Vero E6 cells, NTZ and JIB-04 had

87

half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 4.90 μM (with 95% confidence

88

interval of 3.05-7.25 μM) and 695 nM (with 95% confidence interval of 567-822 nM),

89

respectively. Both drugs did not induce cytotoxicity at 300 μM and thus had excellent

90

selectivity indices (SI > 150). Intracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels also were reduced

91

significantly by NTZ and JIB-04 but not by camostat treatment (Fig. 1C).

92
93

To examine whether the lead compounds target cellular pathways (e.g., entry, translation,

94

replication, or assembly) shared by different viruses, we counter-screened 15 molecules

95

with a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) eGFP virus (22) and a replication-competent

96

chimeric VSV eGFP virus that encodes SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in place of the

97

native glycoprotein (23). Concanamycin A and MG132 preferentially (>50-fold) inhibited

98

VSV-SARS-CoV-2 than VSV, implying that at least part of the antiviral activity was

99

specific to the S protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the majority of the top hits from the drug

100

screen (thapsigargin, AG-1478, FTY720, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), arbidol,

101

nigericin, JIB-04, and nitazoxanide) suppressed both VSV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2

102

replication in MA104 cells (Fig. 2A). Using flow cytometry, we observed that NTZ or JIB-

103

04 reduced the infectivity of VSV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 at 6 hr post infection (hpi), within

104

a single replication cycle (Fig. 2B). Less GFP intensity was detected in infected cells (Fig.

105

S2A), suggesting that the inhibitors might act on a common post-entry pathway. NTZ or

106

JIB-04 reduced VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner without

107

apparent cytotoxicity (Fig. 2C and S2B). The inhibitory effects were more apparent when

108

cells were infected with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Fig.

109

S2C). At 30 μM, JIB-04 treatment led to 100-fold reduction of intracellular VSV-SARS-

110

CoV-2 RNA levels, comparable to the efficacy of chloroquine (Fig. S2D).

111
112

Unlike NTZ, with reported broad-spectrum antiviral activity (24-27), JIB-04 is not known

113

to have an antiviral function. We found that besides VSV (Fig. 2A), JIB-04 had antiviral

114

property against both DNA and RNA viruses, including vaccinia virus and two strains of

115

rotaviruses (RVs) (Fig. 2D). JIB-04 also inhibited the replication of enteric viruses, i.e. a

116

strain of porcine RV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Fig. 2E-F and Fig.

117

S2E), a porcine CoV that infects the small intestine of pigs and causes severe diarrheal

118

disease (28).

119
120

Ciliated airway epithelial cells are a target for SARS-CoV-2 in vivo (29), and the human

121

lung epithelial cell line, Calu-3, has been used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection as an

122

in vitro surrogate (8, 30). NTZ inhibition of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication, as measured by

123

viral RNA levels, was ineffective in HEK293-hACE2-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells, in

124

contrast to JIB-04 (Fig. 2G), suggesting distinct antiviral mechanisms.

125
126

Although NTZ and JIB-04 have been previously connected to interferon (IFN) and

127

autophagy activation (20, 31, 32), the antiviral activity that we observed was independent

128

of these pathways. Neither treatment led to the induction of IFN and IFN-stimulated gene

129

expression or the formation of LC3-positive punctate structures (Fig. S3A-B). Using a

130

dose-response drug matrix, we found that JIB-04 had synergistic antiviral effects with

131

chloroquine and NTZ in MA104 cells (Fig. 3A). Synergism was calculated by the highest

132

single agent (HSA) synergy model using SynergyFinder 2.0 (33). JIB-04 at 0.1-3 μM had

133

the most synergy with either chloroquine or NTZ at 1-10 μM (Fig. 3A). A combinatorial

134

effect of JIB-04 and camostat also was observed in Calu-3 cells (Fig. S3C), further

135

highlighting a unique antiviral mode of action of JIB-04.

137

Time of addition experiments also supported that both NTZ and JIB-04 primarily acted at

138

a post-entry step (Fig. 3B). Pre-incubation of the cells with JIB-04 for 1 hr significantly

139

reduced SARS-CoV-2 S mRNA transcription post VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3C).

140

Consistently, the newly synthesized full-length S protein levels were strongly decreased

141

(Fig. 3D). We obtained similar results with SARS-CoV-2 plasmid transfection. JIB-04

142

treatment suppressed S mRNA transcription (Fig. S3D) and almost completely prevented

143

the production of full-length and protease-processed SARS-CoV-2 S proteins (Fig. S3E).

144
145

In parallel, we examined the cellular signaling pathways modulated by JIB-04. Small

146

interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of JIB-04 cellular targets (i.e., histone

147

demethylases KDM4B, KDM4C, KDM5A, or KDM5B (20)) recapitulated the antiviral effect

148

of JIB-04 (Fig. 3E and Fig. S3F-G). We hypothesized that JIB-04 treatment led to H3K9

149

and H3K27 methylation and silenced expression of a subset of genes. To evaluate this

150

idea, we performed RNA-sequencing on mock and JIB-04 treated cells with or without

151

virus infection to identify the potential JIB-04 targets. Pathway analysis revealed

152

dampened metabolic signaling such as the cytochrome P450 system in JIB-04 treated

153

cells (Fig. S3H). Specifically, JIB-04 downregulated two cytochrome P450 enzymes,

154

CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR), product of

155

which represses transactivator of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 (34) (Fig. 3F). We validated by

156

quantitative PCR that JIB-04 treatment reduced CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and AHRR mRNA

157

levels by 4-6-fold (Fig. 3G). To explore the pharmacological utility of this finding, we tested

158

the antiviral activity of cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors Fluoxetine and Fluvoxamine

159

(35). Both compounds inhibited the replication of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3H) and wild-

160

type SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3I).

161
162

Next, we used a neonatal pig TGEV infection model (36) to assess the antiviral efficacy

163

of JIB-04 against coronavirus in vivo. Two-day old piglets were injected via intraperitoneal

164

route with JIB-04 at 24 hr and 6 hr before oral inoculation of TGEV (Fig. 4A). We

165

monitored body weight on a daily basis and recorded diarrhea development and mortality

166

every 6 hr. The animals in the control group lost more weight and had more severe

167

diarrhea than those receiving JIB-04 (Fig. S4A-B). At 2 days post infection, 3 out of 5

168

piglets in the DMSO group succumbed to infection as compared to 1 out of 5 animals in

169

the JIB-04 group (Fig. 4B). Consistent with our in vitro results (Fig. 2E-F), the TGEV viral

170

loads throughout the gastrointestinal tract, measured by viral RNA and titer levels, were

171

substantially lower in the JIB-04 treated piglets (Fig. 4C-D). The number of viral antigen

172

positive intestinal epithelial cells also was decreased following JIB-04 treatment (Fig.

173

S4C). Independent of virus inhibition, JIB-04 enhanced the expression of tight-junction

174

genes such as claudin-1 and ZO-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN-β and

175

TNF-α (Fig. S4D-E). Furthermore, we observed less severe enteropathy in the JIB-04

176

treated animals (Fig. 4E). Taken together, our data demonstrate in vivo antiviral activity

177

of JIB-04 against a major porcine CoV pathogen.

181

Using a repurposed compound screening approach, we identified drugs with reported

182

inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2, such as tetrandrine (37) and arbidol (38), and

183

characterized a number of previously unreported small-molecule (JIB-04, AG-1478,

184

nigericin, etc.) that reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several compounds converge on the

185

endosomal pathway: brefeldin A, concanamycin A, tetrandrine, and U18666A.

186

Furthermore, FTY720 induced formation of enlarged endosome/lysosome structure,

187

similar to that triggered by apilimod treatment (39), highlighting an important role of

188

endosomal trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection, at least in cell culture.

189
190

Our results highlight NTZ and JIB-04 as potential therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 and the

191

need for further evaluation. Compared to NTZ, JIB-04 does not have reported antiviral

192

properties. Another compound in our screen, GSK-J4, also is a histone demethylase

193

inhibitor, which targets JMJD3/KDM6B. However, it did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2

194

replication. Thus, a definitive involvement of certain KDM family members in SARS-CoV-

195

2 host interactions has not been established.

196
197

Although NTZ has been used to treat protozoan infections since 1984 (40), the

198

mechanisms underlying its anti-microbial activities are not fully elucidated. Our in vitro

199

results support a post-entry inhibitory mode of action, which was previously proposed for

200

hepatitis C virus (27). In a non-placebo-controlled setting, NTZ, given at the dosage of

201

500 mg twice a day for 5 days, was used to treat 150 severe COVID-19 patients in a

202

public hospital in Guayaquil, Ecuador (Villacís-Bermeo BA, Personal Communication,

203

May 15, 2020). Besides antiviral activity, NTZ is reported to reduce plasma IL-6 level in

204

mice (41), which suggests that it also might reduce inflammatory responses. We propose

205

that studies are needed to determine possible combinatorial efficacy of these antivirals in

206

combination with remdesivir in COVID-19 patients.

322

divided into three groups: a DMSO inoculation control group (control, n=5); a DMSO

323

inoculation and TGEV infection group (TGEV-DMSO, n=5); a JIB-04 inoculation and

324

TGEV infection group (TGEV-JIB-04, n=5)). Neonatal pigs were intraperitoneally injected

325

twice with JIB-04 (75 mg/kg) or DMSO at 24 hr and 6 hr prior to TGEV infection. TGEV-

326

DMSO and TGEV-JIB-04 groups were orally infected with 1×107.25 (1.778×107) TCID50

327

(equivalent to 1.245×107 PFU) of TGEV in 1.5 ml of DMEM per pig. Neonatal pigs were

328

weighed and observed for clinical signs every 8 hr throughout the study. Serum samples

329

were collected from each pig at 24 and 48 hpi to detect specific anti-TGEV antibodies.

330

The occurrence of diarrhea was monitored, and its severity was recorded based on an

331

established scoring system (44). In brief, diarrhea was scored on the basis of color,

332

consistency, and amount, and numbered as follows: 0 = normal; 1 = pasty; 2 = semi-liquid;

333

3 = liquid, and score ≥ 2 considered as diarrhea. At 48 hpi, all pigs were euthanized, and

334

intestinal tissues were collected for pathological examination and viral load analysis using

335

RT-qPCR and primers in Table S2.
