Abstract

18

The SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 as a zoonotic virus highly transmissible

19

between humans that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic

20

healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The

21

overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be ~2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients

22

age 70-79 years 4.

23

limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment

24

can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including

25

the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and

26

hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development.

27

Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing

28

as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of ~6,070 drugs with a

29

previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. In our primary

30

screen we found ~50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate <0.75%). Subsequent dose

31

validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 < 50 M. Hits from our screen are

32

enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 M),

33

Ciluprevir (20.77M). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10M), and Telaprevir (15.25M). These results demonstrate

34

that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved

35

drugs is both feasible and warranted.

36

drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some

37

previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for

38

rapid repurposing.

Introduction

44

The SARS virus and SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, are zoonotic coronaviruses

45

found in bats that can infect humans. Initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, myalgia,

46

cough, and headache. Infection usually resolves without active medical intervention, but for a subset of

47

cases infection can progress to viral pneumonia and a variety of complications including acute lung

48

damage leading to death 5. While complications are atypical in most cases, mortality rates increase

49

dramatically with the age and impaired health of infected patients. To date, much of our knowledge of

50

COVID-19 virology has been inferred from the study of similar Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

51

(SARS) coronavirus and related coronaviruses including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [reviewed in

52

6

53

a single positive-stranded genomic RNA. Infection starts with receptor-mediated virus internalization,

54

uncoating, and translation of the viral genome 7. Polyprotein cleavage by viral proteases yields a

55

complement of viral structural and accessory proteins. This polyprotein cleavage is mediated by the main

56

viral protease (Mpro), a chymotrypsin-like protease responsible for endoproteolytic cleavages of viral

57

polyproteins producing functional viral proteins. Recent structural biology work has solved the crystal

58

structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro yielding structural insights into Mpro function

]. Like all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits an enveloped ribonucleoprotein helical capsid containing

8,9

.

59

Antiviral drugs effective for COVID-19 would have a broad impact on global healthcare in the

60

current coronavirus pandemic. Existing antiviral drugs on the market target a wide variety of both RNA

61

and DNA viruses. Probably the most successful approved antivirals are protease inhibitors such as

62

atazanavir for HIV-1 and simeprevir for hepatitis C. [reviewed in 10 and 11]. Other conceptual COVID-19

63

antiviral targets include the host ACE2 receptor, viral replicase, and viral genome encapsidation.

64

However, previous work with other RNA viruses suggest that Mpro function is essential for viral

65

replication and readily targetable using existing technology.

Thus, while there are many potentially

66

targetable activities for COVID-19, the coronavirus Mpro seems a likely choice for rapid drug

67

development.

68

To accelerate drug development we employed a drug repurposing strategy, an approach of utilizing

69

previously approved drugs for new indications 12,13. Previous work suggests libraries enriched with known

70

bioactive drug-like compounds provide the best opportunity for finding new lead compounds 14,15. Thus

71

we attempted the selective optimization of side activities (SOSA) approach 16 as a rapid and cost effective

72

means to identify candidate hits while minimizing the number of compounds screened. The SOSA

73

approach proceeds by two steps. First a limited set of carefully chosen, structurally diverse, well-

74

characterized drug molecules are screened; as approved drugs, their bioavailability, toxicity and efficacy

75

in human therapy has already been demonstrated 16,17. To screen as much of the available approved drug

76

space as possible in an easily accessible format we chose to screen the Broad Institute Drug Repurposing

77

Library (6070 compounds, see Table S1)

78

approved or experimental drugs known to human clinical medicine 19. There are significant cost and time

79

advantages realized by drug repurposing as it can accelerate the preclinical phase of development and

80

streamline clinical trials to focus on efficacy rather than safety.

18

. This represents about half of the approximately 14,000

81

Repositioning existing approved drugs with the capacity to inhibit COVID-19 virus replication and

82

infection would be of profound utility and immediately impact health care in the current pandemic. There

83

are no drugs in clinical use specifically targeting coronavirus replication. The major advantage of the

84

approach taken here is that by screening drugs with a history of previous clinical use, we will be focusing

85

on compounds with known properties in terms of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and

86

toxicity. Thus, the Broad Repurposing Library we screened consists of compounds suitable for rapid

87

translation to human efficacy trials.

Development of fluorescent Mpro Assays

90

We began assay development by selecting potentially suitable synthetic Mpro substrates and compared

91

catalyzed hydrolysis curves between 5 fluorescently labeled substrates (Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AFC

92

DABCYL-VKLQ-EDANS, Ac-VKLQ-AFC, DABCYL-TSAVLQSGFRKM-EDANS21 , and MCA-

93

AVLQSGFR-K(Dnp)-K-NH2)22. We chose to use the recently published Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AFC

94

(Abu=2-Aminobutyrate, Tle=tButylglycine) synthetic non-canonical amino-acid containing peptide as

95

Mpro more readily cleaves this preferred sequence as compared to the native VKLQ sequence 20(Fig 1A).

96

Substrates

97

drastically lower rates of Mpro catalyzed hydrolysis and were not considered further in our assay

98

development (Fig 1A). To determine concentration ratios between Mpro and substrate, we next preformed

99

a two-dimensional titration and chose 625nM Mpro and 8µM substrate for a balance of relatively modest

100

Mpro protein requirement and a robust fluorescence intensity (Fig 2B). Before screening the Broad library,

101

we piloted our assay conditions against the NIH Clinical collections library (~650 compounds) and

102

calculated our Z’-factor for each plate at 0.780 and 0.784 (Fig 1C and D). Z’-factor is a score of suitability

103

of assays for high-throughput screening and is derived from the equation Z’ -factor = 1 −

104

σ = standard deviation, µ=mean, p=positive controls, and n=negative controls. A score greater than 0.5

105

indicates a screenable assay. Although no promising compounds were identified from this smaller library,

106

it demonstrated that our assay was sufficiently robust for screening the much larger Broad Repurposing

107

library.

Drug Repurposing Strategy – screening the Broad Repurposing Library
The concept of drug repurposing is to utilize existing therapeutic drugs to treat a new disease indication.

126

This approach is particularly relevant for COVID-19 because of the potential for an accelerated clinical

127

impact as compared to de novo drug development. A systematic approach to facilitate drug repurposing

128

has recently been described (18, http:// www.broadinstitute.org/repurposing) and has made a large collection

129

of drugs with previous history of use in humans available for high throughput screening. We acquired this

130

~6,070 compound library as an assay ready collection in 384-well format. We conducted the library screen

at 384-well density using the optimized kinetic Mpro assay described in Fig 1. Our overall repurposing

132

strategy is described in Fig 2A. We conducted a single point screen at 50 M compound concentration and

133

observed ~50 compounds with activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for an overall hit rate <0.75%. These

134

compounds were screened in parallel against the natural amino acid substrate (Ac-VKLQ-AFC) as well as

135

a kinetically preferred substrate (Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AFC) (Fig 2B). Individual compounds are shown

(a) Schematic of screening funnel. The Broad Repurposing library was screened both empirically and
virtually. Any hit from the Broad library (Z-score ≤ -2) was validated for dose-responsiveness. All suitable
compounds passing this filter with satisfactory curve fitting and potency were ordered as powder and revalidated. Future efforts will test for selectivity and in orthogonal assays for suitability. Although outside
the scope of this report, determination of viral anti-replicative properties as well as toxic profile at required
dosage will be determined. The goal of this paradigm is to find suitable candidates for development both
as tools for probing underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 as well as for translational potential. (b)

We validated the hits from the primary screen by conducting a 10-point dose-response analysis with a drug
concentration range from 150 M down to 7.6 nM (3-fold dilution series). From this dose-response analysis,
IC50 values were calculated for dose-responsive hits. Several of the drugs uncovered in our screen
including, Boceprevir (IC50 = 0.95 µM), Ciluprevir (IC50 = 20.77 M), Narlaprevir (IC50 = 1.10 µM ),
Telaprevir (IC50 = 15.25 µM), are antiviral compounds targeting the hepatitis C NS3 protease.
Boceprevir, Narlaprevir, and Telaprevir are approved drugs with a track record of safe use in human patients
23-28
. Other relatively potent dose responsive compounds emerging from our screen include calpeptin (IC50
= 4.05 M), aurothioglucose (IC50 = 13.32 M), PYR-41 (IC50 = 17.38 M), and hemin (IC50= 9.68 )

Discussion

199

Therapeutic potential of Mpro as a target

200

A general discussion of drug repurposing for COVID-19 suggests viral encoded proteases may be relevant

201

therapeutic targets for coronaviruses 31. Relative to most other human viruses, our understanding of the

202

virology of SARS-CoV-2 remains incomplete. However, after decades of extensive research, we have

203

learned a great deal about viral proteases in general and the chemical means to inhibit them from our studies

204

of HIV-1, hepatitis C and rhinoviruses. Likewise protease inhibitors targeting the SARS protease have

205

been investigated 32,33. Furthermore, previous work on SARS Mpro has demonstrated that it is a targetable

206

enzyme worth significant translational effort 34.

207
208

Perspective on hit compounds and future screening

209

Sequence alignment shows a high degree of homology between SARS Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with

210

~95% amino acid sequence identity. Recent studies have solved the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro

211

and compared it with SARS Mpro showing that they have similar but distinct active site pockets and will

212

require distinct dugs for potent and highly specific inhibition. This sequence and structural information has

213

provided an opportunity to conduct in silico docking of known drugs to the COVID-19 virus Mpro active

214

site. However thus far, such analysis has not uncovered potent inhibitors of Mpro. Recent in silico work

215

has suggested that protease inhibitor drugs may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro 35,36.

216

suggest that in silico approaches alone cannot substitute for enzyme kinetic screening evaluation of Mpro

However, our findings

Potential for Drug Repurposing and Clinical Trials

221

To date clinical trials for COVID-19 have not yielded potent antiviral therapies. The objective of this work

222

is to complete a survey of approved drugs to identify therapies that can block COVID-19 viral replication

223

by inhibiting the main viral protease. The advantage of this approach is that any approved drug identified

224

can be advanced rapidly to clinical trials without extensive multi-year preclinical development efforts. This

225

is also particularly germane given the limitations of animal models of COVID-19 infection and

226

pathogenesis.

227

A diverse variety of initial hits were identified in our high throughput screen of the broad library.

228

Of these, the most potent hits are all known protease inhibitors and there is strong representation from

229

protease inhibitors developed to inhibit HCV protease NS3/4A (Boceprevir, Ciluprevir, Narlaprevir, and

230

Telaprevir).

231

pharmacological and pharmacodynamic properties well suited to repurposing as a COVID-19 antiviral

232

therapy. Boceprevir and Narlaprevir appear the most potent against Mpro and may be suitable for

233

repurposing.

Clearly as approved or well-developed clinical candidates, these drugs exhibit

234
235

Previous clinical evaluation of Boceprevir (also known as Victrelis) showed it to be safe and

236

effective for treating HCV 37. Boceprevir was approved as a first in class HCV NS3/4A serine protease

237

inhibitor for treatment of chronic HCV infection. Boceprevir was FDA approved for use in the USA in

238

2011 and Boceprevir treatment is given as a combination therapy with interferon 2b and ribavirin.

239

Likewise, clinical evaluation of Narlaprevir (also known as Arlansa or SCH900518) showed it to be both

243
244

Our findings demonstrate Boceprevir and Narlaprevir potency against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the

245

one micromolar range.

246

therapeutics make them drug repurposing candidates worth further evaluation.

247

commercially developed NS3/4A inhibitor lead compounds may be suitable for further repurposing studies.

248

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed an urgent unmet medical need for potent antiviral agents for

249

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because antiviral therapies are frequently most effective when used

250

in combination 40, it may be useful to consider combining Mpro inhibition with other antiviral strategies for

251

treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. For instance, inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 replicase in combination with

252

Mpro inhibition might exhibit synergistic antiviral activity.

253

replicase inhibitor has shown efficacy against a wide variety of RNA viral replicases including SARS-CoV-

254

255

synergistic drug repurposing strategy for treating COVID-19. Taken together, the work presented here

256

supports the rapid evaluation of previous HCV NS3/4A inhibitors for repurposing as a COVID-19 therapy.

Methods:

258
259

Recombinant Protein

260

Recombinant Mpro was purified using constructs and methods as previously described 8. pGEX-6p-1

261

plasmid containing SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was gifted from Hilgenfeld lab at Luebeck University, Germany.

262

Plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) bacteria (NEB). A single colony was inoculated into 10mL

263

Terrific Broth (TB) + Carbenicillin (25ug/mL) and grown overnight to saturation. Overnight culture was

264

transferred into 1L of TB and grown in a shaking incubator at 37ºC until log phase (OD 600~0.7). Culture

265

was induced with IPTG (1mM final) and kept in 37ºC shaking incubator for 4 hours. Culture was spun

266

down at 3,400rpm for 30 min at 4ºC, and pellet resuspended in PBS with 10% sucrose then spun at previous

267

conditions. PBS was aspirated and bacteria pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70ºC.

268

Pellet was thawed and resuspended in Lysis buffer (PBS, 0.3% lysozyme, 1mM DTT, 1.5% Sarkosyl,

269

RNAse A, and DNAse I) and sonicated for 10 seconds ON time, 20 seconds OFF time for 5 minutes of

270

total ON time at 60% amplitude. Lysate was spun at 16,000rpm for 30 minutes at 4ºC. 4mL of Ni-NTA

271

beads and supernatant were rotated for 2 hours at room temperature. Gravity column was used for

272

purification with His6-tagged Mpro binding to Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen 30210), washed with lysis buffer +

273

10mM imidazole and eluted with increasing concentration of imidazole (50mM, 100mM, 150mM and

274

200mM). The majority of Mpro eluted at between 150-200mM imidazole and was 90%+ pure by

275

Coomassie stained gel analysis. Mpro fractions were pooled and buffer exchanged into 20mM Tris pH 7.8,

276

150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70ºC. Yield and

277

purity were assessed via BCA (ThermoFisher 23225) and Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE.

Fluorescent Mpro Protease Assay

281

Fluorescent Mpro peptides were synthesized by Anaspec (www.anaspec.com) at 90% purity and frozen in

282

1 mg aliquots. Stock concentration of substrates were made by reconstituting powder in 100uL DMSO

283

(10mg/ml) and storing at -70°C. Optimal Mpro substrates were previously determined to be Ac-Val-Lys-

284

Leu-Gln-AFC for physiological substrates and Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AFC, a noncanonical amino acid

285

substrate

monitored at 380/20 nm excitation and 500/20 nm emission wavelengths. FRET-based substrates Dabcyl-

287

Val-Lys-Leu-Gln-EDANS was measured at 336/20 nm excitation and 490/20 nm emission wavelengths

288

and MCA-Ala-Val-Lys-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe-Lys-DNP-Lys was monitored at 325/20 nm excitation and

289

392/20 nm emission wavelengths. We used 20mM Tris pH 7.8, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT,

290

0.05% Triton X-100 as the assay buffer. Assay conditions were at room temperature (25°C) for all assays.

2D Titration main screen optimization

293

2D titration for determining the main screen ratios was done in 96 well black opaque plates (Corning 3686

294

NBS). The top concentration of Mpro was 2.5µM and serial diluted to 0.0395µM along the Y-axis of the

295

plate. The top concentration of substrate was 16µM and serial diluted along the X-axis of the plate.

296

Fluorescence was monitored at 380/20 nm excitation and 500/20 nm emission wavelengths.

The Broad Repurposing Library was ordered and plated into black opaque 384-well plates (Greiner 781209)

300

at 100nL of 10mM (slight variations depending on compound) compound in DMSO. 10uL of diluted Mpro

301

(625nM final concentration in reaction buffer detailed above) was added with a MultiFlo FX liquid

In Silico Docking of the Broad Repurposing Library with Mpro

316

We utilized the Schrodinger Maestro software package

317

compounds in the Broad Repurposing library. In this approach we generated a receptor grid model of the

318

Mpro active site and serially docked each compound in the Broad Repurposing library with the active site

319

model using the physics based Glide algorithm 43,44. We chose the Glide algorithm over the many competing

320

options because of its superior performance in head to head comparisons of algorithms 43.
