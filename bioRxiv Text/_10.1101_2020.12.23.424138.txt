Abstract
The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
necessitates the fast development of vaccines to meet a worldwide need. mRNA-based
vaccines are the most promising technology for rapid and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
development and production. We have designed CVnCoV, a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)
encapsulated, sequence optimised mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that encodes for full
length, pre-fusion stabilised Spike protein. Unlike other mRNA-based approaches, CVnCoV
exclusively consists of non-chemically modified nucleotides and can be applied at
comparatively low doses. Here we demonstrate that CVnCoV induces robust humoral and
cellular responses in non-human primates (NHPs). Animals vaccinated with 8 µg of CVnCoV
were protected from challenge infection with SARS-CoV-2. Comprehensive analyses of

pathological changes in challenged animals via lung histopathology and Computed
Tomography (CT) scans gave no indication of enhanced disease upon CVnCoV vaccination.
These results demonstrate safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of CVnCoV in
NHPs that extend our previously published preclinical data and provide strong support for
further clinical testing in ongoing phase 2b/3 efficacy studies.

Introduction
One year after the first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) were identified, a pandemic of >70 million confirmed infections has spread worldwide 1.
Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far resulted in 1.7 million deaths 1,
highlighting the urgent need for rapid vaccine development. Fifty-six vaccine candidates are
currently in clinical development 2, with the first highly promising clinical efficacy data available
3,4

. mRNA vaccine technologies allow both rapid development and large-scale production 5 and

have recently emerged as the most promising technology to tackle this worldwide crisis

6 7 8 9,

10

.

CureVac’s mRNA technology termed RNActive® is based on non-chemically modified,
sequence engineered mRNA, and is designed to allow rapid development of human vaccines
to emerging diseases. RNActive® vaccines formulated with protamine have been employed in
the development of cancer immunotherapy
vaccines

as well as in the context of prophylactic

15 16 17 18

. A first-in-human phase 1 study using this formulation in a rabies mRNA

vaccine demonstrated proof of concept of chemically unmodified mRNA vaccines in humans
and found significant levels of rabies neutralizing antibodies

19

. Further studies established

significant improvements of vaccine efficacy by encapsulating the mRNA in lipid nanoparticles
(LNPs). These improvements were demonstrated in preclinical models 16 and a phase 1 clinical
trial, where two 1 or 2 μg doses elicited immune responses comparable to a three-dose
regimen of a licensed rabies vaccine 20.

RNActive® technology has now been applied to the development of CVnCoV; an LNP
formulated mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The mRNA component of the vaccine
consists of non-chemically modified nucleotides and has been optimised for high expression
of the encoded protein and moderate activation of innate immune responses. CVnCoV
encodes for full-length Spike (S) protein with two proline mutations (S-2P) aimed to stabilise
the protein in the pre-fusion conformation, as previously described for MERS- and SARS-CoV21 22

1

. This protein, a trimeric glycoprotein on the viral surface, is responsible for receptor

binding and viral entry 23 24, 25 and represents a critical target for viral neutralizing antibodies 26
27

.

Preclinical results have shown the induction of robust cellular and humoral immune responses
in CVnCoV vaccinated rodents, as well as the ability to protect against challenge infection in a
hamster model 5. CVnCoV testing in phase 1 clinical trials demonstrated safety and tolerability
as well as full seroconversion in the 12 µg vaccine group two weeks post injection of the second
dose. Importantly, this group exhibited comparable virus neutralizing antibody titres to the
median titres observed in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients exhibiting multiple
symptoms 28. These results supported further clinical testing of the vaccine currently in phase
2b/3 studies that will investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the candidate
vaccine CVnCoV.
Here, we evaluate CVnCoV efficacy in a rhesus macaque SARS-CoV-2 challenge model. Nonhuman primates develop mild clinical disease with high levels of viral replication in both the
upper and lower respiratory tract and pathological changes indicative of viral pneumonia upon
infection with SARS-CoV-2

29 30

. In this study we show that CVnCoV had protective impact

against challenge with 5 x 106 PFU via the IN and IT routes in an NHP in vivo model of COVID19. Protective endpoints include significantly reduced virus load and protection against lung
pathology.

Results
Immunogenicity
Eighteen rhesus macaques of Indian origin were divided into three groups of six, each
comprising three males and three females. Animals were vaccinated twice with either 0.5 µg
or 8 µg LNP-formulated mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 S-2P (CVnCoV) or remained
unvaccinated prior to challenge

30

with wild type SARS-CoV-2 (Victoria/1/2020) four weeks

after the second vaccination (Figure 1A).
Analysis of binding titres to either a trimeric form of the S protein or the isolated receptor binding
domain (RBD) showed a measurable increase in spike (Figure 1B) and RBD-specific IgG titres
(Figure 1C) in animals vaccinated with 8 µg after a single vaccination. A significant increase
was observed in IgG titres after the second vaccination on study day 42, with animals exhibiting
median endpoint titres of 1.6 x 103 and 3.2 x 103 for S and RBD reactive antibodies,
respectively (Figures 1 B and C). A further increase of spike- and RBD specific IgG titres was
seen upon challenge in this group, particularly in serum collected at the time of termination
(study days 62, 63, and 64).
As expected, no significant increase in spike or RBD-specific IgG antibodies was seen in the
0.5 µg CVnCoV (intentionally sub-optimal) dose or in the unvaccinated control group during
the vaccination phase. However, a gradual increase in Spike and RBD specific IgG titres was
observed at each of the sampling points in animals vaccinated with 0.5 µg CVnCoV after
challenge (Figures 1 B and C). No increase in Spike- or RBD specific IgG titres was observed
in the unvaccinated controls (Figure 1B and C).
In agreement with the induction of binding antibodies, robust levels of virus neutralising titres
(VNTs) were detectable after the second vaccination in the 8 µg group (Figure 1D). VNTs
peaked on d42 at median titres of 2.7 x 104. Neutralising antibody titres remained relatively
unchanged upon challenge until day 62, 63, and 64 of the experiment. Animals in the 0.5 µg
and unvaccinated control groups remained negative before challenge, while SARS-CoV-2

infection induced small increases in antibody titres in 4/6 and 5/6 animals in the 0.5 µg and
unvaccinated group, respectively.
In order to assess CVnCoV induced cellular responses, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) isolated at different time points post vaccination and challenge were stimulated with
pools of peptides spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. IFN- release of stimulated cells
was measured by ELISpot. Analysis of responses to summed pools in the vaccination phase
showed increases in spike-specific IFN- in 8 µg CVnCoV vaccinated animals, two weeks after
the first and, more pronounced, two weeks after the second vaccination (Figure 2A panel 1).
Stimulation with ten individual pools each covering approximately 140 amino acids of the S
protein demonstrated the induction of cells reactive to peptides across the whole length of S
upon vaccination with 8 µg of CVnCoV (Figure 2A panel 3).
There were no clear responses in 0.5 µg CVnCoV or unvaccinated animals in the vaccination
phase (Figure 2A panels 1, 2 and 4). One of the female animals in the negative control group
showed particularly high IFN- secretion after stimulation with peptide pool 2 (covering part of
the N-terminal domain (NTD)) throughout the experiment and peptide pool 3 (covering part of
the NTD and RBD) on d56 (Figure 2A panel 1 and 4).
Increased spike-specific IFN-responses were detectable in all animals on d62-64 post
challenge (Figure 2B panels 1-4). Of note, increases of cellular responses in animals
vaccinated with 8 µg of CVnCoV were less pronounced than in the other groups, likely
indicative of lower levels of viral replication in these animals (Figure 2B panel 3).
Protective efficacy
Presence or SARS-CoV-2 total RNA in the upper and lower respiratory tract post-challenge
was monitored via qRT-PCR (Figure 3). Viral replication in the upper respiratory tract peaked
on d59 in unvaccinated animals, which reached median values of 2.7 x 107 cp/ml in nasal
swabs (Figure 3A), and remained detectable until termination on d62-d64. No significant
difference between viral replication in animals vaccinated with 0.5 µg CVnCoV and
unvaccinated control animals was measured in nose swabs. Overall, 8 µg CVnCoV vaccination

induced the lowest number of viral RNA copies in the upper respiratory tract, where median
values of 2.9 x 106 cp/ml in nasal swabs, respectively, were detectable on d59. However, the
difference between the study groups was not statistically significant. Comparable results were
generated in throat swabs (Supplementary Figure 1A).
Additional analyses assessing subgenomic (sg) RNA via qRT PCR indicative of viral replication
yielded overall low sgRNA levels in the upper respiratory tract. Values peaked on d59 and
returned to baseline on d62 in all animals. In nasal swabs, sg RNA levels were lowest in
CVnCoV vaccinated animals with values of 0.4 x 104 compared to 3.7 x 104 cp/ml in
unvaccinated control animals. Three of 6 animals in the 8 µg CVnCoV vaccinated group
remained negative at all time points while 5/6 animals in the unvaccinated group had
detectable levels of subgenomic viral RNA (Figure 3D). Analyses of throat swabs showed no
significant difference of subgenomic RNA between the groups and median values remained
below the lower limit of quantification in all animals (Supplementary Figure 1 B).
Parallel analyses of the lower respiratory tract of in-life (d59) and post-mortem (d62-d64)
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples showed significantly reduced levels of total viral RNA
upon 8 µg CVnCoV vaccination at both time points (Figure 3B). Median values of total RNA on
d59 and d62-d64 were 4.3 x 106 and 1.1 x 105 cp/ml in the control group, while animals
vaccinated with 8 µg of CVnCoV featured median titres of 0.6 x 104 and 0.3 x 104, respectively.
RNA levels in BAL were below the lower limit of quantification for all but one animal in the 8 µg
CVnCoV group on d59, which featured low RNA counts. Total viral RNA levels in 0.5 µg
CVnCoV vaccinated animals were comparable to the control group. Of note, BAL analyses on
d59 only depict female animals and one male animal of the unvaccinated group. The remaining
animals were excluded from this analysis since suboptimal BAL sampling conditions prevented
further evaluation.
The analysis of lung tissue collected at necropsy confirmed results gained in BAL samples.
Median titres of 2.9 x 108 cp/g were detectable in the unvaccinated group while all animals in
the CVnCoV 8 µg vaccinated groups remained below the lower limit of quantification (Figure

3C). There was no statistically significant difference between animals in the 0.5 µg CVnCoV
and the unvaccinated group.
Subgenomic viral RNA analysis in BAL and lung tissue samples yielded comparable results:
RNA indicative of replicating virus was detectable in BAL and lung samples of unvaccinated
and 0.5 µg CVnCoV vaccinated animals on d59 and d62-d64, respectively. All animals in the
8 µg CVnCoV group were negative in these analyses (Figure 3E and F).
Evaluation of further tissue samples collected at necropsy revealed low but detectable signals
of SARS-CoV-2 total RNA in trachea and tonsils of 0.5 µg CVnCoV and unvaccinated animals,
while 8 µg CVnCoV vaccinated animals remained negative (Supplementary Figure 1 C and
D). No viral RNA was detectable in spleen, duodenum, colon, liver, or kidney in any group
(Supplementary Figure 1 E-I).
Histopathology and imaging
Histopathological analyses of lung samples taken at necropsy showed lesions consistent with
infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs of challenged animals (Figure 4). Briefly, the lung
parenchyma showed multifocal to coalescing areas of pneumonia surrounded by unaffected
parenchyma. Alveolar damage, with necrosis of pneumocytes was a prominent feature in the
affected areas. The alveolar spaces within these areas were often thickened. Damaged
alveolar walls contained mixed inflammatory cells including macrophages, lymphocytes, viable
and degenerated neutrophils, and occasional eosinophils. Alveolar oedema and alveolar type
II pneumocyte hyperplasia were also observed. In distal bronchioles and bronchiolo-alveolar
junctions, degeneration and sloughing of epithelial cells were present. In the respiratory
epithelium of larger airways, occasional focal, epithelial degeneration, and sloughing were
observed. Low numbers of mixed inflammatory cells, comprising neutrophils, lymphoid cells,
and occasional eosinophils, infiltrated bronchial and bronchiolar walls. In the lumen of some
airways, mucus admixed with degenerated cells, mainly neutrophils and epithelial cells, was
seen. Within the parenchyma, perivascular and peribronchiolar cuffing were also observed,

with mostly lymphoid cells comprising the infiltrates. No remarkable changes were observed in
non-pulmonary tissues.
In agreement with reduced levels of viral RNA, the evaluation of lung samples using a
histopathology scoring system showed a significant reduction in severity of lung lesions in
CVnCoV vaccinated animals compared to 0.5 µg CVnCoV vaccinated and unvaccinated
groups (Figure 5A and B).
Viral RNA was observed in alveolar epithelial cells and within the inflammatory cell infiltrates
(Figure 4). The quantity of virus RNA observed by in situ hybridisation (ISH) was also
significantly reduced in 8 µg CVnCoV vaccinated animals when compared to 0.5 µg CVnCoV
and unvaccinated (Fig 5C).
To gain in-life view of pathological changes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
complete lung, CT scanning was performed prior to challenge and post-challenge on study
day 61. Overall, the apparent level of disease was relatively mild and only affected less than
25% of the lung. Post-challenge, abnormalities in the lung were detected in 6 of 6 animals in
the 0.5 µg CVnCoV group, and 5 of 6 in the unvaccinated control group, while only 3 of 6
animals vaccinated with 8 µg CVnCoV exhibited detectable changes. Lowest levels of total
scoring in CT scans were seen in animals vaccinated with 8 µg of CVnCoV (Figure 5D). Of
note, highest scores were seen in the 0.5 µg CVnCoV group in this analysis. However, values
were not statistically different to the control group.

Discussion
Our data demonstrate that CVnCoV is safe and highly immunogenic in rhesus macaques.
Vaccination with 8 µg CVnCoV elicited robust humoral responses, known to correlate with

to elicit detectable levels of antibodies before challenge, infected animals raised specific
antibody responses faster than the unvaccinated control group, indicative of a previously
induced priming response in these animals. These data extend our preclinical finding in mice
and hamsters, that elicited robust, dose-dependent humoral immune responses upon
vaccination with CVnCoV using comparable or lower doses of CVnCoV 5. In addition, our
results support previously published interim phase I clinical data that demonstrated the
induction of humoral responses with two doses up to 12 µg 28.
Furthermore, data presented here demonstrated the strong induction of S specific cellular
responses in CVnCoV vaccinated animals via IFN ELISpot. In animals vaccinated with 8 µg
of CVnCoV, increasing responses against peptides covering the whole length of the S protein
were elicited after first and second vaccination. These data are in line with our previous reports
in mice that demonstrated the ability of CVnCoV to induce high S-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T
cell responses 5. The generation of robust T cell responses is likely to support vaccine efficacy
against SARS-CoV-2. Recent data have demonstrated that CD8+ T cells contribute to viral
control in a rhesus macaque model 32. While the exact role of T cells in the context of COVID19 is still under some debate, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are readily detectable in
humans and may play a role in long term protection 33 34 35.
Of note, the analysis of cellular responses revealed one animal in the unvaccinated group that
mainly reacted against a single peptide pool of S covering amino acids 129-267 which
represent part of the NTD of S. Responses to other immunological read outs, i.e. specific
antibodies and nucleocapsid and membrane antigens in ELISpot, were not high pre-challenge,
ruling out a prior infection of this particular animal with SARS-CoV-2. While the reason for this
observation remains unclear, a possible explanation is cross-reactive T cell epitope of a preexisting response to a seasonal coronavirus infection.
Quantification of viral RNA copies upon challenge infection demonstrated a reduction of viral
replication in the upper respiratory tract in 8 µg CVnCoV vaccinated animals. Importantly, this
vaccine dose was able to protect the lungs of challenged animals. Protection was both

demonstrated by undetectable levels of viral RNA and by reduced pathological changes upon
challenge infection compared to unvaccinated animals. More effective protection of the lower
respiratory tract (LRT) compared to the upper respiratory tract (URT) in the presence of a
robust immune responses is in line with our previously published results in hamsters 5 and with
reports of other mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in NHP challenge models 6 7.
In terms of vaccine safety, the injection of 0.5 µg or 8 µg of CVnCoV elicited no adverse
reactions to vaccination and no differences in weight or temperature were observed between
groups during the vaccination phase of the study (data not shown), supporting a favourable
safety profile of the vaccine in rhesus macaques at the doses used.
Previous vaccination studies in the context of SARS- and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS)- CoV suggest an association with vaccine enhanced disease in animal models
(reviewed in 36 37), highlighting the need for careful evaluation of this potential risk during SARSCoV-2 vaccine development. However, no signs of vaccine enhanced disease (VED), post
challenge, were observed in this study. To date, neither preclinical

38 6 39 40

, nor clinical

evidence indicating a risk of VED in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been reported.
Vaccine enhanced disease can be caused by antibodies (antibody-dependent enhanced
disease, ADE (reviewed in

41

) as previously described for a feline coronavirus

42

. Such

antibodies most likely possess non-neutralising activity, and enhance viral entry causing
increased viral replication and disease exacerbation. Results presented here give no indication
of increased viral replication in animals vaccinated with CVnCoV. Importantly, enhanced
replication in the respiratory tract or distal organs such as spleen, duodenum, colon, liver, or
kidney was not detectable in the 0.5 µg group of the study. These animals featured low levels
of S binding but undetectable levels of VNTs upon challenge infection, creating conditions
under which ADE could hypothetically occur.
Another cause of disease enhancement may be vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory
disease (VAERD) that is hallmarked by increased inflammation due to Th2-biased immune
responses and high ratios of non-neutralising to neutralising antibodies (reviewed in

43 41 44

).

CVnCoV and gave no indication for increased inflammation and pathological changes in suboptimally dosed animals.
Results presented here extend our knowledge of CVnCoV safety, immunogenicity and
protective efficacy in a highly relevant model system for SARS-CoV-2. The overall outcome of
the study in non-human primates in terms of immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and
pathology are comparable to results in the hamster model, providing support for hamsters as
a model system for SARS-CoV. We conclude that CVnCoV is highly efficacious at a low dose
of 8 µg in a COVID-19 NHP challenge model while being safe at both doses tested with lack
of any indication of disease enhancement. In alignment with the phase I interim safety and
immunogenicity data of CVnCoV 28, these results provide strong support for further evaluation
in the ongoing phase 2b/3 HERALD clinical trial.

Materials and Methods
mRNA vaccines
The mRNA vaccine is based on the RNActive® platform (claimed and described in e.g.
WO2002098443 and WO2012019780) and is comprised of a 5′ cap structure, a GC-enriched
open reading frame (ORF), 3′ UTR, polyA tail. It does not include chemically modiﬁed
nucleosides. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulation of mRNA was performed by Polymun
Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH (Klosterneuburg, Austria). The LNPs used in
this study are particles of ionizable amino lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol and a PEGylated
lipid. The mRNA encoded protein is based on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 NCBI
Reference Sequence NC_045512.2, GenBank accession number YP_009724390.1 and
encodes for full length S featuring K986P and V987P mutations.
Animals
Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), Indian origin, were obtained from a UK Home Office
approved colony. In total, this study included 18 animals (9 male, 9 female) with a weight of >
4.5 kg and an age of 3-6 years.

All animal work was conducted at Public health England (PHE) Porton Down in compliance
with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 with licensed individuals
performing all procedural techniques. The study was conducted under the authority of a UK
Home Office approved project licence

that had been subject to local ethical review at PHE

Porton Down by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB). Animals were housed
in compatible social groups, in cages in accordance with the UK Home Office Code of Practice
for the Housing and Care of Animals Bred, Supplied or Used for Scientific Procedures (2014)
and National Committee for Refinement, Reduction and Replacement (NC3Rs) Guidelines on
Primate Accommodation, Care and Use, August 2006.
Vaccinations
Animals were injected intramuscularly (IM) in the bicep muscle of the upper arm with 0.5 µg or
8 µg of LNP-formulated SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs (CVnCoV), in a volume of 0.5 ml, on d0 and d28
of the study or left untreated as negative controls.
SARS-CoV-2 challenge infection
The challenge agent used in this study was SARS-CoV-2 virus, VERO/hSLAM cell passage 3

, titre 2.4 x 107 PFU/ml, passaged from material (P1) generously provided

to PHE by The Doherty Institute, Melbourne, Australia. All animals were challenged with a dose
of 5.0 x 106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 by applying 2 ml of virus preparation to the pre-carinal
section of the trachea using a bronchoscope followed by 1 ml applied intranasally (0.5
ml/nostril). Two animals of each group were followed for 6, 7 or 8 days post challenge (p.c.)
and euthanised on day 62, 63 or 63 of the experiment.
IgG ELISA
A full-length trimeric and stabilised version of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was supplied by
Lake Pharma (#46328). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding-Domain (319-541) MycHis was developed and kindly provided by MassBiologics. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spikeand RBD-specific IgG responses were determined by ELISA. High-binding 96-well plates

(Nunc Maxisorp, 442404) were coated with 50 µl per well of 2 µg/ml Spike trimer or RBD in 1x
PBS (Gibco) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The ELISA plates were washed and blocked with
5% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma, F9665) in 1x PBS/0.1% Tween 20 for 1 hour at room
temperature. Serum collected from animals after vaccination had a starting dilution of 1/50
followed by 8, two-fold serial dilutions. Post-challenge samples were inactivated in 0.5% triton
and had a starting dilution of 1/100 followed by 8, three-fold serial dilutions. Serial dilutions
were performed in 10% FBS in 1x PBS/0.1% Tween 20. After washing the plates, 50 µl/well of
each serum dilution was added to the antigen-coated plate in duplicate and incubated for 2
hours at room temperature. Following washing, anti-monkey IgG conjugated to HRP
(Invitrogen, PA1-84631) was diluted (1: 10,000) in 10% FBS in 1X PBS/0.1% Tween 20 and
100 µl/well was added to the plate. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.
After washing, 1 mg/ml O-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride solution (Sigma P9187) was
prepared and 100 µl per well were added. The development was stopped with 50 µl per well
1M Hydrochloric acid (Fisher Chemical, J/4320/15) and the absorbance at 490 nm was read
on a Molecular Devices versamax plate reader using Softmax (version 7.0) All test sample
dose response curves were fitted to a 4PL model in Softmax Pro (version 7.0) and the endpoint
titre at an OD of 0.5 (defined as reciprocal of the serum dilution required to give an absorbance
response of 0.5) was interpolated from each curve. Where results were below the limit of
detection, they were assigned a value of 25 for the post immunisation samples and 50 for the
post challenge samples. For low samples where the absorbance never reached a value of 0.5,
the titre was estimated from the extrapolated portion of the curve. The cut-off was set as the
average titre of serum collected from naïve animals (day 0) + 1 Standard Deviation. The cut

antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco, 15240-062) with serum doubling dilutions from 1:20 to 1:640 (or
higher dependent on antibody levels) in a 96-well V-bottomed plate. The plate was incubated
at 37°C in a humidified box for 1 hour to allow antibodies in the serum sample to bind to the
virus.

One hundred microlitres of the serum/virus mixture was then transferred to virus

susceptible Vero/E6 monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated for a further 1 hour at 37°C in
a sealed humidified box. After adsorption, the virus/antibody mixture was removed and 100 μl
of 1% w/v CMC in complete media overlay was added. The box was resealed and incubated
at 37°C for 24 hours prior to fixing with 100 μl of 20% formalin/PBS solution and fumigation of
the plate overnight prior to immunostaining.
Following washing with water using an ELISA washer (BioTek 405 TSUS), residual
endogenous peroxidase activity was removed by the addition of 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for
20 min. Plates were then incubated for 1 h with primary/detection SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD
rabbit polyclonal antibody (SinoBiologicals; 40592-T62) diluted 1: 2,000 in PBS. After washing,
plates were incubated for 1 h with secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugate antibody (Invitrogen;
G-21234) diluted 1: 4,000 in PBS. After washing, foci were visualised using TrueBlue™
Peroxidase Substrate (KPL seracare; 5510-0030) after which plates were washed with water
and dried. Foci were counted using an ImmunoSpot S6 Ultra-V analyser (CTL) and BioSpot
software (7.0.28.4 Professional; CTL) and the results analysed in SoftMax Pro (Molecular
Devices; v7.0.3 GxP). Briefly, the count data was expressed as percentage of VOC for each
serum dilution, i.e. percentage foci reduction and plotted on a 4-Parameter logistic (4PL) curve.
The virus neutralisation titre (VNT) is reported as serum dilution that neutralised 50% of the
virus foci.
ELISpot
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole heparinised blood by
density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare, USA). An IFN-
ELISpot assay was used to estimate the frequency and IFN- production capacity of SARSCoV-2-specific T cells in PBMCs using a human/simian IFN- kit (MabTech, Nacka, Sweden).

The cells were assayed at 2 x 105 cells per well. Cells were stimulated overnight with SARSCoV-2 peptide pools and ‘megapools’ of the spike protein (Mimotopes, Australia). Peptide
sequence was based on GenBank: MN908947.3. Ten peptide pools were used, compriseing
of 15 mer peptides, overlapping by 11 amino acids. The three megapools were made up as
such: Megapool 1 (MP1) comprised peptide pools 1-3, Megapool 2 (MP2) comprised peptide
pools 4-6 and Megapool 3 (MP3) comprised of peptide pools 7-10. All peptides were used at
a final concentration of 1.7 µg/ml per peptide. Phorbol 12-myristate (Sigma-Aldrich Dorset, UK)
(100 ng/ml) and ionomycin (CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) (1 mg/ml) were used as a
positive control. Results were calculated to report as spot forming units (SFU) per million cells.
All SARS-CoV-2 peptides and megapools were assayed in duplicate and media only wells
subtracted to give the antigen-specific SFU. ELISpot plates were analysed using the CTL
scanner and software (CTL, Germany) and further analysis carried out using GraphPad Prism
(version 8.0.1) (GraphPad Software, USA).
Bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL)
In-life BAL washes were performed using 10 ml PBS using a bronchioscope inserted to the
right side of the lung above the second bifurcation. BAL washes performed post-mortem were
conducted on the right lung lobes, after ligation of the left primary bronchus using 20 ml PBS.
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction
RNA was isolated from nasal swab, throat swabs, EDTA treated whole blood, BAL and tissue
samples (spleen, kidney, liver, colon, duodenum, tonsil, trachea and lung). Tissue samples in
RNAprotect (Qiagen), were homogenised in a Precellys 24 homogeniser with CK28 Hard
tissue homogenizing 2.0 ml tubes (Bertin) and 1 ml of RLT buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with
1%(v/v) Beta-mercaptoethanol. Tissue homogenate was passed through a QIAshredder
homogenizer (Qiagen) and a volume that equated to 17.5 mg of tissue was extracted using
the BioSprint™96 One-For-All vet kit (Qiagen) and Kingfisher Flex platform as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Non-tissue samples were inactivated by placing samples into AVL
buffer (Qiagen) and adding 100% ethanol. Extraction of these samples was performed using

the BioSprint™96 One-For-All vet kit (Qiagen) and Kingfisher Flex platform as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed using
TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Applied Biosystems™), 2019-nCoV CDC RUO
Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies) and QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems™). PCR amplicons were quantified against in vitro transcribed RNA N gene
fragment standard. Positive samples detected below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of
10 copies/µl were assigned the value of 5 copies/µl, undetected samples were assigned the
value of 2.3 copies/µl, equivalent to the assays LLOD. For nasal swab, throat swab, BAL and
blood samples extracted samples this equates to an LLOQ of 1.29 x 104 copies/ml and LLOD
of 2.96 x 103 copies/ml. For tissue samples this equates to an LLOQ of 5.71 x 104 copies/g
and LLOD of 1.31 x 104 copies/g.
Subgenomic RT-qPCR was performed on the QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System
using TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with forward primer,
probe and reverse primer at a final concentration of 250 nM, 125 nM and 500 nM respectively.

Histopathology
Tissue samples from left cranial and caudal lung lobes, trachea, larynx, mediastinal lymph
node, tonsil, heart, thymus, pancreas, spleen, liver, kidney, duodenum, colon, brain,
vaccinating site (skin including subcutis and underlying muscle) and draining lymph node (left
and right) were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedded into paraffin wax. 4 µm
thick sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Tissue slides were
scanned and examined independently by two veterinary pathologists blinded to the treatment
and group details.
For the lung, three sections from each left lung lobe were sampled from different locations:
proximal, medial and distal to the primary lobar bronchus. A scoring system

30

was used to

evaluate objectively the histopathological lesions observed in the lung tissue sections. The
scores for each histopathological parameter were calculated as the average of the scores
observed in the six lung tissue sections evaluated per animal.
Additionally, RNAscope in-situ hybridisation (ISH) technique was used to identify the SARSCoV-2 virus in both lung lobes. Briefly, tissues were pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10
mins (RT), target retrieval for 15 mins (98-101⁰C) and protease plus for 30 mins (40⁰C) (all
Advanced Cell Diagnostics). A V-nCoV2019-S probe (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) targeting
the S-protein gene was incubated on the tissues for 2 hours at 40⁰C. Amplification of the signal
was carried out following the RNAscope protocol (RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection Reagent –
Red) using the RNAscope 2.5 HD red kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Appropriate controls
were included in each ISH run. Digital image analysis was carried out with Nikon NIS-Ar
software in order to calculate the total area of the lung section positive for viral RNA.
Computed Tomography (CT) Radiology
CT scans were collected from sedated animals using a 16 slice Lightspeed CT scanner
(General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) in the prone and supine position. All axial

scans were performed at 120KVp, with Auto mA (ranging between 10 and 120) and were
acquired using a small scan field of view. Rotation speed was 0.8s. Images were displayed as
an 11cm field of view.
To facilitate full examination of the cardiac / pulmonary vasculature, lymph nodes and
extrapulmonary tissues post-challenge, Niopam 300 (Bracco, Milan, Italy), a non-ionic,
iodinated contrast medium, was administered intravenously (IV) at 2ml/kg body weight and
scans collected immediately after injection and ninety seconds from the mid-point of injection.
Scans were evaluated for the presence of COVID disease features: ground glass opacity
(GGO), consolidation, crazy paving, nodules, peri-lobular consolidation; distribution - upper,
middle, lower, central 2/3, peripheral, bronchocentric) and for pulmonary embolus. The extent
of lung involvement was estimated (<25%, 25-50%, 51-75%, 76-100%) and quantified using a
scoring system developed for COVID disease.
