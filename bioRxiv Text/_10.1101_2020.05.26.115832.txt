Abstract
Memory T cells induced by previous infections can influence the course of new
viral infections. Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific preexisting memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to
structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of
ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all
of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing
multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients
(n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T
cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARSCoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2
specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS,
COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18)
possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were
rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope
characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein
fragments with low homology to “common cold” human coronaviruses but
conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.
Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell
immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the
management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Main Text:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause
of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. This disease has spread
pandemically placing lives and economies of the world under severe stress.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical
syndromes, ranging from mild influenza-like symptoms to severe pneumonia
and acute respiratory distress syndrome2.
It is common to observe in human the ability of a single virus to cause different
pathological manifestations. This is often due to multiple contributory factors
including the quantity of viral inoculum, the genetic background of patients and
the presence of concomitant pathological conditions. Moreover, an established
adaptive immunity towards closely related or completely different viruses can
increase protection3 or enhance disease severity4.
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Coronaviridae, a family of large RNA viruses infecting
many animal species. Six other coronaviruses are known to infect human. Four
of them are endemically transmitted5 and cause common cold (OC43, HKU1,
229E and NL63), while SARS-CoV (defined from now as SARS-CoV-1) and
MERS-CoV have caused limited epidemics of severe pneumonia6. All of them
trigger antibody and T cell responses in infected patients: however, antibody
levels appear to wane relatively quicker than T cells. In SARS recovered
patients, SARS-CoV-specific antibodies dropped below detection limit within 2
to 3 years7, while SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells can be detected even at
11 years after infection8. Since the sequences of selected structural and nonstructural proteins are highly conserved among different coronaviruses (i.e.
NSP7 and NSP13 are 100% and 99% identical, respectively, between SARSCoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and the bat-SL-CoVZXC219), we studied whether crossreactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present in individuals who resolved
from SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also studied these T cells in
individuals with no history of SARS or COVID-19 and who were also not in
contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected cases. Collectively these individuals are
hereon referred to as SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed.
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have just started to be characterized in COVID19 patients10,11 and their potential protective role has been inferred from studies
in SARS12 and MERS13 patients. To study SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells

associated with viral clearance, we collected peripheral blood of 24 individuals
who recovered from mild to severe COVID-19 (demographic, clinical and
virological information are summarized in Extended Data Table 1) and studied
the T cell response against selected structural (nucleocapsid protein-NP) and
non-structural proteins (NSP7 and NSP13 of ORF1) of the large SARS-CoV-2
proteome (Figure 1A). We selected nucleocapsid protein as it is one of the
more abundant structural proteins produced and has large homology between
different betacoranaviruses (Extended Data Fig. 1)14.
NSP7 and NSP13 were selected for their complete homology between SARSCoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and other animal coronaviruses belonging to the
betacoranavirus genus (Extended Data Fig. 2)9, and because they are
representative of the ORF1a/b polyprotein encoding the replicase-transcriptase
complex15. This polyprotein is the first to be translated upon coronavirus
infection. We synthesized 216 15-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids
(aa) covering the whole length of NSP7 (83aa), NSP13 (601aa) and NP (422aa)
that were organized in 5 pools of approximately 40 peptides each (NP-1, NP-2,
NSP13-1, NSP13-2, NSP13-3) and in a single pool of 15 peptides spanning
NSP7 (Figure 1B). The unbiased method with overlapping peptides was
utilized instead of peptide selection by bioinformatic approaches, since the
performance of such algorithms in ethnically-diverse Asians is often suboptimal16.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 24 recovered COVID-19
patients were stimulated for 18h with the different peptide pools and virusspecific T cell responses were analyzed by IFN-γ ELISpot assay. In all tested
individuals (24/24) we detected IFN-γ spots following stimulation with the pools
of synthetic peptides covering NP (Figure 1C/D). In nearly all individuals NPspecific responses could be identified for multiple regions of the protein: 23/24
for region 1-205aa (NP-1) and 24/24 for 206-422aa (NP-2). In sharp contrast,
responses to NSP7 and NSP13 peptide pools were detected at low levels only
in 3 out of 24 COVID-19 convalescents tested. Direct ex vivo intracellular
cytokine staining (ICS) was performed to confirm and define the NP-specific
IFN-γ ELISpot response. Due to the low frequency, NP-specific T cells were
more difficult to visualize by ICS than by ELISpot, but a clear population of CD4
and/or CD8 T cells producing IFN-γ and/or TNF-α were detectable in 7 out of 9

tested subjects (Figure 1E). To confirm and further delineate the
multispecificity of the NP-specific T cell response detected ex vivo in COVID19 recovered patients, we defined in nine individuals, the distinctive sections of
NP targeted by T cells. We organized the 82 overlapping peptides covering the
entire NP into small peptide pools (7-8 peptides) that were used to stimulate
PBMC either directly ex vivo or after an in vitro expansion protocol previously
used in HBV17 or SARS recovered subjects18. A schematic representation of
the peptide pools is shown in Figure 2A. We found that 8 out of 9 COVID-19
recovered patients possess T cells that recognize multiple regions of NP of
SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2A). Importantly, we then defined single peptides that
were able to activate T cells in 7 patients. Utilizing a peptide matrix strategy18,
we first deconvolute individual peptides responsible for the detected T cell
response by IFN-γ ELISpot. Subsequently, we confirmed the identified single
peptide by testing, with ICS, its ability to activate CD4 or CD8 T cells (Figure
2B). Figure 2B summarizes the different T cell epitopes defined by both
ELISpot and ICS, in 7 COVID-19 recovered individuals. Remarkably, we
observed that COVID-19 convalescents developed T cells specific to regions
that were also targeted by T cells of SARS recovered subjects. For example,
the NP region 101-120 which is a described CD4 T cell epitope in SARS-CoV1 exposed individuals8,18, also stimulated CD4 T cells of two COVID-19
recovered donors. Similarly, the NP region 321-340 contains epitopes
triggering CD4 and CD8 T cells in both COVID-19 and SARS recovered
patients18. The demonstration that COVID-19 and SARS recovered patients
can mount T cell responses against shared viral determinants implicates that
individuals with SARS-CoV-1 infection can induce T cells able to cross-react
against SARS-CoV-2.
For the management of the current pandemic and for vaccine development
against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand if acquired immunity will be
long-lasting. Therefore, we tested if individuals who recovered from SARS 17
years ago still harbor memory T cells against SARS-CoV-1. Hence, their PBMC
(n=15) were stimulated directly ex vivo with peptide pools covering SARS-CoV1 NP (NP-1 and NP-2), NSP7 and NSP13 (Figure 3A). This revealed that 17
years after infection, those individuals still possess virus-specific memory T
cells, and similar to COVID-19 recovered patients, we detected T cells reacting

almost exclusively to NP and not to the NSPs (Figure 3B/C). Subsequently, we
tested if the NP-specific T cells detected in SARS recovered patients could
cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 NP peptides (aa identity = 94%). Indeed,
although at lower frequency, T cells in all 23 individuals tested reacted to SARSCoV-2 NP (Figure 3D, 4A). In order to test whether these T cells could expand
after encounter with SARS-CoV-2 NP, their PBMC were stimulated in vitro with
the whole battery of NP, NSP7 and NSP-13 peptides and the quantity of T cells
responding to SARS-CoV-2 NP, NSP7 and NSP13 was analyzed after 10 days
of cell culture. A clear and robust expansion of NP-specific T cells was detected
in 7 out of 8 individuals tested (Figure 3E). Importantly, and in sharp contrast
to the T cell response to NP peptides, we could not detect any T cells reacting
to the peptide pools covering NSP13 and only 1 out of 8 reacted to NSP7,
despite in vitro expansion.
Thus, SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific cross-reactive T cells are part of the T cell
repertoire of individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-1 infection and are able to
robustly expand after encounter with SARS-CoV-2 NP peptides. These findings
demonstrate that virus-specific memory T cells induced by betacoronanvirus
infection are long-lasting, which supports the notion that COVID-19 patients
would develop long-term T cell immunity. Furthermore, our findings also raise
the intriguing possibility that infection with related viruses can also protect from
or modify the pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To explore this possibility, we tested NP and NSP7/13-specific T cell responses
in 18 SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed donors. The blood samples were collected
either before July 2019 or were serologically negative for both SARS-CoV-2

Different

coronaviruses known to cause common cold in humans like OC43, HKU1,
NL63 and 229E present different degrees of amino acid homology with SARSCoV-2 (Extended Data Fig. 1, 2) and recent data demonstrated the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cells (mainly specific for Spike) in SARSCoV-2 unexposed donors11. Remarkably, we detected NP-specific T cells in
some of our SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed individuals. The pattern of T cell
reactivity, however, was different compared to COVID-19 and SARS recovered.
T cells from SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed were directed against a single peptide

pool: i.e. none of the 18 donors responded to the NP-2 peptide pool (Figure
4A). Moreover, a different pattern was observed for NSP7- and NSP13-specific
T cells. These cells were detected in only 3 out of 24 COVID-19 and in 2 out of
23 SARS recovered tested, but were present in 9 out of 18 unexposed donors
(Figure 4A/B). The cumulative proportion of all studied subjects responding to
NP and ORF-1-coded NSP7 and 13 proteins is shown in Figure 4B. These
SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells from SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed donors
have the capacity to expand upon stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides
(Figure 4C). To better characterize the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell reactivity
detected in the SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed individuals, fine-specificity and
phenotype of the responding T cells were defined in selected donors.
Characterization of the NP-specific T cells detected at high frequency in one
donor (H-2) identified CD4 T cells reactive for an epitope comprised within the
NP region 101-20. This same epitope was also detected in COVID-19 and
SARS-recovered patients (Figure 2B and8,18). It has a high degree of homology
to the MERS-CoV, OC43 and HKU1 NP sequences (Figure 4D). In two other
SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed donors (H-7 and H-3), we identified CD4 T cells
specific for the NSP7 region 26-40 (SKLWAQCVQLHNDIL), and CD8 T cells
specific

for

(NDILLAKDTTEAF), respectively (Figure 4D, Extended Data Figure 3).
These latter two T cell specificities were particularly intriguing since the
homology between the two protein regions of SARS-CoV-1/2 and other
“common cold” coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1 NL63 and 229E) was minimal
(Figure 4D), especially for the CD8 peptide epitope. This may suggest that
perhaps not only human “common cold” coronaviruses, but other presently
unknown coronaviruses, possibly of animal origin, can induce cross-reactive
SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells in the general population.
It was remarkable to find that NSP7/13-specific T cells were detected in 9 out
of 18 (50%) SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed donors, despite the fact that our
analysis was performed with peptides that cover only 10% (684aa) of the ORF1 proteome (7096aa). Notably, T cells specific for ORF-1-coded proteins were
rarely detected in our SARS and COVID-19 convalescents. This is consistent
with the findings of Grifoni et al11: using selected peptides, they detected ORF-

1 specific T preferentially in some SARS-CoV-2 unexposed donors while T cells
of COVID-19 recovered donors preferentially recognized structural proteins.
The cause of this observed different pattern of immunodominance is presently
unknown. We might speculate that a robust T cell response against structural
proteins is induced by a productive infection (occurring in COVID-19 and SARS
recovered patients). Individuals exposed to but not infected with possible
unknown coronaviruses might just prime ORF-1-specific T cells. Indeed,
induction of virus-specific T cells in “exposed but not infected” individuals has
been demonstrated in other viral infections20. In coronavirus infected cells, the
ORF-1 coded proteins are necessary for the formation of the viral replicasetranscriptase complex in which viral replication and transcription occur14.
Therefore, an ORF-1-specific T cell can be envisioned to abort viral production
in infected cells by lyses of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells even before the
formation of mature virions.
Importantly, the ORF-1 region contains domains that are extremely conserved
among many different coronaviruses6. The distribution of these viruses in
different animal species might result in periodic human contact and
subsequently induction of ORF-1-specific T cells with cross-reactive ability
against SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the distribution, frequency and protective
ability of the pre-existing structural or non-structural SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive T cells could be of great importance to explain some of the differences
in infection rate or pathology observed during this pandemic. T cells specific for
viral structural proteins have protective ability in animal models of airway
system infection21,22. Nevertheless, the impact that the presence of ORF-1
specific T cells could have in the differential modulation of SARS-CoV-2
infection will have to be carefully evaluated.

Material and Methods:
Ethics statement: All donors provided written consent. The study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the
NUS institutional review board (H-20-006) and the SingHealth Centralised
Institutional Review Board (reference CIRB/F/2018/2387).
Human samples: Donors were recruited based on their clinical history of
SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blood samples of recovered COVID19 patients (n=24) were obtained 2 – 28 days post PCR negativity; of recovered
SARS patients (n=23) 17 years post infection. Healthy donors’ samples were
either collected before June 2019 for studies of T cell function in viral diseases
(n=10) or in March-April 2020 and tested negative for RBD neutralizing
antibodies and negative in an ELISA for NP IgG19.
PBMC isolation: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by
density-gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque. Isolated PBMC were either
studied directly or cryopreserved and stored in liquid nitrogen until used in the
assays.
Peptide pools: 15-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids spanning the
entire protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 NP, NSP7 and NSP 13, as well as
SARS-CoV-1 NP were synthesized (GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd; see Sup.
Tables 1,2). To stimulate PBMC, the peptides we divided into 5 pools of about
40 peptides covering NP (NP-1, NP-2) and NSP13 (NSP13-1, NSP13-2,
NSP13-3) and one pool of 15 peptides covering NSP7. For single peptide
identification, peptides were organized in a matrix of 12 numeric and 7
alphabetic pools for NP, and 4 numeric and 4 alphabetic pools for NSP7.
ELISpot assay: ELISpot plates (Millipore) were coated with human IFN-γ
antibody (1-D1K, MabTech) overnight at 4ºC. 400,000 PBMC were seeded per
well and stimulated with pools of SARS-CoV-1/2 peptides (2 μg/ml). For
stimulation with peptide matrix pools or single peptides, a concentration of 5
μg/ml was used. Subsequently, the plates were developed with human
biotinylated IFN-γ detection antibody (7-B6-1, MabTech), followed by

incubation with Streptavidin-AP (MabTech) and KPL BCIP/NBT Phosphatase
Substrate (SeraCare).
Flow Cytometry: PBMC or Expanded T cell lines were stimulated for 5h at
37°C with or without SARS-CoV-1/2 peptide pools (2 μg/ml) in the presence of
10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were stained with the yellow
LIVE/DEAD fixable dead cell stain kit (Invitrogen) and anti-CD3 (clone SK7),
anti-CD4 (clone SK3), and anti-CD8 (clone SK1) antibodies. Cells were
subsequently fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD
Biosciences-Pharmingen) and stained with anti-IFN-γ (clone 25723, R&D
Systems) and anti-TNF-α (clone MAb11) antibodies and analyzed on a BD-LSR
II FACS Scan. Data were analyzed by FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.). Antibodies were
purchased from BD Biosciences-Pharmingen unless otherwise stated.
Cell culture for T cell expansion: T cell lines were generated as follows: 20%
of PBMCs were pulsed with 10 μg/ml of the overlapping SARS-CoV-2 peptides
for 1 hour at 37°C, subsequently washed, and cocultured with the remaining
cells in AIM-V medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2%
AB human serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific). T cell lines were cultured
for 10 days in the presence of 20 U/ml of recombinant IL-2 (R&D Systems).
Sequence alignment:
Reference protein sequences for ORF1ab and Nucleocapsid Protein were
downloaded from the NCBI database (see below). Sequences were aligned
using the MUSCLE algorithm with default parameters and percentage identity
was calculated in Geneious Prime 2020.1.2 (https://www.geneious.com).
Alignment figures were made in Snapgene 5.1 (GSL Biotech).

(A) SARS‐CoV‐2 proteome organization; analyzed proteins are marked by *. (B) For detection of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T cells by
IFN‐γ ELISpot, 15‐mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids covering nucleocapsid protein (NP) and the non‐structural proteins
(NSP) 7 and 13 were synthesized and split into 5 pools of about 40 peptides covering NP (NP‐1, NP‐2) and NSP13 (NSP13‐1,
NSP13‐2, NSP13‐3) and one pool of 15 peptides covering NSP7. (C) PBMC of 24 recovered COVID‐19 patients were stimulated
with the peptide pools. Bar graphs show frequency of spot forming units (SFU) of IFN‐γ secreting cells. (C) Composition of the
SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T cell repertoire is shown as percentage of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T cells reacting to NP (NP‐1 = light blue; NP2
= dark blue), NSP7 (orange) and NSP13 (grey) for the individual recovered COVID‐19 patients tested. (D) PBMC were stimulated
with the peptide pools covering NP (NP‐1, NP‐1) for 5h and analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining. Dot plots show examples
of patients with CD4 and/or CD8 T cells producing IFN‐γ and/or TNF‐α in response to stimulation with NP‐1 and/or NP2 peptides.
The graphs summarize the percentage of SARS‐CoV‐2 NP‐peptide‐reactive CD4 and CD8 T cells in 7 individuals.

Fig 2: SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T cells in convalescent COVID‐19 patients are targeting multiple regions of nucleocapsid protein
(A) PBMC of 9 COVID‐19 recovered individuals were stimulated with 12 different pools of 7‐8 NP‐peptides to delineate the region
to which their T cells react. The table shows IFN‐γ ELISpot response against the individual NP peptide pools. (B) Following in vitro
T cell expansion, a peptide pool matrix strategy was applied in 7 individuals. The distinct peptide epitopes to which the T cells
react were identified by IFN‐γ ELISpot and confirmed by ICS (representative dot‐plots are shown). Previously described T cell
epitopes for SARS‐CoV‐1 are highlighted in red; non‐conserved amino acid residues between SARS‐CoV‐1 and ‐2 are bold and
underlined.

Fig 3: SARS‐CoV‐2 cross‐reactive memory T cells are present in SARS‐recovered patients
(A) PBMC isolated from 15 individuals who recovered from SARS 17 years ago were stimulated with SARS‐CoV‐1 NP, NSP7 and
NSP13 peptide pools. (B) Bar graphs show spot forming units (SFU) of IFN‐γ secreting cells per 1 million PBMC following overnight
stimulation with the indicated peptide pools. (C) Composition of the SARS‐CoV‐1‐specific T cells in individual recovered SARS
patients. The percentage of SARS‐CoV‐1‐specific T cells against NP (NP‐1 = light green; NP2 = dark green), NSP7 (orange) and
NSP13 (grey) in each patient is shown. (D) PBMC of 15 SARS‐recovered individuals were stimulated in parallel with peptide pools
covering NP of SARS‐CoV‐1 and of SARS‐CoV‐2 and their frequency is shown. (E) PBMC of 8 SARS‐recovered individuals were
stimulated with all peptides covering SARS‐CoV‐2 NP, NSP7 and NSP13 to expand peptide cross‐reactive T cells. The graph shows
the number of T cells reactive to the peptide pools indicated directly ex‐vivo and after specific T cell expansion.

Fig 4: Differential protein immunodominance of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cells in COVID‐19‐ and SARS‐recovered patients and in
unexposed individuals
(A) PBMC of individuals who are SARS‐CoV‐1/2 unexposed (n=18), recovered from SARS (n=23) or COVID‐19 (n=24) were
stimulated with peptide pools covering SARS‐CoV‐2 NP (NP‐1, NP‐2), NSP7 and NSP13 (NSP13‐1, NSP13‐2, NSP13‐3) and analyzed
by ELISpot. Frequency of peptide‐reactive T cells is shown for each donor (dots) and the bars represent median frequency. (B) Pie
charts represent percentage of individuals with NP‐specific and NSP7/13‐specific T cells for unexposed, SARS‐ and COVID‐19‐
recovered individuals. (C) Frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 reactive T cells in 9 unexposed donors to the indicated peptide pools directly
ex vivo and after a 10‐day expansion. (D) A peptide pool matrix strategy was applied in 3 SARS‐CoV‐1/2 unexposed individuals.
The identified T cell epitopes were confirmed by ICS, and the sequences are aligned with the corresponding sequence of all
coronaviruses known to infect humans.
