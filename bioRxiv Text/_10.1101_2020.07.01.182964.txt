ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic took us ill-prepared and tackling the many challenges it poses in a
timely manner requires world-wide collaboration. Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and
its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes
indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing
antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS
coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to
expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their
native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D
(pronounced “I see in 3D”) 1​​ to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of
different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and
engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging “lifelong” web links
(URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of “sharing of molecular scenes” in a reliable
and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire
analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and
underlying data are FAIR 2​​ and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live
and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications,
eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials. This paper exemplifies
iCn3D capabilities in visualization, analysis, and sharing of COVID-19 related structures,
sequence variability, and molecular interactions.

INTRODUCTION
With the COVID-19 pandemic our ability to study the virus and virus-host interactions in-depth
and collaboratively has become extremely important. We already know key SARS-COV-2 viral
proteins at the molecular level and some of the molecular interactions that allow the virus spike
to bind its human host ACE2 receptor. Structural analyses have become de facto
mission-critical for the development of new (or repurposed) drugs, vaccines, or antibodies, and
making them instantaneously available worldwide is imperative. For that to occur we need to
lower the barrier of entry to study molecular structures for scientists that are not trained in that
field and enable the discovery process and sharing of analyses in a self-teaching environment.
Structure-based antigen design, computational biology, and protein engineering provide
methods to make vaccines with speed and precision 3​​ . This is a reason for hope in developing
a vaccine in a short time frame. Structure-based drug design, whether on small molecules or
monoclonal antibodies, provides a pathway to possible treatments. The global need for
vaccines and drugs and the wide geographic diversity of the pandemic require more than one
effective vaccine or drug design approach, and the full development pathway for an effective
vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 requires the collaboration of industry, government, and academia at
an unprecedented scale 4​​ . “Stopping the pandemic could rely on breakneck efforts to visualize

SARS-CoV-2 proteins and use them to design drugs and vaccines” 5​​ . Yet, ​the current tools
are limited in their ability to exchange information at the required level.​ iCn3D offers an
initial contribution in that direction, by making the sharing and collaboration on structure and
structure analysis possible, peer to peer, and through preprint and publication channels,
seamlessly.
With the COVID-19 pandemic, an avalanche of new experimental and modeled structures
became available in a very short time over the web, and the production of new structures is
accelerating. In one month the number of structures has almost doubled
(​https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure?term=SARS-COV-2​). It took only a few weeks after the
publication of the SARS-COV-2 virus genome sequence to get the first 3D structures of the
virus spike interacting with the human ACE2 receptor (see ​gallery​), and new experimental 3D
structures are produced at an unprecedented rate. Many are available as 3D coordinates in
repositories and their descriptions/annotations are spread in a myriad of papers or preprints on
the Internet. These structures are the basis of a very large number of structural analyses,
modeling efforts, and structure-based design projects all over the planet: on vaccines, on
broadly neutralizing antibodies, and on drug lead explorations.
Yet, structural information is still exchanged in the year 2020, for the most part, as it was
decades years ago. Structures are still shared as arcane sets of 3D coordinates and are
interpreted by sophisticated, often proprietary software applications, some outdated or not
properly maintained. To this date, structural annotations are still lengthy textual descriptions
and represented as 2D pictures in papers, and sometimes through supplemental videos. While
structural biologists and molecular modelers, armed with extensive knowledge in molecular
structure and long experience in using complex proprietary software to process data, may be
comfortable with the status quo, structural analyses remain opaque to a broad range of
scientists. To make matters worse, and especially in the case of COVID-19, structural
annotations are dispersed in hundreds of papers, supplements, preprints, and now archives.
By contrast, it only takes a second to share a structural annotation worldwide through 3D web
links 1​​ , exactly as one would share a Google map or a Google Doc. For example, a simple link
can focus on ​the SARS-COV-2 Receptor Binding domain interacting with the ACE2 receptor
(Link 1), or allow one to visualize and analyze epitopes used by neutralizing ​antibodies against
SARS-COV-1 vs. SARS-COV-2​ (Link 2), or analyze where ​mutations may occur across
coronaviruses​ (Link 3) ​in a structural context.​
The unprecedented volume of new structures and new sequencing data shared through the
Internet as data sets, preprints and publications exacerbates the need to perform structural
analyses quickly and share these results with collaborators and through online publications. The
role of 3D in this fast moving field is critical because it is the one form of annotation that can
effectively organize and coordinate the others. In other words, we can correct a faulty 1D
alignment or improve the interpretation of a sequence pattern if the 3D (structure) information
can be adequately harnessed. iCn3D has been designed for that purpose ​and​ it can help foster

collaborative research over the World Wide Web. It does not replace any modeling or expert
tool. It emerges from a new paradigm that emphasizes visualization, analysis, and sharing of
sequence-structure information over the web.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The simplest way to look at iCn3D, beyond simply visualizing 3D structures of molecular
structures, is to see it as a tool to investigate the structure of molecular assemblies
interactively and cooperatively​. iCn3D, literally, allows the interaction with molecular objects:
highlighting, delineating and extracting elementary structural properties at any level of detail
(atom, residue, domain, chain, or any arbitrary set of residues or atoms) to reveal the structural
underpinning of a given molecular structure and constituent molecular interactions. These are
all very simple and very well known descriptive elements (in a classical context): covalent
bonds, Hydrogen-bonds, non-bonded interactions (Van der Waals). The strength of the
program is its ability to analytically address any set of such elements in isolation, collectively
and in interaction.
In order to convey the power of interactive structural analysis, we investigate a molecular
system of current interest: the SARS-COV spike proteins, and their interactions with the human
ACE2 receptor in their initial (pre-fusion) binding stage, and highlight the analytical methods
employed.
This exploration is reported as an investigation, not a tutorial, yet at every step the reader will be
offered a 3D link that encapsulates a reproducible analysis within the context of the analytical
software itself, to make the experience a ​self-teaching​ one. Through these links, the reader
will be offered a graphical description of the analysis performed, the tool to reproduce that
analysis, and very importantly the ability to go beyond in extending a proposed analysis, making
new observations, new connections, new inferences. The power of these links is in sharing and
disseminating analyses with peers to open collaborative research. Currently, these links have
been used mostly in education, where professors can teach their students about molecules and
molecular interactions, concentrating on chemistry or physics of interactions, not on how to use
the software. This is mostly a descriptive (passive) use. The link is live and an invitation to
active, interactive use of molecular objects. Exchanging links between scientists is in essence a
mechanism for collaborative, iterative, and discursive analysis.
These URLs are “lifelong” and can be accessed from a preprint or a publication. We started to
publish 3D analyses as links 1,6​
​ . This paper further demonstrates its use with links that annotate
structures and molecular interactions between SARS-COV-2 and the human ACE2 receptor, or
with antibodies. Each iCn3D link can be reused, modified, extended, saved, and reshared,
making a paper not an end but potentially a new beginning.
All SARS-COV-2 structures used in this study were deposited by their authors in the PDB
database. They are accessible as initial iCn3D links on the ​NCBI Structure website​. In addition,

unpublished structures can be loaded in a PDB or MMCIF format 7​​ , and exchanged as an
“iCn3D PNG image” file including data and annotations; they can also be shared through a web
server privately on an intranet or publicly through the Internet. We have just released iCn3D
version 2.17.5 to help analyze, annotate, and share sequences & structures. The software is
open-source and available from ​GitHub​ as an invitation to software developers to join in.
In the following sections, we will exemplify iCn3D’s 3 main functions:
1. Molecular Visualization.
2. Interactive Structural Analysis.
3. Sharing, Collaborating, Publishing.
As mentioned before, this will be reported as an investigation on SARS-CoV/ACE2 interaction
analysis, not a software description or a tutorial, in order to make the experience a
self-teaching​ one.
A brief summary of the analysis developed in the Methods section​: We start by observing
the architecture of the spike trimer vs. the ACE2 receptor, focusing on the Receptor Binding
Domain (RBD)-ACE2 interaction and get deeper and deeper in the analysis of the details of
molecular interactions through a set of annotated links that can be manipulated by the reader.
Simultaneous visualization of the Spike chain sequences (1D), domain organization, and 3D
structure allow zooming on regions of interest. We can observe a spike trimer exhibiting
different conformations of its three RBDs. Beyond, since experimental structures usually focus
on a limited number of domains, chains, or assemblies, one can use them to build larger
composite assemblies through partial overlaps (domain level structural alignment). In doing so,
we can visualize for example an ACE2 [quasi] intact dimer with one or two spikes binding one or
two of the ACE2 peptidase domains.
We then drill down, looking at the binding interface between SARS-COV-2 Spike’s RBD and the
ACE2 receptor in terms of residue interactions. We compare CoV-1 vs. CoV-2 RBDs in binding
ACE2 (differential binding analysis). We then look at sequence variants across beta
Coronaviruses RBDs, including MERS, analyzing conservation in the Spike RBD, comparing
animal and human sequences. Since iCn3D accesses seamlessly dbSNP, we map human
ACE2 SNPs to see how polymorphism may act on structure, especially at the viral interface.
Neutralizing antibodies are an important focus in COVID-19 research and some structures are
available, we look at some that bind RBD epitopes and how these compare with the ACE2
binding RBD surfaces. Glycans on the virus surface or within the ACE2 receptor are naturally
highly studied and will be observed.
3D links are used along the way.​ Not only do links present the results of analyses, and share
the data and annotations with readers, they offer a starting point for challenging analyses and
performing a further investigation. This is the 3rd function of iCn3D: providing a capability to
share structural analysis and annotations with collaborators and peers and use them in

publications. These links are in fact already used today by a number of professors in teaching
about protein structure and molecular interactions, and we envision them as being used for peer
review and publication, as we have started to do ourselves in our latest preprints and papers 1,6​
​ .

METHODS
1. Molecular Visualization
An initial goal in developing iCn3D was to visualize biological molecules' structures to help
unveil the structural basis of biological function. In molecular terms, it meant the ability to study
interacting biological molecules with the appropriate molecular representations. To help guide
this development, we defined "Twelve Elements of visualization and analysis for the tertiary and
quaternary structure of biological molecules" 8​​ , that are now well underway in their
implementation. We will review here the most relevant elements.
3D data retrieval
Currently, the retrieval of protein 3D coordinates is essentially the same as it has ever been
since the inception of the protein data bank (​www.pdb.org​) in Brookhaven National Labs, almost
fifty years ago ​9​. The use of a “PDB id” and the maintenance of the PDB data repository since
1971 has been a wonderful means of data sharing. This is also the starting point for any
structural analysis with any public or commercial software, such as Chimera, etc. 3D
coordinates stored in a PDB file (whether old or newer style) are the basic data. With the
introduction of iCn3D, one can start directly from a link that gives access to a 3D visual
representation associated with a 1D sequence window and a 2D schematic representation.
These are available for any PDB structure from the NCBI Structure web site
(​www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure​) with a good number of annotations that are generated
automatically such as conserved protein domains, intermolecular interactions, dbSNP or ClinVar
annotations, secondary structures, or functional sites.
One can also visualize any structure from a user-defined coordinate file in a PDB (or MMCIF)
format. Users can create their own repository for use on an intranet or on the Internet (see an
example at the Frederick National Lab who is serving ​verified COVID-19 related structures
correcting issues that may be found in recently deposited SARS-COV-2 structures).
“Set Selection” and synchronized 1D/2D/3D visualization
iCn3D has the ability to name any molecular entity at any level of detail (chain, domain,
supersecondary structure, residue, atom). This gives great flexibility for analysis, especially in
studying molecular interactions. Practically, the analytical power of iCn3D relies on its ability to
select sets of molecular entities at any level of detail and to name them. It allows us to study

and compare sets across homologous (or non-homologous) families and very important to study
their interactions, as will become clear in the following. Sets open the door to virtually unlimited
flexibility since they can be combined through Boolean operations. That flexibility and breadth
of analysis will grow even more as we introduce more and more molecular properties, while
each property alone or in combination can enable set selection (This is a key design Element #3
- ​8​)
We have implemented a parallel, synchronized visualization of 1D sequence and 3D structure
visualization. This is of tremendous use to follow sequences in their (3D-folded) operational
environment. We have added 2D, which allows simple schematic representations and
projections. This is, surprisingly, an untapped realm of visualization, and we are just scratching
the surface at the moment. 2D is particularly useful to simplify and illustrate molecular
interactions. 2D illustrations are well suited for paper publications. Meanwhile, the 3D is only
perceivable through 3D visualization, and snapshots of a 3D screen used in papers to this date
usually do not convey the depth of information they are meant to represent. To achieve this we
use 3D links, which by the same token allow simultaneous use and visualization in 1D 2D 3D.
In addition, data can be represented as Tables that list residues/atoms properties, such as
solvent accessibility, contacts/pairwise interactions. The latter can be projected on 3D
structures, or exported for external analysis. Conversely, externally computed data can be
imported for visualization and analysis within iCn3D.
iCn3D triple focus: Visualization, Structural Analysis, Sharing.
It is important to understand what iCn3D does and does not do. It was designed to enable
visualization and analysis of structures and molecular interactions at any level of detail in a
straightforward manner, as we shall illustrate in the following. Very importantly it is designed to
share molecular scenes and entire structural analyses in 1D, 2D, 3D, and Tables (containing
numerical data) to enable interactive collaborative research and data sharing. The simple use
of links allows both passive visualization and/or active analysis. These links can be shared
through emails, papers, preprints, courses, etc. i.e. in any live document. The software is
centered on structural visualization, analysis, and sharing. It does not perform modeling or
complex computational biology simulations. It can however import and analyze structures
determined experimentally or computationally, and molecular properties that may be produced
through computational biology.
A word on Reference numbering
This section can be skipped until the reader comes across with difficulties in dealing with
residue numbers. ​Residue numbering​ may seem a mundane topic, yet it is a major
unresolved issue that could be resolved in any given context, and that would save countless
hours of tedious work (and tedious reading!) to scientists analyzing sequences and structures.
In fact, this problem could be discussed at length, and an entire symposium may not suffice to
cover all the issues. ​There is no reference numbering used on any protein​, except to some
extent on antibodies with the simple and brilliant idea of Kabat 10​
​ to number residues in order to

compare positions, presented over 30 years ago. Naturally, with hypervariable regions and
insertions, numbers may need extensions such as 100A, B, etc. , as it happened in antibody
CDR3 loop regions, but that numbering has endured, and some international organizations
maintain databases with a reference numbering on antibodies 11​
​ . Using a reference numbering
can be tricky in widely variable systems before these systems are known well enough of course,
but a reference is better than none. The field of genomics has this incredible advantage of
using Reference Genomes with a genome reference numbering, at least on an organism basis.
One can think of what would be the impossible task of genome assembly without a reference
numbering to relate to!
In dealing with proteins, the community should adopt a reference numbering at least for widely
studied problems such as SARS Coronaviruses proteins and receptors, certainly spikes and
certainly for RBDs as we will need to compare many species receptors and many viral strains.
Already too many preprints on SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are using different numbers for
the same residue, for example as we shall see Y453 <> Y440, and we add some more
numbering gymnastics in using relative numbers for each Y135<>Y114. This is a problem we
can solve on our end, yet ultimately it is a community issue to adopt a single reference
numbering. For the ACE2 receptors, we are lucky as ACE2 is a highly conserved protein with
an (almost) constant number of 805 residues across all species, yet in the literature, as for any
protein, numbers differ when one considers the signal peptide or not, and even when one
considers the starting Methionine or not in numbering. The solution would be to use numbers
according to REFSEQ 12​
​ or UNIPROT ​13​ protein sequences. Structural Biologists have often
used numbers that match these, but of course, many structures in the PDB predate all these
sequence databases.
iCn3D’s primary source is MMDB 14​
​ that uses an internal numbering starting at 1 for the first
residue read in and then numbered consecutively. For example in iCn3D ACE2 numbers will
start at position 1, which is position 19 in reference sequence in UNIPROT ​Q9BYF1​, same
transcript as REFSEQ N
​ P_068576.1​. In the general case, things may be more complex. For
example, REFSEQ has two transcripts one shorter one longer associated with the ​ACE2 gene​.
For a general reference numbering solution in proteins, the problem can become quite complex
with alternative splicing and multiple transcripts associated with a gene. Historically the problem
of numbering in sequence analysis has not been seen as a forefront issue since sequence
mappings have been used, not numbers. Yet when analyzing sequences and structures and
interactions that can change in sequence but maintain geometric relationships, a number base
is unavoidable, and it can be made much simpler and reliable with a reference numbering
across all protein sequence occurrences from many organisms.
iCn3D keeps track of the original PDB numbering that is available in the “sequence and
annotations window”. If the data is loaded directly from the native PDB structure file, then native
PDB numbers are used. All these numbering issues are historical. Anyone who has used PDB
structures knows far too many issues in numbering, with missing residues, insertions, deletions,
etc. Yet going forward, for important collaborative projects such as those rapidly emerging due

to the fast paced efforts triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the community should adopt a
reference sequence numbering to be used across all species and all strains. We do not solve
the problem in this version of the program but we will have to solve it. So our apologies if we
use multiple numbers to refer to a single position across structures of SARS-CoV-1,
SARS-CoV-2, and MERS … from different strains or for infected species. This is not a limitation
of iCn3D but what happens and will happen in virtually any published paper until a reference
numbering system is adopted.

2. Structural Analysis
Visualization of the SARS-COV-2 protein spike
Protein domains delineation, visualization, and coloring
The Virus Spike structure has been determined by Electron Microscopy (EM) (​15​,​16​). A first
inspection consists of delineating and visualizing the various domains that compose the spike.
In Figure 1.A, we can visualize the spike trimer where one monomer is shown as ribbons with
individual domains colored, in particular, the Receptor Binding domain in Cyan, and the
N-terminal domain (NTD) in dark blue. Since we need to study the spike interaction with its
receptor, we can bring this spike in its larger structural context, combining various structures
determined experimentally, look at the spike trimer in context.
Building and visualization Biological Assemblies: Spike(s) vs. intact ACE2 dimer?
Structural Biology (XRAY, NMR, EM …) provides structures of domains or chains in isolation
and in interaction. Rarely does it offer a full complex, and one may need to combine/assemble
a full complex for further analysis. Such an assembly process from parts is commonly used in
assembling EM structures while fitting an electron density map. Similarly, when studying a
problem one may need to bring together various protein domains in interaction, while these may
be spread in multiple “structure files”, each described independently in a paper, and aggregate
the parts to get a broader picture.
The SARS-COV-2 spike binding to the human ACE2 receptor through its RBD provides a viral
entry point for the COVID-19 infection in humans. A structure of the (quasi) intact ACE2 dimer
with the RBD binding has been solved independently 17​
​ and we can recompose the assembly
for the ACE2-spike trimer binding to the intact ACE2. The composite assembly on one spike vs.
one ACE2 monomer receptor is assembled by superposing the RBD that is common to both
experimental structures. This is made easy through the use of the VAST+ database, that aligns
tertiary and quaternary structures from the PDB 1418​
​ , accessible through iCn3D. In Figure 1.B,
we can visualize one spike interacting through one RBD (in Cyan) in the up position with one
ACE2 peptidase domain (in Red). What transpires from this buildup is that, sterically, an ACE
dimer can accommodate the binding by two spikes, one can build a dimeric assembly by simply
repeating that same buildup on the second RBD binding the second ACE2 peptidase domain
(we did hide in Figure 1B that second RBD which is present in the original structure).

The architecture of the coronaviruses’ RBD: the RBD framework and the RBM plugin
There are four types of common Coronaviruses that infect humans: 229E (alpha coronavirus),
NL63 (alpha coronavirus), OC43 (beta coronavirus), HKU1 (beta coronavirus), and three new
beta coronaviruses that appeared recently, originating from animals: MERS-COV, SARS-CoV-1,
and SARS-CoV-2, the latter being the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic

Table 1 - Known Structures of 7 known coronaviruses RBDs. ​Beta coronaviruses share the
same RBD framework (Figures 2 A, B and 3A), and vary the RBM plugin (see Figure 2 A, B, and
3B) (see text). Figure 3A, B shows sequence variability for MERS and SARS beta
coronaviruses. OC43 and HKU1 share the same RBD framework, their RBMs (not shown) have
larger and more complex insertions (see Supplement Figure).
Beta coronaviruses RBDs share the same beta fold framework and vary the RBM subdomain to
bind a variety of receptors. Currently, known receptors are peptidases: SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 also bind ACE2. MERS-CoV binds DPP4, with a slightly different RBM.
HCoV-229E an alpha coronavirus with yet another, larger RBM binds aminopeptidase N, while
receptors for HCoV-OC43 and HKUI, two beta coronaviruses are still unknown. Alpha
coronaviruses use a totally different, simpler, RBD with a beta-barrel fold. Intriguingly, NL63
different beta also binds ACE2.

If we look at the RBDs of alpha and beta coronaviruses for which we have structures (see Table
S1), they all share a common architecture composed of an all beta-sheet ​framework​ that
supports what we would describe as a ​beta plugin​ RBM (Receptor Binding motif), where the N
and C termini of the RBM plug into a beta-hairpin of the framework that would otherwise be a
turn/loop. Many protein folds have robust frameworks that accommodate entire domains as
plugins. This is in fact a common modular architecture, that is not stressed enough. In
principle, any domain with N/C termini joining in close proximity can be plugged-in another
domain framework if its folding is robust enough. Incidentally and interestingly, a similar overall
RBD architecture is observed for example in other viruses such as the Murine or Feline
Leukemia Viruses (pfam00429 TLV_coat ENV polyprotein), albeit with totally different
framework or plugin folds. Such a plugin architecture seems to be a brilliant evolutionary
technique for viruses to evolve binding motifs that can adapt to different cell surface receptors
while maintaining a framework that conserves a needed conformational articulation of the RBD
vs. the other spike domains. From a structural alignment of alpha and beta coronaviruses, we
seek to determine which residues may be conserved in both sequences and in structure in the
RBDs (see Figure 1).
Comparing SARS-CoV-1 vs. CoV-2 RBDs in binding ACE2 in iCn3D
A simple interface analysis of a complex network of interactions
A protein-protein interface is a very complex web of electronic interactions between residues.
XRay structure coordinates provide average positions of atoms that we idealize as points in
Euclidean space. This gives us a rather simple representation of points (atoms or residues) and
lines (bonds and nonbonded interactions) and we can use Euclidean distances between
residues (Carbon-alphas) and/or specific atoms in residues at the interface to describe the
interactions between two proteins, in our case between the Spike RBD and its human ACE2
receptor. Most interface descriptions use a cutoff distance of 4A to identify “key interactions”.
iCn3D can identify a number of interaction types with variable cutoffs. In the example below
(Figure 2), we compare a structure of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB 6M0J) with SARS-CoV-1 (PDB 2AJF)
and delineate the corresponding networks of interactions. It is amazing how mutations between
the two viruses rewire the interface, yet ​maintain both the tertiary structure and the overall
complex quaternary structure within 0.70A​ (considering CA only in the alignment over 758
residues with 94% sequence identity overall). This quaternary interface is maintained even with
the evolution of residues in the RBD vs. the constant human ACE2 sequence, showing that
many variants can bind the same ACE2 RBS. It shows that a dynamic adaptation, rewiring of
interactions to the ACE2 sequence-structure. The devil is in the details and one can compare
the rewiring of interactions that show an exquisite variety of local variations.
One can characterize and compare SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD interfaces by
superimposing the two complexes (quaternary structures) ​6M0J vs. 2AJF​ (Link 7) or
alternatively ​6M0J vs. 3SCI​ (Link 8), and visualize the differences in both sequence and
structure simultaneously (see Figure 2). A Superimposed view or a ​side by side comparison of
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs​ (Link 9) shows remarkable overall conservation of the

Comparing networks of interacting residues in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 ​vs.​ ACE2
We can analyze in parallel the two ​SARS-CoV-1 - ACE2 vs. the SARS-Cov-2 - ACE2​ (Link 10)
interfaces and delineate the interactions, conserved in position and sequence, or position
despite sequence differences that create subtle changes in “wiring” difficult to perceive without a
detailed analysis, especially some new interactions in SARS-CoV-2 vs. SARS-CoV-1. Figure 2
shows an interaction network representation for each. The 3D links give access to all details of
the interactions simultaneously in 3D, 2D, 1D, and Tables, allowing zooming in any residue pair
interaction, categorized as H-bonds, Salt Bridges between charged residues, Cation-Pi, and
Pi-Pi interactions between aromatic rings. Since XRay or EM structures present irregularities, it
is always prudent to consider all contacts, beyond well-identified hydrogen bonds or salt bridges
for example. It is especially true of highly polar interfaces such as the SARS-CoV RBDs vs.
ACE2.

are computed with various thresholds that can be modified.

Using a 4A distance cutoff overall, the ACE2 - SARS-CoV-2 interface (PDB 6M0J) is formed by
two ​complementary surfaces​ (Link 11), composed of mostly polar residues with 18 residues on
the RBD (only one Arginine outside of the RBM) containing ​6 aromatic ​residues, 3 non-polar 2
Aromatic, 3Gly, 2 charged 1+/1- aromatic and polar vs. 20 residues on ACE2 with 3 non-polar, 1
Gly, 9 charged 4+/5- and ​3 aromatic. ​The interface with SARS-CoV-1 is compared in Figure 2.
It also involves 20 residues on ACE2 with 16/20 being the same, but not necessarily the same
interactions. A surprising number of aromatics are involved in conserved interactions (see
later), specially conserved aromatics in SARS-CoV-1 vs SARS-CoV-2 RBMs (and RBDs
overall). The ​ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 interface (PDB 6M0J)​ (Link 12) is composed of 12 H-bonds
(green), 2 Salt Bridges (cyan) for a total of 36 non bonded contacts (black) with a cutoff distance
of 4A, most of them polar (H-bonds calling is using both distance and angles criteria). The
ACE2-SARS-CoV-1 interface (PDB 2AJF)​ (Link 13) is composed of 4HB, 1SB, 1CP, 1PP for a
total of 34 nonbonded interactions
The ACE2-SARS-CoV-1 interface shows significant differences in the non bonded interactions
“wiring” that can be schematically visualized in Figure 2. One should bear in mind that using a
different experimental structure minute details may vary these numbers and that it is indeed
important to analyze interfaces from alternate structures. For example, using PDB 6LZG ​the
SARS-CoV-2 the interface is composed of 7HBs, 2SBs but also 2 cation-Pi interactions for a
total of 40 non bonded interactions​ (Link 14). Using PDB 3SCI ​the SARS-CoV-1 interface is
composed of 5 HBs, 2SBs, 1 CP, 1 PP interactions for a total of 35 nonbonded interactions
(Link 15). Overall the interfaces contain between 34 and 40 non bonded mostly polar
interactions. The devil is in the details however on how to call key interactions. We have more
work to do in that respect. Overall these variations from identical protein structures solved
independently show that interfaces are highly complex and require a great deal of attention to
detail, one structure may identify a key interaction while one may miss it in using rigid distance
criterion. Ideally, simulations should be performed to better understand molecular interactions
and differences in the ACE2 binding interface with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.

human ACE2 (Figure 4) in the following, but before we do so, ​let’s look at at the
sequence-structure conservation at a broader scale across beta coronaviruses to put
this TYR453-HIS34 axis in an evolutionary context.
Sequence and Structure conservation of beta coronaviruses RBD
Structures of known coronaviruses infecting humans, alpha and beta, are available (Table 1),
alone or in interaction with their human cell surface receptors, and a comparative structural
analysis gives an understanding of their structural and conformational architecture and
evolution. MERS and SARS beta-coronaviruses genomes are available across species and can
be analyzed in a structural context. Finally, a growing number of SARS-COV-2 viral genomes
are being sequenced during the COVID-19 pandemic (​https://www.gisaid.org/​), and bringing
sequence and possibly clinical information in a structural context may help foster a rational
design approach of vaccines or of drugs.
We look at a multiple structure alignment performed with the Cn3D 30​
​ program, iCn3D
predecessor, that allows highly accurate interactive alignment of protein structures, that
automatic alignments cannot perform to that same level. RBD domains from SARS-CoV-1,
SARS-CoV-2, and other beta coronaviruses from MERS were used to identify structural
conservation patterns. As we observed in the architectural analysis, the RBD framework is
highly conserved, and one can see in Figure 3a (blue background) a highly conserved
framework with significant sequence conservation of key residues controlling its folding (with
remarkably no sequence insertion). The RBM plug-in, responsible for binding to the receptor,
however, shows extremely low sequence conservation, which shows its ability to adapt to
different receptor targets.

structural superimposition of the central 2-strands aligns within 0.3A RMS between SARS-CoV-1/2. It aligns within
0.6A between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS (using Carbon Alphas). When ​Comparing MERS to SARS RBM (Link 18) the

One can observe a ​significant structural variability in the RBM between MERS and SARS

of structure resilience of the RBM of beta coronaviruses, beyond SARS strains, and there is one

If we look at the alignment, it appears that the RBM subdomain (residues 117-191/435-509 in

can be seen as an elongated domain sitting on top of the RBD framework. The idiosyncratic
supersecondary structure is an irregular antiparallel 2 stranded 5 residue long beta-sheet with a first
strand containing a conserved sequence motif ​Y​x​Y​R​x​ ​(​strand1​)​ ​H-bonded to a second strand ​PL​Q/N​x​Y
(​strand2​) in antiparallel. The central TYR135/453 sits on top of a conserved central folding pattern

with the YxY sequence motif is conserved in MERS​ (Link 22) (see Figure 3), but has evolved two extra
strands beyond that motif to bind DPP4 instead of ACE2. What is even more surprising is that
conservation extends to OC43, HKU1, and MHH beta coronaviruses (see Figure S1), with larger RBM
insertions. This conserved RBM supersecondary structure (SSS) is central and so well conserved
structurally in itself and in its anchoring on the RBD framework that one can align entire RBDs simply by
superimposing that central RBM SSS. The structural superimposition of the central 2-strands aligns
within 0.3A RMS between SARS-CoV-½, it aligns within 0.6A between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS, and 0.9A

structural pattern of the flanking loop is not uncommon in proteins; it has been described as a “GD box”

single-stranded left-handed beta helices, to which this flanking substructure bears some resemblance.

in this paper to perform a review. For the sake of illustration, we compare interactions between
various viral strains for which we have a structure (first 3 in Figure 4A), If we follow the central

Comparative binding in the RBD-ACE2 interface between Civet and Human viruses
Palm civet was thought to be the animal origin of SARS-CoV-1, and it was believed that ​the

major species barriers between humans and civets for SARS infections are the specific
interactions between a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) its host receptor,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ​33​. The structure of a chimeric human-civet
ACE2 receptor with the critical N-terminal helix from civet shows a conserved interface
28,32​

. If we compare the ACE2-RBD interfaces of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 but also the
ACE2 chimera vs. the civet’s RBD ​(6M0J vs. 3D0I), again the central RBM-ACE2 interface is
conserved overall​ (Link 24), we can notice a number of subtle changes vs. the RBD structures
of SARS-CoV-1 SARS-CoV-2, especially with the RBM central region interface to ACE2
N-terminal helix we have been outlining (Figure 3-4). In fact, ​it has been shown that “a major
species barrier between humans and civets for SARS-CoV-1 infections is the adaptation of
residue 479 on RBD”. It corresponds to Q175/493 in SARS-CoV-2, (PDB: 6M0J) vs.
N157/479 in SARS-CoV-1 (2AJF) interacting with residues K31 and E35 in hACE2
(K13/E17), corresponding to T31 and E35 in cACE2 (T13/E17).

While Y135/453 in strand 1 of the central SSS binds ACE2 H16/34, in SARS-CoV-2 the residue in vis a vis in strand 2
Q175/493 binds simultaneously K31 and E37 through a hydrogen bond (see Figure 2). while in SARS-CoV-1 where
Q>N at that position (N479), the shorter side chain does not reach as far out to contact K31-E37 that form an internal
salt bridge within ACE2. The comparison is made easy using the alternate command in the iCn3D link one can see
(“a” letter on keyboard) to alternate between the 2 homologs superimposed.
C-D)​ ​Comparison of the Civet-CoV/cACE2 (chimera N-terminus) vs. SARS-CoV-2/hACE2​ (Link 26). The Civet’s
strain (cGd05 - PDB 3D0I) harbors an Arginine residue R479 at the position occupied by an Asparagine residue in
SARS-CoV-1. In binding to Civet’s ACE2 where threonine is at position T31 (while HIS16/34 is mutated to a TYR
Y34) a salt bridge is formed between R479 and ACE2 E37. In human ACE2, where position 31 is a Lysine K31, it
has been shown that a single N479K or N479R mutation on human viral RBD decreases the protein's affinity for
hACE2 by over 30-fold 32​
​ , which is understandable for a complex with two positively charged residues. iCn3D does
not perform simulations, but visualization and structural analysis give ideas on what computational properties may be
explored through simulation programs. For example, in this case, having identified the pattern, we assessed the
difference in binding by computing the relative binding free energy using a free energy perturbation (FEP) simulation
scheme, obtaining a ΔΔG = 6.3 (N479K) and 9.1 (N449R) Kcal/mol respectively. In SARS-CoV-2 however, the
mutation is N479Q wrt SARS-CoV-1 on the contrary strengthens the binding. The FEP analysis for this mutation
results in a favorable ΔΔG = -3.0 Kcal/mol (see Supplementary information for details)

Mapping human ACE2 polymorphism on structure
We have analyzed the interface between the virus RBD and ACE2. We have looked at
mutations in the RBD between different viruses SARS-COV2 vs SARS-COV1 vs. MERS. Yet
the ACE2 also varies from patient to patient. Since mutations at the ACE2 interface are
important to modulate binding, the question one may ask is what would be the impact of human
ACE2 polymorphism in binding to SARS-CoV-2 and the possible variations in pathogenicity
leading to COVID-19. iCn3D accesses the human SNP database seamlessly, and one can look
at ACE2 polymorphisms in a structural context. In Figure 5, we can visualize the interacting
residue network with SNP positions marked (in green) that can affect the binding.

As we have seen at the beginning, ​the binding between the RBD and ACE2​ (Link 10),
concentrated in the RBM (but for one residue K99 in the RBD framework - see Figure 2) forms
an extensive elongated binding interface composed of c.a. twenty residues on both sides and
ca. 40 residue-residue interactions (see the paragraph ​comparing networks of interacting
residues in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 ​vs.​ ACE2).​ We have only focused on a central region
involving the RBM-SSS that we have outlined using the same token highlighting some of the
analytical capabilities of iCn3D that allowed us to investigate structures and sequences in
parallel, focusing on molecular interactions that enable viral entry. Whether TYR453 and the
central RBM-SSS may be specifically targeted by cross-neutralizing antibodies, or even small
molecules, need further investigation. Neutralizing antibodies isolated from recovered patients
such as ​b38 cover the entire RBM of SARS-CoV-2​ (Link 28) 35​

comparisons in binding between viruses, their receptors, and neutralizing antibodies. We leave
to readers the opportunity to find other interesting “key” interactions using iCn3D, with the links

as they become available.
Epilogue: The necessary interplay sequence-structure analysis
Structure alignment can guide the proper comparison of sequences, significantly improving the
chances to discover hidden patterns. This has been well known, but correlating 1D and 3D data
involves specialized techniques that have been difficult to use for those not trained in their use.
This type of integrated analysis is now accessible through iCn3D, greatly facilitating this work,
as shown in the previous examples. iCn3D and the seamlessly integrated remote database
infrastructure it benefits from makes the job more intuitive, and the actions are better integrated,
as we have shown in the previous examples applied to Covid-19 relevant problems.
Different viruses are frequently compared through sequence alignment, for instance while
attempting to characterize RBDs. However, sequence-based alignments can be misleading, for
example, in some highly evolved regions (see Supplement Figure S2 comparing sequence
alignment in 36​
​ Figure 1, mispositioning an insertion in MERS vs. SARS-CoV-2/1, vs. Figure 3.B
and ​Link 19​ (Table 2). Therefore, it is critical to get accurate alignments if the aim is to identify
viral attachment sites targeted by inhibitors or as vaccine epitopes, possibly common to various
virus strains. Protein immunogens, in particular, need to be conformationally correct 3​​ . Our
analysis reveals that betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-1 vs. SARS-CoV-2 vs. MERS) display a small
common sequence-structure pattern with remarkable structural stability that can be used as the
focus for structure-based design efforts.
While a sequence alignment may be guided by structure, the converse is also true. Tracing a
sequence in an electron density map, when that map is not well resolved, can be a very
challenging task. We extended our structural alignment in (Figure 3.A, B) to other beta
coronaviruses presenting a third type, more complex RBM (Table 1), i.e., OC43 and HKU1 as
well as MHV (Murine Hepatitis Virus) (Figure S1). We found that the previously described RBM
supersecondary structure is still conserved in these viruses. Its structural resilience is
remarkable in accommodating insertions that differentiate and bind diverse target receptors,
some yet unknown. In performing this analysis, we found structures that could benefit from the
study here presented to guide the refinement process (i.e., MHV 37​
​ -PDB 3JCL-). The MHV
structure, for example, introduces a shift in sequence while attempting to fit the electron density
map, resulting in a local misalignment and, as a consequence, a likely misassigned Cys bridge.
A CDD evolutionary sequence alignment 38​
​ of beta coronaviruses (​CD21470​) shows that
sequences of a variety of viruses have homologous sequence patterns that can be used to
guide sequence tracing in low-resolution electron density. In fact, the ​Y135/453​ ​conservation
can be extended to OC43, HKU1, and MHV​, the pattern Yx​Y​ in SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2,
and MERS mutates to VV​Y​. In the case of MHV (PDB 3JCL), structural alignment of other
structures confirms that homologous sequence patterns are also structurally conserved. Hence
the sequence RBM-SSS-strand 1 can be realigned locally, and from there, strand 2 and the

RBM-SSS flanking loop can also be followed. Another small sequence shift can be observed on
the structure of HKU1 (PDB 5I08). These local sequence realignments are available in Figure
S1, where it can be seen that all known beta coronaviruses exhibit the same supersecondary
structure in the RBM with a highly conserved Tyrosine, as previously described.
In short, we took the problem of parallel characterization of the RBD domains, including diverse
RBM subdomains across a variety of coronaviruses, paying special attention to SARS-CoV-1,
SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, to see how far our methods could go to help current research
and researchers, and how we should push them further in the future. Through these analyses,
we observed ​a common​ ​sequence-structure​ ​pattern across different viruses that have not
been analyzed in-depth before​.
We could not have observed that pattern without a rigorous structure based sequence
alignment across multiple coronaviruses and, reciprocally, a parallel analysis of diverse
structures guided by evolutionary sequence alignments.
We have shown how structural analysis methods in iCn3D can be used in the context of
COVID19 related structures exploration. Beyond the technological benefits of web-based
visualization, web-based data and annotations sharing, and collaborative analysis capabilities,
we demonstrate the scientific merit of performing a simultaneous sequence-structure analysis.

3. Collaborating, Data Sharing, and Publishing
Collaborative Research
Research collaborations can be facilitated by exchanging links. A link can be passed between
scientists in a “​passive​” mode to visualize annotated structures, highlighting specific features,
properties, interactions through multiple labeled representations. Collaboration can become
active​: a link is live, it is not just a simple visual representation, it contains the software that
enables analysis. An analysis is passed at a given stage and it is in a given “state” that can be
used for further analysis and edition, making iCn3D a collaborative diSARS-CoV-very tool.
Lifelong links
Lifelong links are currently hosted by NCBI. It could be hosted by publishers or some other data
service. That hosting currently mediates Google Lifelong links in order to ensure continuity of
access. By this mechanism it is now possible to update links and maintain them over time, as
links addresses are managed. The solution to making links truly lifelong and maintainable is to
give a permanent name, as we do for a domain name vs an IP address - one can host the same
domain name on any server with any IP address. The same concept is applied to links for
which NCBI acts as a Link registry and can be evolved towards using DOI (​www.doi.org​)
scheme in the future. In all cases, links offer a way forward with perennity and are a
game-changer to share information, methodologies, and data itself.

Data sharing through links
Where is the data? Currently, analytical (processed) data is spread as text, tables, figures, and
supplemental files in published papers, while sequence or structural data is available in
depositories such as the PDB or NCBI and others. A link is in fact a set of commands
interpreted by iCn3D that access and process the data in a well-defined manner, making links,
data, and entire analyses they encapsulate FAIR 2​​ , i.e. ​Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
and Reusable​. Reusability of a link, as mentioned before can be passive, but is also de facto
Extensible​, by design, and a key to research ​Collaboration​. Any published link makes the
data FAIR and makes an analysis ​Reproducible.

Table 2. Summary List of iCn3D Share_Links with the corresponding text - ​The corresponding “gallery” is also
added as a supplementary HTML file S2. A gallery is generated by clicking the links and saving them with the option
"iCn3D PNG Image", and then concatenating the saved HTML files.

Data generated by analyses are computed on the fly at any instantiation of a link using basic
data stored at NCBI and PDB. Analytic data is the product or primary data processed by an
analysis method encoded in iCn3D. All commands producing numerical data such as tables of
molecular properties or molecular interactions allow the export as files, hence instead of using
supplemental data files in preprints of papers or attachments to emails, they are all intrinsically
contained in a link. The concept of reproducibility is internalized in iCn3D, and data sharing is
intrinsic to a link. In addition, in order to provide perennial accessibility, reproducibility, and
reusability over long periods of time to analyses, data and annotations, iCn3D released versions
are archived (​https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/icn3d/icn3d.html#log​). Should a future
version change some features affecting a published link, that link can be replayed with the
original iCn3D version that was used to generate it, based on its recorded creation date.
Hyperlinks were native to the WWW from its origin, so iCn3D Share Links are a natural
evolution, using them to share molecular scenes, data, and annotations. Links can be served
through a web server, currently through the NCBI server, but some other external scientific data
services have recently started to use them, such as OPM (​https://opm.phar.umich.edu/​).
Down the road, links could be used as data and annotation aggregators, provided the original
data location or computer servers producing data remain accessible. This is an issue beyond
the current use and would require on-going coordination between data services, but it could be
envisioned, especially at a time when data sharing has become mandatory for, for example,
research funded by the NIH (​https://grants.nih.gov/policy/sharing.htm​).
Peer Review and Publication
Beyond discovery, links are designed to disseminate research results as data and annotations.
They enable the ​sharing​ of annotated 3D structures for publication in preprints or
peer-reviewed papers. Links are perfect peer to peer exchange vehicles as well. They could be
invaluable to ​peer review​, since they present researchers’ data and analysis, avoiding the use
of supplement data and figure files that are currently needed by reviewers. Many supplement
files may be eliminated from preprints and published papers through the use of web links.
Another interesting aspect of links is the ability to cite data directly. A lifelong link is similar to a
DOI and can be cited since it can be addressed from anywhere on the Internet. Current links

are hosted by Google and are being made maintainable (editable) by NCBI. They could very
well be hosted anywhere in the cloud and managed by individual organizations or publishers.
Education
Lastly, links are a perfect means to disseminate scientific knowledge, and teachers have been
faster in picking up their value in education. iCn3D HTML galleries can represent a graphical
summary for a paper, a course, or even a scientific presentation. Since it is an HTML file, it can
simply be edited to provide a simple means to annotate and document a scientific project. For
example, the Supplementary HTML file S2 summarizes the entire set of links (Table 2) of this
paper graphically and we continuously append new links associated with new analyses in ​the
iCn3D gallery​.

Future Developments
Numerous improvements can be envisioned, from adding analysis functionality to extending its
use for group editing. iCn3D is open source to help foster a community of interest that can
collaborate on future developments.
As we implement new functionalities, we will inevitably increase the program complexity. There
are therefore different directions to consider for the future to reduce technical complexity. One
is to use a viewer only version of the program for purely passive visualization use. A link may
encapsulate a highly sophisticated analysis, yet there is no need of any particular knowledge to
visualize molecular scenes. This “light” implementation may best support the rapid publication
and dissemination of 3D annotations. Beyond visualization, in its interactive structural analysis
mode, it becomes an active collaboration tool: a link is then not just an endpoint, it is a starting
point for further exploration.
Another direction towards minimizing complexity in interactive mode, while increasing
functionality is in increasing analysis automation, and possibly using AI, which may greatly
benefit from the model of centralized repositories used by iCn3D. The evolution from interactive
to automated analysis should open the door to making sophisticated analyses simple and
accessible to non-experts. It is also a necessity for experts to be able to scale up and deal with
large ensembles of structures rather than one or a handful at a time. We have currently no tool
to deal with 150,000 structures available in the PDB database, or even a few hundred, while
some structural families, such as antibodies, include thousands of structures. This opens a
whole new research and development area in itself, beyond interactive analysis.

Figure S1 - Structural alignment of known Beta Coronaviruses RBDs:​ Similar alignment to Figure 3A, with​ ​in
addition​ OC43, HKU1, and MHV​. For clarity we omit additional insertions in the RBM plugin vs. ​SARS and MERS
coronaviruses. These insertions increase the RBM size and bring a significant structural complexity due to disulfide
bridges. What is remarkable however, is the structural conservation of the RBM SSS despite significant insertions.
The first Tyrosine Y133/451 in strand 1 is however, not as conserved as Y135/453, as in, for example, HKU1 or
OC43 coronaviruses (PDBids 5GNB and 6NZK) where it is replaced by a Valine. This broader ​coronaviruses
sequence alignment is visualized in iCn3D​ (Link 3). In the structure of a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (PDBid: 3JCL),
the 3D superposition also shows a structurally conserved RBM strand 1 where the sequence ​WNR ​matches the
Y/VxY​ pattern location, yet an evolutionary-based sequence alignment of beta coronaviruses (​CD21470​) finds a ​VVY
match as in HKU1 and OC43, located in sequence right after the (PSS​WNR​RYGF) sequence conserved in OC43
and HKU1. The disagreement is most likely the result of the region being poorly defined in the electron density map,
as stated by the authors of the structure and seen in the following figure (Figure S2) Whether an artefact of the EM
structure or a sequence shift during evolution, the RBM structural pattern (antiparallel strand1-strand2-flanking loop)
is conserved across all know beta coronaviruses.

fitted in place​ ​of VV​Y
B) Beta Coronaviruses CDD (​CD21470​) ​showing the conservation of the PSSWNRRYGF sequence in OC43 and
HKU1 as well as MHV
C)-Optimized Sequence alignment​ ​of beta coronaviruses RBMs ​taking into account homologous patterns
observed in the CDD (B) where Strand 1 aligns Yx​Y​ motif of SARS/MERS vs. VV​Y​ for OC43/HKU1/HKU4/MHV. In
Strand 2 similarly a GWS pattern matches in these four viruses the PLQ/N sequence in SARS. Similarly the GD-box
like flanking loop, between strand 1 and strand 2 aligns GxxE between OC43/HKU1/HKU4/MHV
D)-Optimized structure alignment of beta coronaviruses RBMs​ where in 3JCL WNR was fitted (see A) and aligns
with other structures VVY in strand 1’, in strand 2 the structure presents a shift of 2 residues of GWS when
compared to other structures C) . The HKU1 (PDB 5I08) structure, in the same way shifts by 3 residues strand 1
matching VV​Y​ with the preceding SYD​ ​residues, yet strand 2 and the flanking loop are well positioned.

Figure S3 - ACE2 sequences of selected mammals. ​Two subdomains contain the residues forming the receptor binding site
(RBS) of ACE2, 1. N terminal domain (res 19-90) and 2. subdomain (res. 326-400) [see Figure 2-3-4] for more details.

Free energy calculations
∆∆G values were computed using the Free Energy Perturbation slow growth calculation
approach as described in [1] using Gromacs 5.1.4 [2] and the PMX package [3] considering the
“unbound” geometries (instead of the “unfolded” states as described in [1]) The ∆∆G values
were computed in the forward and backwards direction. The values reported are the average of
the two. The Amber99sb force field was used for all FEP calculations. Initial coordinates were
obtained from the RCSB and preprocessed using Yasara version 20 [4] and the “Clean All”
macro using the NOVA2 force field, followed by an energy minimization using the same force
field and default parameters using the Options / Energy Minimization macro. The coordinates
were then subjected to the regular relaxation in a solvent bath as described in [1] before the
molecular dynamics trajectories were collected.
