ABSTRACT

34

BACKGROUND: Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, is facilitated

35

by host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2

36

(TMPRSS2). We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and

37

TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets.

38

METHODS: Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a

39

weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We

40

explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known

41

drug-gene interactions. RESULTS: ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with

42

moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r>0.3, FDR<0.05) had known interactions with existing drug

43

compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched

44

in the gene ontology biologic process ‘Entry into host cell’, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had

45

known interactions with drug compounds. CONCLUSION: Dozens of genes are co-expressed with

46

ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of

47

the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the

48

development of COVID-19 therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

68
69

Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS coronavirus) in

70

2002 and 2003, coronaviruses have been considered to be highly pathogenic for humans

1–3.

A new

71

coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that spreads through respiratory droplets emerged in December of 2019

72

in Wuhan, Hubei province, China 4. Its rapid spread across China and the rest of the world ultimately

73

resulted in the global COVID-19 pandemic, which was officially declared in March 2020 by the World

74

Health Organization (WHO).

75
76

It has since been shown that SARS-CoV-2 shares a common host cell entry mechanism with

77

the 2002-2003 SARS coronavirus

5,6.

The viral genome encodes for multiple viral components,

78

including the spike protein (S), which facilitates viral entry into the host cell

79

associates with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate infection of the target cells9.

80

ACE2 is a type 1 transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase that is an important negative regulator of

81

the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Once SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into epithelial cells, surface

82

expression of ACE2 is rapidly downregulated in the infected cell 10, which leads to an imbalance in

83

angiotensin II-mediated signalling and predisposes the host to acute lung injury. SARS-CoV-2 also

84

employs transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) to proteolytically activate the S protein, which

85

is essential for viral entry into target cells 11.

7,8.

The S protein

86
87

In view of the rapid spread and the mortality of COVID-19 worldwide, there is an urgent need

88

to find effective treatments against this infection, especially for severe cases. However, the

89

development of a vaccine and novel treatments may take months to years, requiring billions of dollars

90

in investment and with no certainty of their ultimate success. Bioinformatic approaches, however, can

91

rapidly identify relevant gene-drug interactions that may contribute to the understanding of the

92

mechanisms of viral infection and reduce the time to finding potential drug targets and existing drugs

93

that could be repurposed for this indication. Here, we performed a gene expression network analysis

94

on data generated in the Lung eQTL Consortium Cohort to investigate the mechanisms of ACE2 and

95

TMPRSS2 expression in lung tissue. We identified potential targets to be explored as possible

96

treatments for COVID-19. We hypothesized that the mechanisms associated with ACE2 and TMPRSS2

97

likely encompass protein coding genes involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

98
99

RESULTS

100

The Lung eQTL Consortium cohort used in this gene network analysis is described in Table

101

1. Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the three centres

102

that are part of the Lung eQTL Consortium (see methods); ACE2 had low to moderate expression

103

levels in lung tissue; whereas TMPRSS2 was highly expressed. Based on the study cohort lung

104

expression profile, we determined that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were contained in distinct modules. The

105

module containing ACE2 (ACE2 module) included 681 unique genes, while the modules containing

106

TMPRSS2 (TMPRSS2 module) encompassed 1,086 unique genes (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

107

Only 41 genes were found in both modules. The hub gene for the ACE2 module was TMEM33, and

108

hub gene for the TMPRSS2 module was PDZD2 (see methods for the definition of ‘hub gene’). Fig. 1

109

shows the top 50 genes with the highest connectivity to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 within their respective

110

modules, based on the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) analysis.

ACE2 was 0.25. We utilized genes in the ACE2 module to execute a pathway enrichment analysis,

127

which showed significant enrichment of four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)

ACE2-correlated genes

133
134

The expression of 646 genes in the ACE2 module was significantly correlated with ACE2 levels

135

(FDR<0.05), and only two of those genes were negatively correlated with ACE2. The range of their

136

correlation coefficient (r) with ACE2 expression level in lung tissue is shown in Supplementary Fig.

137

S2. Although a large proportion of genes were significantly related to ACE2 expression levels, only

138

76 genes had moderate or high correlations (r>0.3).

139
140

The PCCB gene was most strongly correlated with ACE2 expression (r=0.45, Supplementary

141

Table S1). Of the top 10 genes most strongly correlated with ACE2, three genes (PCCB, PIGN and

142

ADK) were part of the KEGG ‘metabolic pathway’ which showed enrichment with ACE2 module

143

genes (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, out of the top 10 genes, four genes (ITPR2, LONP2,

144

ADK and WDFY3) were found in multiple GO processes that were enriched with ACE2 module genes

145

(Supplementary Table S4).

146
147

We identified 76 genes that showed moderate correlation (r>0.3) with ACE2 expression. Of

148

these, 48 genes had biological and/or druggability information available (details are presented in

149

Supplementary Table S1). We used these genes to construct a ‘map’ of biological information

150

(Supplementary Fig. S3). Based on the druggability scores, we identified 13 genes (GART, DPP4,

151

PIGF, HDAC8, MDM2, SOAT1, IDE, BCAT1, SLC11A2, ADK, KLHL8, IL13RA2 and ITPR2) that are

152

TMPRSS2-correlated genes

172
173

We found that 864 unique genes in the TMPRSS2 module were positively correlated with the

174

TMPRSS2 expression level in lung tissue (FDR<0.05), while 73 demonstrated a negative relationship

175

with the gene. The absolute r ranged from 0.06 to 0.72, with FHDC1 expression showing the strongest

176

correlation with TMPRSS2 (r=0.72) (Supplementary Table S2). Next, we identified 368 genes that

177

were moderately or highly correlated with TMPRSS2 gene expression levels (r>0.30), of those 78 were

178

drug targets or were part of key pathways that could be targeted by drug compounds (see methods).

179

The genes are shown in Fig. 2, grouped based on the availability of biological information. The A4

180

group contained the genes with the most amount of biological information in the explored

181

bioinformatics databases. Most genes in Fig. 2 only had information on human phenotypes (A1 group);

182

details on the genes biological information are presented in the Supplementary Table S2.

There is a scarcity of therapeutic treatments specific for this virus and for severe COVID-19

pneumonia. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are key proteins involved in the cellular entry mechanism of SARS-

224

Cov-2 to infect the lungs of the human host. Because one of the rate-limiting step in this process is the

225

overall availability of these proteins on surface of lung epithelial cells 15, careful evaluation of ACE2

226

and TMPRSS2 biology may enable identification of possible therapeutic targets against SARS-Cov-2

227

infection. In this study, by using a network analysis of genome-wide gene expression in lung tissue,

228

we were able to identify a set of genes that may interact with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and thus may be

229

drug targets.

230
231

One notable gene was ADK. This gene is a key regulator of extracellular and intracellular

232

adenine nucleotides 16,17. ADK inhibition attenuates lung injury in mice 18, while in humans, cigarette

233

exposure upregulates expression of ADK in lung tissue. We speculate a role for ADK in COVID-19,

234

postulating that increased ADK may increase adenosine concentration in the lungs which in turn can

235

enhance viral replication. Previous work has shown that silencing ADK decreased influenza replication

236

in an in vitro model

237

dideoxynucleoside analogue of adenosine that inhibits retro-transcription and is used in the treatment

238

of HIV. Although this drug was recently nominated for drug repurposing as a potential treatment

239

against COVID-19 21, the biology of this drug is complex, particularly given the detrimental effect of

240

ADK on lung injury.

19.

Another study showed that ADK can activate didanosine

20,

a

241
242

Another ACE2-correlated gene that emerged from this study was DPP4. DPP4 encodes the

243

dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) glycoprotein, which plays a major role in glucose and insulin

244

metabolism and is linked to diabetes, now established as a key risk factor for severe COVID-19

245

including mortality

246

(MERS) coronavirus and interacts with dozens of drugs. DPP-4 inhibitors, which are used in the

247

treatment of diabetes, appear to reduce macrophage infiltration and insulin resistance but have not

248

been shown to increase the risk of infection in diabetic patients23. However, the effects of DPP-4

249

inhibitors on the immune response are not well understood. Because of the similarities between MERS

250

and SARS-Cov-2, this is an interesting potential target, particularly for patients with diabetes.

22.

DPP-4 is the functional receptor for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

252

Another interesting target is IL13RA2, which encodes the alpha-2 receptor subunit for

253

interleukin-13 (IL-13). The IL-13 pathway has immunoregulatory functions and is implicated in

254

asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 24 and COPD 25,26. The IL-13 pathway can activate Janus

255

kinase 2 (JAK2) while the inhibition of JAK2 blocks SARS-CoV-2 viral entry 27. IL13RA2 interacts

256

with cintredekin besudotox, a drug compound that is formed by cross-linking IL-13 with Pseudomonas

257

exotoxin-A and induces apoptosis by targeting cells that express the IL-13 receptor. Both the IL-13

258

and DPP-4 pathways could be intriguing possibilities for novel COVID-19 therapeutics.

259
260

The HDAC8 gene is an exciting potential target because of its role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF)

261

and its interaction with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors have shown promise

262

against fibrotic diseases 28. The overexpression of HDACs is suggested to contribute to the process of

263

bronchiolization in patients with IPF 29. Viral infection increases the risk of PF 30 and it is reported that

264

HDAC8 inhibition ameliorates PF 31; moreover we found that cigarette exposure, a known risk factor

265

for both COVID-19 and IPF, increases the expression of HDAC8 in lung tissue. Therefore, targeting

266

the PF mechanisms through HDAC inhibitors pose an interesting therapy to further explore.

267
268

The ‘entry into host cell’ biological process was enriched with genes from the TMPRSS2

269

module. Furthermore, the CD55 or complement decay-accelerating factor, an inhibitor of complement

270

activation, is one of the few genes that was part of this process. The complement system has a major

271

role in the immune response to viruses and triggers a proinflammatory cascade

272

highly expressed in lung tissue, prevents the formation of C3 convertase 33 and therefore also inhibits

273

the formation of C3 complement. C3-deficient mice show less respiratory dysfunction and lower levels

274

of cytokines and chemokines in lungs in response to SARS-CoV 34. Thus, it is possible that preventing

275

the formation of C3 via CD55 could be beneficial in COVID-19. Fortunately, known compounds such

276

as chloramphenicol already exist that specifically target CD55 32,35.

32.

277
278

As noted above, we have identified a set of genes that interact with potential therapeutic targets,

279

which could be explored as treatments against COVID-19. The main strength of our study is the large

280

number of lung tissue specimens with detailed clinical phenotypic data. This allowed us to not only

281

identify genes related to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, but also to determine the effects of various

282

clinical factors on the lung tissue expression of these genes. However, there were limitations to this

283

study. First, we used an in-silico approach to identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 correlated genes, but we

284

did not confirm these association in vivo nor determine how these correlated genes physically

285

interacted with ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Second, we identified the most promising drugs based on drug-

286

gene interactions from bioinformatic databases, but we are yet to test their effects on gene and/or

287

protein expression in in vitro experiments. Third, the lungs of our study cohort were not exposed to

288

SARS-CoV-2, therefore it is possible that the gene expression of these key identified genes in lung

289

tissue could be changed upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, the cohort used for gene expression was

290

of European ancestry and the results may not be generalizable to other ethnic groups, which is of

291

critical importance in a global pandemic.

292
293

In summary, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene networks contained genes that could contribute to the

294

pathophysiology of COVID-19. These findings show that computational in silico approaches can lead

295

to the rapid identification of potential drugs, which could be repurposed as treatments against COVID-

296

19. Given the exponential spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the unprecedented rise in deaths,

297

such rapidity is necessary in our ongoing fight against the pandemic.

302
303

Using microarray, gene expression profiles of 43,466 non-control probe sets (GEO platform

304

GPL10379) were obtained from lung tissue samples in the Lung eQTL Consortium Cohort. Briefly,

305

samples from this cohort included whole non-tumour lung tissue samples from 1,038 participants of

306

European ancestry who underwent surgical lung resection. Tissue samples were collected based on the

307

Institutional Review Board guidelines at three different institutions: The University of British

308

Columbia (UBC), Laval University and University of Groningen. This study was approved by the

309

ethics committees within each institution. A full description of the cohort and quality controls is

310

provided by Hao and colleagues 36.

312

Gene expression network analysis

313
314

Using the WGCNA

37

R package, we explored gene networks correlated to ACE2 and

315

TMPRSS2 in order to identify potential interactions in the Lung eQTL Consortium cohort. WGCNA

316

clusters co-expressed genes into networks and creates “modules”, which are defined as groups of

317

highly interconnected genes. For this analysis we identified signed consensus modules among the three

318

centres in our study cohort. Briefly, WGCNA generated a signed co-expression matrix based on the

319

correlation between genes, which later was transformed into an adjacent matrix by raising the co-

320

expression to a soft threshold power (β). For our study we used a β=6 and a minimum module size of

321

100 probe sets. A consensus network was built by identifying the overlap of all input datasets. For

322

each probe set in the modules a ‘Module Membership’ (MM) was calculated by correlating the gene’s

323

expression with the respective module’s expression (eigengene), i.e. the first principal component of

324

each module gene expression profile; the gene with the highest MM was termed the ‘hub gene’.

327
328

Enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways and GO biological processes was performed using the

329

genes in the modules containing ACE2 (ACE2 module) and TMPRSS2 (TMPRSS2 module). Significant

330

enrichment was established at FDR<0.05. For each gene in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 modules, we

331

determined the Pearson correlation between the expression level of the gene and that of ACE2 or

332

TMPRSS2. We calculated correlation coefficients for the three centres separately and then combined

333

them using correlation meta-analysis via the R package metafor 38. Significant correlations were set at

334

FDR<0.05 and in the downstream analyses, we focused on genes that correlated to ACE2 or TMPRSS2

335

with r>0.30.

Drug-gene interactions and biological information of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 correlated genes

338
339

We cross-referenced the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 correlated genes with the Mouse Genome

340

Informatics (MGI), the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and the ClinVar databases in

341

order to identify biologically relevant genes. We determined druggability scores according to methods

342

of Finan et al 12. Tier 1 refers to genes that are targets of small molecules and/or biotherapeutic drugs;

343

Tier 2 score indicates gene encoding targets with a known bioactive drug-like small molecule binding

344

partner and ≥50% identity (over ≥75% of the sequence) with an approved drug target; and Tier 3

345

denotes protein coding genes with similarities to drug targets and are members of key druggable gene

346

families. We also interrogated the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb)

We investigated the effects of possible risk factors for COVID-19 severity (e.g. smoking,

353

diabetes, asthma, COPD, cardiac disease, and hypertension) on the expression of druggable genes that

354

were correlated with ACE2 or TMPRSS2. We first combined the gene expression from the three centres

355

using ComBat from the R package sva to correct for any batch effect

356

expression was assessed for each gene-risk factor pair by a robust linear regression using the package

357

MASS 40 in R, in which the dependent variable was the gene expression and the explanatory variable

358

was the risk factor. The differential expression analysis on smoking was adjusted for sex and age, and

359

the analyses on diabetes, COPD and cardiac disease and hypertension were additionally adjusted for

360

smoking status. We set statistically significant differential expression FDR<0.05.
