Abstract
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Computational analysis of mammalian ACE2 orthologues
suggests various residues at the interface with the viral receptor binding domain that could facilitate
tighter interaction compared to the human-ACE2. Introducing several mutations to the human-ACE2
resulted with significantly augmented affinity to the viral spike complex. This modified human-ACE2
fused to an Fc portion of an antibody makes a potent immunoadhesin that effectively targets SARSCoV-2.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing devastating pandemic leading to a substantial global
death toll and an unprecedented economic loss. There is an urgent need for anti-viral
countermeasures that will help to save lives as well as shorten the recovery and hospitalization time
of sick people. Immunotherapy has the potential to neutralize viruses directly as well as to recruit
immune effector functions to clear infected cells, and it makes a promising approach that was already
shown to be beneficial in combating other viral diseases. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the
respiratory syncytial virus is effective and was approved for treating infected children

Lassa 9, Junin 10, Ebola 11, and even SARS 12 viruses have been proven effective in animal models.
Preliminary reports indicate that also in the case of COVID-19, sera from convalescent patients help
to fight the disease13,14. Hence, targeted immunotherapy may become a powerful anti-viral tool for
fighting COVID-19.

Though anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs were recently isolated from convalescent patients 15-17,
it would be important to diversify our immunotherapeutic toolkit to maximize the chances for success.
Diversification may be achieved using immunoadhesins, which are antibody-like molecules that
consist of a binding domain fused to an Fc portion on an antibody 18. The viral cellular receptor could
serve as a binding domain for constructing such immunoadhesins. Due to natural adaptation,
however, zoonotic viruses may bind to their animal-derived ortholog cellular receptors at higher
affinities than the human cell-surface receptors 19. Thus, immunoadhesins that are constructed with
the host-ortholog receptors can provide superior anti-viral therapeutics. We recently demonstrated
this approach by constructing Arenacept, which is a powerful immunoadhesin that targets viruses
from the Arenaviridae family of viruses 20.
SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular
receptor 21-23. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses 24, but
the exact origin of the virus is unknown and other animal species may have served as intermediate
reservoirs before SARS-CoV-2 crossed over to the human population

25

. It was shown that ACE2

orthologs from various animals can serve as entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2 26. Furthermore, it was
demonstrated that the human-ACE2 is a suboptimal receptor for SARS-CoV-2

27

. We therefore

reasoned that the human-ACE2 could be modified to make it a superior binder of SARS-CoV-2.
Such an engineered ACE2 may be better suited for therapeutic applications than the human ACE2.
Results
The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to its ACE2 receptors is mediated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD),
which is part of its spike complex 23,28-30. ACE2 has a long helical segment at its N’ terminus, which
forms most of the RBD-recognition site on ACE2 (Fig. 1a). A multiple sequence alignment of over
200 ACE2 sequences derived from mammals indicates that many of the ACE2 positions that
comprise the SARS-CoV-2 recognition site are not conserved (Fig. 1b). This notion indicates an
enormous putative sequence space that ACE2 can adopt.
To identify advantageous alterations of ACE2 that may enhance the binding to SARS-CoV-2, we
selected 70 orthologous ACE2 genes with sequence identity to the human-ACE2 greater than 80%.
We used Rosetta atomistic modelling calculations to assess the stability, binding energy (ΔΔGbind),
interface packing and shape complementarity for the RBD (starting from PDB entry 6VW1) (Fig. 1c)
30

. We visually inspected the top-20 models according to ΔΔGbind and identified mutations that the

calculations indicated would improve contacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD relative to the human
ACE2. Due to the high sequence diversity in ACE2, many design options were available. We rejected
mutations to Trp, due to their tendency to form undesired promiscuous interactions and furthermore
consulted a recent deep mutational sequencing dataset on ACE2 mutations and their impact on
binding to the RBD27 eliminating mutations that were depleted in this dataset.

Three of the mutations that we decided to incorporate are located at the first N'-terminal helix of
human-ACE2. These three mutations include a T27L mutation that improves packing with
hydrophobic residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2a), a D30E mutation that forms a new salt-bridge
with Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2b), and a Q42R mutation that may form a salt-bridge with
Asp38 of ACE2 and stabilize it in a configuration that favors the formation of a hydrogen bond with
Tyr449 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2c). Alternatively, the new arginine may assume a different
rotamer that makes favorable electrostatic interactions with the main-chain carboxylic oxygen of
Gly447 from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2c). Besides these three mutations at the N-terminal helix
of ACE2 that we selected, we identified two additional sites in the surrounding regions of ACE2. In
the first site, we identified a putative change of Glu75 and Leu79 to arginine and tyrosine,
respectively, that may interact favorably with Phe486 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2d). In the second
site outside the first helix of ACE2, N330F may improve packing against the aliphatic portion of
Thr500 from SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2e). We used Rosetta to model the combination of these six
mutations and its impact on the binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Our design showed a remarkable
improvement in ΔΔG of binding as well as in the buried surface area (Fig. 1c).
We decided to incorporate additional modification at other sites on top of modifying ACE2 residues
that directly interact with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Human-ACE2 has a putative glycosylation site at Asn90
that was shown to bear a glycan according to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/human-ACE2 cryo-EM
structure

21

. This N-linked glycan projects toward the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and presumably imposes

steric constraints for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The aforementioned deep mutational
scanning dataset27 is highly enriched with mutations in this N-linked glycosylation site, further
supporting this notion. To eliminate this glycosylation site, we mutated Thr92 from the N-X-T
glycosylation motif to an arginine that can make polar interactions with nearby glutamine (Fig. 2f).
Besides serving as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is an enzyme that has a critical
biological function in regulating blood pressure by hydrolyzing angiotensin II 31. Since the enzymatic
activity of the engineered ACE2 may complicate its therapeutic use, we also mutated its key catalytic
position Glu375 to leucine.
To test our design, we produced two chimeric proteins that included amino acids 19-615 of the
human-ACE2 ectodomain (omitting the original signal peptide) fused to an Fc portion of human IgG1,
with or without the eight above-mentioned mutations (i.e., T27L, D30E, Q42R, E75R, L79Y, N330F,
T92R, & E375L). Both the WT construct (ACE2-Fc) and our designed ACE2 construct (ACE2mod-Fc)
readily expressed as secreted proteins using HEK293F cells in suspension and were easily purified
to near homogeneity using protein-A affinity chromatography (Fig. 3a). Testing the enzymatic activity
of both ACE2-Fc and ACE2mod-Fc verified that the latter is indeed catalytic dead (Supplementary Fig.
1). We then immobilized the two immunoadhesins on a surface plasmon resonance sensor chip and
used purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD as an analyte to determine their binding affinities, which is a
configuration that does not allow avidity. A simple 1:1 binding model gave a good fit for the binding

data of ACE2mod-Fc to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, but the binding of ACE2-Fc to SARS-CoV-2 RBD could
not be fitted using this model, and we, therefore, used a more complex heterogeneous-ligand model
that assumes some heterogeneity of the ACE2-Fc (Fig. 3b). Such heterogeneity could presumably
originate from partial glycosylation at Asn90 of ACE2. Remarkably, the binding affinity of ACE2modFc to SARS-CoV-2 RBD is more than two orders of magnitude stronger compared with the binding
affinity of ACE2-Fc (Fig. 3b). While the association rate (ka) of ACE2mod-Fc to SARS-CoV-2 RBD is
somewhat faster compared to ACE2-Fc, the improvement mainly stems from a dramatic two-orders
of magnitude slower dissociation rate (kd).
To test if the enhanced affinity of ACE2mod-Fc could translate to improved biological functions, we
conducted a pseudovirus neutralization assay. The neutralization profile of ACE2mod-Fc is apparently
better compared to the profile of ACE2-Fc (Fig. 4a). There is more than a 10-fold improvement in
both IC50 and IC80 values, comparing the two reagents. Anti SARS-CoV-2 immunoadhesin that binds
to cell-surface displayed spike complexes might recruit beneficial immune factions via its Fc portion.
We used flow cytometry to monitor the ability of ACE2-Fc and of ACE2mod-Fc to stain HEK293 cells
that were transiently transfected express the SARS-CoV-2 spike complex (Fig. 4b). ACE2mod-Fc has
an apparent higher capacity to recognize the spike complex compared to ACE2-Fc. Altogether, we
created a superior ACE2-based immunoadhesin that displays an improved capacity to target SARSCoV-2.
Discussion
Immunotherapy makes a promising avenue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. ACE2-based
immunoadhesins were already described in the literature 26,32. However, reagents based on humanACE2 have limited potency, and they can only compete in a stoichiometric fashion with the abundant
natural ACE2 receptor on cells. An improved ACE2 binder, like the one we present here, is a more
efficient competitor for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Neutralization of the virus by blocking the
receptor binding site is a mechanism that is shared by some anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD mAbs that were
recently isolated

15-17

. Nevertheless, ACE2mod-Fc is likely to interact solely with the residues that

make the ACE2 binding site, whereas the epitopes of anti-RBD mAbs are likely to only partially
overlap with the ACE2-binidng surface, which may contribute for the emergence of escape mutations.
Altogether we present a promising immunoadhesin that we now term Coronacept, which is a
candidate immunotherapeutic agent for COVID-19.
Methods
Atomistic modeling– Orthologous sequences of ACE2 were collected by using a protein BLAST 33
search of the human-ACE2 sequence at GenBank and filtering the results to mammalian origin, and
to sequences with greater than 80% identity to human-ACE2. Sequences were aligned using
MUSCLE 34. Each sequence was threaded on the human-ACE2/Spike structure (PDB entry: 6VW1)

and relaxed using sidechain packing and backbone, sidechain and rigid-body minimization subject
to harmonic constraints on the Cα coordinates observed in the experimental structure. The ref2015
energy function was used in all calculations (xml and command line are provided in the
Supplementary information). 100 models were generated for each sequence and the best scoring

Construction of expression vectors – Codon-optimized forms of human ACE2 binding region
(amino-acids 19-615) and modified ACE2 genes were chemically synthesized (Genscript), and were
subcloned upstream of a human Fc region (derived from IgG1) as previously described

Protein expression and purification – ACE-Fc fusion proteins and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were
expressed in suspension-HEK293F cells grown in FreeStyle media (Gibco). Transfections were
done using 40 kDa polyethyleneimine (PEI-MAX) (Polysciences) at 1 mg of plasmid DNA per 1 L of
culture at a cell density of 106/ml. Media were collected six days post-transfection and supplemented
with 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and PMSF. S covid19 RBD was buffer exchanged to Phosphate
Buffered Saline (PBS) using a tangential flow filtration system (Millipore), and captured using a
HiTrap IMAC FF Ni+2 (GE Healthcare) affinity column followed by size exclusion chromatography
purification with a Superdex 200 10/300 increased column (GE Healthcare). Fc-Fusion proteins were
isolated using HiTrap protein-A (GE Healthcare) affinity columns.

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) measurements – Binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 –Fc

Fusion proteins were first immobilized at a coupling density of ~1000 response units (RU) on a series
S sensor chip protein A (GE Healthcare) in PBS and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide buffer. RBD was
then injected at 0.16, 0.8, 4, 20, and 100 nM concentrations, at a flow rate of 60 μL/min. Single-cycle
kinetics was performed for the binding assay. The sensor chip was regenerated using 10 mM
glycine-HCl pH 1.5 buffer.

Lentiviral particles production and Neutralization – Lentiviruses expressing S-Covid19 spikes
were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with Luciferase-pLenti6, D19 S_covid-pCMV3 and
DR89 Ψ vectors at 1:1:1 ratio, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher). Media containing
Lentiviruses was collected at 48h post-transfection, centrifuged at 600g for 5min for clarifying from
cells, and aliquots were frozen at -80°C.
For neutralization assays, HEK293T were transiently transfected with hACE2-pCDNA using
Lipofectamine 2000. Following 18h post-transfection, cells were re-seeded on a poly-L-lysine precoated white, chimney 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One). Cells were left to adhere for 8 h, followed
by the addition of S-covid19 lentivirions, which were pre-incubated with 4-fold descending
concentration series of either ACE2–Fc or ACE2mod–Fc. Luminescence from the activity of luciferase
was measured 48 h post-infection using a TECAN infinite M200 pro plate reader after applying
Bright-Glo reagent (Promega) on cells.
Flow cytometry analyses – Flow cytometry was used to detect the binding between ACE2-Fc or
ACE2mod-Fc to the spike complex of SARS-CoV-2 on cells. HEK293T cells were seeded on 10-cm
plates and transfected 24 h later with 5 µg of D19 S_covid-pCMV3 using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Cells’ media were replaced 6 h later to full medium, i.e., DMEM (Biological Industries)
supplemented with 1% Pen-Strep (v/v), 1% Glutamine (w/v), and 1% (v/v) MEM Non-essential amino
acids. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were detached by pipetting and washed by centrifugation at
400xg for 5 min and re-suspension in PBS/0.5 % BSA solution. To prevent unspecific binding,
blocking was performed by incubation in PBS/1 % BSA for 15 min. Cells were aliquoted and
incubated with different concentrations of ACE2-Fc or ACE2mod-Fc diluted in PBS/0.5 % BSA: 50,
10, 2, 0.5, 0.25, 0.05, 0.01 µg/ml for 1 h, washed, and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor
488 donkey-anti-human secondary antibody for 30 min. Unstained cells and secondary antibody
stained cells were used as negative controls. Analyses were performed using an LSR II flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). Curve fitting were performed using GraphPad Prism.
ACE2 activity assay – ACE2 activity was evaluated using SensoLyte® 390 ACE2 Activity Assay
Kit (ANASPEC; cat# 72086) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 ng or 100 ng of ACE2-Fc
and ACE2mod-Fc samples were compared blank control. Measurement of product formation
(fluorogenic peptide cleavage) as a function of time was taken every 10 seconds.
