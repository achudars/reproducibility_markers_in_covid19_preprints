Abstract: ​There is an urgent need for the ability to rapidly develop effective
countermeasures for emerging biological threats, such as the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the ongoing coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We have developed a generalized computational design
strategy to rapidly engineer ​de novo ​proteins that precisely recapitulate the protein
surface targeted by biological agents, like viruses, to gain entry into cells. The designed
proteins act as decoys that block cellular entry and aim to be resilient to viral mutational
escape. Using our novel platform, in less than ten weeks, we engineered, validated, and
optimized ​de novo protein decoys of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2),
the membrane-associated protein that SARS-CoV-2 exploits to infect cells. Our
optimized designs are hyperstable ​de novo proteins (~18-37 kDa), have high affinity for
the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and can potently inhibit the virus
infection and replication in vit​ro. Future refinements to our strategy can enable the rapid
development of other therapeutic ​de novo protein decoys, not limited to neutralizing
viruses, but to combat any agent that explicitly interacts with cell surface proteins to
cause disease.

Main Text: Since its emergence in December of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused
millions of cases of COVID-19 and become a global pandemic. The need for effective
strategies to prevent and treat the disease remains unfulfilled and urgent ​(​1​)​. There are
multiple ongoing efforts to develop prophylactics and therapeutics using several
approaches ​(​2​) such as vaccination ​(​3​)​, protein engineering ​(​1​) and small molecule drug
discovery ​(​4​)​. The high mutational rate of positive sense single-strand RNA (+ssRNA)
viruses ​(​5​–​7​) can lead to viral escape ​(​8​)​, which could rapidly compromise the efficacy
of many treatments under development, possibly leading to recurrent outbreaks of
SARS-CoV-2 with globally catastrophic consequences. Mutations have already
spontaneously occurred in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 ​(​9​)​, and some of them
are already suspected to increase the infectivity of the virus ​(​10​)​). Deep mutational
scanning studies have further shown that there are mutations that can enable the virus
to escape known neutralizing antibodies, as well as mutations that can increase its
binding affinity for hACE2 ​(​11​, ​12​)​. A pressing need exists to develop novel therapeutics
that can be more resistant to viral mutation and immunologic escape by SARS-CoV-2.
Traditional approaches to combat viruses (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) ultimately rely on
molecules interacting with viruses in a way that is fundamentally different than how the
virus engages with its cellular targets ​(​13​, ​14​)​. Viruses can exploit such structural
discrepancy to evade neutralization, changing the shape of their proteins to prevent
recognition by the neutralizing agents while preserving their viral function. To address
these challenges, we have developed a general protein design strategy that enables the
rapid and accurate computational design of ​de novo proteins that neutralize a virus by
disabling its mechanism of cellular entry. ​By mimicking the exact protein surface that the
virus targets on its first contact with the cell’s membrane, our ​de novo designer proteins
can outcompete the viral interaction and act as neutralizing agents. Since a de novo
protein decoy mirrors the natural viral cell’s protein target, mutations that affect (e.g.
weaken) the interaction of the virus with the ​de novo decoy are likely to have a similar
effect on its interaction with the cell, automatically conferring the designed decoys with
resiliency to mutational viral escape.
SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells in a two-step process ​(​15​–​17​)​. The first step occurs
when the SARS-CoV-2 S protein attaches to the cell via binding to the angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), triggering endocytosis and the second when it escapes
the endosome via a protease-cleavage-mediated fusion peptide ​(​18​)​. The process is
similar to the beta-coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-1, which also target
ACE2 for cellular entry ​(​19​)​. In principle, inhibiting the viral interaction with ACE2 should
therefore prevent infection. ​In a span of ten wee​ks (figure 1J), we applie​d our design
strategy to engineer, validate and optimize ​de novo protein decoys of human ACE2
(hACE2) to neutralize ​SARS-CoV-2 ​(figure S1)​. Our best optimized design, CTC-445.2d
(ConquerTheCorona445.2duo), is a thermodynamically hyperstable, bi-valent,
single-chain protein that exhibits low nanomolar affinity for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and
is cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-1. As predicted, the strong and specific binding of

CTC-445.2d to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 translated into potent and specific ​in vitro viral
neutralization. As expected, the effect SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations in binding are
closely mirrored between hACE2 and the de novo decoys. ​At a size of ~160 a.a. and
combining multiple ɑ-helical and β-strand structures, CTC-445 and its optimized variants
are among the most advanced examples of ​de novo therapeutic proteins reported to
date.
Computational design and optimization of de novo ACE2 decoys to neutralize
SARS-CoV-2. We started the design process of the de novo decoys by identifying the
hACE2 structural motifs that form the protein surface that SARS-CoV-2 binds to gain
entry into the cell. We based our effort on three publicly available structures of hACE2 in
complex with the RBDs of SARS-CoV-1 (PDB: 6CS2) and SARS-CoV-2 (PDBs: 6VW1,
6M17) ​(​20​–​22​)​. By visual inspection, we identified four discontiguous hACE2 structural
elements that form the target protein binding interface. We selected the major three of
these elements to build our de novo decoys: two long alpha helices (H1 and H2) and a
short beta hairpin (EE3) (figures 1A and S2). To generate molecules that are
biologically inert for humans, our design strategy avoided incorporating elements of
hACE2 that are known (or predicted) to be biologically active, such as its catalytic site
and/or its interface with the cell. We built new disembodied ​de novo secondary structure
elements tailored to support the target structural elements in a way that is both
compatible with globular folding and that stabilizes the binding interface (figure 1B and
methods), inspired by recent developments in the design of de novo structural elements
(​23​–​26​)​. Then, in a spirit similar to the design of Neoleukin-2/15 (Neo-2/15) ​(​23​, ​27​)​, we
used a combinatorial approach based on Rosetta’s "protein_mimic_designer" to
generate multiple fully-connected protein topologies that contain all the desired
structural and binding elements ​(​23​)​. The design of the protein decoys was constrained
to fully preserve --intact up to each amino acid's conformation-- the target binding
interface (figure 1A-B, 2A-B), such as the designed de novo decoys can be more
resilient to mutational escape by the virus. We then used Rosetta to generate de novo
amino acid sequences predicted to fold into the target structures (figure 1B and
methods), and evaluated the designs with an automatic filtering pipeline based on nine
computational parameters, including predictions of smooth folding funnels into stable
protein structures (figure 1C-D). The top ranking designs (see methods) were selected
for experimental testing of binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (figure 1E).
We engineered ~35,000 plausible computational models of ​de novo ACE2 decoys, and
by using yeast display, we individually tested 196 of the top ranked designs for
SARS-CoV-2 binding. Out-of-the-box, one of the designs, CTC-445, showed
strong/nanomolar specific binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (figure 1E, S3, and
methods). Despite its high affinity, recombinantly expressed CTC-445 was a weak (µM
range) competitor of hACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (figure 1I). A single round of
directed evolution and rational combination of the most frequently observed (stabilizing
and affinity-improving) mutations led to CTC-445.2, which contains five amino acid

substitutions (figure 1G, S4, S5, and table S1, see methods). The improving mutations
play a role in optimizing the stability of the protein’s native state, and none of them is at
the binding interface (figures 2C-D, S4, and methods). CTC-445.2 is highly soluble,
monodisperse (figure 1H and S7), thermodynamically hyperstable (figure 2C-D), a
strong competitor of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to hACE2 (figure 1I), and a potent in
vitro inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection (figure 3). A simple domain duplication of
CTC-445.2 (figure 2B) allowed us to further develop CTC-445.2d, which has similar
favorable biochemical characteristics, but due to its bivalent nature exhibits a ~100-fold
improved SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency.
Biophysical and biochemical properties of the de novo protein ACE2 decoys.
CTC-445 is a 160 a.a. protein comprising 18 of the natural amino acids (it does not
contain cysteine or tryptophan residues), has nanomolar affinity for the RBD of
SARS-CoV-2 (K​d = 357 nM, see table S2 and methods) and can outcompete binding of
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE2 (IC​50 = 1675 nM, figure 1I). Notably, CTC-445 exhibits
lower binding potency for SARS-CoV-2 than hACE2 (K​d ​= 4.6 nM, IC​50 = 10.9 nM, table
S3) and a very weak cross reactivity to SARS-CoV-1 (K​d ≈ 55 µM, figure 2F, table S2
and methods). We believe that the low binding affinity observed is likely due to the low
stability of its folded state (ΔG​NI​~ -2.7 kcal mol​-1​, T​m​~ 75.3 °C, figure 1F and 2C-E). ​In
contrast, the experimentally stability-optimized de novo decoy CTC-445.2 is
predominantly monomeric (figure 1H and S7), thermodynamically hyperstable (ΔG​NI​~
-5.0 kcal mol​-1​, T​m ~ 93 ℃, figure 2C-D), exhibits low nanomolar affinity for the RBD of
SARS-CoV-2 (K​d ​~ 21.0 nM, see table S3), and has improved cross-reactivity to
SARS-CoV-1 (K​d ~ 7.1 µM, table S2 and figure 2F). CTC-445.2 is capable of
outcompeting hACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD at low nanomolar concentrations
(IC​50 ~ 10.4 nM, figure 1I). Single-site s​aturation mutagenesis (SSM) ​(​28​, ​29​) of the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding interface showed that the effects of mutations in the binding
of hACE2 are closely recapitulated by CTC-445.2 (see figure S14). ​The bivalent de
novo protein decoy CTC-445.2d is our top optimized variant due to its remarkable
binding and neutralizing potency, albeit it has a slightly less stable native state than its
parent (ΔG​NI ~ -4.5, T​m ~ 71.7 ℃; figure 2C-D) highlighting perhaps the advantage of
starting with a very stable molecule before attempting a domain duplication to augment
binding potency. The increased avidity of CTC-445.2d confers a ~10-fold improvement
in binding affinity of the de novo decoy for both SARS-CoV-2 RBD (K​d ~ 3.5 nM, table
S2) and SARS-CoV-1 RBD (K​d ~ 587 nM, table S2 and figure S9), as well as a similar
increase in its ability to outcompete hACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (IC​50 ~ 0.7
nM, figure 1I).
Functional characterization of CTC-445.2 and CTC-445.2d. T​he strong binding of our
optimized ​de novo protein decoys to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD translated into effective and
specific ​in vitro neutralization of viral cell infection (figure 3). The presence of the ​de
novo decoys showed no impact on mammalian cell viability. Co-incubation of hACE2
with the decoys had no impact on the enzymatic activity of hACE2 (figure 3E)​. Both of

the ​de novo hACE2 decoys were able to fully neutralize viral infection in three different
in vitro systems (figure 3A-C). Briefly, in a VSV pseudovirus system expressing the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the ​de novo decoys specifically protected HEK 293T cells
overexpressing hACE2 from infection (figure 3A and figure S11). Our ​de novo protein
decoys also prevented infection by SARS-CoV-2 expressing the nanoLuc reporter
(SARS-CoV-2 nanoLuc, see methods) in the lung epithelial cell line Calu-3, which
expresses both ACE2 and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), known to
augment the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 ​(​30​, ​31​) (figure 3B; EC​50 < 5 nM at MOI=1.0). To
confirm the mechanism of inhibition (i.e. extracellular neutralization of the virus) by
CTC-445.2 and CTC-445.2d, a time-of-addition assay was performed in Vero E6 cells.
Briefly, CTC-445.2 or CTC-445.2d were added either during the full course of infection
(i.e. co-incubated with the virus and in the cell media), before infection (i.e. only
co-incubated with the virus), or after infection (i.e. only in the cell media). As expected,
CTC-445.2 and CTC-445.2d were most effective when continuously present throughout
the full course of infection (figure 3C and S12). To define the activity of CTC-445.2d as
a locally delivered therapeutic to possibly protect the airway from infection, we delivered
a high dose (100 µg) of CTC-445.2d to Balb/c mice via inhalation of intranasal droplets.
We observed persistence of fully functional CTC-445.2d in the lungs for more than 24
hours (figure 3D). We also detected CTC-445.2d in blood, raising the possibility that
inhaled therapy might lead to some level of systemic exposure.
Conclusions: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a global health threat has highlighted
the need for the rapid development of novel countermeasures. Soluble “decoy” proteins
are orthogonal to traditional therapeutic approaches such as vaccination, neutralizing
antibodies, or small molecule inhibitors, and might have the potential to better overcome
the problem of mutational viral evasion. Utilizing natural proteins as therapeutics often
presents a number of significant challenges, such as poor stability that can complicate
manufacturing, transport and storage, side effects that can arise from residual/unwanted
biological activity, and the fact that human proteins repurposed as therapeutics pose the
risk of eliciting an autoimmune response with possibly lifelong consequences ​(​32​–​41)​ ​.
Designed ​de novo protein decoys offer an avenue to overcome these challenges.
B​ecause CTC-445.2d differs in sequence and structure from any natural protein, it
reduces the potential risk of eliciting an autoimmune reaction. The optimized ​de novo
protein decoys are easy to manufacture in traditional bacterial systems, and their
thermodynamic hyperstability and full thermal reversibility make them ideal candidates
for transport, storage, and local delivery. Also, due to their remarkable thermodynamic
stability, there is further potential to fine tune de novo protein decoys ​(​42​)​. For example,
we have shown that ​by simply increasing the avidity of CTC-445.2 it is possible to
greatly augment its potency. As well, we demonstrate that it is also possible to further
increase stability while preserving the function of the de novo decoy (​figure S13​)​. This
tunability could be difficult to achieve with a natural protein such as hACE2, which is

much larger (~90 kDa) and has significantly lower stability (figure S8)​. ​The protein
surface that CTC-445 (and its optimized variants) present to ​SARS-CoV-2 is designed
to be virtually identical to the natural binding surface that the virus targets in hACE2.
Therefore, mutations in the RBD that affect binding to our de novo decoy are likely to
have a similar effect on the virus' binding to hACE2, effectively making the decoys
functionally resilient to mutational escape (figure S10 and S14). Our principle is also
exemplified by the cross reactivity of our de novo decoys with SARS-CoV-1 despite (at
least) 17 mutations that separate their binding interfaces (figure S9), including a drastic
loop remodeling in the RBD’s ridge region ​(​43)​ ​.
We have laid the groundwork for a generalized strategy that has the potential to quickly
address emerging biological threats. Our strategy is novel, precise, and fast.
CTC-445.2d is, to our knowledge, the first reported example of a ​de novo protein
therapeutic that has been conceptualized, engineered, and validated in less than ten
weeks, matching the rapid speed with which the SARS-CoV-2 threat has emerged.
Moreover, further speed and accuracy improvements to our strategy are theoretically
possible (figure 1G). We envision that future embodiments of our ​de novo protein
design paradigm will be generally useful for the rapid development of therapeutic
decoys to treat disease, not only for viral agents, but for any case where interrupting
protein-protein interactions could be beneficial. Combined prowess in structural biology
and ​de novo protein design are quickly bringing us to the point where therapeutic
molecules can be engineered on demand.

Figure legends:

Figure 1. Design and characterization of de novo ACE2 decoys. A) ACE2 (gray) and its binding motifs (H1 19-52, orange; H2
55-84, green; EE3 346-360, blue) to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (pink). Three starting structures were simultaneously used as the target (see
main text), 6VW1 is shown; ​B) Strategies for supporting the binding motifs. ​De novo secondary structure elements (magenta) were
computationally generated to stabilize H1, H2, and EE3. Seven combinations of secondary structure elements were considered.
Circles indicate α-helices, triangles indicate 𝛽-sheets; filled circles are helices oriented forward and empty circles are the opposite.
We used Rosetta to generate fully connected backbones (“protein_mimic_designer” algorithm) and amino acid sequences predicted
to fold into the target structure. In all cases, the binding interface of ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was preserved intact (see
methods); ​C) Automatic computational filtering based on 8 metrics to select the best candidates. In addition, the RMSD of the
binding motifs to ACE2 was also used as a quality check. The dots indicate the mean computational score for each design scored
against the three target RBD structures. Designs selected for experimental testing are shown in black. Our best design, CTC-445, is
shown in red. The blue boxes indicate the filtering thresholds (see methods); ​D) Designs that passed filtering were subjected to
biased forward folding simulations (see methods), here shown for CTC-445, including the unsalted biased simulation (brown), the
native-salted (orange), and relaxation (blue). E) The top 196 designs were selected for yeast display screening using a combination
of Rosetta score per residue, ddG, and the folding simulations (see methods); The designs were individually assessed for specific
binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (Fc fusion, 200 nM). The plot for CTC-445 is shown. ​F) CTC-445 was recombinantly expressed
and purified by affinity chromatography (see methods). Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for CTC-445 revealed the
presence of oligomeric species; G) CTC-445 was optimized by directed evolution and rational combination of the observed favorable
mutations, leading to ​H) CTC-445.2 (SEC) which is mainly monomeric in solution and ~1000x more potent to compete ACE2 than its
parent (see “G”); we further optimized the potency of our molecule by generating a bivalent version named CTC-445.2d; ​I) Potency
of designs to outcompete binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, as measured by competition ELISA assays using a constant
concentration of 0.4 nM ACE2. J) Timeline of the de novo protein design and optimization pipeline. Timewise, a green color
indicates phases that we believe were carried out optimally, red can potentially be avoided in future efforts, and yellow are phases
that can potentially be expedited by using more advanced/automated methods for gene synthesis, cloning and high-throughput
screening.

Figure 2. Binding, stability and structure of the de novo protein decoys CTC-445, CTC-445.2 and CTC-445.2d. A)
Computational models of CTC-445.2. Left, comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 binding interface surface of CTC-445.2 (top) and hACE2
(bottom). CTC-445.2 is designed to present the same binding interface as the one that SARS-CoV-2 targets in hACE2, down to the
level of individual interactions. Residues from the binding motifs: H1 are shown in shades of orange, residues from H2 in shades of
green and residues from EE3 in shades of blue. The boxes show detailed structural comparison of the interfaces between
CTC-445.2 and hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The relaxed complex of hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (dark and light gray,
respectively; PDB: 6M17) are aligned to the model of the relaxed compex of CTC-445.2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (pink). Hydrogen
bond interactions are indicated by black dashed lines; ​B) Design models of CTC-445, CTC-445.2 and CTC-445.2d. CTC-445.2
contains 5 mutations that were guided by directed evolution experiments. CTC-445.2d is a bivalent variant composed of two
CTC-445.2 subunits linked by a 17-mer flexible GS linker (sequence -GGGGSGGSGSGGSGGGS-); ​C) Circular dichroism of
recombinantly expressed CTC-445 (red), CTC-445.2 (blue) and CTC-445.2d (orange). Thermally-induced meltings of the decoys
were followed by its circular dichroism signal at 208 nm (heating rate 2°C/min). The inset shows far UV wavelength spectra at 20 °C
(purple), after heating to ~95 °C (brown) and after cooling the heated sample to 20 °C (green dashed). Complete ellipticity-spectra
recovery (full reversibility) upon cooling was observed in all cases. Calculated T​m values for CTC-445, CTC-445.2 and 445.2d are
75.3 ± 0.2 °C, ≈93 °C and 71.7.± 0.2 °C; D) Chemical denaturation of CTC-445, CTC-445.2 and CTC-445.2d by incubation with
guanidine hydrochloride (0-6 M). Calculated values of ΔG​ND, ΔG​NI and ΔG​ID were -9.8 ± 0.8, -2.7 ± 1.1 and -7.1 ± 0.7 kcal mol​-1 for
CTC-445, -14.6 ± 2.0, -5.0 ± 2.8 and -9.6 ± 2.0 kcal mol​-1 for CTC-445.2, and -19.0 ± 1.7, -4.4 ± 2.3 and -14.6 ± 1.6 kcal mol​-1 for
CTC-445.2d; ​E) Thermal recovery of CTC-445, CTC-445.2 and CTC-445.2d. Similar values of BCM were observed before and after
repeated cycles of heating and cooling for the three proteins; F) Octet binding assays of CTC-445, CTC-445.2 (left) and CTC-445.2d
(right) against immobilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD (top) and SARS-CoV-1 RBD (bottom). The RBD was immobilized to Anti-Penta-HIS
(HIS1K, ForteBio) and incubated with varying concentrations of ACE2 decoys. Binding kinetics were monitored by dipping the
biosensors in wells containing defined concentrations (4.7-300 nM for binding to SARS-CoV-2 and 30-2500 nM for binding to
SARS-CoV-1) of CTC-445, CTC-445.2, CTC-445.2d (association) and then dipping the sensors back into baseline wells
(dissociation). Data traces shown are a 2 s (10 data point) rolling average. Data for CTC-445 was fit to 1:1 model. For CTC-445 and
CTC-445.2, the results were globally fit using a 1:1 binding model (K​d​=646 and 30 nM, k​on​=8.6 x 10​4 and 3.9 x 10​5 M​-1​s​-1​, k​off =5.5 x
10​-2 and 1.2 x 10​-2 s​-1​) and . For CTC-445.2d, the results were globally fit using a 2:1 binding model (K​d ≤7.0 nM, k​on​=3.0 x 10​5 M​-1​s​-1​,
koff​≤2.0 x 10-3 s-1).

Figure 3. In vitro virus neutralization by CTC-445.2 and CTC-445.2d. CTC-445.2 (blue) and CTC-445.2d (orange) are shown. A)
SARS-CoV-2/VSV-Luc pseudovirus assay. Neutralization assays (left) were performed using a non-replicative VSV pseudovirus
carrying a luciferase reporter gene and expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 on its surface. Viral neutralization was
performed on HEK 293T cells overexpressing ACE2. The de novo decoys were pre-incubated with pseudovirus prior to incubation
with cells. Samples were tested in duplicate utilizing 3-fold serial dilutions started at 20 μM (CTC-445.2) or 10 μM (CTC-445.2d). A
cell viability assay (right) confirmed that the decoys are not cytotoxic to HEK 293T. We used an analogous pseudovirus expressing
an unrelated RBD to confirm that their neutralizing activity of the de novo decoys is specific (figure S11); ​B) (left) Neutralization of
NanoLuc SARS-CoV-2 by CTC-445 and CTC-445.2 in Calu-3 cells after a 72 h incubation; (right) A cell viability assay (48 h)
confirmed that the decoys are not cytotoxic to Calu-3; C) Neutralization of live BetaCoV/Hong Kong/VM20001061/2020
SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells. The cells were incubated with virus at both MOI 1.0 and MOI 0.01 throughout infection
(pre-incubated with virus, during infection, and post infection) (upper left), post-infection (upper right) and pre-infection only (lower
left). Cell viability in Vero E6 cells (lower right) was independently performed (CCK8 assay) and confirmed that the de novo decoys
are not cytotoxic. SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. All assays were performed
in triplicate unless otherwise noted; ​D) Bioavailability of CTC-445.2d in mice lung (top) and plasma (bottom) after intranasal
administration (see methods); ​E) ACE2 functional activity as measured by enzymatic release of a free fluorophore from
Mca-APK(DNP) substrate. The de novo decoys didn’t affect ACE2 function. DX600 was used as positive control (see methods).
