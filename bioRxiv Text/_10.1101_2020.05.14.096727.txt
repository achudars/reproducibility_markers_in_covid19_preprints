SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary abnormalities in macaques
44

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an

45

exponentially increasing number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) cases

46

globally. Prioritization of medical countermeasures for evaluation in randomized

47

clinical trials is critically hindered by the lack of COVID-19 animal models that

48

enable accurate, quantifiable, and reproducible measurement of COVID-19

49

pulmonary disease free from observer bias. We first used serial computed

50

tomography (CT) to demonstrate that bilateral intrabronchial instillation of SARS-

51

CoV-2 into crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) results in mild-to-moderate

52

lung abnormalities qualitatively characteristic of subclinical or mild-to-moderate

53

COVID-19 (e.g., ground-glass opacities with or without reticulation, paving, or

54

alveolar consolidation, peri-bronchial thickening, linear opacities) at typical

55

locations (peripheral>central, posterior and dependent, bilateral, multi-lobar). We

56

then used positron emission tomography (PET) analysis to demonstrate increased

57

FDG uptake in the CT-defined lung abnormalities and regional lymph nodes.

58

PET/CT imaging findings appeared in all macaques as early as 2 days post-

59

exposure, variably progressed, and subsequently resolved by 6–12 days post-

60

exposure. Finally, we applied operator-independent, semi-automatic quantification

61

of the volume and radiodensity of CT abnormalities as a possible primary endpoint

62

for immediate and objective efficacy testing of candidate medical countermeasures.

SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary abnormalities in macaques
67

population, causing more than 4.2 million infections and almost 300,000 deaths globally

68

by May 14, 2020 (4). Infections result in a wide spectrum of disease ranging from

69

asymptomatic to mild upper respiratory illness to severe pneumonia that can progress to

70

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death despite aggressive supportive care

71

(5). After a short but variable incubation period, most patients with COVID-19 develop

72

self-limiting fever, cough, nonspecific fatigue, and myalgia (6-11). Some patients

73

develop non-productive cough and dyspnea related to lower respiratory tract

74

involvement; particularly in patients of older age or with co-morbidities, this involvement

75

can lead to severe, progressive disease and unfavorable outcomes (5). Well-documented

76

characteristic lung CT findings in humans include ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with or

77

without reticulation, reticulonodular opacities, inter- or intralobular septal paving, or

78

consolidation in a bilateral, lobar to sub-segmental, and peripheral distribution (6-8, 12).

79

Notably, GGOs have been described in patients who are shedding SARS-CoV-2 but do

80

not present with clinical signs (13, 14). Bilateral diffuse alveolar damage, type II

81

pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial fibrosis and inflammation, hemorrhage, and edema

82

with syncytia appear to be typical lung histopathological findings seen in a limited human

83

data set that also suggests a high rate of venous thromboembolism (15-19).

84

Currently available rodent/carnivore/tree shrew (20-24) and nonhuman primate

85

(NHP) (11, 25-29) models of SARS-CoV-2 infection do not accurately reflect severe

86

human COVID-19. NHPs, considered an evolutionary proximate for human disease

87

modeling, develop no or only mild clinical disease signs (11, 26-29). In SARS-CoV-2-

88

infected rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), quantifiable virus shedding, virus-specific

89

immune responses, and limited histopathologic lesions have been observed (11, 25, 27Finch et al. 4

29). However, in both human disease and animal models, the temporal and mechanistic

91

relationship between viral replication, subsequent immunopathology (30, 31), and clinical

92

disease remains uncertain. Furthermore, in the available NHP models, all of which are

93

sublethal, markers of clinical disease (cage-side scoring, chest X-ray) have been of

94

limited sensitivity. More concerningly, both metrics are subject to observer bias (32-35).

95

Reliable animal models needed for rapid development and evaluation of candidate

96

medical countermeasures (MCMs) require an unbiased reproducible and quantifiable

97

metric of disease that mirrors key aspects of COVID-19. Based on the rather limited X-

98

ray findings in the lungs of reported NHP models of SARS-CoV-2 infection with either

99

mild or no clinical signs (11, 25, 27-29), we turned to high-resolution chest CT and

100

PET/CT to characterize lung abnormalities in infected NHPs toward longitudinal

101

quantitative comparison.

102

We used direct bilateral primary intrabronchial instillation in a 1-day-apart

103

staggered design to expose two groups of three crab-eating macaques (Macaca

104

fascicularis) to medium (mock group macaques M1–3) or medium including 3.65x106

105

pfu/macaque of SARS-CoV-2 (virus group macaques V1–3) (Supplementary Table 1).

106

All macaques were observed daily for 11 days prior to exposure (day [D] 0) and for 30

107

days post-exposure. Physical examination scores and blood, conjunctival,

108

nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, rectal, fecal, and urine specimens were collected at

109

identical timepoints. Virus-exposed macaques were indistinguishable from mock group

110

macaques during the pre-exposure time period. Two pre-exposure chest CT and whole-

111

body 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET/CTs and eight post-exposure CTs and

112

three post-exposure PETs were performed at identical timepoints (Figure 1). In line with

SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary abnormalities in macaques
113

previously published results (11, 25-29), none of the macaques developed any major

114

clinical abnormalities (including by cage-side assessment and clinical scoring or physical

115

examination) throughout the study and clinical laboratory results were not significantly

116

different between the mock-exposed and virus-exposed groups (Supplementary Tables

117

2–3). SARS-CoV-2 RNA could not be detected by RT-qPCR in any sample from mock-

118

exposed macaques but was variably present during the early days post-exposure in

119

conjunctival, fecal, nasopharyngeal, oral, and rectal swabs, but never in plasma or urine

120

(Figure 2a). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were not detectable by ELISA in mock-

121

exposed macaques but were detectable at D10 post-exposure and continued to rise in all

122

virus-exposed macaques to at least D19 (Figure 2b). Consistent with ELISA results,

123

fluorescent neutralization titers generated from sera were undetected until D10 and were

124

detected only in virus-exposed macaques (Figure 2c). Longitudinal measurement of

125

selected peripheral cytokines revealed between- and within-group differences with

126

marked abnormalities noted in macaque V3, which also had the highest IgG antibody

127

titers (Supplementary Figure 1).

128

With the exception of minor and transient abnormalities on baseline imaging, CT

129

scans of all mock-exposed macaques appeared generally normal over the entire study

130

period (Supplementary Figure 2). However, all virus group macaques developed lung

131

abnormalities clearly visible by chest CT as early as D2. Qualitatively, the distribution

132

morphology, and duration of abnormalities described a spectrum similar to mild-

133

moderately ill humans with COVID-19. Characteristic CT findings in all virus group

macaques included bilateral peripheral GGOs variably in association with intra- or

opacities, peri-bronchial thickening, subpleural nodules, and, in one macaque, dense

137

alveolar consolidation with air bronchograms (Figures 3–4a, Videos 1–3,

138

Supplementary Figure 3). Longitudinal serial CT scans showed heterogeneity in the

139

duration and evolution of these abnormalities over the next week from rapid

140

improvement within a few days (macaque V1) to persistence and progression (macaques

141

V2, V3) (Figure 4a, Supplementary Figure 3). Nonetheless, by D19, chest CT

142

universally showed complete or nearly complete resolution of lung abnormalities in all

143

virus group macaques. Individual and per-group average radiologist-derived CT scores

144

(adapted from a scoring system generated from human COVID-19 CT images)

145

demonstrate the extent and duration of these qualitative findings (Figure 5).

146

Increased FDG uptake detected by PET (Figure 6, Supplementary Figures 4–5)

147

corresponded well to the structural changes in the lungs observed by CT, and regional

148

lymph node uptake was seen in all virus group macaques at D2. In macaque V1, FDG

149

uptake decreased in the lungs at D6 but increased in mediastinal lymph nodes, and new

150

FDG uptake was identified in the spleen. The two macaques (V2, V3) with persistent or

151

progressive structural abnormalities on chest CT had variable changes in FDG uptake

152

associated with the structural abnormalities in the lungs (some markedly increased, some

153

improved) with an accompanying marked increase in FDG uptake in regional lymph

154

nodes and spleens on D6. PET scan on D12 revealed normalization of previous areas of

155

increased FDG uptake in the lung parenchyma in all three virus-exposed macaques, and

156

persistent increased FDG update in regional lymph nodes and spleen. Mock-exposed

157

macaques did not have similar increased FDG uptake with the exception of transient

158

increased uptake in regional lymph nodes after mock-exposure in a single macaque (M1).

SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary abnormalities in macaques
159

Quantification of the SUVmax in selected regions of interest (ROI) in the lung, specific

160

regional lymph nodes, and spleen mapped well to the qualitative findings in both mock-

161

exposed and virus-exposed macaques (Figure 7).

162

CT images can be used for quantification of lung abnormalities using measures of

163

volume or radiodensity, i.e., total lung volume (LV); average radiodensity in the total

164

lung volume (LD); hyperdense volume (HV), a volume of lung in which radiodensity

165

(Hounsfield units, HU) is above a pre-defined threshold; and average radiodensity in the

166

hyperdense volume (hyperdensity, HD). Normalized changes from a pre-exposure

167

baseline can be longitudinally measured as the percent change in the volume of lung

168

hyperdensity (PCLH). Toward standardization across lung volumes, PCLH can be also be

169

expressed as a percent of total lung volume (PCLH/LV). Increases in PCLH or PCLH/LV

170

were not seen in the mock-exposed macaques over the entire study (Figure 8a–d,

171

Supplementary Figure 2). However, post-exposure increases in PCLH or PCLH/LV

172

were noted in all virus group macaques starting at D2, notably with heterogeneity in both

173

the peak and duration of PCLH and PCLH/LV that corresponded well to longitudinal

174

qualitative chest CT observations in individual virus group macaques (Figure 4b, Figure

175

8a–d, Supplementary Figure 2). Though both measures captured similar differences

176

between groups, the within-group variability was unsurprisingly less with PCLH/LV

177

versus PCLH. The virus group had significantly higher cumulative PCLH/LV over days

178

0–30 as summarized by the area under the curve (AUC0–30; p=0.01). The AUC0–8 for days

179

0–8 showed a similar trend (p=0.06), as did the AUC0–8 and AUC0–30 for the PCLH

180

(p=0.06 and p=0.03, respectively).

SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary abnormalities in macaques
181

A comparison of PCLH or PCLH/LV (Figure 8a–d) and absolute radiodensity

182

(change in HD, change in LD) (Figure 8e–h) highlights similarities and differences

183

windowed by these readouts that are particularly apparent as the CT abnormalities

184

evolved in macaque V3. In this macaque, dense consolidation in the left lung reached

185

peak radiodensity at D6, subsequently evolving toward a larger volume of less dense

186

mixed consolidation and GGO at D8 (Figure 4a). This progression of findings is

187

captured as an increase in PCLH (Figure 8a) and PCLH/LV (Figure 8c) from D6–8, but

188

a sharp decline in HD (Figure 8e) over the same period.

189

Quantifiable changes in CT lung abnormalities, e.g., AUC of the PCLH/LV curve

190

in an appropriately powered macaque study, could be used to objectively evaluate

191

efficacy of candidate MCMs, including vaccines and therapeutics. Although the

192

described crab-eating macaque model windows only mild to moderate radiographic

193

disease, it captures heterogeneity in both severity and duration of disease; the readout can

194

be similarly applied to any larger animal model of increased severity should they become

195

available in the future. These objective measurements add to semi-quantitative scoring,

196

which is potentially subject to observer bias in experimental settings (36-39); in our

197

study, semi-quantitative findings include radiologist-derived CT lung scores (Figure 5)

198

or mean SUVmax measured in operator-selected regions of interest (ROIs) on PET/CT

199

scans (Figure 7).

200

Of interest, the disease heterogeneity captured by our imaging readouts is

201

mirrored to some degree in thus-far limited measures of innate or adaptive immunity,

202

namely in ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers and in longitudinal measurements of

203

peripheral cytokines. Conclusions cannot be meaningfully drawn from the small numbers

SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary abnormalities in macaques

of measurements taken from only three macaques; nonetheless, between- and within-

205

group differences in cytokines that have been identified as biomarkers of disease, disease

206

severity, and disease outcome in humans (30, 40-44) are observed. Most notable in this

207

regard is a remarkable concentration increase of cytokines associated with cytokine

208

release syndrome (aka “cytokine storm”), such as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8

209

(CXCL8), interleukin (IL) 6, IL13, IL15, IL1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), and tumor

210

necrosis factor (TNF), starting around D6 in the macaque (V3) with the most significant

211

CT and PET/CT abnormalities.

212

A key advantage of quantifiable CT chest imaging readout over serial euthanasia

213

studies, in addition to potentially reduced experimental animal numbers, is the ability not

214

only to evaluate between-group differences, but also to compare severity and duration of

215

disease at higher resolution in single animals and even in isolated parenchymal areas

216

sequentially. This approach can reduce the error inherent in cross-sectional sampling of

217

individual animals at single timepoints. Imaging does, however, introduce its own

218

experimental complexities and limitations. As we aimed to evaluate whether PCLH (or

219

other CT imaging readouts presented in Figure 8) could be a useful quantitative readout

220

for radiographic progression in the SARS-CoV-2 infected lung, we chose not to include

221

irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in the mock inoculum to avoid antigen-induced

222

inflammation and related radiographic changes. For similar reasons, and to avoid

223

artificial dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, we specifically did not perform bronchoalveolar

224

lavage (BAL) to obtain lung samples for downstream cellular, molecular, and virologic

225

analysis (45, 46) and did not perform lung biopsies. The frequency of anesthesia and

226

instrument availability pragmatically limit imaging to carefully chosen timepoints during

227

a study. In particular, the extended time required to perform PET imaging resulted in

228

logistical limitations of the number of macaques that could be included in the study.

229

Finally, with complete resolution of radiographic abnormalities by the end of the study

230

period, we opted not to euthanize these macaques to be able to perform a re-exposure

231

study in the future. Thus, we cannot correlate radiographic with histopathologic findings.

232

Future studies should extend our initial findings in several directions. First,

233

follow-up confirmation of these pilot results in this model of mild-moderate COVID-19

234

is needed to further establish quantifiable lung CT as a reliable disease readout and to

235

forge imaging-pathologic correlates in macaques euthanized at peak radiographic

236

abnormality. Confirmation should enable proof-of-concept evaluation of whether a

237

candidate MCM will indeed significantly decrease peak or AUC of PCLH or PCLH/LV

238

compared to untreated infected control macaques. Data from additional macaques will be

239

used to confirm the sensitivity and relevance of the AUC0–8 and AUC0–30 for PCLH or

240

PCLH/LV as robust measures of lung changes from CT evaluation.

241

In parallel, disease severity could possibly be increased in the crab-eating

242

macaque model by optimizing delivery of SARS-CoV-2 to the most vulnerable lung (via

243

aerosol or more distal bronchoscopic delivery), with the ultimate goal of using the CT-

244

quantifiable volume or radiodensity readouts to model the sick hospitalized human.

245

Other groups are already evaluating NHPs of diverse species as possible COVID-

246

19 models. In these models, serial chest CT imaging after intrabronchial instillation of

247

SARS-CoV-2 could be used to establish a meaningful and quantifiable COVID-19-like

248

disease readout that will enable objective evaluation of medical countermeasures and also

249

a comparison of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung abnormalities in different NHP models.

Animals

284

Six crab-eating (aka cynomolgus) macaques (Macaca fascicularis Raffles, 1821) of both

285

sexes, 4–4.5 years old and weighing 3.17–4.62 kg (Supplementary Table 1), were

286

obtained from Cambodia via Envigo Captive (Hayward, CA, USA) and housed at the US

287

National Institutes of Health Animal Center (NIHAC; Dickerson, MD, USA) for 3

288

months. All female macaques were on depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (administered

289

intramuscularly, 150 mg/ml) while at NIHAC for several months. The last dose

290

administered was administered approximately one month prior to study start. The

291

macaques were subsequently moved into the maximum (biosafety level 4 [BSL-4])

292

containment laboratory at the IRF-Frederick, a facility accredited by the Association for

293

Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC).

297

multiple times for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Once in containment, the

298

macaques passed physical exams and routine bloodwork and were confirmed appropriate

299

for study assignment by IRF-Frederick veterinarians. Experimental procedures for this

300

study (protocol “SARS-CoV-2-NHP-064E-1”) were approved by the National Institute of

301

Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Clinical Research (DCR), Animal

302

Care and Use Committee (ACUC), and were in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act

303

regulations, Public Health Service policy, and the Guide for the Care and Use of

304

Laboratory Animals 8th Ed. recommendations. The macaques were singly housed during

305

the 2-week acclimatization to the maximum containment laboratory and the course of the

306

study, and were provided with appropriate enrichment including, but not limited to,

307

polished steel mirrors, durable toys, and food enrichment. Macaques were anesthetized in

308

accordance with maximum containment standard operating procedures prior to all

309

macaque manipulations, including virus exposure, sample collection, and medical

310

imaging. Macaques were observed following anesthesia to ensure complete recovery. All

311

work with NHPs was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the

same way with each 2-ml instillate containing 9.13x105 pfu/ml (i.e., a total exposure dose

320

of 3.65x106 pfu) of SARS-CoV-2 followed by 1-ml saline flush and then 5 ml air. All

321

macaques were sedated prior to instillation. Prior to administering anesthesia,

322

glycopyrrolate (0.06 mg/kg) was delivered intramuscularly to reduce saliva secretions.

323

Next, each macaque received 10 mg/kg ketamine and then 35 μg/kg dexmedetomidine

324

intramuscularly. To reverse anesthesia, 0.15 mg/kg atipamezole was administered

325

intravenously. All macaques were evaluated daily for health and were periodically

326

examined physically, including blood draws, and conjunctival (left and right),

327

nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swab collection. Stool and urine were also

328

collected on each day swabs were collected. All swabs were collected in 1-ml universal

329

virus transport (UVT) media (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Macaque scoring

332

Cage-side assessment scoring criteria (Supplementary Table 4) were modified from

333

Chertow et al. (2016) to include clinical signs relevant to COVID-19 and respiratory rates

334

of crab-eating macaques (9, 50, 51). In addition to cage-side observations, physical exam

335

scoring criteria were implemented to assess clinical conditions on days when macaques

336

were anesthetized (Supplementary Table 4). Cage-side and physical exam scoring

337

criteria were developed in collaboration with National Primate Research Centers

338

(NPRCs) to standardize disease assessment and compare disease outcomes between NHP

339

models. Heart rate was not incorporated into the physical exam scores until D2 because

340

heart rate score was determined as beats per minute over baseline. Baseline heart rate was

341

determined as an average over three timepoints, D-11, D-5/D-6, and D0 (except for

Clinical analysis

346

Blood samples were collected in Greiner Bio-One Hematology K3EDTA Evacuated

347

Tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Complete blood counts, including leukocyte

348

differentials and reticulocyte counts (CBC/Diff/Retic), were determined using the Procyte

349

DX (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA). The Catalyst One analyzer (IDEXX

350

Laboratories) was used for biochemical analyses of serum samples, which were collected

351

in Greiner Bio-One VACUETTE Z Serum Sep Clot Activator Tubes (Thermo Fisher

352

Scientific). Samples were run on both machines the day of collection shortly following

353

collection such that they were not stored prior to analysis. On D30, an equipment issue

354

with the Procyte DX required that samples from the virus-exposed group be stored at 4°C

355

for about 30 h prior to analysis. For a list of all measured parameters and their values, see

Image acquisition

359

Following sample collection and intubation, macaques were moved to chest computed

360

tomography (CT) or whole-body positron emission tomography combined with CT

361

(PET/CT) imaging. For imaging procedures, each macaque was anesthetized

362

intramuscularly with 15 mg/kg ketamine following 0.06 mg/kg glycopyrrolate

363

intramuscularly. Anesthesia was maintained using a constant rate intravenous infusion of

364

propofol at 0.3 mg/kg/min (except on D-11 when propofol at 0.2 mg/kg/min was used).

Macaques were placed on the scanner’s bed in a supine, head-out/feet-in position and

366

connected to a ventilator to facilitate breath holds, and vital signs were monitored

367

throughout the imaging process.

368

High resolution chest CT

369

Chest CT scans were performed using the 16-slice CT component of a Gemini TF 16

370

PET/CT (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH, USA) or a Precedence SPECT/CT scanner

371

(Philips Healthcare). Chest CT images were acquired in helical scan mode with the

372

following parameter settings: ultra-high resolution, 140 kVp, 300 mAs/slice, 1 mm

373

thickness, 0.5 mm increment, 0.688 mm pitch, collimation 16x0.75, and 0.75 s rotation.

374

CT image reconstruction used a 512x512 matrix size for a 250-mm transverse field-of-

375

view (FOV), leading to a pixel size of 0.488 mm. Two CT images were produced: one

376

with the standard “B” filter and one with the bone-enhanced “D” filter. No contrast agent

377

was administered. Each macaque underwent a 15–20-s breath-hold during acquisition.

378

The pressure for the breath-hold was maintained at 150 mmH2O.

379

Whole-body PET/CT

380

Whole-body PET/CT scans were performed using a Gemini TF 16 TF PET/CT scanner.

381

Radiotracer (2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose; FDG) was injected intravenously (0.5

382

mCi/kg FDG, up to 4.0 mCi/scan) and the time of injection was recorded. After high-

383

resolution chest CT imaging with breath-hold session (≈5 min), whole-body CT images

384

were acquired (≈5 min) in helical scan mode with the following parameter settings: high

385

resolution, 140 kVp, 250 mAs/slice, 3 mm thickness, 1.5 mm increment, 0.688 mm pitch,

(FOV), resulting in a pixel size of 1.17 mm and a slice spacing of 1.5 mm. This CT image

389

was used to create an attenuation map needed to correct the PET images for photon

390

attenuation. Raw CT data were reconstructed a second time into diagnostic quality CT

391

images by reducing the FOV size to 250 mm, resulting in a pixel size of 0.488 mm with 1

392

mm slice thickness. One CT image was produced with the standard (“B”) filter. No

393

contrast agent was administered, and the macaques breathed freely during the scan.

394

Following whole-body CT scanning, whole-body PET scans covering the macaques’

395

bodies from the top of the head to the middle of the thighs was performed after a 60-min

396

delay. Depending on the size of the NHP, 6 or 7 bed positions (with 50% overlap) were

397

needed for this scan range. Dwell time per bed position was 3 min, resulting in a total

398

duration of 18 or 21 min/scan. PET data were reconstructed into a set of either 300- or

399

342-image slices with 128x128 2-mm-cubic voxels. To ensure quantitative accuracy, all

400

reconstructed PET images were corrected during scans for radioactive decay, uniformity,

401

random coincidences, and attenuation and scattering of PET radiation in situ. Lastly,

402

whole-body CT imaging with iopamidol (600 mg iodine/kg) intravenous contrast material

403

were acquired at D-11 and the terminal D30 scans. Each macaque underwent a 30–50-s

404

breath-hold during acquisition. The pressure for the breath-hold was maintained as 150

mmH2O. After completion of imaging, macaques were returned to the clinical team for

406

subsequent procedures.

SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary abnormalities in macaques
410

An adapted semi-quantitative scoring system based on a previously published method

411

(52) was used to quantitatively estimate the pulmonary involvement of lung

412

abnormalities on the extent of parenchymal lung disease in each lung lobe. The sums of

413

the lobar scores were used to generate total lung summary scores. CT scores ranged from

414

0–5 for each lobe (right upper, right middle, right lower, right accessory, left upper, left

415

middle, and left lower). Lobes were scored as: 0 = no disease involvement, 1 ≤5%, 2 = 5–

416

24%, 3 = 25–49%, 4 = 50–74%, 5 ≥75%, with a maximum total lung score of 35. Score

417

increments of 0.5 were used to indicate improvement (or worsening) in radiodensity

418

when changes in volume were insufficient to change score category. Additional data

419

points included cohort (macaques M1–3 and V1–3), scan date and study day, and number

420

of “lesions”. Types of infiltrates (GGOs, paving, consolidation, and organizing

421

pneumonia) per lobe were given individual 0–5 scores, and the overall predominant type

422

of infiltrate per each lobe and each subject scan were recorded. The summary scores per

423

each lobe and whole lung were used as markers of disease progression. Image analysis

424

was performed by a board-certified radiologist and a research fellow using MIM software

425

version 6.9 (Cleveland, OH, USA).

426

To quantify CT data, the lung field was segmented using a region-growing

427

implementation (MIM software). Entire lung volumes (LV) were measured at each time

428

point (n: at time point n; b: at baseline). A histogram analysis was performed on the voxel

429

intensities (radiodensity in Hounsfield units [HU]) within the segmented lung. Percent

430

change in the volume of hyperdense lung tissue was determined as described previously

431

(53). Briefly a threshold value was determined for each subject, based on a 5% cutoff in

432

the upper tail of the histogram of lung tissue from the baseline CT scan. Due to an

inability to keep the lungs of the virus group macaques inflated to approximately the

434

same volumes over time, a correction was applied to the 5% PCLH threshold as

435

previously described (54).

436

As more abnormalities (e.g., GGOs, consolidation) appear during the disease

437

process, a larger volume of tissue will have higher HU values and PCLH as percent

438

change in lung hyperdense volume (HV) from baseline can be expressed as [(HVn-

439

HVb)/HVb]*100. Then PCLH/LV can be expressed as [Vn/LVn]*100. Change in average

440

lung radiodensity (LD) in the entire lung volume can be [LDn-LDb]. Change in average

441

hyperdensity in hyperdense volume can be expressed as [HDn-HDb]. Then, PCLH as

442

percent change in lung hyperdense volume, PCLH as percent of lung volume

443

(PCLH/LV), change in the average radiodensity in the entire lung and change in the

444

averaged hyperdensity in the hyperdense volume were graphed with disease progress. To

445

visualize CT abnormalities in three dimensions (3D), a volume rendering technique was

446

used to create videos. In brief, the lungs and airways were extracted form chest CT

447

images using MIM software. A region growing algorithm was used to segment different

448

classes including normal lung tissue, vessels, airways, and “lesions” with multiple seeds

449

at specific locations to achieve realistic segmentations. 3D volume renderings of the

450

segmentations were generated and animated rotations exhibiting the location and extent

451

of the abnormalities were produced using 3D Slicer 4 software version 4.10.2 (55).

Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) within 30 min of stopping the reaction. Reciprocal

514

endpoint titers were determined in GraphPad software version 8.4.2 (Prism, La Jolla, CA,

515

USA), using a sigmoidal 4 parameter-logistic fit curve. Endpoint titers were calculated at

516

the point when the curve crossed the ELISA cutoff value. For the S1 subunit IgG ELISA,

517

the cutoff value was determined to be an optical density (OD) of 0.19077, which was

518

determined from control sera collected from twenty-five NHPs sampled prior to the

519

known emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Data are presented as the mean and standard

520

deviation of two independent ELISA runs.

100 µl DMEM+10% heat-inactivated FBS in 96-well Operetta plates (Greiner Bio-One,

526

Monroe, NC, USA). The following day, a series of six-point dilutions, each 1:2, were

527

performed in duplicate starting with a dilution of 1:20 (1:20, 1:40, 1:60, etc.) in 96-well

528

1.2-ml cluster tubes (Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA). Then, stock SARS-CoV-2 virus

529

was diluted in serum free media and was added to the sera in each cluster tube at a

530

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 using a liquidator, doubling the total volume in

531

each well and further diluting sera 1:2. Thus, the final starting dilution was 1:40. The

532

sera/virus mixtures were then mixed by pipetting up and down with the liquidator.

533

Cluster tubes were next incubated for 1 h at 37°C/5% CO2. Following incubation, 100

534

µl/well of each virus/serum mixture were transferred to the Operetta plates from the

535

cluster tubes to yield final volumes of 200 µ/well (100 µl cell seeding media plus 100 µl

536

virus/serum mixture). Each set of cluster tubes provided enough material for each sample

537

to be run in duplicate in 2 plates, yielding a total of 4 replicates per sample. The

538

virus/serum mixtures were incubated on plates for 24 h at 37°C/5% CO2. Subsequently,

539

plates were fixed with 20% neutral buffered formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 24 h

540

at 4°C. Next, plates were washed with PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then blocked

541

with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1X PBS for 30 min on a rocker. Staining

542

followed, first with the primary antibody and then the secondary antibody. The primary

543

antibody was SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein/NP Antibody, Rabbit mAb (Sino Biological,

544

545

Plates were incubated with primary antibody for 60 min on a rocker. The secondary

549

primary, and secondary steps, plates were washed three times with 1X PBS. Finally,

550

plates were read on a Operetta High-Content Analysis System (PerkinElmer, Waltham,

551

552

Harmony software (PerkinElmer). Half-maximal neutralization titers (NT50) were

calculated by averaging the fluorescence intensity in virus control wells and dividing by

554

two. The fluorescence intensity of a sample at each dilution was compared to the NT50

555

values, and the lowest dilution that is equal to or less than the NT50 value was recorded.
