Abstract
A collection of twelve organoselenium compounds, structural analogues of
antioxidant drug ebselen were screened for inhibition of the papain-like protease
(PL​pro​) from the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, CoV2).
This cysteine protease, being responsible for the hydrolysis of peptide bonds
between specific amino acids, plays a critical role in CoV2 replication and in
assembly of new viral particles within human cells. The activity of the PL​pro CoV2 is
essential for the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it
constitutes a key target for the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. Here, we
identified four strong inhibitors that bind favorably to the PL​pro CoV2 with the ​IC​50 in
the nanomolar range.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the coronavirus pandemic that on May 19,
2020 affected around 4.5 million people in over 188 countries [1]. The scale of the
pandemic, easiness of its spreading [2] and variety of potential complications [3],
which yet remain not fully understood, position COVID-19 among serious diseases
faced by humankind so far.

The extensive research on developing new antiviral drugs for COVID-19 led to
identifying two potential targets being cysteine proteases that play a vital role in viral
replication. Main protease (M​pro​, also known as chymotrypsin-like protease 3CLpro)
is responsible for polypeptide processing during virus replication [4,5]. Papain-like
protease (PL​pro​) additionally to its role in virus replication assembles new viral
particles within human cells [6,7]. Harcourt et al. [6] showed that PL​pro is a key
enzyme in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-1 [8], the causative agent of the fatal
global outbreak of respiratory disease in humans during 2002–2003 [9]. In the study
presented by Shin et al. [10], PL​pro from novel SARS-CoV-2 is claimed to be the
essential viral enzyme that weakens the antiviral immune response and helps to take
advantage of the host’s immune system for its own benefit. Thus, current
understanding of mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 indicates that blocking PL​pro seems to
be crucial for further stopping virus spread.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 PL​pro as an essential viral enzyme [10] offers a
great possibility for drug discovery. In recent studies, peptide analogues [11] and
ebselen [12] have been identified as highly active inhibitors for PL​pro​. Ebselen is a
seleno-organic

drug

with

well-known

anti-inflammatory,

anti-atherosclerotic,

cytoprotective properties and low toxicity in humans [13]. It has been proven to be an
effective therapeutic agent in multiple diseases like cancer and hepatitis C virus
[14-18].

In this paper, we present inhibitory activity of twelve ebselen derivatives obtained by
substitution/functionalization of the phenyl ring towards SARS-CoV-1 PL​pro
(PL​pro​SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 PL​pro ​(PL​pro​CoV2). Previously, these derivatives were
proven to be highly effective towards human methionine aminopeptidase 2 [19] and
antiviral and antimicrobial agents [20]. We show that some of them indeed possess
higher activity than ebselen, that has been recently reported as PL​pro​CoV2 inhibitor
[12], and, thus, could be considered as novel potential drugs against COVID-19.

benzisoselenazol-3(2​H​)-ones (​1a​–​g​) and four 2,2′-dicarbamoyldiaryl diselenides
(​2a​-​2f​) were employed for inhibitory studies toward PL​pro from SARS and CoV2. The
first group included 2-phenylbenzisoselenazol-3(2​H​)-ones with the phenyl ring
monosubstituted with functional group, such as Me (​1c​), OH (​1d​), OMe(​1e​) and
analogues of ebselen based on the benzisoselenazol-3(2​H​)-one core modified in
position 2 (the nitrogen atom) by adding -CH​2​- (​1f​) and -CH​2​CH​2​- (​1g​) (compound ​1f
is additional monosubstituted by t-Bu). The second group constitutes acyclic
diselenide form of ebselen or its derivatives ( ​2d and 2e​) containing two atoms of
selenium per molecule.
Organoselenium compounds were found to be irresistible inhibitors toward both
enzymes. Similar to recently published ebselen [12] they show irreversibility of the
mode of action. All of phenylbenzisoselenazol-3(2​H​)-ones inactivated completely
PL​pro​Cov2 in concentration equal 20μM (see Table 1). In the case of PL​pro​SARS the
range of inhibition was from 50% to 100% (see Table 1).

Enzymes activity assayed in the absence of inhibitors is defined as 100% activity. “< 3” means that the enzyme

was not active (i.e., almost zero relative activity of the enzymes). The inhibitors were screened in TRIS buffer.
The concentration of the enzymes was 10nM. The release of the fluorophore was monitored continuously. The
linear portion of the progress curve was used to calculate the velocity. Each experiment was repeated at least
three times and the results are presented as the average with standard deviation. For more details, please see
the materials and methods section.

The experiment with 1μM of the inhibitor led to identify highly active ligands. Two
derivatives of ebselen with substitution by hydroxy (​1c​) or methoxy group (​1d​)
inhibited CoV2 in 100% in this condition. Affinity of diselenide orthologs (​2c and ​2d​)
were overall in the same range (Table 1 and 2). Whereas, replacing phenyl in
position 2 with less hydrophobic substituents, hydrogen (​1a​) or methyl (​1b​), was not
beneficial, similar to substitution by methyl in the ​para position (​1b​). We observed a
similar relationship for diselenide (Table 1). All compounds were less active toward

PL​pro​SARS. Only compounds that are substituted derivatives of ebselen and their
diselenide orthologs showed significant inhibition in concentration 20 μM.

The inhibitory potency was further investigated for the most significant ligands with
PL​pro​CoV2 and we found ​IC​50 value in nanomolar range for ​1c​, ​1d​, 2c and 2d (Table
3). All four compounds appeared to be very effective inhibitors of PL​pro from CoV2,
with the ​IC​50 constants in the nanomolar range, e.g. 236 nM for compound ​1e with
methyl substitution in the ​para​ position.

The most significant results obtained in this study were further illustrated with
molecular modeling (Figure 1 and 2). The modeled interactions do not show
significant changes in the overall binding mode architecture compared with the
ebselen-PL​pro​CoV2 [12]. Similar to ebselen complexes with enzyme, hydroxyl
derivative occupies the same intersection between catalytic Cys111–His272–Asp286
triad and Trp106 and it is wrapped by other Tyr268, Ala289 and Leu298 making with

Discussion
Inhibition of papain like protease from CoV2 has been recently identified as a
potential approach to therapy of COVID-19 [10]. In this work, we used the ebselen
derivatives/analogues library and performed a comprehensive inhibition study of
PL​pro​CoV2. All of the tested compounds proved to be covalent inhibitors of the
enzyme. Interestingly, all derivatives except ​1a blocked completely PL​pro​CoV2 ​at a
high concentration of the inhibitor (20μM), but only some of them (​1c​, ​1d​, ​1e and ​2d​,
2e​) inhibited PL​pro​SARS while rest of them failed. This outcome is even more
apparent for the concentration of 20μM of an inhibitor. In the case of PL​pro​SARS,
none of the presented ebselen derivatives was able to block the enzyme. However,
1d​, ​1e​, ​2d and ​2e inhibited PL​pro​CoV2 at this concentration. The investigation of ​IC​50

revealed that ​1d​, ​1e​, ​2d and ​2e obtained approximately 250 nM that is one
magnitude better than in the case of ebselen (around 2 μ​M​ as reported in [12]).

​
In conclusion, we identified very effective inhibitors of PL​pro​CoV2, with the ​IC50
constants in the nanomolar range. Our findings provide evidence that ebselen
derivatives with an additional hydroxy or methoxy group serve as highly potential
prospective drugs against COVID-19.

Material and methods
1.General
SARS-CoV-1 PLpro, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Ubiquitin-AMC were purchased as 32,
11 and 3 μM solutions, respectively, from R&D Systems.
All compounds were obtained and fully characterized in previous studies [19-21].
Their purity and homogeneity were confirmed by HRMS and ​77​Se NMR.
2. Enzymes assay
The enzymes were dissolved in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing DTT (2 mM),
NaCl (100mM) and 0.1 mg/mL albumin, at pH 7.5, and preincubated 30 min.
Spectrofluorimetric measurements were performed in a 96-well plate format working
at two wavelengths: excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. The release of the
fluorophore was monitored continuously at the enzyme concentration of 10 nM. The
linear portion of the progress curve was used to calculate velocity of hydrolysis.
3. Inhibition assay
The inhibitor was screened against recombinant PL​pro​SARS and PL​pro​CoV2 at 37°C
in the assay buffer as described above. For steady state measurement the enzymes
were incubated for 60min at 37°C with an inhibitor before adding the substrate to the
wells. Eight different inhibitor concentrations were used. Value of the concentration

​ ) was taken from the dependence of
of the inhibitor that achieved 50% inhibition (​IC50​
the hydrolysis velocity on the logarithm of the inhibitor concentration [I].

4. Molecular Modeling
Molecular modeling studies were performed using the Discovery Studio 2020
(Dassault Systemes BIOVIA Corp). The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 (PDB
ID 6W9C [22]) with protons added (assuming the protonation state of pH 7.5) was
used as the starting point for calculations of the enzyme complexed with ebselen.
The partial charges of all atoms were computed using the Momany-Rone algorithm.
Minimization was performed using the Smart Minimizer algorithm and the CHARMm
force field up to an energy change of 0.0 or RMS gradient of 0.01. Generalized Born
model was applied. The nonbond radius was set to 14 Å.
