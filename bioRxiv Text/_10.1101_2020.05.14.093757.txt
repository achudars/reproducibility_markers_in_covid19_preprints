Abstract
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across

30

the globe, infecting millions of people and generating societal disruption on a level not seen since the

31

1918 influenza pandemic. A safe and effective vaccine is desperately needed to prevent the continued

32

spread of SARS-CoV-2; yet, rational vaccine design efforts are currently hampered by the lack of

33

knowledge regarding viral epitopes targeted during an immune response, and the need for more in-depth

34

knowledge on betacoronavirus immunology. To that end, we developed a computational workflow using

35

a series of open-source algorithms and webtools to analyze the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and identify

36

putative T cell and B cell epitopes. Using increasingly stringent selection criteria to select peptides with

37

significant HLA promiscuity and predicted antigenicity, we identified 41 potential T cell epitopes (5 HLA

38

class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 potential B cell epitopes, respectively. Docking analysis and binding

39

predictions demonstrated enrichment for peptide binding to HLA-B (class I) and HLA-DRB1 (class II)

40

molecules. Overlays of predicted B cell epitopes with the structure of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein

41

revealed that 4 of 6 epitopes were located in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein. To our

42

knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze all 10 (structural, non-structural and

43

accessory) proteins from SARS-CoV-2 using predictive algorithms to identify potential targets for

44

vaccine development.

Significance Statement:

48

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged from China, rapidly spreading and ushering in a

49

global pandemic. Despite intensive research efforts, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 immunology and the

50

proteins targeted by the immune response remains relatively limited, making it difficult to rationally

51

design candidate vaccines. We employed a suite of bioinformatic tools, computational algorithms, and

52

structural modeling to comprehensively analyze the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome for potential T cell and

53

B cell epitopes. Utilizing a set of stringent selection criteria to filter peptide epitopes, we identified 41 T

54

cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 B cell epitopes that could serve as promising targets

55

for peptide-based vaccine development against this emerging global pathogen.

Introduction
In December 2019, public health officials in Wuhan, China, reported the first case of severe

61

respiratory disease attributed to infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (1). Since its

62

emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly via human-to-human transmission (2), threatening to

63

overwhelm healthcare systems around the world and resulting in the declaration of a pandemic by the

64

World Health Organization (3). The disease caused by the virus (COVID-19) is characterized by fever,

65

pneumonia, and other respiratory and inflammatory symptoms that can result in severe inflammation of

66

lung tissue and ultimately death—particularly among older adults or individuals with underlying

67

comorbidities (4-6). As of this writing, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in 4 million confirmed

68

cases of COVID-19 and over 280,000 deaths worldwide (7).

69

SARS-CoV-2 is the third pathogenic coronavirus to cross the species barrier into humans in the

70

past two decades, preceded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (8, 9) and

71

Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (10). All three of these viruses belong to the

72

β-coronavirus genus and have either been confirmed (SARS-CoV) or suggested (MERS-CoV, SARS-

73

CoV-2) to originate in bats, with transmission to humans occurring through intermediary animal hosts

74

(11-14). While previous zoonotic spillovers of coronaviruses have been marked by high case fatality rates

75

(~10% for SARS-CoV; ~34% for MERS-CoV), widespread transmission of disease has been relatively

76

limited (8,098 cases of SARS; 2,494 cases of MERS) (15). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have

77

a lower case fatality rate (~2-4%) but is far more infectious and has achieved world-wide spread in a

78

matter of months (16).

79

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to grow, there is an urgent need for a safe and

80

effective vaccine to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare

81

systems. No licensed vaccine or therapeutic is currently available for SARS-CoV-2, although there are

82

over 100 vaccine candidates reportedly in development worldwide. Seven vaccine candidates have

83

rapidly progressed into Phase I/II clinical trials: adenoviral vector-based vaccines (CanSino Biologics,

84

ChiCTR2000030906; University of Oxford, NCT04324606), nucleic-acid based vaccines encoding for

85

the viral spike (S) protein (Moderna, NCT04283461; Inovio Pharmaceuticals, NCT04336410;

86

BioNTech/Pfizer, 2020-001038-36), and inactivated virus formulations (Sinopharm,

87

ChiCTR2000031809; Sinovac (NCT04352608) (17). While the advancement of these vaccine candidates

88

into clinical testing is promising, it is imperative they meet stringent endpoints for safety (18). Preclinical

89

studies of multiple experimental SARS-CoV vaccines have reported a Th2-type immunopathology in the

90

lungs of vaccinated mice following viral challenge, suggesting hypersensitization of the immune response

91

against certain viral proteins (19-22). Similarly, a modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector expressing the

92

SARS-CoV S protein induced significant hepatitis in immunized ferrets (23). These data suggest that

93

candidate coronavirus vaccines that limit the inclusion of whole viral proteins may have more beneficial

94

safety profiles.

95

The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for 10 unique protein products: 4 structural proteins (surface

96

glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)); 5 non-structural proteins (open reading

97

frame (ORF)3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, ORF10); and 1 non-structural polyprotein (ORF1ab) (Figure 1A,

98

B) (24). It is currently unknown which epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome are recognized by the

99

human immune system, although studies of SARS-CoV immune responses suggest that both cellular and

100

humoral responses against structural proteins mediate protection against disease (19, 22, 25-27). It is

101

likely that cellular immune responses against non-structural viral proteins also play a key role in

102

orchestrating protective antiviral immunity (28-30). In lieu of biological data, immunoinformatic

103

algorithms can be employed to predict peptide epitopes based on amino acid properties and known human

104

leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding profiles (31-33). These computational approaches represent a validated

105

methodology for rapidly identifying potential T cell and B cell epitopes for exploratory peptide-based

106

vaccine development and have been recently used to identify target epitopes for MERS-CoV (34) and

107

SARS-CoV-2, although many of these reports focus solely on structural proteins (35-38).

108

Herein, we employed a comprehensive immunoinformatics approach to identify putative T cell

109

and B cell epitopes across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome (Figure 1C). We independently identified

110

peptides from each viral protein that were restricted to either HLA class I or HLA class II molecules

111

across a subset of the most common HLA alleles in the global population. By filtering this list of peptides

112

on the basis of predicted binding affinity, antigenicity, and promiscuity, we produced 5 HLA class I-

113

restricted and 36 HLA class II-restricted peptides as leading candidates for further study. We also

114

evaluated linear and structural B cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with six antigenic

115

regions identified as potential sites for antibody binding. These selected peptides may serve as initial

116

candidates in the rational and accelerated design of a peptide-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Comparison of genome sequences from SARS-CoV-2 isolates
Genomic sequences for reported SARS-CoV-2 isolates were identified and retrieved from the

120

Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) database on February 27, 2020

121

(https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=corona_ncov). Sequences that did not cover the

122

complete viral genome (~29,900 nucleotides) were excluded from further analysis. Remaining sequences

123

were aligned using the Clustal Omega program (version 1.2.4) from the European Bioinformatics Institute

124

(39) and compared against the first reported genome sequence for SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1; taxonomy

125

ID: 2697049) (1). Sequences from Wuhan-Hu-1 viral proteins were determined to be representative of

126

those from all viral isolates and were subsequently used for epitope prediction analyses.

127

Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes

128

Prediction of HLA class I and class II peptide epitopes was carried out with the 10 protein

129

sequences reported for the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate: E (GenBank accession: QHD43418), M (QHD43419), N

130

(QHD43423), S (QHD43416), ORF3a (QHD43417), ORF6 (QHD43420), ORF7a (QHD43421), ORF8

131

(QHD43422), ORF10 (QHI42199), ORF1ab (QHD43415).

132

For CD8+ T cell epitope prediction, NetCTL 1.2 (Immune Epitope Database) was initially used to

133

evaluate the binding of nonameric peptides derived from each viral protein to the most common HLA

134

class I supertypes present among the human population (40, 41). HLA class I molecules preferentially

135

bind 9-mer peptides, and most algorithm training datasets have been based on peptides of this length. The

136

weight placed on C-terminal cleavage and antigen transport efficiency was 0.15 and 0.05, respectively.

137

The antigenic score threshold was 0.75. Peptides with scores above this threshold were subsequently

138

analyzed on the NetMHCpan 4.0 server (Technical University of Denmark) to predict binding affinity and

139

percentile rank across representative alleles of each major HLA class I supertype (HLA-A*01:01, HLA-

140

A*02:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*27:05, HLA-B*40:01,

141

HLA-B*58:01, HLA-B*15:01), which collectively cover the majority of class I alleles present in the

142

human population (42-44). Thresholds for defining binding strength were set at 0.5% and 2.0% for strong

143

and weak binders, respectively.

144

For CD4+ T cell epitope prediction, NetMHCIIpan 3.2 server (Technical University of Denmark)

145

was used for predicting the binding affinity and percentile rank of 15-mer peptides derived from each

146

viral protein across a reference panel of 27 HLA class II molecules (33, 45). Thresholds for defining

147

binding strength were set at 2% and 10% for strong and weak binders, respectively.

148

HLA class I and class II peptides with high predicted binding affinities (< 500 nM), high

149

percentile ranks (< 0.5% for class I; < 2% for class II), and broad HLA coverage (> 3 alleles) were

150

independently analyzed on the VaxiJen 2.0 server (Edward Jenner Institute) (46, 47) using a conservative

151

score threshold (0.7) to predict antigenicity.

152

Molecular docking of HLA class I peptides

153

Docking simulations of 5 HLA class I-restricted SARS-CoV-2 peptides with high antigenicity

154

scores and a commonly shared predicted HLA molecule (HLA-DRB1*15:01) were performed using the

155

GalaxyPepDock server (Seoul National University Laboratory of Computational Biology) (48). The

156

structure of HLA-DRB1*15:01 was accessed from the Protein Data Bank as a co-crystallized structure of

157

the HLA molecule with a nonameric SARS-CoV peptide (PDB ID: 3C9N) (49). The bound nonamer

158

peptide was removed from the structure using Chimera 1.14 (University of California-San Francisco) (50)

159

prior to running simulations. Ten models of each peptide-HLA complex were generated on the basis of

160

minimized energy scores, and the top model for each complex was selected for comparative analysis.

161

Prediction and structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 B cell epitopes

162

Linear B cell epitope predictions were performed on the three exposed SARS-CoV-2 structural

163

proteins: S (GenBank accession: QHD43416), M (QHD43419), and E (QHD43418) using the BepiPred

164

1.0 algorithm (51). Epitope probability scores were calculated for each amino acid residue using a

165

threshold of 0.35 (corresponding to > 0.75 specificity and sensitivity below 0.5), and only epitopes > 5

166

amino acid residues in length were further analyzed. The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was

167

accessed from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6VSB) (52). Discontinuous (i.e., structural) B cell epitope

168

predictions for the S protein structure were carried out using DiscoTope 1.1 (53) with a score threshold

169

greater than – 7.7 (corresponding to > 0.75 specificity and sensitivity below 0.5). The main protein

170

structure was modeled in PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC), with predicted B cell epitopes identified by both

171

BepiPred 1.0 and DiscoTope 1.1 highlighted as spheres.

172

Results

173

Genetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates

174

The primary goal of our study was to identify peptide epitopes that would be broadly applicable

175

in vaccine development efforts against SARS-CoV-2. We identified 64 point mutations and 4 deletions

176

across the genomes of 44 clinical isolates, with all deletions and the majority of mutations (n=45)

177

occurring in the ORF1ab polyprotein (Supp. Figure S1). Single-point mutations were also found in the S

178

protein (n=5), N protein (n=5), ORF8 protein (n=3), ORF3a protein (n=2), ORF10 protein (n=2), E

179

protein (n=1), and M protein (n=1). Despite the genetic diversity introduced by these events (Figure 1D),

180

matrix analysis determined that > 99% sequence identity was maintained across all viral genomes. Based

181

on these findings and for study feasibility, the genome from the original virus isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1;

182

GenBank: MN908947) was selected as the consensus sequence for all further analyses.

183

Prediction of CD8+ T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome

184

We next identified potential CD8+ T cell epitopes from all proteins in the SARS-CoV-2

185

proteome. Using the NetCTL 1.2 predictive algorithm, we analyzed the complete amino acid sequence of

186

each viral protein to generate sets of 9-mer peptides predicted to be recognized across at least one of the

187

major HLA class I supertypes (Figure 2A, Supp. Figure S2). This approach yielded a significant number

188

of potential epitopes from each viral protein (ORF10: 9, ORF6: 17, ORF8: 23, E: 25, ORF7: 39, N: 80,

189

M: 87, ORF3a: 87, S: 321, ORF1ab: 2814), with the number directly related to the size of the parent

190

protein. We used the NetMHCpan 4.0 server to further refine the list of potential CD8+ T cell epitopes by

191

predicting binding affinity across representative HLA class I alleles (see Methods) and assigning

192

percentile scores to quantify binding propensity. Peptides with percentile rank scores < 0.5% (i.e., strong

193

binders) were filtered using a 500 nM threshold for binding affinity to further delineate 740 candidate

194

HLA class I epitopes from the viral proteome (54). For feasibility reasons, we refined our selection to 83

195

candidate epitopes by excluding peptides predicted to bind only one HLA molecule (Supp. Table S1).

196

The resultant peptides were enriched for predicted binders to HLA-B molecules (HLA-B*15:01=50;

197

HLA-B*58:01=32; HLA-B*08:01=31) (Figure 2B). A final round of selection on the basis of HLA

198

promiscuity (i.e., predicted binding to > 3 HLA molecules) and predicted antigenicity scoring using the

199

VaxiJen 2.0 server produced a subset of five candidate peptides (four ORF1ab, one S protein) as potential

200

targets for vaccine development (Table 1) with the hypothesis that increased HLA binding promiscuity

201

meant broader population base coverage by those peptides. These peptides were predicted to provide 74%

202

global population coverage and had higher predicted binding affinities for HLA-B molecules

203

(B*08:01=42.6 nM; B*15:01=67.7 nM; B*58:01=110.3 nM) compared to HLA-A molecules

204

(A*01:01=238.6 nM; A*24:02=142.9 nM), with the exception of one ORF1ab-derived peptide

205

(MMISAGFSL) that was predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01 with high affinity (IC50= 6.9 nM) (Figure 2C).

206

Prediction of CD4+ T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome

207

We also sought to identify potential HLA class II peptides from SARS-CoV-2, as the stimulation

208

of CD4+ T-helper cells is critical for robust vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses. Using the

209

NetMHCIIpan 3.2 server, we identified 801 candidate HLA class II peptides from the viral proteome

210

predicted to have high binding affinity (< 500 nM) and percentile rank scores < 2% across a reference

211

panel of HLA molecules covering > 97% of the population (33, 45). Similar to HLA class I epitope

212

predictions, the number of class II epitopes identified for each viral protein (ORF10: 4, E protein: 7,

213

ORF7: 8, ORF8: 10, ORF6: 14, N: 15, M: 29, ORF3a: 31, S: 96, ORF1ab: 587) was largely proportional

214

to protein size. After excluding peptides predicted to bind to only a single HLA molecule in our panel, we

215

refined our selection to 211 peptides (Supp. Table S2), which were enriched for binding to HLA-DRB1

216

molecules (n=142) (Figure 2D). Filtering on HLA promiscuity and predicted antigenicity scores yielded

217

a subset of 36 peptides (24 ORF1ab, 5 S protein, 2 M protein, 2 ORF7, 1 ORF3a, 1 ORF6, 1 ORF8) as

218

CD4+ T cell epitopes for further study (Table 1). These peptides were predicted to collectively provide

219

99% population coverage and have significantly higher average binding affinities for HLA-DR alleles

220

(DRB1=56.4 nM; DRB3=50.9 nM; DRB4=70.1 nM; DRB5=18 nM) compared to HLA-DP (155.9 nM)

221

or HLA-DQ (238.6 nM) molecules (Figure 2E).

222

Characterization of HLA class I peptide docking with HLA-B*15:01

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.093757; this version posted May 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

223

The five candidate HLA class I peptides identified by our computational approach were predicted

224

to provide coverage across six HLA alleles (A*01:01, A*02:01, A*24:02, B*08:01, B*15:01, B*58:01).

225

The peptide FAMQMAYRF was the only candidate predicted to bind to A*24:02 molecules, whereas

226

MMISAGFSL was predicted to uniquely bind A*02:01 and B*08:01 molecules. Four of the five peptides

227

were predicted to bind A*01:01 and B*58:01 molecules, but all were predicted to bind with relatively

228

high affinity (average IC50 = 67.7 nM) to HLA-B*15:01. Therefore, we performed molecular docking

229

studies of each peptide with the molecular structure of HLA-B*15:01 (PDB: 3C9N).

230

All peptides were predicted to bind within the peptide binding groove, forming hydrogen bond

231

contacts with numerous amino acid side chains (Figure 3A). The binding motif for HLA-B*15:01 is

232

highly selective for residues at the P2 and P9 anchor positions, with a preference for bulky hydrophobic

233

amino acids at the C-terminus (Figure 3B) (55). All candidate peptides possessed terminal residues (Phe,

234

Tyr, Leu) that fit into the hydrophobic binding pocket of the HLA groove, further supporting that these

235

peptides should be strong binders of HLA-B*15:01 and promising candidates for vaccine development

236

studies.

237

Prediction of B cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins

238

An effective vaccine should stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses against the

239

target pathogen; therefore, we also sought to identify potential B cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2

240

proteins. We limited our analysis to the primary structural proteins exposed on the virus capsid (S, N, M,

241

and E), as these are the most accessible antigens for engaging B cell receptors. Using the Bepipred 1.0

242

algorithm, we identified 26 potential linear B cell epitopes in the S protein, 14 potential epitopes in the N

243

protein, and 3 potential epitopes in the M protein (Table 2). No epitopes were identified in the E protein.

244

Studies have previously shown the S protein to be the predominant target of neutralizing antibodies

245

against coronaviruses (56, 57), and, as our findings indicate this to likely be the case for SARS-CoV-2,

246

we focused all subsequent analyses on the S protein. While the N protein is also a major target of the

247

antibody response (58), it is unlikely these antibodies have any neutralizing activity based on the viral

248

structure. As epitope conformation can significantly influence recognition by antibodies, we also

249

employed DiscoTope 1.1 to identify discontinuous B cell epitopes in the protein structure. Our analysis

250

identified 14 potential structural epitopes in the S protein (7 in the S1 domain, 7 in the S2 domain), with

251

six regions having significant overlap with our predicted linear epitopes (Table 2). Antigenic regions

252

identified in both analyses were modeled using the recently published structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S

253

protein (52) to examine their accessibility for antibody binding. Epitopes in the S2 domain (P792-D796;

254

Y1138-D1146) were clustered near the base of the spike protein, whereas regions in the S1 domain

Discussion
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that safe and effective vaccines be rapidly

258

developed in order to induce widespread herd immunity in the population and prevent the continued

259

spread of SARS-CoV-2. Our study identified probable peptide targets of both cellular and humoral

260

immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 using computational methodologies to investigate the entire viral

261

proteome a priori. Studies such as these are paramount during the early stages of pandemic vaccine

262

development given the relative scarcity of biological data available on the viral immune response, and we

263

employed an approach that allowed us to systematically refine our predictions using increasingly stringent

264

criteria to select a subset of the most promising epitopes for further study. The data we have curated could

265

inform the design of a candidate peptide-based vaccine or diagnostic against SARS-CoV-2.

266

As selective pressures are known to introduce viral mutations that promote fitness and can lead

267

to evasion of immune responses (59, 60), we first sought to investigate the genetic similarity of all

268

reported SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates and identify a consensus sequence for use in our epitope

269

prediction studies. We identified 68 mutations/deletions across the 44 genomes of clinical isolates

270

reported as of 27 February 2020. Despite these variations, the viral genomic identity was > 99%

271

conserved across all isolates. As the protein coding sequences were largely conserved, the genome of the

272

original virus isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1) was deemed a representative consensus sequence for analysis of the

273

SARS-CoV-2 proteome.

274

CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses will likely be directed against both structural and non-structural

275

proteins during antiviral immune responses, as all viral proteins are accessible for processing and

276

presentation on the HLA molecules of infected cells. Therefore, we sought to identify T cell epitopes

277

across the entire viral proteome. Our analysis identified 83 potential CD8+ T cell epitopes (Supp. Table

278

S1) and 211 potential CD4+ T cell epitopes (Supp. Table S2), with stringent filtering for more

279

promiscuous peptides with high predicted antigenicity yielding a subset of 5 CD8+ T cell epitopes and 36

280

CD4+ T cell epitopes (Table 1) as potential targets for vaccine development. A single study by Grifoni

281

and colleagues has recently reported the computational identification of 241 CD4+ T cell epitopes from

282

SARS-CoV-2 (35), and 22 peptides from our analysis shared sequence homology or were nested within

283

peptides identified in their study. Moreover, seven peptides from this initial report were replicated in our

284

final subset of HLA class II epitopes, supporting that these peptides may be promising vaccine targets.

285

An increasing number of studies have employed predictive algorithms to identify potential HLA

286

class I epitopes for SARS-CoV-2, although relatively few have comprehensively analyzed the entire viral

287

proteome. A report from Feng et al. recently outlined the identification of 499 potential class I epitopes in

288

the main structural proteins from SARS-CoV-2 but did not consider any non-structural proteins (38).

289

Grifoni and colleagues conducted a more rigorous analysis, identifying 628 unique CD8+ T cell epitopes

290

across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins but focusing their analyses solely on peptides with sequence homology

291

to known SARS-CoV epitopes (35). Our approach initially identified ~ 3,500 potential CD8+ T cell

292

epitopes across all viral proteins, which we refined to a subset of 5 peptides (Table 1). One peptide

293

derived from ORF1ab (MMISAGFSL) was predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01 with high affinity (IC50= 6.9

294

nM) (Figure 2C). Given the prevalence of this allele in the American and European populations (25-60%

295

frequency) (61), MMISAGFSL may represent a promising epitope capable of providing broad vaccine

296

population coverage.

297

We also observed a notable enrichment of epitopes predicted to bind HLA-B molecules–

298

particularly HLA-B*15:01–as we imposed more stringent selection criteria (Figure 2B). All five peptides

299

identified by our approach were predicted to be relatively strong binders for this allele (IC50 = 67.7 nM),

300

with molecular docking simulations illustrating strong contacts with amino acid residues in the peptide

301

binding groove (Figure 3 A, B). A recent computational study identified another HLA-B allele (B*15:03)

302

as having a high capacity for presenting epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 that were conserved among other

303

pathogenic coronaviruses (62). These data collectively suggest the HLA-B locus may be significantly

304

associated with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (and potentially other coronaviruses), with further

305

biological studies warranted to determine the true role of host genetics in SARS-CoV-2 immunology.

306

Lastly, we analyzed the primary structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (S, N, M, E proteins) for

307

potential B cell epitopes, as an ideal vaccine would be designed to stimulate both cellular and humoral

308

immunity. Our analysis identified potential linear B cell epitopes in all proteins except for the E protein

309

(Table 2). The greatest number of epitopes were predicted in the surface-exposed S protein (n=26), but a

310

significant number of epitopes were also predicted for the N protein (n=14). This is not surprising, as

311

previous reports identified the N protein as a significant target of the humoral response to SARS-CoV

312

(63, 64). As the S protein is the predominant surface protein and has been the primary target of

313

neutralizing antibody responses against other coronaviruses (56, 57), we elected to focus our subsequent

314

analyses solely on antigenic regions in the S protein. We identified 14 potential structural epitopes in the

315

S protein structure and referenced against our linear epitope predictions to identify six regions that were

316

independently identified by both analyses (Table 2, Figure 4). Feng et al. recently reported the

317

computational identification of 19 surface epitopes in the S protein using Bepipred and the Kolaskar

318

method (38), four of which had significant sequence overlap with the regions identified by our analyses.

319

To further evaluate the potential of these six antigenic regions as targets for antibody binding, we

320

modeled their surface accessibility on the crystal structure of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein (52). Four

321

regions in the S1 domain (D405-D428; N440-N450; G496-P507; D568-T573) were solvent exposed

322

(Figure 4 A, B), with minimal steric hindrance for antibody accessibility. The S1 domain contains the

323

residues (N331-V524) important for virus binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell

324

surface (65), and studies have shown that antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV

325

target this domain (66-68). Indeed, three of the four S1 epitopes identified in our analyses are located in

326

the ACE2-binding region, supporting their potential utility in vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.

327

Two regions were identified in the S2 “stalk” domain of the S protein (Figure 4 A, C). While Y1138-

328

D1146 is located at the base of the S protein and likely inaccessible to antibodies, P792-D796 is on the

329

outer face of the protein and has been previously identified as part of a larger B cell epitope that is

330

conserved with SARS-CoV (35). As SARS-CoV S2-specific antibodies have previously been shown to

331

possess antiviral activity (66), it is interesting to speculate whether a strategy similar to targeting the

332

influenza hemagglutinin protein stalk could be employed for developing a broadly reactive coronavirus

333

vaccine.

334

Our study possessed several strengths and limitations. Rather than restricting our analyses of

335

HLA class I and class II epitopes to specific proteins based on prior studies of SARS-CoV immunology,

336

we investigated the complete proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using an unbiased approach. Furthermore, we

337

employed a multi-tiered strategy for identifying putative B cell and T cell epitopes from all viral proteins

338

studied. Our initial analyses were performed with liberal thresholds for epitope identification, and at each

339

additional step, we imposed more stringent selection criteria to filter these peptides to a subset of B cell

340

and T cell epitopes for further study. Nevertheless, the results of this study are derived purely from

341

computational methods, and it should be noted that computational algorithms can fail to capture a

342

significant number of antigenic peptides (69). Experimental validation with biological samples will

343

ultimately be needed.

344

During the early stages of a pandemic, access to sufficient biological samples may be extremely

345

limited, so we must continue to utilize methodologies—such as computational predictive algorithms—

346

that allow us to explore the epitope landscape for experimental vaccine development. Our approach in this

347

study allowed us to identify and refine a manageable subset of T cell and B cell epitopes for further

348

testing as components of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Based on our results, our proposed SARS-CoV-2

349

vaccine formulation could contain the following: 1) one or more B cell peptide epitopes from the S

350

protein to generate protective neutralizing antibodies; and 2) multiple HLA class I and class II-derived

351

peptides from other viral proteins to stimulate robust CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses. Based on global

352

allele frequencies, these class I and class II peptides would be expected to collectively provide 74% and

353

99% population coverage, respectively. While such a vaccine could be readily formulated as a synthetic

354

polypeptide or an adjuvanted peptide mixture, these strategies may not retain the epitope structural

355

features necessary to induce a robust antibody response. Recombinant nanoparticles and assembly into

356

VLPs represent promising alternative vaccine platforms, as they have been extensively used for the

357

controlled display and delivery of peptide-based vaccine components (70-73). By omitting whole viral

358

proteins from the vaccine formulation, a peptide-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should have a well-

359

tolerated safety profile and avoid the adverse events previously observed with experimental SARS-CoV

360

vaccines (19-22).

361

In summary, we have identified 41 potential T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and

362

6 potential B cell epitopes from across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that are predicted to have broad

363

population coverage and could serve as the basis for designing investigational peptide-based vaccines.

364

Further study on the biological relevance and immunogenicity of these peptides is warranted in an effort

365

to develop a safe and effective vaccine to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
