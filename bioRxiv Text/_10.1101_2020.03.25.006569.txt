Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (2019-nCoV), which first broke out in
Wuhan (China) in December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality
ranging from 3% to 6%. To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this
paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon
usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae.
We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its
codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary
pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved
genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and
nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias
and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we
show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly
by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid
(N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and
antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest
that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the
development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.

1. Introduction

20

The name “coronavirus” is derived from the Greek κoρωνα, that mean crown. The first complete
genome of coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus - MHV), a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus,
was first reported in 1949. It belongs to the family Coronaviridae and ranges from 26.4 (ThCoV
HKU12) to 31.7 (SW1) kb in length [10], making it the largest genomes among all known RNA viruses,
with G + C contents varying from 32% to 43% [20]. The coronavirinae family consists of four genera
based on their genetic properties, including genus: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus (subdivided in
subgroups A, B, C and D), Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Coronavirus can infect humans
and many different animal species, including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds,

bats, rabbits, ferrets, mink, snake, and other wildlife animals. To date, 30 CoVs genomes have been
identified. Only seven CoVs have been identified that infect humans, including Human CoV-229E
(HCoV-229E), Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HumanCoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Human
CoV- HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), Human SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS CoV 2 ( nCoV) [26].
Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (2019-nCoV), which first broke out in Wuhan (China) in
December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality rate from 3% to 6%.
The newly sequenced virus genome encodes two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1ab,
the latter encodes replicase polyproteins, and four structural proteins [19], [9]: the spike-surface
glycoprotein (protein S), the small envelop protein (protein E), the matrix protein (M), and the
nucleocapsid protein (N).
The phenomenon of codon usage bias (CUB) exists in many genomes including RNA genomes and
it is actually determined by mutation and selection [1]. As it is well-known, the non-random choice
of synonymous codons varies among species that are potential host for viruses [11] [? ]. It is then
important to study patterns of common codon usage in coronaviruses because CUB can be related to
the driving forces that shape the evolution of small RNA viruses. Mutational bias has been considered
as the major determinant of codon usage variation among RNA viruses [13]. Indeed, RNA viruses
show an effective number of codons (ENC) that is quite high (ENC>45) pointing to a quite random
codon usage, whereas if one uses the adaptive index CAI then the viral CUB is consistent with that of
the host, as observed in the Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) or Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) [5].
The aim of this study was to carry out a comprehensive analysis of codon usage and composition of
coronavirus and explore the possible leading evolutionary determinants of the biases found.

2. Results

51

2.1. Nucleotide composition

52

55

The nucleotide content of 30 coronaviruses coding sequences are calculated. The results reveal
that the nucleotide A is the most frequent base and the nucleotide frequencies are in order A >T>G>C
[19]. For nCoV we note a different trend T>A>G>C, but in totally AT% is more used than GC% (See
Table 3). The GC content in 2019-nCoV is 0.373 ± 0.05.

56

2.2. All the sequenced 2019-nCoV genomes share a common codon usage

57

64

We downloaded the protein-coding sequences of 2019-nCoV from GIDAID database, by
classifying each n-CoV based on the geographic location where they are sequenced (see tree in
A2). For each n-CoV genome, we calculated the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), in the
form of a 61-component vector. In Fig A1, we show the heatmap and the associated clustering of these
vectors. Despite the high mutation rate that characterizes 2019-nCoV genome [30], [4], the overall
codon usage bias among 2019-nCoV strains appears to be similar. Moreover, their associated vectors
did not cluster according to geographic location, thus confirming the common origin of these genomes.
Therefore, we will consider a unique vector to represent 2019-nCoV in the following analyses.

65

2.3. Codon usage of 2019-nCoV genome strains

66

We compared the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of the other coronavirus genomes. For
this purpose, we used the RSCU which is a biologically relevant metric of distance between the codon
usage in the protein-coding sequences of these genomes. In Fig. 1, we report the heatmap of the RSCU
values associated with the coronavirus. The RSCU values of the majority of the codons scored between
0 and 3.1 (see legend in Figure 1). Interestingly, analysis of codon bias in coronavirus genomes reveal
that the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence has a clear origin from other
beta-CoV’s and is closer, specifically, to SARSr-CoV, consistent with their phylogenetic relationships
(Figure A3). In line with previous observations, we show that the mean CpG relative abundance in the

coronavirus genomes is markedly suppressed [27]. Specifically, GGG, GGC, CCG (pyrimidine-CpG)
and ACG (purine-CpG) present a very low frequence of occurrence, probably due to the relative tRNA
abundance of the host. In fact, in human the abundance of tRNA in codons GGG, GGC, CCG and
ACG are respectavely: 0, 0, 4 and 7.
In 2019-nCoV, the most frequently used codons are CGU (arginine, 2.34 times) and GGU (glycine,
2.42), whereas the least used codons are GGG (glycine) and UCG (serine). We also note the most
frequently used codons for each amino acid, ended in either U or A. [5]

Figure 1. Clustering of the RSCU vectors associated to coronavirus. Analysis of codon bias in
coronavirus genomes reveal that the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence
was closer to SARSr-CoV as in the reconstructed phylogenetic tree shown in Figure A3. Heatmap
are drawn with the CIMminer software [25], which uses Euclidean distances and the average linkage
algorithm.
81

2.4. The codon usage of 2019-nCoV is not optimized to the host.

82

To measure the codon usage bias in the coronavirus genomes, we used the effective number
of codons (ENC) value and the Competition Adaptation Index (CAI). In Table 2 and 3, we report
the ENC and CAI values for all the coronaviruses we considered in this work. To visually enhance
the differences among the codon usage of these coronaviruses we calculated Zscore of a single virus
in relation to the other members of the CoV subfamily. Interestingly, the ENC value associated to
2019-nCoV (51.9 ± 2.59) is lower than the average of all Coronaviruses, meaning that 2019-nCoV uses
a broader set of synonymous codons in its coding sequences. We also note that CAI of 2019-nCoV
(0.727 ± 0.054) is lower than the average one, underscoring that this coronavirus tend to use codons
that are not optimized to the host. We calculate similarity index (SiD) to measure the effect of codon
usage bias of the host (human) on the 2019-nCoV genes. The SiD values range from 0 to 1, with higher
values indicating that the host has a dominant effect on the usage codons. [16] In our case SiD for
2019-nCoV is equal to 0.78.

Figure 2. Z-score values. Z-score is calculated for two codon bias indexes ENC and CAI. We show in
figure that a lot of coronavirus have a codon usage major than the average value of the family (Z-score
3). For what concerns 2019-nCoV, it presents average CAI and ENC higher than the average too.

2.5. Genes

95

The genome of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV consists of a single, positive-stranded RNA,
that is approximately 30K nucleotides long. The overall genome is organizated similar to other
coronaviruses. Ceraolo et al. performed a cross-species analysis for all proteins encoded by the
2019-nCoV (see Figure 3-4 in [3]). The newly sequenced virus genome encodes polyproteins, common
to all betacoronavirus, which are further cleaved into the individual structural proteins E, M, N and S,
as well the non-structural RdRP [28]. So, only five viral genes are classified according to their viral
location and studied for each virus because the short length and insufficient codon usage diversity of
the other genes might have biased the results. The corresponding gene products including S protein
regulates virus attachment to the receptor of the target host cell [2]; the E protein functions to assemble
the virions and acts as an ion channel [18], the M protein plays a role in virus assembly and is involved
in biosynthesis of new virus particles [17] the N protein forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with
the virus RNA [19]. Finally, RdRP catalyzes viral RNA syntesis. We calculate for these five proteins
the RSCU vectors in each virus of the dataset (see Figure 3). We show that only for gene E, M and
N 2019-nCoV cluster with SARSr-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, consistent with the inferred
phylogeny shown in Figure A3.

2.6. The ENC plot analysis of individual genes of 2019-nCoV

111

To further investigate which factors account for the low codon usage bias of the different genes
in coronavirus, we analyzed the relationship between the ENC value and the percentage of G or C
in the third positioncodons (GC3s). In Figure 4, we show separately the ENC-plots obtained for the
five genes (M, N, S, E, and RdRP), together with the Wright’s theoretical curve, corresponding to the
case when the codon usage is only determined by the GC3s [29]. We would like to point out that if
mutational bias, as quantified by GC-content in the generally neutral 3rd codon position, is the main
factor in determining the codon usage among these genes, the corresponding point in the ENC-plot
should lie on or just below Wright’s curve. In Figure 4, all distributions lie below the theoretical curve,
an indication that not only mutational bias but also natural selection plays a non-negligible role in the
codon choice in all genes. This is exemplified by the violinplots in Figure 5 of the distances between the
genes and Wright’s theoretical curve. Genes N, S, and RdRP are more scattered below the theoretical
curve than those of genes M and E, implying that in the latter the codon usage patterns are pretty
consistent with the effects of mutational bias. Interestingly, data points corresponding to the gene N,
which is the major viral structural component needed to protect and encapsidate the viral RNA, is
localized around GC3=0.5 (See Figure 4). This means that the displacement under the curve most likely
reflects the selective pressure exerted on this gene. Conservely, all other genes show a displacement

coronaviruses tend to use codons that end with A and U (see section 2.3).

A neutrality plot analysis was performed to estimate the role of mutational bias and natural
selection in shaping the codon usage patterns of the five genes under investigation. In this plot, the
average GC-content in the first and second positions of codons (GC12) is plotted against GC3s, which
is considered as a pure mutational parameter. In Figure 5, we report the neutrality plots obtained for
genes M, N, S, E, RdRP, together with the best-fit lines and the slopes associated with them.

merely due to mutational bias (no selective pressure). The black-dotted lines are the linear regressions.
Red dots represent 2019-nCoV genes.

151

The rationale to understand the results is that the wider is the deviation between the slope of the
regression line and the bisector, the stronger is the action of selective pressure. All correlations are
highly significant (Spearman correlation - R2 analysis, p-value<0.0001). By comparing the divergences
between the regression lines and the bisectors in each panel, we reveal that the five genes here
considered are subject to different balance between natural selection and mutational bias. Specifically,
in line with the ENC-plot analyses, the genes S and RdRP present the largest deviations of their
regression lines from the bisector lines and, therefore, a stronger action of natural selection. Conversely,
the regression line for the gene M is closer to the bisector than the other genes, meaning that the
this gene is the least one subject to the action of natural selection. Finally, the genes E and N are
intermediate between the previous cases.
It is worth noting that almost all data points are located below the bisector lines, implying a selective
tendency for a higher AT content in the first two codon positions than in the third one. In addition,
both GC3 and GC12 are lower than 0.5, thus showing a general preference for A and T bases in all
three codon positions. Interestingly, data points associated to gene M and E are closer to the bisector
lines as compared to gene N, S, and RdRP. This observation means that the GC content in the first
two codon positions tend to be in proportion to GC3 in gene M and E, and this partially explains the
closeness of these two genes to the Wright theoretical curve in Figure 4.

152

2.8. Forsdyke plot

153

We analyze the rate of evolution that characterize these genes by confronting the nucleotide
sequences of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV and their corrisponding protein sequences with those
of other coronaviruses here considered. Each gene of 2019-nCoV was compared to the orthologous
gene in one of the 30 coronaviruses to estimate evolutionary divergences. Each pair of homologous
genes is represented by a point in the Forsdyke plot [8], which correlates protein divergence with DNA
divergence. Each point in Forsdyke plots measures the divergence between pairs of orthologous genes
in the two species, as projected along with the phenotypic (protein) and nucleotidic (DNA) axis. Thus,
the slope is an estimation of the fraction of DNA mutations that result in amino acid substitutions

Overall, protein and DNA sequence divergences are linearly correlated, and these correlations
can be expressed through slopes and intercepts of the regression lines.
Genes M and E show quite low slopes, indicating that these proteins tend to evolve slowly by
accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, the steeper slopes for genes N, RdRP,
and S indicate that these genes tend to evolve faster compared to other ones. A plausible explanation
for this observation is that protein N due to its immunogenicity, has been frequently used to generate
specific antibodies against various animal coronavirus, including in SARS [24]. The viral replicase
polyprotein that is essential for the replication of viral RNA and, finally, the gene S encodes the protein
that is responsible for the “spikes” present on the surface of coronaviruses. Taken together, our results
suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these proteins could represent a major obstacle
to in the development of a antiviral therapeutics against 2019-nCoV.

3. Discussion

176

To investigate the factors leading to the 2019-nCoV and other viruses related to codon usage
patterns, several analytical methods were used in our study. First, the RSCU value of the 2019-nCoV
was calculated. Despite the high mutation rate that characterize 2019-nCoV, we do not show differences
in codon usage between these genomes. Moreover, their associated vectors did not cluster for
geographically positon, thus confirming the common origin of these genomes. The nucleotide
composition confirm higher AT% content and low GC% content as it is common in RNA viruses
such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [? ]. The results indicate also that codon usage
bias exists and that the 2019-nCoV preferred codons almost all end in U. The codon usage bias was
further confirmed by the mean ENC value of 51.9 (a value greater than 45 is considered as a slight
codon usage bias due to mutation pressure or nucleotide compositional constraints). The same analysis
is effectuated with CAI index, that it is calculated on the with RNA of codons expressed most often.
This suggests that the RNA viruses with high ENC values (and low CAI) adapt to the host with
various preferred codons. So a low biased codon usage pattern might allow the virus make use of
several codons for each amino acid, and might be beneficial for viral replication and translation in the

host cells. The ENC-plot analysis reveals that natural selection plays an important role in the codon
choice of the five conserved viral genes here considered: RdRP, S, E, M, and N. However, genes N, S,
and ORF1ab are more scattered below the theoretical curve than those of genes M and E, implying
that in the latters the codon usage is under more strict control by mutational bias. According with
this analysis, the genes S and RdRP present the largest deviations of their linear regressions from
the bisectors lines in the neutrality plot analysis that implies a stronger action of natural selection.
Conversely, the regression line for the gene M is closer to the bisector than the other genes, meaning
that this gene is the least one subject to the action of natural selection. Finally, the genes E and N are
intermediate between the previous cases.
To analyze the rate of evolution that characterize these genes by confronting the nucleotide sequences
we use the Forsdyke plot thar correlates protein divergence with DNA divergence. The two proteins
M and E show quite low slopes, indicating that these proteins tend to evolve slowly by accumulating
nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, the steeper slopes for gene N and RdRP and the
gene S encoding for the S protein, which is responsible for the “spikes” present on the surface of
coronaviruses, indicate that these three genes, and therefore their corresponding protein products,
tend to evolve faster compared to the other two genes. Findings of the present study could be directed
to be useful for developing diagnostic reagents and probes for detecting a range of viruses and isolates
in one test and for vaccine development, using the information about codon usage patterns in these
genes.

210

4.1. Sequence data analyzed

211

218

The complete coding genomic sequences of 306 isolates of nCov reported across the world to date,
were obtained from GISAID (available at https : //www.gisaid.org/epi f lu − applications/next −
hcov − 19 − app/) and NCBI viruses database accessed as on 17 March 2020.
Then the sequences are selected according to their geographical distribution, the isolation date,
and the host species. The complete coding genomic sequences of 30 coronaviruses were
downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) (available at https :
//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). For each virus we consider in following alphabetical order genes: E, M, N,
RdRP and S.

219

4.2. Nucleotide Composition Analysis

220

224

The diverse nucleotide compositional properties are calculated for the coding sequences of 30 CoV
genomes. These compositional properties comprise the frequencies of occurrence of each nucleotide
(A, T, G, and C), AU and GC contents, nucleotides G + C at the first (GC1), second (GC2), and third
codon positions (GC3). To calculate these values we use an in-house Python script. We calculate, also,
mean frequencies of nucleotides G + C at the first and the second positions (GC12).

225

4.3. RSCU

226

RSCU vectors for all the genomes were computed by using an in-house Python script, following
the formula:

In the RSCUi Xi is the number of occurrences, in a given genome, of codon i, and the sum in the
denominator runs over its ni synonymous codons. If the RSCU value for a codon i is equal to 1, this
codon was chosen equally and randomly. Codons with RSCU values greater than 1 have positive
codon usage bias, while those with value less than 1 have relatively negative codon usage bias [? ].

the average linkage algorithm.

4.4. Effective Number of Codons Analysis

232

ENC is an estimate of the frequency of different codons used in a coding sequence. In general,
ENC ranges from 20 (when each aminoacid is coded by just one and the same codon) to 61 (when all
synonymous codons are used on an equal footing). Given a sequence of interest, the computation of
ENC starts from Fα , a quantity defined for each family α of synonymous codons (one for each amino
acid):


nkα 2
Fα =
(2)
nα
where mα is the number of different codons in α (each one appearing n1α , n2α , ..., nmα times in the
α
sequence) and nα = ∑m
k =1 n k α .
ENC then weights these quantities on a sequence:
ENC = Ns +

K2 ∑αK=
1 nα

∑α=

K

∑α=
1 ( nα Fα )

(3)

238

where NS is the number of families with one codon only and Km is the number of families with
degeneracy m (the set of 6 synonymous codons for Leu can be split into one family with degeneracy 2,
similar to that of Phe, and one family with degeneracy 4, similar to that, e.g., of Pro).
We have evaluated ENC by using the implementation in DAMBE 5.0 [31].

239

4.5. Codon Adaptation Index

235
236
237

Codon adaptation index CAI [? ] is used to quantify the codon usage similarities between the
virus and host coding sequences. The principle behind CAI is that codon usage in highly expressed
genes can reveal the optimal (i.e., most efficient for translation) codons for each amino acid. Hence,
CAI is calculated based on a reference set of highly expressed genes to assess, for each codon i, the
relative synonymous codon usages (RSCUi ) and the relative codon adaptiveness (wi ):
Xi

RSCUi =
1
ni

ni

wi =

;

∑ Xj

RSCUi
;
max { RSCUj }

(4)

j=1,...,ni

j =1

In the RSCUi , Xi is the number of occurrences of codon i in the genome, and the sum in the denominator
runs over the ni synonyms of i; RSCUs thus measure codon usage bias within a family of synonymous
codons. wi is then defined as the usage frequency of codon i compared to that of the optimal codon
for the same amino acid encoded by i—i.e., the one which is mostly used in a reference set of highly
expressed genes. The CAI for a given gene g is calculated as the geometric mean of the usage
frequencies of codons in that gene, normalized to the maximum CAI value possible for a gene with
the same amino acid composition:

1/lg
lg

CAIg = ∏wi 

,

(5)

i =1

240
241
242
243
244
245

where the product runs over the l g codons belonging to that gene (except the stop codon).
This index values range from 0 to 1, where the score 1 represents the tendency of a gene to always
use the most frequently used synonymous codons in the host. The CAI analysis of these coding
sequences are performed using DAMBE 5.0 [31]. The synonymous codon usage data of different
hostes (human- Homo sapiens and other species) are retrieved from the codon usage database (available
at: http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/).

To study the patterns of codon bias in the coronaviruses, we use Z-score values:
Zv [( ENC )] =

h ENC i f amily − h ENC iv
√
,
σv / Nv

(6)

250

where h ENC i f amily is the average of the ratio within a codon bias index in a family of a virus v, h ENC iv
and σv are the average value of ENC and its standard deviation over the whole virus v, and Nv is the
number of virus in the family (we use the standard deviation of the mean as we are comparing average
values).
The same Z-score is evalueted for codon bias index CAI.

251

4.6. ENC plot

246
247
248
249

ENC-plot analysis was performed to estimate the relative contributions of mutational bias and
natural selection in shaping CUB of genes encoding for proteins that are crucial for 2019-nCoV: RdRP,
the spike-surface glycoprotein (protein S), the small envelop protein (protein E), the matrix protein
(M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The ENC-plot is a plot in which the ENC is the ordinate and the
GC3 is the abscissa. Depending on the action of mutational bias and natural selection, different cases
are discernable. If a gene is not subject to selection, a clear relationship is expected between ENC and
GC3 [? ]:
29
ENC = 2 + s + 2
(7)
s + (1 − s )2
252

259

where s represents the value of GC3 [? ]. Genes for which the codon choice is only constrained by
mutational bias are expected to lie on or just below the Wright’s theoretical curve. Alternatively, if
a particular gene is subject to selection, it will fall below Wright’s theoretical curve. In this case, the
vertical distance between the point and the theoretical curve provides an estimation of the relative
extent to which natural selection and mutational bias affect CUB.
To evaluate scatter of dots from theoretical Wright’s curve, we calculate the module of distance and we
drawn box plot calculated with an in-house Python script.

260

4.7. Neutrality plot

261

275

We used a neutrality plot analysis [? ] to estimate the relative contribution of natural selection
and mutational bias in shaping CUB of five crucial genes in the research field aiming to develop a
vacine against 2019-nCoV: M, N, S, RdRP, and E. In this analysis, the GC1 or GC2 values (ordinate)
are plotted against the GC3 values (abscissa), and each gene is represented as a single point on this
plane. In this case, the three stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA) and the three codons for isoleucine (ATT,
ATC, and ATA) were excluded in calculation of GC3, and two single codons for methionine (ATG)
and tryptophan (TGG) were excluded in all three (GC1, GC2, GC3) (Sueoka 1988). For each gene, we
separately performed a Spearman correlation analysis between GC1 and GC2 with the GC3. If the
correlation between GC1/2 and GC3 is statistically significant, the slope of the regression line provides
a measure of the relative extent to which natural selection and mutational bias affect CUB of these
genes (Sueoka 1999). In particular, if the mutational bias is the driving force that shapes CUB, then the
corresponding data points should be distributed along the bisector (slope of unity). On the other hand,
if natural selection also affects the codon choice of a family of genes, then the corresponding regression
line should diverge from the bisector. Thus, the extent of the divergence between the regression line
and the bisector indicates that the extent of codon choice due to the natural selection.

4.8. Forsdyke plot

277

To study the evolutionary rates of genes M, N, S, RdRP, and E, we performed an analysis by
using our previously defined Forsdyke plot [8]. Each gene in 2019-nCoV (taken as a reference) was
confronted with the homologous gene in one of the 30 coronaviruses considered in this analysis. Each

pair of homologous genes is represented by a point in the Forsdyke plot, which correlates protein
divergence with DNA divergence (see Methods in [8] for details). The protein sequences were aligned
using Biopython. The DNA sequences were then aligned using the protein alignments as templates.
Then, DNA divergences and protein divergences were assessed as axplained in Methods in [8] by
counting the number of mismatches in each pair of aligned sequences. Thus, each point in Forsdyke
plots measures the divergence between pairs of homologous genes in the two species, as projected
along with the phenotypic (protein) and nucleotidic (DNA) axis.The first step in each comparison is
to compute the regression line between protein vs. DNA sequence divergence in the Forsdyke plot
getting values of intercept and slope for each variant of gene. To test whether the regression parameters
associated with each variant are different or not, we have followed a protocol founded by F-statistic
test, considering a p-value ≤ 0.05.

291

4.9. Phylogenetic analysis

292

To explore the evolutionary relationships among the four genera of coronaviruses, phylogenetic
analysis of the full-length genomic sequences of the 30 CoVs listed in Table 1 was performed. The
sequences were aligned with the usage of ClustalO [21], [22]. The resulting multiple sequence
alignment was used to build a phylogenetic tree by employing a maximum-likelihood (ML) method
implemented in the software package MEGA version 10. 1 [15]. ModelTest-NG [6] was used to select
the best-fit evolutionary model of nucleotide substitution, that is, GTR + G + I. Bootstrap analysis (100
pseudo-replicates) was conducted in order to evaluate the statistical significance of the inferred trees.
