Abstract

17

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses

18

are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43.

19

Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection,

20

with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),

21

Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study,

22

Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by

23

alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of

24

superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell

cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside

26

downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection.

27

Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)

28

and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On

29

the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme

30

catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was

31

previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T

32

mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could

33

be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating

34

HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.

Author summary

37

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) generate respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E is one of four known HCoV

38

strains that circulate annually in the population for several decades. Beside these, three pandemic CoV

39

emerged since year 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East

40

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. These three strains attracted most

41

attention for extensive research and less consideration has been given to the commonly infecting HCoVs. In

42

this study we use Next generation sequencing analysis to understand global transcriptomic changes in human

43

host cells following HCoV-229E infection. We found several cellular pathways that change during infection

44

that involve cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle control, DNA replication, DNA repair, innate immune

45

response and an interesting RNA editing enzyme which could be involve in CoVs pathogenesis.

Introduction

50

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), which are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses

51

belonging to the Coronaviridae family, are associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory diseases [1, 2].

52

Thus far, seven types of HCoV have been discovered in humans, the majority (Alphacoronavirus species

53

HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E and betacoronavirus species HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43) being causative

54

agents of community-acquired infections. These HCoV infections occur primarily in the winter-spring season

55

[3-5] [6], however summer epidemics have been detected [7]. The other three HCoVs are the pandemic severe

56

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

57

(MERS-CoV) [8] and the newly pandemic SARS-CoV-2 [9].

58

HCoVs typically exploit three known receptors or O-acetylated sialic acids on the host cell surface to gain

59

entry [10]. Coronaviruses have an exceptionally large ~30 kb genome in polycistronic organization and

60

engage a unique transcription mechanism to generate mRNA [11]. They possess many non-structural proteins

61

(NSPs) that appear to have multiple functions in RNA processing, facilitating viral entry, gene expression and

62

virus release [10]. Many +ssRNA viruses use diverse strategies to subvert and exploit host protein synthesis

63

[12], with one central strategy involving inactivation of the elongation initiation complex by manipulating

64

kinase activities. Indeed, viral replication and protein expression are associated with endoplasmic reticulum

65

(ER) overload and subsequent stress responses which trigger host protein translation shutoff. Coronaviruses

66

have evolved to block or subvert these responses in order to restore ER homeostasis or block apoptosis [13].

67

Some coronaviruses have evolved to counteract the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), which prevents

68

translation by phosphorylating elongation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and upregulating antiviral gene expression,

69

including the production of interferons (IFNs) [10, 14]. Several additional innate immune receptors involved

70

in recognizing RNA viruses activate interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other cellular factors which fight

71

the viral intruders [15].

72

In the last decade, several studies have focused on host cell transcriptome changes subsequent to HCoV

73

infection. Microarray analysis in human A549 and HuH7 cells found HCoV-229E to attenuate the inducible

74

activity of NF-κB and to restrict the nuclear concentration of NF-κB subunits [16]. Another microarray

analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from SARS-CoV patients, described the altered

76

inflammatory and immune genes that may contribute to acute lung injury and imbalance of homeostasis [17].

77

Differential RNA sequencing analysis comparing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV–infected human Calu-3 cells

78

showed that both viruses induced a similar activation pattern of recognition receptors and of the interleukin 17

79

(IL-17) pathway, however, only MERS-CoV downregulated the expression of type I and II major

80

histocompatibility complex genes [18]. Transcriptomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 patients identified

81

excessive cytokine release, activation of apoptosis and of the p53 signaling pathway [19]. Global

82

transcriptomic sequencing to shed light on the influence of common circulating HCoVs on host cells is

83

lacking. Thus, this study used RNA-next generation sequencing (NGS) to track the transcriptomic changes in

84

human MRC-5 cells following infection with HCoV-229E.

85

Results

86

RNA extracted at various time points following infection of MRC5 with HCoV-229E, demonstrated rapid

87

viral propagation inside the host cells, reaching maximal levels at 24 HPI and remained stable for several days

88

(Fig 1A). Viral copies began to emerge in the supernatant at 24 HPI and gradually increased over time (Fig

89

1B). At 96 HPI, MRC5 cell counts began to decline and the cells were not viable a day later. In parallel to the

90

high replication rate of HCoV-229E, a robust change in the MRC5 transcriptome was observed, with 1465

91

transcripts already showing a >2-fold change at 6 HPI ('early genes') as compared to uninfected cells. The

92

number of active genes continued to increase as infection progressed, until it reached over 5000 transcripts at

93

48-72 HPI (Fig 1C).

94

Prediction of canonical pathways based on the most significant gene enrichment included eIF2 signaling, cell

95

cycle control of chromosomal replication, cholesterol biosynthesis superpathway, BRCA1-associated DNA

96

damage response and other cell cycle checkpoint regulation pathways (Fig 2A). More specifically, 205 gene

97

annotations in the NGS analysis were categorized in the eIF2 signaling pathway, of which 64.88% genes were

98

active/inactive in MRC5 cells. At early stages of infection, considerable downregulation of the eIF2 signaling

99

pathway was observed in MRC5 cells, a trend which increased as infection progressed (Fig 2, B-I). In this

100

pathway, over 80 genes which are coding to ribosomal protein subunits (RPLs and RPSs) were downregulated

during infection (data not presented). The cell cycle control of chromosomal replication pathway includes

102

genes that are involved in the strict control of DNA origin replication points. In our analysis, 57 genes were

103

annotated to this pathway in IPA software, of which 64.91% were active/inactive in MRC5 cells. Genes in this

104

pathway were upregulated mostly at the early stages of HCoV-229E infection (22 genes at 6 HPI), but lightly

105

active during the late stages of infections (Fig 2, B-II). Two of the most significantly upregulated early genes

106

in this pathway were ORC1 and CDC6, both of which initiate assembly of a pre-replication complex at DNA

107

replication origins [20]. In the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, 18 genes were downregulated in MRC5 cells,

108

15 of which at 6 HPI (Fig 2, B-III). During infection, the BRCA1 and DNA damage response pathway was

109

active (48.75% of 80 genes) in MRC5 cells. Many genes in the pathway were upregulated within 6-24 HPI,

110

followed by a gradual decline in gene expression as infection persisted (Fig 2, B-IV). To confirm the data of

111

RNA-Sequencing, MRC5 cells were infected with HCoV-229E and total RNA was extracted and analyzed by

112

qRT-PCR for the detection of several selected mRNAs with differential expression (Fig 2C). Relative gene

113

expression was calculated for 2 transcripts in the cell cycle control of chromosomal replication pathway,

114

ORC1 and CDK1 mRNA (Fig 2C- I and II respectively) and one eIF2 pathway factor, ATF3 mRNA (Fig 2C-

115

III).

116

Next, expression of genes involved in antiviral response were analyzed. In a database of 319 genes involved in

117

"antiviral response", 256 genes were found in our NGS analysis, of which 105 were active in MRC5 cells

118

during HCoV-229E infection. Strikingly, as shown in figure 3A, 82% of the antiviral genes were

119

downregulated at 6 HPI, and 65% were downregulated genes at 24 HPI. Only at 48-72 HPI did the profile

120

change, with 58% of the genes showing upregulated levels as compared to control cells (Fig 3A). The

121

temporal expression of 23 early activated antiviral genes (6 HPI), as shown in figure 3B, indicates that most of

122

the downregulated genes remained inactive (below 2 fold change) during infection. In general, these genes

123

included a cluster of ISGs, e.g., the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 1 and 2 (IRF1 and IRF2)

124

and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) family members, a major branch of the

125

immune antiviral response [21, 22]. Furthermore, an early regulator of the response to viral RNA detection,

126

DHX58 (also known as LPG2 or RIG-I-like receptor 3 (RLR-3)), was downregulated (-2.25 fold) following

127

HCoV-229E infection, as was suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) (-2.09 fold). SOCS1 is involved in

negative regulation of cytokines that signal through the JAK/STAT pathway which induces expression of

129

IFN-stimulated genes [23, 24]. PCR analysis of CLU transcript, one of the early antiviral response genes (Fig

130

3B), validated the trend of expression observed in the NGS analysis (Fig 3C).

131

Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was upregulated in early antiviral

132

responses in infected MRC5 cells (Fig 3B). APOBEC3 proteins play essential roles in innate immunity by

133

deaminating cytidine in RNA (C-to-U) and/or DNA (C-to-T), restricting foreign viral RNA/DNA [25].

134

Mutational analysis suggests that pandemic corona viruses show a pattern of APOBEC activity in infected

135

cells [26]. Thus we analyzed genomic sequences of HCoV-229E and of the most recent outbreak of SARS-

136

CoV-2 in search of variant viruses showing characteristics of APOBEC editing activity. We downloaded 303

137

partial and complete genomes of HCoV-229E obtained from clinical samples (From the ViPR database) and

138

showed that C-to-T mutations occurred as frequently as T-to-C mutations (Fig 4A). However, a first analysis

139

of broncho-alveolar lavage fluids derived from two Wuhan patients showed nucleotide changes that may be

140

signatures of RNA editing [26]. In a larger analysis, using the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data

141

GISAID SARS-CoV-2 sequence database, Korber et al. found a distinct bias for C-to-T mutations (47%) in

142

the spike protein [27]. In order to further characterize the mutation in the whole genomic sequence of the

143

SARS-CoV-2, 16600 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from different origins were downloaded from the hCoV-19

144

database and compared; 41% of the variation between the sequences were C-to-T (Fig 4B). Higher correlation

145

was found between C-to-T occurrences and geographic regions characterized with high mortality as compared

146

to lower mortality (R2=0.222, R2=0.065 respectively) (Fig 4C-D), suggesting that the new emerging CoV

147

may use the APOBEC nucleotide editing activity to increase its virulence.

148

Discussion

149

This study sought to shed light on host transcriptome responses to common infecting HCoVs, using NGS and

150

bioinformatics tools. More specifically, it aimed to examine major transcriptomic changes occurring over

151

several cycles of HCoV-229E infection in human host cells. Several cellular pathways that were affected early

152

in infection were identified, i.e., eIF2 signaling, cell cycle, cholesterol biosynthesis, BRCA1-associated DNA

153

damage response and cellular innate immune factors.

The fluidity of membranes is dependent on the presence and structure of specific lipids and sterols. While

155

cholesterol increases membrane fluidity by interfering with the packing of acyl chains, it can also reduce the

156

flexibility of neighboring unsaturated acyl chains [28, 29]. Viruses may remodel lipid metabolism and

157

membrane structure to form a microenvironment suitable for infection [29]. Lipidomic analyses have

158

uncovered a striking rearrangement of fatty acids and phospholipids in the cellular membrane upon HCoV-

159

229E and MERS-CoV infection [30, 31]. The current NGS analysis indicated that the cholesterol biosynthesis

160

pathway is inhibited in multiple stages following HCoV-229E infection (Fig 2, A and B-III). Cholesterol can

161

promote coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) entry to the cells [29]. When cholesterol was depleted by

162

methyl β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) or supplemented in growth media, it reduced or increased cells susceptibility

163

to MHV respectively [32]. These various cholesterol levels are correlated with S-protein-mediated membrane

164

fusion rather than binding activities [32]. HCoV-229E binds to CD13 in lipid rafts and enters the cell through

165

caveolae [33]. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol by MβCD disrupted the co-localization of HCoV-

166

229E and caveolin-1 and decreased the intracellular occurrence of HCoV-229E [33] . Both SARS-CoV-1 and

167

SARS-CoV-2 S proteins bind the host cell receptor ACE2 [34]. This receptor is localized in cholesterol-rich

168

microdomains, which are important for the efficient interaction of the S protein with ACE2 [35]. Depletion of

169

plasma membrane cholesterol with MβCD in Vero E6 cells relocalized the raft-resident marker caveolin-1 as

170

well as ACE2 to a non-raft environment, and inhibited infectivity of the virus [36]. Intriguingly, cholesterol

171

depletion by pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with MβCD reduced the release of SARS-CoV particles and the

172

levels of viral mRNAs were significantly decreased. However, cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage (3

173

HPI) caused only a limited effect on virus particle release [37]. It remains to be determined if inhibition of the

174

cholesterol biosynthesis superpathway in MRC5 cells is an attempt of the host to interfere with HCoV-229E

175

infection, or a response of the virus to establish a suitable environment for infection. If the cholesterol

176

biosynthesis superpathway is inhibited, the basic acetyl-CoA molecule could be directed to other metabolic or

177

synthetic pathways.

178

Acetyl-CoA is a major substrate used in the transfer of acetyl groups to lysine residues of histones, which

179

results in increased accessibility of chromatin to DNA-binding proteins to the exposed sites, where they can

180

then activate gene transcription [38]. In HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells, changes in several pathways that

could be linked together were observed, i.e., cell cycle regulation, control of chromosomal replication and the

182

role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response. Cell cycle control of the chromosomal replication pathway refers to

183

the strict control of the chromosomal origin of replication. This pathway includes the six-subunit origin

184

recognition complex (ORC), cell division control protein 6 (Cdc6) AAA+ ATPase, minichromosome

185

maintenance (MCM) protein complex, cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) and others [39]. Marked

186

upregulation of this pathway was observed in early stages of HCoV-229E infection. Exploitation of host ORC

187

has been extensively described in Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, where the virus utilizes its own

188

EBNA1 to recruit host replication initiation machinery [40, 41]. Similarly, coronaviruses manipulate the cell

189

at various stages, which can differ between the specific coronaviruses and even between host cell types [10].

190

In the present analysis, upregulation of cyclins and cell cycle regulation pathway was observed, together with

191

downregulation of checkpoint regulation Growth 1 (G1) to Synthesis (S) phases, implying that cells enter the

192

DNA synthesis phase. Functional annotation analysis supported these observations, where "Interphase",

193

"Segregation of chromosomes", "G1/S phase transition", "S phase" and "M phase" annotations were

194

upregulated at 6 HPI in MRC5 cells (data not presented, IPA software). Many DNA and RNA viruses are

195

known to manipulate cell cycle at different stages, in efforts to increase the efficiency of virus replication by

196

subverting host-cell functions [42]. This action is not restricted to DNA viruses or retroviruses, which

197

primarily replicate in the nucleus, but also RNA viruses, which mainly replicate in the cytoplasm [43]. For

198

instance, infection with measles, a negative ssRNA viruses, leads to cell arrest in G0 stage [44] and simian

199

parainfluenza virus 5 (SV5) promotes prolonged G1 and G2 phases [45]. The positive-ssRNA avian

200

coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was shown to induce cell cycle arrest at both S and G2/M phases

201

for the enhancement of viral replication and progeny production [46-48]. Betacoronavirus MHV infection

202

causes decreased hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), resulting in arrest of cell cycle

203

progression from G1 to S [49]. Transient expression of the SARS-CoV 3a structural protein inhibits cell

204

growth and prevents 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, suggesting that it inhibits cell cycle progression

205

[50]. The current analysis suggests that HCoV-229E causes cell cycle arrest mainly in S phase and benefits

206

from this cellular recruitment for chromosomal replication.

As MRC5 cells enter DNA replication stage during HCoV-229E infection, mutations can occur. Accordingly,

208

upregulation of BRCA1-associated DNA damage response was observed. To avoid passage of accumulated

209

DNA damage to daughter cells, cell cycle checkpoints are activated to regulate cell growth and division,

210

allowing cells to repair the damage before resuming cell cycle progression [51]. DNA damage activates the

211

kinases ATM, ATR and CHK2, which, in turn, activate BRCA1 by phosphorylation [52]. The tumor repressor

212

BRCA1 is recruited to DNA damage sites, promotes DNA damage checkpoint activation and DNA damage

213

repair [51, 53]. BRCA1 has been suggested to be responsible for or involved in the activation for G1/S, S-

214

phase and G2/M checkpoints [53-56]. Activation of the ATR-dependent cellular DNA damage response is one

215

of the mechanisms exploited by IBV to induce cell cycle S-phase arrest [46]. Activation of the cellular DNA

216

damage response by the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes cell cycle arrest in the S

217

phase, thereby upregulating DNA replication factors in the cytoplasm, which are exploited for viral replication

218

[10, 46].

219

Translation is a key step in the regulation of gene expression and one of the most energy-consuming processes

220

in the cell. In homeostasis, the eIF2 machinery actively participates in the regulation of protein synthesis and

221

its dysregulation is thought to contribute to pathological conditions [57]. While proper synthesis is crucial for

222

the innate antiviral immune response, viruses rely on the host translation machinery and directly interfere with

223

the function of transcription factors or with signaling pathways that regulate translation, to favor synthesis of

224

viral proteins [12]. Coronaviruses modulate host protein synthesis through different mechanisms, which

225

contributes to their pathogenicity [10]. Like other viruses, coronaviruses overload the ER with the production

226

of viral proteins, thus triggering an ER stress response. SARS-CoV, MHV, IBV and TGEV intervene with ER

227

stress and eIF2 regulators to ensure continuous production of functional viral proteins [13]. In the current

228

study, downregulation of the eIF2 signaling pathway occurred at early stages of HCoV-229E infection. This is

229

assume to be in response to the robust growth of HCoV-229E inside the cells (Fig 1A), which presumably

230

causes ER overload at early stages of infection, thereby triggering a stress response, including manipulation of

231

eIF2 signaling (Fig 2, B-I), as reported for other CoVs [13].

232

Viral dsRNA and 5′-triphosphate-RNA molecules are present in the cytosol and recognized by intracellular

233

sensors. These sensors activate signaling pathways that generally activate IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs) and

NF-κB. The latter triggers the excretion of cytokines and Type-I IFN, which activate JAK-STAT signaling,

235

which, in turn, induces expression of antiviral ISGs [58, 59]. Since the present NGS analysis identified broad

236

downregulation of ISG transcripts (Fig 3), it can be assumed that the HCoV infection interfered with upstream

237

regulators of IFN transcription. Indeed, downregulation of IRF1 and IRF2 transcription factors (Fig 3B),

238

which are responsible for inducing the expression of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines [60], and which

239

are necessary for positive regulation of Toll-like receptor 3 transcription that recognizes dsRNA [22, 61-63],

240

was observed. Similarly microarray analysis of an acute case of SARS-CoV revealed upregulation of pro- and

241

anti-inflammatory signals and downregulation of many IFN-stimulated genes [17]. Upregulation of

242

APOBEC3B was demonstrated in the early stages of HCoV-229E infection (Fig 3B). Induction of APOBEC3

243

family members is augmented by IFN-α [64]. APOBEC3B is a DNA cytidine deaminase that prevents

244

interspecies DNA transmission by conversion of cytosines of foreign DNA to uracil, leading to

245

hypermutations [65-67]. RNA editing activity of this cytidine deaminase was first demonstrated in human

246

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and later in measles, mumps and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [68, 69].

247

Upregulation of several APOBEC3 transcripts was observed in cultured human airway epithelium (HAE) cells

248

following HCoV-NL63 infection. More specifically, three APOBEC family proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H)

249

inhibited viral infection in vitro but did not cause hypermutation of the HCoV-NL63 genome [70]. Viral RNA

250

sequencing and mutational analysis has suggested that both APOBEC and adenosine deaminase acting on

251

RNA (ADAR) deaminases are involved in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genome editing [26].

252

The present analysis showed that the mutational imprint of APOBEC proteins is less distinct in commonly

253

infecting HCoVs, which have been circulating for decades [70] (Fig 4). However, APOBEC proteins may

254

cause antigenic drift that shapes the spread of new pandemic CoVs [26] (Fig 4).

255
256

This work used NGS and bioinformatics approaches to demonstrate the influence of HCoV-229E on the host

257

cell transcriptome. Several pathways that were altered were discussed, mainly involving alterations of the host

258

cell cycle regulation, metabolic processes, protein synthesis machinery and cellular innate antiviral responses.

259

This study provides important data and expands our current understanding of the pathology and treatment

260

targets of common HCoVs and newly emerging Coronaviridae.

Methods

263

Viruses and cell cultures

264

HCoV-229E virus was purchased from ATCC (VR740™) along with its recommended human host cell lines

265

MRC5. Cells were grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf

266

serum (FCS). After a 24-hour culture to 80-90% confluency, cells were infected with 0.01 multiplicity of

267

infection (MOI) of virus. HCoV-229E was grown in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, at 35°C. Cells and

268

virus were incubated for 2-7 days as per the manufacturer recommendations.

269

RNA extraction and preparation

270

Total RNA was extracted at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-HCoV-229E infection, using NucliSENS®

271

easyMag®, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At each time point, three biological repeats were tested.

272

All RNA samples were treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNaseI (Promega, USA), according to the

273

manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape for

274

TapeStation System (Agilent Technologies, Germany).

275

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)

276

Viral load in both supernatants and cells was determined as described by Dare et al. [71]. Validation of gene

277

expression was performed using SensiFAST™ SYBR® Lo-ROX One-Step Kit, according to the

278

manufacturer's instructions (Bioline Reagents Ltd). The primers used for validations were as follow: ORC1:

279

F-5'-AGAGCCATCCTCGCAGAGTT,

CLU:

F-5'-

280

CDK1:

For NGS analysis the RNA samples (>8 RNA integrity number (RIN)) were prepared using the Illumina

286

TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 and sequenced in Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencer. Software and

287

applications used for sequencing and data analysis were as follows: library quality control: FASTQC version

288

0.11.5, quality and adapter trimming: trim_galore (uses cutadapt version 1.10), mapping: Tophat2 version

289

2.1.0 (uses Bowtie2 version 2.2.6), gene counting: HTseq-count version 0.6.1/0.11.2, normalization and

290

differential expression analysis: DESeq2 R package version 1.18.1. Sequencing and quality control were conducted by

291

the Technion Genome Center (TGC). RNA-Seq library is available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository,

292

accession number GSE155986. Data analysis was performed using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN

293

IPA) software. Transcriptomic reads at each time point were compared to the uninfected cells. Canonical

294

pathways were analyzed with highest –log(p-value) (significance of gene enrichment for any given pathway)

295

and highest z-score (directional effect). Diseases and Functions Analysis in IPA software predicts cellular

296

processes and biological functions based on gene expression and predicts directional change on that effect

297

(IPA manual). A database of 319 "antiviral response"–annotated genes were pooled from the IPA database

298

and compared to the collected transcriptome dataset. TIBCO Spotfire version 7.7.0.39 was used for data

299

analysis, filtering and visualization, including heatmap generation. Whole genomic sequences of the SARS-

300

CoV-2 were downloaded from the hCoV-19 data base (GSAID; more than 16600 sequences, at May 12 2020).

301

Sequences of HCoV-229E were obtained from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource

302

(ViPR) [73] through the web site at http://www.viprbrc.org/. For genomic analysis we used the bioinformatics

303

toolkit Augur (https://nextstrain-augur.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Fig 1. Change in gene expression following HCoV-229E infection. (A-B) Viral propagation of HCoV-

469

229E. MRC5 cells, 24-hour culture to 80-90% confluency, were infected with 0.01 multiplicity of infection

470

(MOI) of HCoV-229E virus. Cells and virus were grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM)

471

supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) in incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, at 35°C.

472

Total RNA was extracted at the indicated hours post infection (HPI) and viral load was determined in both

473

cells (A) or growth media (B) by qPCR analysis. (C) Active transcripts in HCoV-229E –infected MRC5 cells.

474

Total RNA samples of MRC5-infected cells (from section A) were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA

475

Library Preparation Kit v2 and sequenced in Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencer. Software and applications used

476

for sequencing and data analysis are specified in the methods. Total number of upregulated (>2 fold change,

477

red bars) or downregulated (<-2 fold change, blue bars) genes at the indicated HPI was calculated by

478

comparing to gene expression to that measured in uninfected cells.
