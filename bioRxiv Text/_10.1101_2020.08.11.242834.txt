ABSTRACT
AT-527, an orally administered double prodrug of a guanosine nucleotide analog, has been shown
previously to be highly efficacious and well tolerated in HCV-infected subjects. Herein we report
the potent in vitro activity of AT-511, the free base form of AT-527, against several coronaviruses,
including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. In normal human airway epithelial (HAE)
cell preparations, the average concentration of AT-511 required to inhibit replication of SARSCoV-2 by 90% (EC90) was 0.5 µM, very similar to the EC90 for AT-511 against HCoV-229E, HCoVOC43 and SARS-CoV in Huh-7 cells. No cytotoxicity was observed for AT-511 in any of the antiviral
assays up to the highest concentration tested (100 µM). Surprisingly, AT-511 was 30-fold less
active against MERS-CoV. This differential activity may provide a clue to the apparent unique
mechanism of action of the guanosine triphosphate analog formed from AT-527.

INTRODUCTION
A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was
recently identified as the pathogen that causes the potentially life-threatening disease called
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has rapidly spread across the world. Currently there
are no vaccines or therapeutics approved to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or to treat COVID-19.
Recently remdesivir, the prodrug of an adenosine nucleotide analog, originally developed for the
treatment of Ebola virus infections, has demonstrated potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV2 (Wang et al., 2020) and has shown sufficient promise in the treatment of COVID-19 patients
(Beigel et al., 2020) such that the FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorization to this
nucleotide prodrug. The limited oral bioavailability of remdesivir (Eastman et al., 2020), however,
requires that it be administered via intravenous infusion, thus limiting its use to hospitalized
patients. COVID-19 is an acute viral infection for which antiviral therapeutics will be most

effective within the first stage of the infection when viral load is at its maximum, with rapid viral
replication initially in nasal, throat and pulmonary cells (Mason, 2020). Only the availability of a
potent, safe, oral antiviral administered to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in their early stage of
disease will avert clinical illness and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.
AT-527, an oral double prodrug of a guanosine nucleotide analog, has demonstrated potent in
vitro activity against clinical isolates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) by inhibiting the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Good et al., 2020). Supported by a comprehensive preclinical toxicology
and safety pharmacology package, AT-527 has recently been evaluated in a Phase 1B study
(Berliba et al., 2019) and a Phase 2 clinical trial (Mungar, et al. 2020). In the latter study, AT-527
was safe and well-tolerated for up to 12 weeks in HCV-infected subjects and achieved a high rate
of efficacy. Amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the activity of AT-511, the free base of AT-527, was
tested in vitro against several human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS
In an initial screening, BHK-21 cells acutely infected with a seasonal human alpha coronavirus,
HCoV-229E, were exposed to serial dilutions of AT-511. After a 3-day incubation, the effective
concentration of AT-511 required to achieve 50% inhibition (EC50) of the virus-induced cytopathic
effect (CPE) from two independent experiments averaged 1.8 µM (Table 1). In contrast, the 2’fluoro-2’-methyl uridine nucleotide prodrug sofosbuvir did not inhibit HCoV-229E replication at
concentrations as high as 100 µM. No toxicity was detected from either drug.
The in vitro potency of AT-511 against HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 (another seasonal human
coronavirus strain), MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV was then evaluated in Huh-7 cell-based assays. This
human hepatocarcinoma cell line was selected based on its ability to activate AT-511
intracellularly to its triphosphate metabolite, unlike MRC-5 cells in which AT-511 lacked activity
against HCoV-229E (EC50 >100 µM; Good et al., 2020). Antiviral activity was assessed by two
different methods after exposure of Huh-7 cells to virus and serial dilutions of test compound by
determining 1) the EC50 for virus-induced CPE by neutral red dye staining after a 5-day (229E and
OC43) or 7-day (MERS and SARS) incubation and 2) the effective concentration required to reduce
secretion of infectious virus into the culture medium by 90% (EC90) after a 3-day incubation using
a standard endpoint dilution CCID50 assay to determine virus yield reduction (VYR). Half-maximal
cytotoxicity (CC50) was measured by neutral red staining of compound-treated duplicates in the
absence of virus. Although a robust VYR endpoint was obtained in Huh-7 cells infected with HCoVOC43 or SARS-CoV, CPE was not observed and EC50 values using neutral red staining were not
obtained with these viruses. Individual determinations of EC90 values for AT-511 against HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV ranged from 0.34 to 1.2 µM, whereas the value against MERSCoV averaged 37 µM (Table 1). No cytotoxicity was detected with AT-511 up to 86 µM, the highest
concentration tested.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine appeared to be quite potent against HCoV-229E and HCoVOC43 based on their EC90 values of <0.05 µM obtained using VYR measurements (Table 1). The
respective EC50 values for these two drugs (8.1 and 7.4 µM), obtained using the neutral red assay,
were substantially higher and only 2.6- to 3.6-fold less than the corresponding CC50 values,

indicating considerably lower potencies and poor selectivity indices. These differences illustrate
an inherent error in assessing antiviral activities of cytotoxic compounds using only
measurements of VYR. When cells are poisoned by toxic drugs and are progressing toward death,
their ability to support viral replication and propagation in addition to their own health likely is
greatly diminished. At the point when cell death is detected by staining, viral yield reduction
measurements likely reflect a combination of antiviral activity and cytotoxicity, thus
overestimating antiviral potencies.
In contrast to a recent publication (Wang et al., 2020), Huh-7 cells were not permissive for
replication of SARS-CoV-2. An assay was developed using normal human airway epithelial (HAE)
cells, a highly relevant in vitro model of the lung, which has been established as a more
representative system than cell lines for SARS-CoV-2 replication (Jonsdottir and Dijkman, 2016).
These primary cells form polarized monolayers, the apical side of which is exposed to air and
produces a mucin layer, consistent with the physiology of the human airways (Sheahan et al.,
2020). Average EC90 and CC50 values for AT-511 against SARS-CoV-2 from two separate HAE
assays (0.5 and >86 µM, respectively) were in the same range as those obtained for HCoV-OC43
and SARS-CoV (Table 1).
In the second HAE assay, the activity of AT-511 was tested in parallel with N4-hydroxycytidine
(the nucleoside formed from the mutagenic oral prodrug EIDD-2801) with recently reported in
vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Sheahan et al., 2020). The potency of N4hydroxycytidine against SARS-CoV-2 (EC90 = 3.9 µM) was 8 times less than that of AT-511 in the
same experiment.
DISCUSSION
The 30-fold difference of AT-511 activity between MERS-CoV and other CoVs is puzzling.
Nucleotide and nucleotide analogue selection is achieved at the CoV RdRp active site, the nsp12
gene product activated by its processivity co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 (Subissi et al., 2014).
Conserved amino acid motifs A and C are involved in phosphodiester bond formation, whereas
motifs F and B participate in nucleotide channeling and binding at the active site, respectively.
No significant structural differences are apparent between MERS-CoV and other CoVs in these
essential motifs. With a similar ribose modification between AT-511 and sofosbuvir, it is unlikely
that the selective lack of activity of sofosbuvir would be due to excision by the CoV exonuclease
carried by nsp14 (Ferron et al., 2018). Rather, our results suggest that the triphosphate formed
from AT-511 most likely targets another less conserved viral GTP-binding protein, whose
inhibition would account for both the antiviral effect and the MERS-CoV differential sensitivity
pattern.
To date, human safety and tolerability have been confirmed in more than 40 HCV-infected
patients treated orally with once-daily administration of 550 mg of AT-527 for seven days and up
to 12 weeks. Excellent pharmacokinetics (50-60% bioavailability and long intracellular half-life of
the active metabolite) associated with a dosing regimen of a 1,100 mg loading dose, followed by
550 mg BID, should provide lung drug exposures consistently above its in vitro EC90 of 0.5 µM

against SARS-CoV-2 replication and should lead to a very effective antiviral treatment. A Phase 2
clinical trial is currently ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AT-527 in COVID-19
patients. Additionally, the differential activities AT-511 against MERS-CoV in comparison to the
other CoVs tested and of AT-511 in comparison to sofosbuvir against HCoV-229E are being
exploited to probe the unique mechanism of inhibition of the active guanosine triphosphate
analog formed from AT-527.

Corporation, Ashland, MA. AT-511 and N4-hydroxycytidine were prepared for Atea
Pharmaceuticals by Topharman Shanghai Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China and Oxeltis, Montpellier,
France, respectively. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were purchased from Mason-Chem,
Palo Alto, CA and sofosbuvir was purchased from Pharma Sys, Inc., Cary, NC.
Antiviral assays in BHK-21 cells: Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 100 mM and then
diluted in Minimum Essential Medium with Earle’s salts (MEM-E) containing 1 mM sodium
pyruvate and 25 µg/mL kanamycin, supplemented with 10% FBS (growth medium) to final
concentrations of 100, 20, 4 and 0.8 µM (two 24-well replica plates each). After BHK-21 cells
were grown to confluency in 96-well plates, growth medium was replaced with fresh
maintenance medium (growth medium with 1% inactivated FBS in place of 10% FBS) containing
serially diluted test compound and HCoV-229E at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01.
Uninfected cells in the presence of serially diluted compound were used to assess the
cytotoxicity of compounds. After a 3-day incubation at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2
atmosphere, cell viability was determined by the MTT method (Pauwels et al., 1988). The
effective concentration of test compound required to prevent virus-induced cytopathic effect
(CPE) by 50% (EC50) and to cause 50% cell death in the absence of virus (CC50) were calculated
by regression analysis.
Antiviral assays in Huh-7 and RD cells: The antiviral activities of test compounds were
evaluated against human coronaviruses alpha (229E), beta (OC43), MERS (EMC) and SARS
(Urbani) using a neutral red assay to determine inhibition of virus-induced and compoundinduced CPE and using a virus yield reduction (VYR) assay as a second, independent
determination of the inhibition of viral replication.
Neutral red assay: Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg/mL
and serially diluted using eight half-log dilutions in test medium (Minimum Essential Medium
supplemented with 5% FBS and 50 µg/mL gentamicin) so that the highest test concentration
was 50 µg/mL. Each dilution was added to 5 wells of a 96-well plate with 80-100% confluent
Huh-7 or RD cells (OC43 only). Three wells of each dilution were infected with virus, and two
wells remained uninfected as toxicity controls. Six untreated wells were infected as virus
controls and six untreated wells were left uninfected to use as virus controls. Viruses were
diluted to achieve MOIs of 0.003, 0.002, 0.001 and 0.03 CCID50 per cell for 229E, OC43, MERS
and SARS, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37±2°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.
On day 5 (229E and OC43) or day 7 (MERS and SARS) post-infection, when untreated virus
control wells reached maximum CPE, the plates were stained with neutral red dye for
approximately 2 hours (±15 minutes). Supernatant dye was removed, wells were rinsed with
PBS, and the incorporated dye was extracted in 50:50 Sorensen citrate buffer/ethanol for
>30 minutes and the optical density was read on a spectrophotometer at 540 nm. Optical
densities were converted to percent of controls and the concentrations of test compound
required to prevent virus-induced CPE by 50% (EC50) and to cause 50% cell death in the
absence of virus (CC50) were calculated.

Virus yield reduction assay: Vero 76 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and grown overnight
(37°C) to confluence. A sample of the supernatant fluid from each compound concentration
was collected on day 3 post infection (3 wells pooled) and tested for virus titer using a standard
endpoint dilution CCID50 assay and titer calculations using the Reed-Muench equation (1938)
and the concentration of compound required to reduce virus yield by 90% (EC90) was
determined by regression analysis.
Antiviral assays in HAE cell preparations: The antiviral activities of test compounds were
evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) using made to order differentiated normal
human bronchial epithelial (HAE) cells.
Cell Culture: HAE cells were grown on 6mm mesh disks and arrived in kits with either 12- or 24well transwell inserts. During transportation the tissues were stabilized on a sheet of agarose,
which was removed upon receipt. One insert was estimated to consist of approximately 1.2 x
106 cells. Kits of cell inserts (EpiAirwayTM AIR-100 or AIR-112) originated from a single donor, #
9831, a 23-year old, healthy, non-smoking, Caucasian male. The cells form polarized
monolayers, the apical side of which is exposed to air and creates a mucin layer. Upon arrival,
the cell transwell inserts were immediately transferred to individual wells of a 6-well plate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and 1 mL of MatTek’s proprietary culture medium
(AIR-100-MM) was added to the basolateral side, whereas the apical side was exposed to a
humidified 5% CO2 environment. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 for one day before the start of the experiment. After the 24-h equilibration
period, the mucin layer, secreted from the apical side of the cells, was removed by washing
with 400 µL pre-warmed 30 mM HEPES buffered saline solution 3X. Culture medium was
replenished following the wash steps.
Viruses: Virus was diluted in AIR-100-MM medium before infection to yield a MOI when added
to cultures of approximately 0.0015 CCID50 per cell.
Experimental design: Each compound treatment (120 L) and virus (120 L) was applied to the
apical side, and the compound treatment (1 mL) was applied to the basal side. As a virus
control, some of the cells were treated with cell culture medium only. After a 2-h infection
incubation, the apical medium was removed, and the basal medium was replaced with fresh
compound or medium (1 mL). The cells were maintained at the air-liquid interface. On day 5,
cytotoxicity (CC50 values) in the uninfected, compound-treated inserts was estimated by visual
inspection, and the basal medium was removed from all inserts and discarded. Virus released
into the apical compartment of the HAE cells was harvested by the addition of 400 µL of culture
medium that was pre-warmed at 37C. The contents were incubated for 30 min, mixed well,
collected, thoroughly vortexed and plated on Vero 76 cells for VYR titration. Separate wells
were used for virus control and duplicate wells were used for untreated cell controls. Virus
titers from each treated culture were determined as described above.
