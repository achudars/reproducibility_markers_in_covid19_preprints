Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a global

13

testing supply shortage. In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately

14

increase testing capacity. Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care

15

Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the Xpert® Xpress SARS-

16

CoV-2 assay limit of detection was comparable to central laboratory reverse-transcription quantitative PCR tests

17

with observed SARS-CoV-2 detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert® Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after

18

samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were diluted into six sample pools. Based on these data, we

19

recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted by

20

population public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or pooling depth, is unique for each

21

point-of-care test site and should be determined by assessing positive test rates. To statistically determine

22

appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes

23

and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities

24

to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented demand for global

30

testing supplies. In response, public health officials are searching for innovative ways to increase testing capacity

31

in the face of limited resources. One approach that could be rapidly deployed to achieve increased SARS-CoV-2

32

testing capacity is pooled sample testing. The number of samples to be combined into each test pool, or pooling

33

depth, is determined by test sensitivity and community disease prevalence, with some laboratories pooling up to

34

10 (1), 30 (2), or 48 (3) samples using the Corman quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) test (4).

35

Similar strategies should be explored for currently deployed SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests, such as the

36

Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay.

37

The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay is a rapid, fully-automated, and self-contained multiplex

38

qualitative RT-qPCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay targets two

39

regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: the N (nucleocapsid) region and the E (envelope) region. The test is

40

interpreted as positive for SARS-CoV-2 if either of the two analytes produce a Ct below 45. The test is performed

41

on the Cepheid GeneXpert system in single-use cartridges, with an approximate run time of 50 minutes. This

42

Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay received approval from Health Canada on March 24, 2020 under

43

interim order authorization. Evaluation of the Cepheid SARS-CoV-2 assay is ongoing, with higher reported

44

sensitivity than the Abbott ID Now SARS-CoV-2 Assay (5, 6), and high agreement (>99%) with the Roche Cobas

45

6800 system (5, 7, 8) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) RT-qPCR test (8). Using viral

46

recombinants to contrive samples, Cepheid reports 100% sensitivity (n=35) at 250 copies (cp)/mL. Using

47

synthetic RNA controls, Zhen et al. (6) reported 100% sensitivity at 100 cp/mL (n=10) and a 87.5% sensitivity at

48

50 cp/mL (n=8).

49

Given the high sensitivity of the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, it is reasonable to propose that it could be

50

suitable for pooled testing. Here, the potential for pooled SARS-CoV-2 testing was assessed on the GeneXpert

51

system using a small panel of clinical specimens with low- to mid-range viral loads that were diluted with

known clinical negative samples. The results here corroborate previous findings that the LOD for the Cepheid

53

test is likely <100 cp/mL. Additionally, data generated by this study suggest that the GeneXpert device can be

54

effectively applied for SARS-CoV-2 pooled sample testing in pools containing up to at least six individual

55

samples. Finally, a reference dataset is provided that can be used by public health authorities to advise point-of-

56

care test sites on the optimal number of samples to combine per pool given their current positive test rates.

2. Materials and Methods

58

2.1

59

Viral Culture
High-titre inactive SARS-CoV-2 culture (Strain VIDO; GISAID Accession: EPI_ISL_425177), made

60

inactive by gamma-irradiation, was provided by the Special Pathogens Program of the National Microbiology

61

Laboratory. Briefly, virus was cultured in Vero cells in minimum essential media and cellular debris were

62

removed via low-speed centrifugation. Nominal viral load of the inactivated virus was determined by

63

quantitation of dilutions that fell within another standard curve that was developed using serial dilutions of the

64

SeraCare AccuPlex™ SARS-CoV-2 Reference Material Kit (0505-0126). The AccuPlex™ SARS-CoV-2 Reference

65

Material Kit consists of recombinant Sindbis virus containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA, at a concentration of 5000

66

cp/mL.

67

2.2

68

Clinical Specimens
Clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected in 1 mL of viral transport media, and provided by

69

Cadham Provincial Laboratory (CPL; Winnipeg, Canada). All provided samples were previously tested and

70

characterized using their approved SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RT-qPCR assay. The ethics-exempt panel used for

71

this study consisted of six positive CPL clinical samples and an additional two low viral load swab samples

72

(Ct=37/Ct=38) provided by the Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Program of the National Microbiology

73

Laboratory. Pooled negative samples were also provided by the Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Program.

Standard Curve for the Xpert Xpress® SARS-CoV-2 assay
A standard curve was produced to facilitate the quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 viral load for each of the

76

clinical samples used in this study. To produce the curve, 10-fold serial dilutions of inactivated high-titre SARS-

77

CoV-2 were prepared in viral transport media to yield a series from 6 x 108 cp/mL to 6 x 100 cp/mL. For each step

78

of the dilution series, 300 µL was pipetted into an Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge. The linear equation

79

from the standard curves for analytes E and N were used to determine the nominal viral load of undiluted

80

clinical samples following testing with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. The reported value is the average

81

between the N and E targets.

82

2.4

83

Sample Pool Tests
All testing was performed with the same GeneXpert system used to produce the standard curve, and all

84

replicates of a given sample were performed on the same system module. Each sample was tested without

85

pooling on the GeneXpert system and Ct values were used to determine nominal viral load using the standard

86

curve. Each sample was then diluted in a pool of confirmed negative clinical specimens to simulate either three-

87

sample pools (three-fold dilution) or six-sample pools (six-fold dilution). To conserve the Xpert® Xpress SARS-

88

CoV-2 assay cartridges for clinical use, only six-sample pools were performed in triplicate and a limited number

89

of samples were included in our panel. Each pool was created individually to account for errors in pipetting.

91

Calculation of Pooling Efficiency
To provide guidance on pooling efficiency, the impact of pooling on testing capacity was calculated at

92

various pooling depths (1-10) and individual positive test rates (0-100%). Similar to the statistical approach used

93

by Hanel and Thurner (9), a custom Python script was used to calculate the pooled testing capacity relative to

94

non-pooled testing capacity, represented as a percentage, for each combination. A value above 100% indicates

95

that testing capacity has increased, whereas values below 100% indicate decreased capacity. To calculate relative

96

testing capacity, for each combination of pool sizes and positive test rates, the proportion of pools that would be

97

SARS-CoV-2 positive (PS+) were determined with the following equation:

98

PS+ = 1 – (1 – p)n

99

where n is the pool size and p is the proportion of individual tests that are positive. The average number of tests

100

needed per pool was then determined by multiplying the proportion of pools that are positive by the pool size

101

to determine the cost of retests, in addition to the original test that was needed for the pool itself. The average

102

number of tests (T) needed to process each pool is therefore determined by:

T = PS+ x n + 1

103
104

Finally, relative testing capacity was calculated by dividing the average number of tests required for each pool,

105

divided by the number of samples tested:

106

Relative Testing Capacity = (T / n) x 100%

3. Results

108

3.1

The Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay can be used to provide quantitative results

109

Although the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay is considered a qualitative test, it does provide output Ct

110

values that can be used to approximate viral loads using a standard curve. To produce a standard curve, 10-fold

111

serial dilutions of inactivated high-titre SARS-CoV-2 were prepared in viral transport media from 6 x 108 cp/mL

112

to 6 x 100 cp/mL. All dilutions above 6 x 101 were recorded as SARS-CoV-2 positive by the assay (Supplemental

113

Table 1), consistent with the previously observed LOD (6) for the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay of <100

114

cp/mL. The resulting curve was highly linear (R2 > 0.999), suggesting that the Ct values can be used for

115

quantitation across the entire range of our standard curve. The qPCR efficiency for the E and N analytes was

116

99.8% and 96.6%, respectfully (Figure 1).

118

Determining the effect of sample pooling on the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay
To determine the effect of sample pooling on the sensitivity of the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, five

119

clinical samples were selected with Ct values ranging from 23-35 as determined by the Corman RT-qPCR test

120

performed at the Cadham Provincial Laboratory in Winnipeg, MB. Each sample was first individually tested

121

without pooling on the GeneXpert® system, and resultant Ct values were converted to nominal viral loads using

122

the standard curve. Input viral loads ranged from approximately 938 cp/mL to 2.85 million cp/mL (Table 1).

123

Each of these samples was then diluted in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative clinical samples to simulate three

124

sample or six sample pooling. Although Ct values were higher, as anticipated after dilution in a pool, the Xpert®

125

Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay correctly identified each pool qualitatively as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Standard

126

deviation of Ct values between replicates increased at high Ct values, likely due to sampling and PCR biases.

127

Though not clinically relevant, this would likely affect accurate quantitation of viral load at higher Ct values.

128

To better observe the effects of sample pooling near the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay’s LOD, an

129

additional three clinical samples were selected with high Ct values (>37). This included a discordant sample that

130

was not detected by the Cadham Provincial Lab RT-qPCR test, but was subsequently identified as weakly

131

positive on the GeneXpert (CT=43.5/39.2). At initial viral loads of 461 and 1362 cp/mL, the Xpert® Xpress SARS-

132

CoV-2 assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after six-fold pooling with negative specimens, while our weak positive (64

133

cp/mL) returned a negative result (Table 2). Additionally, the E target was not detected in one of the pools;

134

however, only one detected analyte is needed to return an actionable positive test result.

135

3.3

Determining the optimal pool size

136

An objective of this study is to provide guidance for when sample pooling is a viable option for SARS-

137

CoV-2 testing with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, or any sensitive SARS-CoV-2 test in general. At high

138

positive testing rates, pooling may actually increase the number of tests required to screen samples and increase

139

turnaround time. Further, deciding what pooling depth to use is arbitrary without understanding the relationship

140

between pooling depths and positive test rates. We determined testing capacity using various combinations of

141

pool sizes (1-10) and test rates (0-100% in increments of 0.1%). A complete summary of all combinations can be

142

found in Supplemental Table 2, and a graphical representation of a subset of these data is shown in Figure 2.

143

This information can help medical authorities provide informed recommendations pertaining to sample

144

pooling. For example, no pooling strategy is effective when positive test rates exceed ~30%. Additionally, at no

145

combination of pool size and positive test rates is two sample pooling more efficient than three sample pooling

146

(Figure 2). Although at low positive test rates aggressive pooling is favored, this quickly changes when test rates

147

increase above 1%. For example, if the positive test rate at a site is ~3% the ideal pool size would be six samples.

148

4. Discussion

149

The results of this study strongly suggest that sample pooling is a viable option for SARS-CoV-2 testing

150

using the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. All samples tested positive after pooling, except for a high-Ct discordant

151

positive with a nominal viral load of 64 cp/mL. At this level of sensitivity, pooled tests should detect SARS-CoV-

152

2 in the vast majority of clinical cases; a study following 80 patients at different stages of infection detected average

153

sample viral loads of >104 from 1 day before to 7 days after disease onset, using sputum (n=67), throat (n=42), and

154

nasal (n=1) swabs (10), with the lowest observed viral load of 641 copies/mL. Another research group determined

155

average viral loads to be >105 at the onset of mild to moderate symptoms (11). When testing asymptomatic

156

individuals, results still show typical Ct values of 22-31 with the Corman RT-qPCR assay (12–14).

157

One challenge that may prevent some point-of-care testing sites from adopting a pooled testing strategy

158

is the lack of mechanical pipettes. The Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay is provided with single-use transfer pipettes

159

that dispense 300 µL of sample. With small pool sizes, multiple samples can be combined into a 5 mL specimen

160

tube or 15 mL canonical tube, and inverted to mix. Subsequently 300 µL of this pool can be transferred into a test

161

cartridge. With this approach, pooled testing with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay could be readily achieved

162

in a resource-limited setting with the provision of additional 300 µL transfer pipettes.

163

Several other strategies for SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing are being investigated such as combinatorial

164

testing, or matrix testing (3, 15). In this approach, samples are combined into multiple pools, such that each sample

165

is tested multiple times across multiple pools. The combination of SARS-CoV-2 positive pools can identify

166

individual positives with limited retesting required. Although this strategy is promising, it works best for high-

167

throughput laboratories processing batches of hundreds of samples using 96- or 384-well plates and real-time PCR

168

machines. Because of the need for larger batch sizes and its more complicated testing design, a combinatorial

169

approach is unlikely to be feasible with point-of-care tests that perform only a few tests in a single run, such as the

170

Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay.

171

Another pooling strategy proposed by the German Red Cross Blood Donor Service and Geothe University

172

is swab pooling, or the mini-pool method (16). Multiple swabs can be combined into a single tube at the point of

173

collection, rather than the traditional method of pooling transport media or extracted RNA. As a result, there is

174

minimal loss of sensitivity as no dilution is occurring. The main disadvantage of this approach is that the pooled

175

samples need to be collected simultaneously and at the same location; however, the swab pool approach could be

176

applied in certain scenarios. For example, this strategy may be appropriate for door-to-door household testing,

177

workplace screening, or its intended of purpose of blood donor screening. This approach could easily be combined

178

with traditional pooling to substantially increase testing capacity with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay or other

179

validated molecular test method.

180

5. Conclusions

181

This study provides a resource that can be used to determine the appropriate pool size to use at each

182

testing site. Public health authorities can approximate positive tests rates, and use this information with the

183

reference table (Supplemental Table 2) to make appropriate recommendations on pooling strategies. The

184

application of sample pooling, when possible, can be used to immediately increase testing capacity on the

185

GeneXpert® system while conserving limited resources. Future experiments should investigate if more extensive

Figure 2: The effect of sample
pooling on testing capacity using
pools of two (black dashed-dotted
line), three (green solid line), or
six (brown dashed line) samples.
For each pool size, testing
capacity is plotted against the rate
of positive individual tests. The
red dotted line represents the
point at which pooled testing
decreases capacity and is no
longer viable. The cross-over
point, when three sample pooling
is more efficient than six sample
pooling, occurs at 7.6%.

Table 1: Five clinical samples collected at the Cadham Provincial Laboratory (CPL) were selected for analysis with Ct values ranging from 2335 as determined by the CPL in-house RT-qPCR test. Each sample was tested with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay as an undiluted sample,
diluted three-fold in negative clinical samples to simulate a three sample pool, and diluted six-fold in negative clinical samples to simulate a six
sample pool (performed in triplicate). Ct values are provided for the envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and sample processing control (SPC) targets
at each dilution. Nominal viral load was determined from the standard curve using the results from the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay using
undiluted clinical specimens. For the six sample pool replicates, standard deviation was calculated for each target.

Table 2: An additional three clinical specimens with high Ct values were selected to
better observe the effect of sample pooling close to the limit of detection of the Xpert®
Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. This included two samples provided by the National
Microbiology Laboratory and one from the Cadham Provincial Laboratory (CPL),
which is a discordant sample not detected by CPL’s Corman RT-qPCR test, but
detected as a weak positive by the Xpert® assay. At the six-fold dilution, the weak
positive was no longer detected by the assay.
