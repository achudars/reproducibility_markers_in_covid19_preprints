Abstract
The current global pandemic of COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To
investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the RBD have altered the receptor binding affinity and
infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the
human ACE2 receptor. Among 1609 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated during the early transmission
phase, 32 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and found clustered into nine mutant types under
high positive selection pressure. Applying molecular dynamics simulations, three mutant types (V367F,
W436R, N354D/D364Y) displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2, likely due to the enhanced
structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The increased infectivity of one mutant (V367F)
circulating worldwide was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon
resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Genome phylogenetic analysis of V367F mutants showed that
during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2
prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G), which emerged later and formed a
distinct sub-cluster. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary
trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 under high selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike
mutations to aid in the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.

1. Introduction
A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused outbreaks of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally
beginning in mid-December 2019, with an epicenter in Wuhan, China[1–3]. As of September 8, 2020, SARSCoV-2 had infected 27,236,916 people world-wide and caused 891,031 deaths with an estimated fatality rate
of 3.27%[4]. This on-going pandemic of COVID-19 has become the most serious threat to public health in
this century.

The origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive. However, the initial cases were largely associated with a
seafood market, which indicated potential zoonotic transmissions[1,5]. Although bats and pangolins are most
likely the reservoir and the intermediate hosts in the wild, more evidence is needed to support zoonotic
transmission and to track the origin of this new coronavirus[6–8].

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
which is similar to its counterpart in SARS-CoV[9–12]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike
protein subunit S1 interacts directly with ACE2, providing for tight binding to the peptidase domain of
ACE2[13,14]. Therefore, RBD is the critical determinant of virus-receptor interaction and reflects viral host
range, tropism, and infectivity. Although the RBD sequences of different SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating
globally are largely conserved, mutations have appeared; these may account for differences in viral
infectivity and also contribute to its spread[15–18].

The S protein expresses antigenic sites on its protein surface, likely with both T-cell and B-cell epitopes. The
main antibody binding sites substantially overlap with RBD, and an antibody binding to these sites is likely
to block viral entry into cells[19–21].

To investigate whether mutations in RBD have altered the receptor binding affinities and whether these
strains may have been selected for higher infectivity, the binding dynamics and the infectivity between the
SARS-CoV-2 RBDs of the mutant strains to date and human ACE2 receptor were modelled and assessed
computationally. In addition, experimental validation of the enhanced affility and infectivity of the V367F
mutant was assessed. The experimental results supported and validated our computational simulations.

2. Results
2.1. SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutation mapping during the early transmission phase
Among the 1609 SARS-CoV-2 strains with whole genome sequences available in public databases collected
before April 2020, 32 strains contained amino acid mutations in the RBD (Supplementary Table 1). These
strains were reported from multiple locations, including China, U.K., Finland, France, Belgium, U.S.A., and
India (Figure. 1). Most mutants in RBD deviated from the original reported genome (SARS-CoV-2 WuhanHu-1) by only one amino acid (Supplementary Figure 1). The 32 mutations parse into nine types. Mutation
V367F was found in six individual strains isolated from four patients: three in France and one in Hong Kong.
This suggested that these variants may have originated as a sub-lineage. Similarly, novel sub-lineages were
also identified including the 13 V483A mutants and seven G476S mutants isolated in the U.S.A. (Figure.
1).

2.2. Strong positive selective pressure on SARS-CoV-2 RBD
Since RBD is the only domain to bind human ACE2 and, in turn, initiates cell entry, it is believed that the
RBD should be highly conserved. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the selective pressures of the S
gene by calculating nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios (dN/dS ratios) for various segments
of the S gene in the 1609 early SARS-CoV-2 strains[22]. Interestingly, the entire S gene exhibited a dN/dS of
4.1197, remarkably greater than 1, showing that the S gene is indeed under positive selective pressure (Table
1). The RBD showed a similar dN/dS (3.3545) as the entire S protein, indicating that high selective pressure
was also applied to this essential domain. Therefore, the functional relevance of these RBD mutations may
be inferred.

2.3. Three mutant types during the early transmission phase bind human ACE2
receptor with higher affinity
To estimate the functional changes suggested by the RBD mutations, we performed molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations for the prototype SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain) and the RBD mutants in order to
assess their binding energy to human ACE2. These were performed using GROMACS 2019[23,24]. The
complex structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain and human ACE2 was obtained from the National
Microbiology Data Center (ID: NMDCS0000001) (PDB ID: 6LZG) (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LZG).
Mutated amino acids of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants were directly replaced in the model, and the
bat/pangolin CoV RBD domain was modeled using SWISS-MODEL[25]. Each simulation was performed at
10ns and each model was simulated in triplicate. All trajectories reached a plateau of RMSD after 2~5ns

(Figure. 2A), indicating that their structures reached equilibrium. All of the subsequent computations on
thermodynamics were based on the 5~10ns trajectories. Three RBD mutant types (N354D and D364Y,
V367F, W436R) exhibited significantly lowered ΔG, suggesting a significantly increased affinity to human
ACE2; the other mutants showed a similar ΔG compared to the prototype (Figure. 2B). The ΔG of these
three mutant types were around -58 kJ/mol, approximately 25% lower than the prototype strain (-46.5
kJ/mol, calculated from the experimentally measured KD) (Figure. 2B). Compared to the KD = 14.7 nM of
the prototype RBD[9], the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the three mutants are calculated as 0.12
nM, 0.11 nM, and 0.13 nM, respectively (Figure. 2C), which were two orders of magnitude lower than for
the prototype strain, indicating a remarkably increased affinity to the human ACE2 receptor. For the only
double amino acid mutant (N354D, D364Y), the N354D substitution decreased the affinity, while the D364Y
provided a higher affinity than the double mutation (Figure. 2B). This indicated that the D364Y is the major
contributor to the enhanced affinity.

In comparison, the bat CoV RBD (strain RaTG13, with the highest genome similarity) showed a much lower
binding affinity (KD=1.17mM; ΔG=-17.4kJ/mol) to human ACE2 than the pangolin CoV (KD=1.89μM;

ΔG=-33.9kJ/mol). For comparison, the affinity of the pangolin CoV was slightly lower than the SARS-CoV2 prototype strain (KD=14.7nM; ΔG=-46.5kJ/mol) (Figure. 2B, 2C).

2.4. Structural basis for the increased affinity of the SARS-CoV RBD mutants
The nine RBD mutant types that emerged during the early transmission phase were divided into two groups:
a “similar affinity” group (V341I, F342L, R408I, A435S, G476S, V483A), whose affinity is not significantly
increased, and a “higher affinity” group (N354D D364Y, V367F, W436R), whose affinity is significantly
increased. To explain the structural basis of the increased affinity, we investigated the dynamics of the
residues in these structures in greater detail. The binding surface of the RBD to ACE2 is largely arrayed in
random coil conformation, which lacks structural rigidity. Logically, a firm scaffold should be necessary to
maintain this conformation of the interaction surface, and thus may facilitate the binding affinity. The betasheet structure scaffold, centered by residues 510-524 (Figure. 3A, marked as red), apparently provides this
rigidity. “Higher affinity” mutants (N354D D364Y, V367F, and W436R) showed a considerable decrease of
the RMSF (Root Mean Square of Fluctuation) at this region, demonstrating a more rigid structure; this was
not observed for the “similar affinity” mutants (Figure. 3B). Coincidentally, the substitutions that account
for the affinity increase (D364Y, V367F, and W436R) are all located near this fragment. Indeed, residues
475-485, which is a random coil near the binding site, showed a remarkably higher RMSF for the “similar
affinity” group mutants, in contrast to the “higher affinity” group mutants (Figure. 3B). Moreover, the
“higher affinity” group exhibited a general decreased ΔG in the binding site region, in contrast to the “similar
affinity” group mutants (Figure. 3C). In addition, the D364Y and W436R mutations directly contributed to
the ΔG decrease. In contrast, the N354D mutation directly elevated the ΔG (Figure. 3B).

2.5. Experimental validation of the enhanced affility and infectivity of the V367F
mutant
As of August 24, 2020, among all of the mutants with dominant mutations in spike RBD (>20 strains), most
mutations resulted in a substitution of amino acids with similar properties. V367F is the only mutant with
higher binding affinity, as calculated by MD simulation (Table 2). The other “higher affinity” mutants
(N354D D364Y, and W436R) that were observed during the early transmission phase could not be detected
again. Therefore, the binding affinity and the infectivity of V367F mutant were further validated
experimentally. First, we performed experiments to assess the binding affinity in vitro with a receptor-ligand
binding ELISA assay using purified S proteins and human ACE2 protein. The result showed that the V367F
mutation significantly lowered the ED50 concentration (ED50 = 0.8±0.04 μg/ml), as compared to the
prototype (ED50 = 1.7±0.14 μg/ml) (Figure. 4A). This demonstrates that the V367F mutant has higher
affinity than the prototype. Second, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, which
yielded the same conclusion: the prototype had a KD of 5.08 nM, compared to the V367F mutant with a KD
of 2.70 nM (Figure. 4B). These results qualitatively validated our computational simulations. Next, we
performed an in vivo experiment to investigate the invasion efficiency of S proteins using a pseudovirus
assay. Same amounts of S protein-containing pseudovirus were subjected to infection of ACE2overexpressed Vero and Caco-2 cells. A higher infection efficiency is represented by the increased copy
number of the integrated lentivirus genome. At 24 hours post-infection, the V367F mutant pseudovirus
showed 6.08x higher copy numbers than the prototype in Caco-2 cells. After 48 hours, the V367F mutant

pseudovirus showed 4.38x and 3.88x higher copy number than the prototype in Vero and Caco-2 cells,
respectively (Figure. 4C). These enhancements were statistically significant (P<0.01, t-test). Therefore, the
in vitro and in vivo results were consistent with enhanced affinity and infectivity for the V367F mutant.

2.6. The convergence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and D614G mutation in dominant
mutation strains
The D614G mutation is located in the S1 region and is outside of the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
It has been confirmed that the D614G change increases virus infectivity by elevating its sensitivity to
protease and that this mutation has spread widely[26]. Among all of the dominant mutations (>20 strains) in
the spike RBD, V367F, S477N, V483A, G485R, A520S, P384L, A522V, and P330S were detected along
with the D614 prototype during the early transmission phase. Later, these mutations were detected with the
D614G mutant (Table 2). The V367F mutants were initially discovered in January in Hong Kong, and the
D614G+V367F dual mutant was initially discovered in March in the Netherlands. Afterwards, detection of
both the V367F single mutant and the dual mutant increased rapidly (Figure. 5). Additionally, the
distribution of V367F mutants and D614G/V367F dual mutants emerged mainly in Europe, including
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Northern Ireland, Switzerland, and Iceland, as well as in the USA,
Australia, and Taiwan (Supplementary Table 2). The phylogenetic analysis of the V367F mutant genomes
showed that most V367F mutants during the early transmission phase clustered more closely with the SARSCoV-2 prototype strain. Intriguingly, all of the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G) formed a distinct
sub-cluster separate from the V367 sub-cluster (Figure. 6). This indicates that the V367F mutation may have
evolved along with D614G mutation, suggesting a synergistic effect of increased infectivity.

3. Discussion
Due to the challenging and on-going pandemic and given the evolving nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
globally, identifying changes in viral infectivity may prove crucial to containing the COVID-19
pandemic. Quarantine policies need to be adapted with respect to the viral infectivity change. It is always
a dilemma of quarantine and economy. Any government would balance the lost due to the quarantine
lockdown versus the lost due to the disease. Numerous models have been rasied to estimate the two costs.
For example, if the viral strain is more infectious, more stringent lockdown measure would be expected.
This report provides computational and experimental insights into the functional outcome of mutations in
RBD. As RBD mutations are under positive selection pressure, we identified the mutants that acquired
increased binding affinity to human ACE2 receptor and presumably higher infectivity for human cells.

First, our analysis of molecular dynamics simulation indicated a remarkable enhancement of the affinity
efficiency of multiple mutant S proteins. Compared to the prototype strain Wuhan-Hu-1, the

ΔG

of

mutants decreased ~25%. These mutants bind to ACE2 more stably due to the enhancement of the base
rigidity of the S protein structure. Potential and recent animal-to-human transmission events of SARSCoV-2 may explain the strong positive selection and enhancement of the affinity during the pandemic.
Ongoing adaptation to transmission and replication in humans, including mutation events in the RBD may
boost the binding affinity and lead to an increase in the basic reproduction number (R0), and in theory,
further enable human to human transmission.

The origin of this virus has been of considerable interest and speculation since the outbreak. Due to the
high sequence similarity of the bat SARS-like CoV genome and the pangolin CoV RBD sequence to the
SARS-CoV-2 sequences, these hosts were thought to have initiated the infection in humans[6–8]. Our
results provide more clues to support this hypothesis. Our results suggest that the binding energy of the
bat SARS-like CoV RBD is too high to bind human ACE2 effectively (KD in millimolar range). In

contrast, the pangolin CoV showed a binding KD for human ACE2 at the micromolar range, just ~6x
higher than that of human SARS virus (KD = 0.326μM) [28](Figure. 3), which indicates that the pangolin
CoV has the potential to infect humans in unprotected close contact. Alignments of the genomic
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoV viruses suggest recombination events, particularly in the
RBD domain, between pangolin and bat viruses6. The pangolin CoV has been detected among intercepted
smuggled Malayan pangolins in multiple provinces in China, suggesting and supporting a high risk of
zoonotic infections to humans, constantly and widely[7,8].

It should be noted that during the early transmission phase, the mutation V367F that enhances the binding
affinity was found in six strains: one in Hong Kong and five in France. As RBD is conserved in SARSCoV-2, the coincidence of six strains with the same mutation across large geographic distances indicates
that this mutant is more robust and that these strains originated as a novel sub-lineage, given the close
isolation dates (January 22 and 23, respectively). An alternate view is that asymptomatic individuals with
the same mutation were “super-infecting” travellers. Along with the epidemiological data, mutation
surveillance is of critical importance as it can reveal more exact transmission routes of the epidemic and
provide early warnings of additional outbreaks. Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Hong Kong,
France, and other countries with RBD mutations allowing higher binding affinity to human ACE2

performing assays comparing the prototype spike protein to the V367F mutation containing counterpart,
we confirmed the significantly enhanced binding affinity and likely higher infectivity of the V367F
mutant, and showed that the mutation stabilizes the RBD structure.

By tracking mutation types in the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, only the V367F was continuously observed.
The N354D, D364Y, and W436R mutations seemed to have disappeared during the course of the

pandemic, perhaps in part due to the extremely strict isolation policy set in China. Most of the dominant
RBD mutants were first detected with the prototype D614, and then together with the G614 mutation.
This is possibly due to multiple individual recombination events between the D614+V367F mutants and
G614 mutants, although it is difficult to determine the exact position and time point due to the high
sequence identities among SARS-CoV-2 mutants. D614G is distinct from the RBD mutationsV367F – it
is not located in the RBD but enhances viral infectivity by elevating its sensitivity to protease[26].
Therefore, D614G and V367F may function independently and have synergistic effects on viral
infectivity. Recombination is known to play an important role in natural coronavirus evolution, which
may contribute to the convergence of dual enhancing mutants (D614G + V367F)[16,18,29,30]. More attention
should be paid to the risk of the advantage accumulation evolution through recombination among the
variants, in which the recombinants may be more infectious and also better at immune escape.

The S protein is also important for antigen recognition. By tracking dominant RBD mutation sequences
up to August, 2020, multiple mutants with more than 20 sequences putatively related to weakly reduced
host receptor binding and altered antigenicity have been detected[17]. These were found by comparing
equivalent positions in more than 500 sequences of SARS and MERS genomes, in particular the N439K
mutation[17]. Equivalent positions have been studied for V483A in the MERS-CoV genomes and for
N439K in the SARS-CoV genomes. These mutations are hypothesized to result in weakly reduced host
receptor binding and altered antigenicity, revealing possible immune escape driving virus evolution[31],[32].
Since the RBD contains important antigenic epitopes, frequent mutations in RBD, especially those that
change the amino acid properties, may weaken the binding affinity of any antibody raised against the
prototype strain[20,21]. This may lead to decreased vaccine efficacy and should be further studied.

In summary, we have identified 32 RBD mutant strains clustering into nine mutant types during the early
transmission phase. Three mutant types that emerged in Asia and Europe display apparent enhanced

structural stability of the spike protein along with higher binding affinities to the human ACE2 receptor.
Multiple mutants apparently disappeared under high positive selection pressure; only the V367F
mutation, which showed higher infectivity, was persistently observed along with the D614G mutation, the
latter not in the RBD. This indicates that the V367F mutant is stable and may have acquired increased
infectivity for humans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of dual mutants (V367F+D614G)
suggests recombination among SARS-CoV-2 genomes may increase the infectivity of the virus along
with enhanced escape from the host immune response. These findings support the continuing surveillance
of spike mutations to aid in the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.

4. Methods
4.1. Genome sequence dataset in this study
Full-length protein sequences of S protein RBD were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank Database,
China 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov), and GISAID EpiFluTM Database
(http://www.GISAID.org). 1609 SARS-CoV-2 full-genome sequences isolated during early transmission
phase (before April 5, 2020) were downloaded and the sequences with amino acid mutations in S protein
and RBD region were parsed . The genome sequences with amino acid mutations in S protein and the
RBD were analyzed in this study (Supplementary Table 1).

For tracking the V367F mutation sequences and the dominant spike mutations “to date”, 83,758 SARSCoV-2 spike amino sequences isolated before August 24, 2020 were retrieved from the GISAID
EpiFluTM Database (http://www.GISAID.org) and aligned. The genome sequences with either theV367F
mutation or the V367F/D614G dual mutations in the S protein RBD were screened and analyzed in this
study (Supplementary Table 2).

4.2. Sequences alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Alignment of S protein sequences from different sources and comparison of ACE2 proteins among
different species were performed using MAFFT version 7, with default parameters

using the Nei-Gojobori model[22]. Phylogentic analyses were conducted with Mega X version 10.0.2,
applying the maximum-likelihood method with 500 bootstrap replicates and default parameters[27].

4.3. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
The complex structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and human ACE2 was obtained from
the Nation Microbiology Data Center (ID: NMDCS0000001) (PDB ID: 6LZG). Mutated amino acids of
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants were directly replaced in the model, and the bat/pangolin CoV RBD
domain was modelled using SWISS-MODEL[25]. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed using
GROMACS 2019 with the following options and parameters: explicit solvent model, system temperature
37°C, OPLS/AA all-atoms force field, and LINCS restraints. With 2fs steps, each simulation was
performed at 10ns, and each model was simulated three times to generate three independent trajectory
replications. Binding free energy (ΔG) was calculated using MM-PBSA method (GitHub;
https://github.com/Jerkwin/gmxtool), with the trajectories after structural equilibrium assessed using
RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)[24,35]. To calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) and

ΔG, the formula ?   ஽ was used. Estimated ΔGs of the RBD mutants were normalized using the
ΔG of the prototype strain which was derived from experimental data[28].

4.4. Recombinant S protein mutant expression
The SARS-CoV-2 prototype S gene was cloned into pNPM5 vector (Novoprotein, NJ, USA), and fused
with a C-terminal His6-tag. The V367F mutation was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis,
consistent with the nucleotide sequence of the actual isolate. These two constructs were transfected into
HEK293 cells using polyethyleneimine. Since the S protein includeed a signal peptide in its N-terminal
14 amino acids, it was secreted into the medium. The expressed proteins were purified from filtered cell
supernatants with a Ni-NTA column. Eluted protein solution was then dialyzed against PBS (pH7.4) for
subsequent assays.

4.5. Ligand-receptor binding ELISA assay
Human ACE2 protein was immobilized onto a microtiter plate at 5 μg/ml (100μl/well). Each S protein
(prototype and V367F) was added as a ligand at different concentrations, ranging from 0.03 μg/ml to 10

μg/ml, and then incubated for 2 hours at 37°C to allow receptor-ligand interaction. The ligand / receptor
mixture was then washed three times. 100μl of HRP anti-His Tag Antibody (BioLegend, USA) (diluted
1:20000) was added to each well, and allowed to react for 1 hour. After three washes, the signal was
visualized using TMB solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and a microtiter plate reader recording OD450.

4.6. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments
The SPR experiments were performed in a BIAcore T200 instrument (GE, USA). For this, the SARSCoV-2 S-proteins, either prototype or V367F, were immobilized on the Sensor Chip NTA (GE, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Human ACE2 protein was injected in each experiment in seven
concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 nM). For each cycle, the absorption phase lasted for
120 seconds and the dissociation phase lasted for 600 seconds. After each cycle, the chip was regenerated
using 350mM EDTA and 50mM NaOH wash for 120 seconds,. Blank controls with 0 nM ACE2 were
performed, with the blank signals subtracted from the cycle signals. All experiments were performed at
37°C. KD values were calculated by fitting the curves using the software provided with the instrument.

4.7. Production and titration of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses bearing V367F S
protein
The full-length S gene of SARS-CoV-2 strain Wuhan-Hu-1(NC_045512.2 ) was cloned into a SARSCoV-2 Spike vector (PackGene, Guangzhou, China), and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid SARSCoV-2 Spike (G1099T), incorporating the V367F mutation in the S gene, was constructed by site-directed
mutagenesis using the ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme), as per the manufacturer’s
protocol.

Generation of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus was done as previously described with some modifications[36].
Briefly, 293T cells, at about 70-90% confluence, were co-transfected with 9 ug of the transfer vector
(pLv-CMV), 6 ug packaging plasmid (psPAX-lentiviral), and 6 ug envelope plasmid (pCB-spike or pCBspikeV367F). Pseudoviruses were harvested at 48 h post-transfection, using a 2.5 ml sterile syringe and
subsequently filtered into either Falcon or microcentrifuge tubes via a syringe driven 0.45 µm filter. Virus
titration was measured by RT-qPCR targeting the WPRE gene of pseudoviruses and using the Hifair® 

One Step RT-qPCR SYBR Green Kit (Yeasen), as per the manufacturer’s protocol. After reverse
transcription (10 min at 42°C) and initial denaturation (5 min at 95°C), PCR amplification was performed
for 40 cycles (15 s at 95°C, 60 s at 60°C). Primers were as follows: WPRE-F, 5'CACCACCTGTCAGCTCCTTT-3'; WPRE -R, 5'- ACGGAATTGTCAGTGCCCAA-3'.

4.8. SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated pseudovirus entry assay.
To detect S variants mediated viral entry, VERO E6 and Caco2 cells (5×104) grown in 24-well plates
were respectively infected with either 20 MOI of S-V367 or S-F367-bearing pseudovirus (1x107
pseudovirus copies per ml). The cell medium was replaced by 500 ul fresh DMEM medium 6h postinfection. Relative fold increase of infected virus titers was calculated according to the WPRE DNA copy
number of the lentiviral proviruses measured by TB Green® Premix Ex Taq ™ II (Takara) at 24 and 48 h
post-infection. Data from all of the samples were obtained from three independent experiments, and each
sample was tested in triplicate.

The number of dominant mutations in the spike RBD (as of August 24, 2020) are shown. The First
Sequence Occurrence date and ID, and D614 sequences number and G614 sequences number are
identified. S477N, V367F, G485R, A520S, P384L, A522V, and P330S mutations were first detected in
D614 sequences, and then with the G614 mutation. Receptor binding efficiencies of dominant mutation
are evaluated by amino acid property change and by binding free energy using the MM-PBSA method[35].
