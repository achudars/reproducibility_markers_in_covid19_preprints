Abstract
The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led
to an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which started in 2019. This is a
member of Coronaviridae family in the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV
and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host
cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral
replication cycle. The receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several
cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between
SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamic
simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the
disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol
groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one
of the binding partners were reduced to thiols. This computational finding provides a molecular
basis

1. INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) or simply COVID-19 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family.1 The other two
viruses in this family that infect humans are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These are
positive-sense, single-strand enveloped RNA viruses. The coronavirus particles contain four
main structural proteins: the spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid.1-2 The spike protein
protrudes from the envelope of the virion and consists of two subunits; a receptor-binding
domain (RBD) that interacts with the receptor proteins of host cells and a second subunit that
facilitates fusion of the viral membrane into the host cell membrane. Recent studies showed that
RBD of spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 interact with angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 belongs to the membrane-bound carboxydipeptidase family. It is
attached to the outer surfaces of cells and is widely distributed in the human body. In particular,
higher expression of ACE2 is observed in organs such as small intestine, colon, kidney, and
heart, while ACE2 expression is comparatively lower in liver and lungs.3-4
The role of oxidative stress on the binding of viral proteins on the host cell surface receptors
is a relatively underexplored area of biomedical research.5-10 Previous studies have indicated that
the entry of viral glycoprotein is impacted by thiol-disulfide balance on the cell surface.5, 7-9, 11-12
Any perturbations in the thiol-disulfide equilibrium has also been found to deter the entry of
viruses into their target cells.5 The first step of the viral entry involves binding of the viral
envelop protein onto a cellular receptor. This is followed by endocytosis, after which
conformational changes of the viral protein helps the induction of the viral protein into the
endosomal membrane, finally releasing the viral content into the cell. These conformational

changes are mediated by pH changes as well as the conversion of disulfide to thiol group of the
viral spike protein.7 Several cell surface oxidoreductases9 regulate the thiol-disulfide exchange,
responsible for conformational changes of viral proteins needed for virus entry into host cells.
In the backdrop of significant mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2 (hereinafter referred to as
CoV-2) infection, it is important to know if the thiol-disulfide balance plays any role on the
binding of the spike glycoprotein on to the host cell receptor protein ACE2. A recent study with
the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (hereinafter referred to as CoV) has exhibited a complete
redox insensitivity;7 despite the reduction of all disulfide bridges of CoV to thiols, its binding to
ACE2 remained unchanged.7 However, this study did not probe the redox sensitivity of ACE2
receptor. Thus, in the present study, we computationally investigated the redox state of both
partners (ACE2 and CoV/CoV-2) on their binding affinities. The structure of CoV13 and CoV214-15 complexed with ACE2 are known and the noncovalent interactions at the protein-protein
interface16 have been reported recently. Using these reported structures, molecular dynamics
simulations and electrostatic field calculations were performed to explore the impact of thioldisulfide balance on CoV/CoV-2 and ACE2 binding affinities. The structural and dynamical
changes due to the change in the redox states of cysteines in the interacting proteins were
analyzed and their effects on binding free energies were studied.

2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The molecular basis of the binding of spike proteins to ACE2 is known from X-ray
crystallographic (SARS-CoV)13 and cryo-electron microscopic (SARS-CoV-2)16 studies. The
sequence alignment of CoV and CoV-2 spike proteins showed high sequence identity (>75 %)

indicating that their binding to ACE2 receptors will be similar (Fig. 1). In both bound structures,
the RBD of CoV and CoV-2 is found to be complexed with ACE2 (Fig. 2). Both ACE2 and
CoV-2 possess four disulfide bridges, whereas CoV subunit has only two disulfide linkages
(Table 1 and Fig. 2a and 2b). Two large helices of ACE2 form a curved surface (Fig. 2,
illustrated by the dashed curved line) that interacts with the concave region of CoV or CoV-2
subunit.
Structural change along the trajectory. In all cases, the simulation started with an
equilibrated structure, which was obtained after minimizing the neutralized solvated protein
complex built from the experimentally determined structures. The evolution of the protein
structure along the MD trajectory was monitored by calculating the root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of each structure from the starting structure as a frame of reference following standard
procedure.17 Briefly, during the MD simulation, the protein coordinates were recorded for every
10 ps interval and a root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of each frame was calculated from the
average root-mean-square displacement of backbone Cα atoms with respect to the initial
structure. Then, the RMSD values, averaged over conformations stored during 1 ns time, were
plotted against the simulated time (Fig. 3). Compared to the starting structure, only a moderate
backbone fluctuation was noted in all protein complexes during 20 ns simulations and the
maximum of RMSD was in the range of 2.0-3.8 Å (Table 2). The evolution was smooth and its
stability was demonstrated by the standard deviation of the computed RMSDs, which was less
than 0.3 Å. Taken together, results of the simulations showed no unexpected structural
deformation of the SAR-CoV/CoV-2⋅⋅⋅ACE2 complex in both, reduced (thiol groups) and
oxidized (disulfide bonds) states (Table 2).

Thermal fluctuation due to cleavage of disulfide bridges. The MD simulation results
indicated that the flexibility of different structural elements of the interacting proteins altered
upon the cleavage of disulfide bridges (oxidized state) producing sulfydryl (thiol) groups
(reduced state). The impact of the reduction of the disulfide bridges was probed by calculating
per-residue RMSD of each complex from the trajectories of MD simulations. Changes in the
backbone flexibility due to complete reduction of all disulfides to thiols of both interacting
proteins are shown in Figs. 4a and 4b, where the backbone is color-coded to indicate the
magnitude of thermal fluctuations. Larger and smaller backbone fluctuations are shown in red
and blue, respectively, whereas the medium fluctuation regions are shown in green. The
backbone fluctuation analysis demonstrated that the cleavage of disulfide bridges indeed affected
the flexibility of the local regions as they became more dynamic (Fig. 4b). A significant
alteration in backbone flexibility was noticed at the interface of CoV and ACE2 subunits when
both proteins are in the fully reduced states i.e. all disulfides are changed to sulfydryl groups. As
it is evident from the Fig. 4b, the helix (residues 52-64) of ACE2 became very mobile, due to the
rupture of the nearby C344:::C361 disulfide. The second region belongs to the flexible loop
consisting residues 463-474 of CoV subunit (residues 478-489 of CoV-2 subunit), which
interacts with the N-terminal segment of the ACE2. The cleavage of the disulfides C467:::C474
in CoV and C480:::C488 in CoV-2 resulted in higher thermal fluctuation.
Binding study. The computed Gibbs binding free energy (∆bindGo) of protein complexes
(Table 3) demonstrated that the binding of CoV or CoV-2 with ACE2 occurs because the
attractive electrostatic interactions between the individual subunits prevail over the desolvation
due to the complexation. The complex formation results in desolvation from proteins’ surfaces at
the protein-protein interface, thereby producing a positive

(Table 3). For formation of a stable protein-protein complex, this energy is needed to be
counterbalanced by the negative electrostatic interactions,

∆CoulG, between the interacting

proteins.
When the disulfides of the RBD of CoV and CoV-2 were reduced to thiols, the impact of
reduction on the binding of these two proteins with ACE2 was different. The computed

∆bindGo

for CoVox ⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox and CoVred ⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox are −7.3 kcal/mol and −11.2 kcal/mol, respectively
(Table 3) indicating a slightly tighter binding of the reduced CoV RBD to ACE2. The
experimentally known Kd value for CoVox⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox system is 325 nM,14 which corresponds to a

∆bindGo value of −8.9 kcal/mol. Therefore, the computationally determined ∆bindGo for CoVox
⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox binding is comparable to the experimental value. Although, there is no experimentally
determined Kd available for CoVred ⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox system, the binding assay with CoVred RBD found
to have no redox sensitivity for its binding to ACE2.7 The small favorability of CoVred⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox
binding, as observed from the computation, indicates that the reduction of CoV did not have
much impact on its binding affinity for ACE2 and could explain the experimentally observed
redox insensitivity.s7 In the case of CoV-2, its binding with ACE2 became less favorable when
all the disulfides of RBD were reduced to thiols. The computed Gibbs binding free energies was
increased by ~ 4.5 kcal/mol for the reduced CoV-2;

∆bindGo of CoV-2ox⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox and CoV-

2red⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox are −10.4 kcal/mol and −6.0 kcal/mol, respectively.
In contrast, the reduction of disulfides of ACE2 impaired the binding significantly for both
CoV and CoV-2 proteins. The Gibbs binding free energies of viral spike proteins CoV and CoV2 with ACE2red, namely, CoVox⋅⋅⋅ACE2red and CoV-2ox⋅⋅⋅ACE2red are –3.4 kcal/mol and –3.8
kcal/mol, respectively. These

∆bindGo values are ~ 4 - 6 kcal/mol more positive than what were

observed for the oxidized from of ACE2 (i.e. CoVox⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox and CoV-2ox⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox in Table 3).
However, when all disulfides in CoV/CoV-2 as well as ACE2 were reduced to thiols, the binding
became thermodynamically unfavorable. In both cases, the binding free energies have positive
values; ∆bindGo of CoVred⋅⋅⋅ACE2red and CoV-2red⋅⋅⋅ACE2red are 52.0 kcal/mol and 57.3 kcal/mol,
respectively. These results indicate that the binding will be severely impacted, when the
disulfides of both interacting proteins are converted to thiols. This finding is potentially
significant as it indicates that the cleavage of disulfide bridges in ACE2 has significant
destabilizing effect on the spike protein binding.
Molecular basis of the impaired binding. The conjoined two helices of ACE2 (residues 19-53
and residues 56-94) form a complementary shape (Fig. 5) that fits into the concave-shaped loop-

β-sheet-loop motif (residues 460-490 of CoV and residues 475-505 of CoV-2) of RBD of viral
spike proteins. The loss of disulfide bridges in ACE2 made a strong impact on the junction of the
two conjoined helices (Fig. 5, CoVred⋅⋅⋅ACE2red). This region is close to the disulfide bridge
C344:::C361 and its cleavage has significant impact on the shape complementarity at the proteinprotein interface. Similarly, the loss of C467:::C474 disulfide in CoV (C480:::C488 in CoV-2)
resulted in a significant conformational change in the loop region, which was displaced away
from the protein-protein interface by ~6 Å indicating a reduced binding interactions as confirmed
by the binding free energy calculations. This conformational change as well as the alteration in
the backbone flexibility (Fig. 4) must have resulted in impaired binding of CoV/CoV-2 with
ACE2.

The study found that the reduction of all disulfides into sulfydryl groups completely impairs
the binding of SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2. This is evident from the positive Gibbs
energy of binding (∆bindGo) obtained for both CoVox⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox and CoV-2ox⋅⋅⋅ACE2ox complexes.
When the disulfides of only ACE2 were reduced to sulfydryl groups, the binding becomes
weaker, as the ∆bindGo becomes less negative by 4 - 6 kcal/mol. On the other hand, reduction of
disulfides of the RBD of CoV-2 has comparatively less effect on

∆bindGo and CoV does not

impact the binding with ACE2. This finding is consistent with the observed redox insensitivity of
the binding between CoV and ACE2.7
The redox environment of cell surface receptors is regulated by the thiol-disulfide
equilibrium in the extracellular region.12, 18 This is maintained by glutathione transporters,19 a
number of oxidoreductases12 including protein disulfide isomerase,8 and several redox
switches.12 Under oxidative stress, the extracellular environment becomes oxidation-prone
resulting more disulfide formation on protein surfaces.12 Therefore, under severe oxidative stress,
the cell surface receptor ACE2 and RBD of the intruding viral spike protein are likely to be
present in its oxidized form having predominantly disulfide linkages. This computational study
shows that under oxidative stress, the lack of reducing environment would result in significantly
favorable binding of the viral protein on the cell surface ACE2. In terms of energetics, this
computational study demonstrates that the oxidized form of proteins with disulfide bridges
would cause a 50 kcal/mol of decrease in Gibbs binding free energy. Furthermore, ACE2, which
the viral spike proteins latch on to, is known to be a key player in the remedial of oxidative
stress.20 Binding of the viral protein will prevent the key catalytic function of ACE2 of
converting angiotensin 2 (a strong activator of oxidative stress) to angiotensin 1-7 thereby
creating a vicious circle of enhanced viral attack. In summary, the present study demonstrates

that the absence of or reduced oxidative stress would have a significant beneficial effect during
early stage of viral infection by preventing viral protein binding on the host cells.

4. METHODOLOGY
Computational Setup. Setting up of protein systems and all structural manipulations were
carried out using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD).21 Disulfide groups were modified to thiols
during setting up of structures using standard VMD scripts. Molecular optimization and
dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD)
package using CHARMM36 force field.22-26 During MD simulations, electrostatic energy
calculations were carried out using particle mesh Ewald method.27 Backbone root-mean-squaredeviation (RMSD) calculations were performed using VMD. Protein-protein interactions were
studied using Adaptive-Basis Poisson Boltzmann Solver (APBS).28 Electrostatic field
calculations were performed using PDB2PQR program suit.29
Molecular Dynamics Simulations. All simulations were performed using the structure of
ACE2 bound SARS-CoV (PDB entry: 3D0G)13 and SCAR-CoV-2 (PDB entry: 6M0J)15. In all
simulations, setup of protein complexes systems was carried out following protocols used
previous studies from this lab.17, 30 Briefly, hydrogens were added using the HBUILD module of
CHARMM. Ionic amino acid residues were maintained in a protonation state corresponding to
pH 7. The protonation state of histidine residues was determined by computing the pKa using
Propka option of PDB2PQR. The protein structures were explicitly solvated with water of TIP3P
model and neutralized by adding with 24 sodium atoms. The prepared solvated protein

complexes were of dimensions 92 Å × 132 Å × 104 Å for SARS-CoV and 94 Å × 144 Å × 100 Å
for SAR-CoV-2 systems.21
All systems were subjected to equilibration for 50 ps. Following equilibration, 20 ns MD
simulations were performed for each system. The velocities and positions of atoms during
dynamics were calculated by velocity Verlet integration algorithm31 using a time step of 2.0
femtoseconds. All simulations were run with NAMD implementation of Langevin dynamics32 at
a constant temperature of 298 K using periodic boundary conditions. To model, non-bonding
interactions, a switching function was turned on with a ‘switchdist’ of 10 Å, a cutoff of 14 Å,
and a ‘pairlistdist’ of 16 Å.
Binding Free Energy Calculations. Gibbs free energies of binding between the ACE2 and
SARS CoV or CoV-2 proteins were calculated using APBS using a standardized method of a
treecode-accelerated boundary integral Poisson-Boltzmann equation solver (TABI-PB).33 In this
method, the protein surface is triangulated, and electrostatic surface potentials are computed. The
discretization of surface potentials is utilized to compute the net energy due to solvation as well
as electrostatic interactions between the two protein subunits, as outlined in thermodynamic
scheme, Scheme 1. Following Scheme 1, the free energy of binding of the two protein fragments
in water, can be expressed as a sum of two components (eq. 1)

∆bindGTABI-PB = ∆CoulG + ∆∆solvG

(1)

where the ∆CoulG represents the Coulombic (electrostatic) interactions between the proteins
occurring at the protein-protein interface (Scheme 1) and ∆∆solvG is the difference of the
solvation energies between the complex and the corresponding free proteins:

∆∆solvG = ∆solvG(complex) – ∆solvG(CoV/CoV-2) – ∆solvG(ACE2)
11

However, the solvation calculation used only part of the entire spike protein as well as the ACE2,
therefore ∆bindGTABI-PB was calibrated by correcting ∆∆solvG using experimentally known binding
free energy of ACE2···CoV-2:

∆Gcorr = RTlnKd – ∆bindGTABI-PB

(3)

where Kd is the experimental dissociation constant, which is equal to 37 nM.16
The corrected free energy of the solvation

∆∆solvGcorr = ∆∆solvG + ∆Gcorr

(4)

Using the ∆Gcorr and eq. 4, the corrected binding free energy, ∆bindGo of all protein complexes is
expressed by

∆bindGo = ∆bindGTABI-PB + ∆Gcorr = ∆CoulG + ∆∆solvG + ∆Gcorr
As shown in eq. 4, the combination of last two terms in eq. 5 is equal to

(5)

∆∆solvGcorr. Therefore,

eq. 5 can be simplified as:

∆bindGo = ∆CoulG + ∆∆solvGcorr
