Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and represents the main
cause of dementia. Currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
that uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. In
COVID-19, neurological manifestations have been reported to occur. The present study
demonstrates that the protein expression level of ACE2 is upregulated in the brain of
Alzheimer’s disease patients. The increased ACE2 expression is not age-dependent, suggesting
the direct relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and the ACE2 expression. Oxidative stress
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease brains
examined in this study also exhibited higher carbonylated proteins as well as increased thiol
oxidation state of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prx6). The positive correlation was found between the
increased ACE2 protein expression and oxidative stress in Alzheimer’s disease brain. Thus, the
present study reveals the relationships between Alzheimer’s disease and ACE2, the receptor for
SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant monitoring Alzheimer’s disease patients with COVID-19
carefully for the possible higher viral load in the brain and long-term adverse neurological
consequences.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of
dementia around the world, affecting a large number of aging populations with an estimated
prevalence of 10-30% in the population >65 years of age [Masters et al., 2015; Scheltens et al.,
2016]. In the United States, an estimated 5 million people have Alzheimer’s disease, which is the
fifth leading cause of death among older adults. However, little is known about the cause of
Alzheimer’s disease and no curative treatments are available [Ballard et al., 2011; Querfurth &
LaFerla, 2010]. Oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [Freeman
& Crapo, 1982; Halliwell & Gutteridge, 2007] have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease
[Tabner et al., 2005; Butterfield et al., 2006; Zhao & Zhao, 2013; Chen & Zhong, 2014].
However, clinical trials on antioxidants have not shown promise as effective treatments [Polidori
& Nelles, 2014; Persson et al., 2014]. Thus, further understanding of the role of oxidative stress
in Alzheimer’s disease is needed.
Coronaviruses are positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses that often cause the
common cold [Su, 2016; Satija, 2007]. Some coronaviruses, however, can be lethal; and
currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [Wu, 2020; Huang,
2020]. So far, 30 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, causing
serious health, economical, and sociological problems. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells [Yan, 2020; Tai, 2020]. It has
been noted that the elderlies, especially those with cardiovascular diseases, is highly susceptible
to developing severe COVID-19 conditions [Huang, 2020; Li, 2020; Yang, 2020].

While the current focus is to treat lung and cardiovascular aspects of COVID-19 to
reduce the mortality, it has been reported that that neurological manifestations occurred in 36%
of COVID-19 patients [Mao, 2020], indicating that this disease may exert to long-term
neurological consequences. Thus, understanding the relationships between COVID-19 and the
brain is important. The present study monitored the expression level of ACE2, the host cell
receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and found that ACE2 protein is upregulated in the brain of
Alzheimer’s disease patients.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples
The hippocampus is the major structure in the brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease and
oxidative stress [Wang & Michaelis, 2010]. Frozen brain (hippocampus) tissues from deidentified deceased patients who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and those from
control individuals without Alzheimer’s or other neurological diseases were obtained from the
Georgetown University Medical Center Brain Bank. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
hippocampus tissues from the same patients were also obtained. Patients usually died at home
and full autopsies were not performed on most of these cases. Bodies of deceased patients were
maintained in refrigeration until tissue collections. The mean post mortem interval value for
Alzheimer’s disease patients was 13.8 ± 1.9 hours and that of controls was 15.2 ± 2.5 hours.
After the brain removal, tissues were flash frozen on dry ice and then stored at -80°C. Control
brain tissues were obtained using the same protocols. ABC grading for Alzheimer’s disease was
performed histologically as previously described [Hyman et al., 2012] at the time of banking by
a neuropathologist and co-author, Dr. Brent Harris.

Tissue homogenate preparations
Frozen hippocampus brain tissues were homogenized in a 4 volume of the 10%
trichloroacetic acid (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) solution using a Kontes glass tissue
grinder. Homogenized tissues were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged for four minutes
at 8,000 rpm at 4°C in an accuSpin Micro R centrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). The resultant pellets were then washed with acetone three times, then with ethanol once.
Pellets were air dried, resuspended in the Lysate Buffer (supplied in the -SulfoBiotics- Protein
Redox State Monitoring Kit Plus, Dojindo Molecular Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD, USA)
supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mM), leupeptin (10 µg/ml), and aprotinin
(10 µg/ml) (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) and sonicated on ice using an ultrasonic
processor. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were
collected. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were measured using the Pierce bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Western blotting
Equal amounts of protein samples (5 µg) were electrophoresed through a reducing
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then electro-transferred to the
Immobilon-FL Transfer Membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). The membranes
were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) for one hour at 25°C
and incubated overnight with the rabbit ACE2 antibody (Catalog # 4355; Cell Signaling), the
goat anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (Catalog # PLA0302;
MilliporeSigma), or the rabbit anti-peroxiredoxin 6 (Prx6) antibody (Catalog # P0058;

MilliporeSigma) at 4°C. Washed membranes were then incubated with IRDye 680RD or IRDye
800CW (LI-COR) for one hour at 25°C in the dark. Signals were obtained by using the Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR), and Western blot band intensities were analyzed by
densitometry.

Measurements of protein carbonylation
Carbonyl groups in protein side chains were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
(DNPH) [Levine et al., 1994] to form the 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazone derivative for
detection using the OxyBlot Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (MilliporeSigma), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with rabbit anti-DNP antibody at 1:150 dilution for Western blotting.
The Immobilon-FL Transfer Membrane was then incubated with anti-rabbit IRDye 680RD for
one hour. Signals were then captured by using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, and band
intensities were analyzed by densitometry.

Protein thiol redox state monitoring
Protein thiol redox states were monitored using the -SulfoBiotics- Protein Redox State
Monitoring Kit Plus (Catalog # SB12; Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Samples were labeled
with the Protein-SHifter Plus in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. After cell
extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, gels were exposed to the UV light on a transilluminator
to remove Protein-SHifter. Proteins in the gel were then electro-transferred to the Immobilon-FL
Transfer Membrane. The membrane was blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer for one hour at
25°C and incubated overnight with the rabbit anti-Prx6 antibody (Catalog # P0058;
MilliporeSigma) at 4°C. Washed membranes were then incubated with anti-rabbit IRDye 680RD

for one hour at 25°C in the dark. Signals were then captured by using the Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System, and band intensities were analyzed by densitometry.

Statistical analysis
Means and standard errors of mean (SEM) were computed. Two groups were compared
by a two-tailed Student’s t test, and differences between more than two groups were determined
by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). P < 0.05 was defined to be statistically significant.

Results
ACE2 protein expression
We performed Western blotting to determine the protein expression levels of ACE2 in
hippocampal brain tissues from Alzheimer’s patients and compared with those of control
subjects. The ACE2 protein expression was found to be higher in Alzheimer’s brain compared to
controls (Fig. 1A). Quantifications of the ratio of ACE2 to GAPDH values revealed that the
mean difference was 4.7-fold and statistically significant (Fig. 1B). The mean ACE2 / GAPDH
ratio value for 13 Alzheimer’s disease patients was 1.22 ± 0.2, while those of five control
subjects were very consistent with a mean of 0.26 ± 0.04. The expression levels of GAPDH were
comparable between the control group (21,554 ± 1,021 densitometry units) vs. the Alzheimer’s
group (21,315 ± 1,471 densitometry units).
The severity of Alzheimer’s patients examined in this study was mostly in the
intermediate to high range with 61.5% of patient samples exhibiting Aβ plaque scores of 2 or 3
and 84.6% exhibiting neuritic plaque scores of 2 or 3. The analysis of ACE2 protein expression
in relation to Aβ plaque scores (Fig. 1C) or neuritic plaque scores (Fig. 1D) determined that the

ACE2 expression levels are not related to the severity of the disease and the significant
upregulation of ACE2 occurs even in Alzheimer’s disease patients with low severity. Further,
among the Alzheimer’s disease patients, no gender difference in ACE2 levels was noted (Fig.
1E). While, in the present study, the age of Alzheimer’s disease patients ranged from 60 to 106
(mean = 78.8 ± 4.2 years) and that of control subjects ranged from 41 to 79 (mean = 60.4 ± 7.8),
our analysis detected no age-dependence in the ACE2 protein expression (Fig. 1F).
Silver staining images of our formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from Alzheimer’s
patients showed amyloid and neuritic plaques as well as the neurofibrillary tangles [Hedreen et
al., 1994; Reusche, 1991]. Further, hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the amyloid plaques
[DeTure & Dickson, 2019; Ryan et al., 2015; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011] and
immunohistochemistry using the Tau AT8 antibody demonstrated the expression of
phosphorylated Tau at serine 202 and threonine 205 [Goedert et al., 1995] in our hippocampal
tissue samples from Alzheimer’s disease patients (data not shown).

Protein carbonylation
Oxidative stress has been shown to occur in Alzheimer’s disease brain [Tabner et al.,
2005; Butterfield et al., 2006; Zhao & Zhao, 2013; Chen & Zhong, 2014]. Consistently, protein
carbonylation of various hippocampal proteins as monitored by the DNPH derivatization of
carbonylated proteins using the OxyBlot Kit showed higher carbonylated proteins in Alzheimer’s
brain compared controls (Fig. 2A). Quantifications of the results revealed that the protein
carbonyl content is 7.8-fold higher in Alzheimer’s disease patients compared to controls and the
difference was found to be statistically significant (Fig. 2B). The carbonyl content-to-GAPDH
ratio values ranged from 0.7 to 2.9 (mean = 1.4 ± 0.15) in Alzheimer’s disease brain while

controls had a range of 0.1 to 0.2 (mean = 0.2 ± 0.02). Our analysis of Aβ plaque scores (Fig.
2C) or neuritic plaque scores (Fig. 2D) in relation to hippocampal brain protein carbonyl content
may have shown a tendency to be dependent on the severity of Alzheimer’s disease, but no
significant differences were noted among patient brain tissues. The protein carbonyl content was
found to be consistently higher with statistical significance between Alzheimer’s patients of any
degree of severity and controls.

Protein Redox State Monitoring Kit Plus analysis of Prx6
The -SulfoBiotics- Protein Redox State Monitoring Kit Plus allows to assess thiol redox
status of a given protein by using 15-kDa Protein-SHifters that are added to the reduced cysteine
sulfhydryl groups followed by immunological detection of the proteins of interest [Suzuki et al.,
2019]. In case of an antioxidant, human Prx6, that contains two cysteines, when both cysteine
residues are oxidized, no Protein-SHifter bind to the protein, thus a 25-kDa band that is the
molecular weight of Prx6 is observed. If one cysteine is reduced, then one 15-kDa ProteinSHifter binds to this cysteine, forming a 40-kDa complex, shifting the Prx6 band. If both
cysteine residues are reduced, two Protein-SHifters bind to the protein allowing a total of 30-kDa
shift of the 25-kDa Prx6, forming a 55-kDa species. We have previously found that, in untreated
cultured human smooth muscle cells, Prx6 molecules are predominant in the reduced state,
exhibiting a 55-kDa band in the -SulfoBiotics- Protein Redox State Monitoring analysis [Suzuki
et al., 2019]. The treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide resulted in the conversion of the 55kDa band into mostly 40-kDa, rather than 25-kDa, suggesting that only one of the two cysteines
in human Prx6 protein is susceptible for this oxidation [Suzuki et al., 2019]. Series of

experiments determined that the shift of 55-kDa to 40-kDa species is due to the oxidation of the
catalytic cysteine 47 [Suzuki et al., 2019].
Using this system, we monitored protein thiol status in Alzheimer’s hippocampal brains
and controls. Similarly to the situation that can be produced by the treatment of cultured cells
with hydrogen peroxide [Suzuki et al., 2019], we found that a large portion of Prx6 protein
molecules in the Alzheimer’s brain exist as the 40-kDa species that corresponds to the addition
of one Protein-SHifter (Fig. 3A). Densitometry analysis determined that the ratio of 40-kDa to
55-kDa Prx6 species is 2.5-fold higher in Alzheimer’s brain compared to control (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that catalytic cysteine is preferentially oxidized in the Alzheimer’s brain. By contrast,
no significant differences were noted for either the 25-kDa to 55-kDa or 25-kDa to 40-kDa ratio
(data not shown), indicating that non-catalytic cysteine is not consistently oxidized in the
Alzheimer’s disease brain. The range of the ratio of 40-kDa to 55-kDa Prx6 species in
Alzheimer’s disease patients was from 0.3 to 1.2 (mean = 0.9 ± 0.08), while that of controls was
from 0.2 to 0.5 (mean = 0.36 ± 0.05). Prx6 thiol oxidation as measured by the ratio of 40-kDa to
55-kDa species was found to correlate with protein carbonylation (Fig. 3C).
The analysis of the Aβ plaque or neuritic plaque scores in relation to the ratio of 40-kDa
to 55-kDa Prx6 species showed no statistically significant differences noted among patients brain
tissues, while the Prx6 thiol oxidation was consistently higher with statistical significance
between Alzheimer’s patients of any degree of severity and controls (data not shown).

Prx6 protein expression
We also found that the expression level of the Prx6 protein is higher in the brain of
Alzheimer’s disease patients compared to controls (Fig. 4A), which may reflect the activation of

an antioxidant defense mechanism in response to oxidative stress. The use of GAPDH protein as
a loading control and the densitometry analysis showed that the protein expression levels of Prx6
between Alzheimer’s and control brains are significantly (6.5-fold) different (Fig. 4B). The range
of the Prx6 to GAPDH ratio determined in Alzheimer’s patients’ brains was from 0.9 to 2.5
(mean = 1.4 ± 0.1), while that of control brain was from 0.01 to 0.5 (mean = 0.2 ± 0.08). The
Prx6 protein expression was found to correlate strongly with protein carbonylation (Fig. 4C) as
well as the Prx6 thiol oxidation as measured by the ratio of 40-kDa to 55-kDa species (Fig. 4D).
The analysis of Aβ plaque and neuritic plaque scores in relation to hippocampal brain
Prx6 levels may have shown a tendency to be dependent on the severity of Alzheimer’s disease,
but no statistically significant differences were noted among patients brain tissues. The Prx6
content was found to be consistently higher with statistical significance between Alzheimer’s
patients of any degree of severity and controls (data not shown).

Correlation analysis to examine the relationships between ACE2 and oxidative stress
Fig. 6 shows the results of correlation analyses to examine the relationships between
ACE2 and various oxidative stress parameters using all of the 18 samples (13 Alzheimer’s
disease patients and 5 controls). The Pearson correlation coefficient R-value between the ACE2
expression and the protein carbonyl content was found to be 0.517 (Fig. 5A), and the R-value
between the ACE2 expression and the Prx6 thiol oxidation state was 0.567 (Fig. 5B). The Rvalue between the ACE2 expression and the Prx6 expression was found to be slightly higher
with 0.687 (Fig. 5C). Thus, the ACE2 protein expression has moderate positive correlation with
oxidative stress parameters and the upregulation of an antioxidant.

Discussion
The major physiological function of ACE2 is to lower blood pressure by catalyzing the
hydrolysis of angiotensin II, which acts as a vasoconstrictor, into angiotensin (1-7) that functions
as a vasodilator [Gheblawi et al., 2020]. ACE2 also serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 that
is causing the current pandemic of COVID-19. Alveolar epithelial cells and cells of the
conducting airways are the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in severe pneumonia and
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [Xu, 2020]. In the brain, immunohistochemistry
detected the ACE2 protein expression in endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells [Hamming
et al., 2004]. In addition, cultured brain glial cells [Gallagher et al. 2006] and mouse brain
neurons [Doobay et al. 2007] have been shown to express ACE2 [Xia & Lazartigues, 2008].
The major finding of the present study is that the brain ACE2 expression is higher in
Alzheimer’s disease patients compared to controls. We did not detect correlation between the
severity of Alzheimer’s disease and the ACE2 expression, and the ACE2 was found to be
upregulated even in the mild Alzheimer’s disease cases. These results indicate that the SARSCoV-2 infection of Alzheimer’s disease patients with any disease severity may results on the
higher viral entry into the cells in the brain and Alzheimer’s disease patients may be highly
affected by COVID-19. No gender difference was noted in the ACE protein expression in
Alzheimer’s brain, and the ACE2 protein expression was not dependent on age. Thus, it appears
that there is a direct relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and the ACE2 expression.
Understanding the mechanism of this relationship may shed a light in the pathogenesis of
Alzheimer’s disease as well as possible management strategies for individuals infected with
SARS-CoV-2 since ACE2 is the host cell receptor for this virus.

Oxidative stress has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and there have been many
studies monitoring various oxidative stress parameters [Tabner et al., 2005; Butterfield et al.,
2006; Zhao & Zhao, 2013; Chen & Zhong, 2014]. Thus, redox processes may play a viral role in
regulating the ACE2 gene expression. Consistent with the previous study [Aksenov et al., 2001],
DNPH-reactive protein carbonyls were found to be increased in our Alzheimer’s disease brain
samples.
Information about protein thiol oxidation in human Alzheimer’s brain has been limited.
Thiol redox status of proteins plays pivotal roles in biology [Boronat & Domènech, 2017; Chung
et al., 2013; Sen, 2000; Suzuki et al., 1997]. Since proteins are the functional molecules in the
biological system, their redox status directly reflects pathophysiology. While there are a number
of ways to monitor the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in the biological samples, the most of the
techniques only allow for the global assessment of the oxidation in cell or tissue samples [Rudyk
& Eaton, 2014] and the monitoring of the redox status of specific proteins cannot be readily
performed. Some techniques can identify individual proteins that are oxidized, but these
approaches are difficult, time consuming, and expensive [Leichert et al., 2008; Couvertier et al.,
2014]. The -SulfoBiotics- Protein Redox State Monitoring Kit Plus is remarkable in that it can
readily allow for the assessment of the redox states of specific proteins of interest in the
biological samples in a convenient and cost-effective fashion [Suzuki et al., 2019]. To
understand the thiol biology, we previously performed a redox state monitoring analysis of Prx6
using the -SulfoBiotics- Protein Redox State Monitoring Kit Plus system [Suzuki et al., 2019]. In
this system, a 15-kDa Protein-SHifter is added to every reduced cysteine residue, defining
protein thiol redox states while examining the mobility shift caused by the Protein-SHifters using
gel electrophoresis. Thiol status specifically on Prx6 was subsequently determined by Western

blotting. In human, the Prx6 protein molecule contains one catalytic cysteine and one additional
non-catalytic cysteine. We found that the treatment of cultured cells with hydrogen peroxide
caused the oxidation of the catalytic cysteine with a minimal influence on the non-catalytic
cysteine [Suzuki et al., 2019]. In Alzheimer’s disease patient brain samples, the present study
also showed that the catalytic cysteine is preferentially oxidized without significant influence on
the non-catalytic cysteine of Prx6. The protein thiol oxidation through the measurement of the
ratio of 40-kDa to 55-kDa species of Prx6 correlated with the degree of protein carbonylation.
Peroxiredoxins are a class of peroxidase antioxidant enzymes [Rhee, 2016; Rhee & Kil,
2017]. Six members of peroxiredoxins have been identified [Kim et al., 1988; Seo et al., 2000;
Rhee, 2016; Rhee & Kil, 2017]. Peroxiredoxins 1 - 5 contain two catalytic cysteines that perform
the two-electron reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water [Rhee, 2016; Rhee & Kil, 2017]. Prx6
is a unique peroxiredoxin that possesses only one catalytic cysteine and presumably utilizes
glutathione to receive the second electron for the two-electron reduction [Fisher, 2011; Fisher,
2017]. The present study also found that the Prx6 protein expression is higher in brains of
Alzheimer’s disease patients, supporting the concept that these brains have been adapted to
contain increased antioxidant defenses. Similarly to our results on Prx6, it has been reported that
the protein expression levels of peroxiredoxin 1 and 2 in the brain are also increased in
Alzheimer’s disease [Kim et al., 2001]. In our study, the increased Prx6 protein expression was
strongly correlated with the degree of oxidative stress as measured by protein carbonylation and
Prx6 thiol oxidation.
The correlation analysis of the brain ACE2 protein expression and various oxidative
stress parameters including protein carbonylation, cysteine oxidation of Prx6, and Prx6 protein
expression showed positive relationships. The relationship between ACE2 and Prx6 was found to

be the highest. However, the correlations between these redox parameters and the ACE2
expression were found to be modest, suggesting other factors may also participate in regulating
ACE2 gene expression in Alzheimer’s disease. Whether the mechanism of the upregulation of
ACE2 expression involves oxidative stress and whether increased ACE2 promotes oxidative
stress need further investigations.
In summary, the examination of brains from Alzheimer’s disease patients indicated that
ACE2 protein is upregulated in association with oxidative stress. Further work is needed to
determine whether redox processes participate in the mechanism of ACE2 gene expression or
whether ACE2 regulates oxidative stress in the brain. We analyzed 13 Alzheimer’s disease
patients and 5 controls. While the number of control subjects is relatively small, observed values
for these individuals were very consistent in all the parameters measured in the present study.
Also, in our study, the mean age was higher for Alzheimer’s disease patients than for controls,
however, the ACE2 protein expression was found not to be dependent on age with no correlation
detected (with a very low Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.059). Thus, it is not likely that
these limitations hamper our conclusion that Alzheimer’s disease per se is associated with
increased ACE2 protein expression. Our conclusion is further supported by a communication by
Lim et al., [2020] published as a Letter to the Editor that their genome-wide association study
detected upregulated Ace2 mRNA in the hippocampus of Alzheimer’s disease patients. In light
of the importance of ACE2 in the current pandemic, further investigations on the issue of ACE2
in Alzheimer’s disease brain is warranted, considering the possibility that the high level of ACE2
in Alzheimer’s disease patients may affect their responses to COVD-19.

Figure 3: Cysteine oxidation of Prx6 is upregulated in brains of Alzheimer’s disease
patients. Brain (hippocampus) homogenates from control subjects and Alzheimer’s patients
were investigated for cysteine oxidation of Prx6 using -SulfoBiotics- Protein Redox State
Monitoring Kit Plus. A free protein thiol group was labeled with the Protein-SHifter Plus that
contains maleimide with high affinity toward reduced sulfhydryl groups. Each Protein-SHifter
causes a 15-kDa shift. After electrophoresis, the Protein-SHifter Plus moiety was eliminated by
the exposure of the gel to ultraviolet light that increases the efficiency of Western blotting and
allowing for detection of specific proteins in biological samples. In case of human Prx6, the
protein with fully oxidized cysteine residues migrates at 25 kDa. The protein with one cysteine
reduced binds to a Protein-SHifter and migrates at 40 kDa, and the protein with two reduced
cysteine residues migrates at 55 kDa. Our previous study determined that the 40-kDa band
depicts Prx6, in which the catalytic cysteine (Cys47) is oxidized [Suzuki et al., 2019]. (A)
