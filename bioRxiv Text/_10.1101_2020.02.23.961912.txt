Abstract

20

A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets

21

with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95%

22

identity) to that of bat α-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural

23

reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission

24

to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM

25

structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å

26

resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural

27

similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1

28

subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically

29

analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and

30

the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes. The

31

results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most

32

ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion

33

is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV

34

S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results

35

structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV

36

and β-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species

37

transmission of coronaviruses.

Introduction

40

Coronaviruses, categorized into the order Nidovirales family Coronaviridae and

41

subfamily Coronavirinae, are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range1.

42

Their infections in humans, other mammals and birds can cause respiratory, hepatic,

43

enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity2. The severe acute respiratory

44

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

45

(MERS-CoV) have posed severe threats to human health in the 21st century1,3. In the

46

meantime, coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic

47

losses4. For example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)

48

(also known as SeACoV and PEAV) isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery

49

diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90% in several commercial pig farms

50

in Guangdong Province of China5-10. SADS-CoV is an α-coronavirus and other

51

representative members in the α-genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus

52

(PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), porcine respiratory

53

coronavirus (PRCV), human NL63 and 229E coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-

54

229E)1. Representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis

55

coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-

56

OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the β-genus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in the

57

γ-genus and porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) in the δ-genus1.

58

Cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination and/or mutations

59

underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses3,11-13. Bats are the natural reservoir

60

of more than 30 different α- and β-coronaviruses that have great potential for

61

interspecies transmission by recombination and/or mutation12,14-16. Data on genetic

62

evolution, receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human SARS-

63

CoV and MERS-CoV most likely originate from bats1. Palm civets and dromedary

64

camels are the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from bats to humans1,

65

respectively. The newly identified porcine SADS-CoV isolates are also found to share

66

~95% sequence identity with Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, and this further

67

stressed the severe results of coronavirus spillover from bats to domestic animals5-10.

68

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of SADS-CoV from

69

bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored. Recently it was shown

70

that SADS-CoV is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse,

71

chicken, pig, monkey and human, indicating a high potential of the SADS-CoV for

72

interspecies transmission17.

73

The spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host

74

receptor with the S1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the S2

75

subunit, thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism18,19. As a class I viral

76

fusion protein, the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each

77

monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into S1 and

78

S2 subunits18. For most coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit

79

(NTD) recognizes cell surface carbohydrates, while the C-terminal domain (CTD)

80

specifically binds to cellular protein receptors18-20. SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 utilize

81

CTD to bind human receptor ACE221-23; MERS-CoV utilizes CTD to bind human

82

receptor DPP424,25; TGEV, PRCV and 229E utilize CTD to bind receptor APN26-28;

83

HCoV-OC43 utilizes NTD to recognize glycans29; and one exception is MHV, which

84

utilizes the NTD to bind mouse receptor CEACAM1a30. Therefore, the S1 subunit,

85

especially its NTD and CTD, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible

86

for different tropisms of coronaviruses. In comparison, the S2 subunit containing the

87

fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) for membrane fusion are more

88

conserved in both sequence and structure18,19. For the SADS-CoV, receptor analysis

89

indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ACE2, DPP4

90

and APN are essential for the cell entry7,17. There are also no reports regarding to the

91

recognition of glycans by the NTD of SADS-CoV.

92

Structural studies of the spike and its binding with glycans and protein receptors

93

have provided important insights into the origin, evolution and interspecies

94

transmission of coronaviruses. Cryo-EM structures of spike trimer from all four

95

coronavirus genera have been reported: the α-coronavirus spike structures are

96

determined for HCoV-NL6331, HCoV-229E27 and PEDV32; the β-coronavirus spike

97

structures are determined for MHV33,34, HCoV-HKU135, HCoV-OC4329, SARS-

98

CoV21,36-38 and MERS-CoV36,39,40; the γ-coronavirus spike structure is determined for

99

IBV41 and the δ-coronavirus spike structure is determined for PdCoV42,43. The cryo-

100

EM structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported, and only crystal

101

structures of the CTD from HKU444, HKU545 and HKU946 were determined.

102

The spikes of SADS-CoV (1130 amino acid residues) and HKU2 (1128 amino

103

acid residues) are the shortest among all known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and

104

their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28%,

105

indicating the spikes of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are unique5-10,47. In this study, we report

106

the cryo-EM structures of the SADS-CoV and HKU2 spike trimers at 2.83 Å and 2.38

107

Å resolution, respectively. The HKU2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat

108

coronavirus. We analyzed the HKU2 and SADS-CoV trimer structures and also

109

compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit

110

of HKU2 with other spikes from α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronaviruses. Our results strongly

111

support that HKU2 and SADS-CoV preserve primitive structural features in their spikes

112

that have a close evolutionary relationship with β-coronavirus spikes and provide new

113

insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.

Results

116

Protein expression and structure determination

117

The cDNAs encoding HKU2 spike (YP_001552236) and SADS-CoV spike

118

(AVM41569.1) were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression.

119

HKU2 ectodomains (residues 1-1066) and SADS-CoV ectodomains (residues 1-1068)

120

were separately cloned into pFastBac-Dual vector (Invitrogen) with C-terminal foldon

121

tag and Strep tag. After expression in Hi5 insect cells and purification to homogeneity,

122

the cryo-EM images on these two spike ectodomains were recorded using FEI Titan

123

Krios microscope operating at 300 KV with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector

124

(Supplementary Fig. 1). About 1,400,000 particles for HKU2 spike and 900,000

125

particles for SADS-CoV spike were subjected to 2D classification, and a total of

126

421,490 particles of HKU2 spike and 152,334 particles of SADS-CoV spike were

127

selected and subjected to 3D refinement with C3 symmetry to generate density maps

128

(Supplementary Fig. 2). The overall density maps were solved to 2.38 Å for HKU2

129

spike and 2.83 Å for SADS-CoV spike (gold-standard Fourier shell correlation = 0.143)

130

(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). The atomic-resolution density map

131

enabled us to build nearly all residues of HKU2 spike ectodomains (residues 17-995)

132

except for a few breaks (residues 129-141 and 204-204), as well as 48 N-linked glycans

133

(Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4a). The final refined model of SADS-

134

CoV spike contains residues 19-998 with some short breaks (residues 134-143 and 488-

135

490) and 45 N-linked glycans (Supplementary Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4b).

136

Data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed in

137

Supplementary Table 1.

138
139

Overall structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes

140

The overall structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes we determined here resemble

141

the previously reported pre-fusion structures of coronaviruses spikes. Both spike

142

trimers have a mushroom-like shape (~150 Å in height and ~115 Å in width) (Fig. 1a),

143

consisting of a cap mainly formed by β-sheets of the S1 subunit, a central stalk mainly

144

formed by α-helices of the S2 subunit, and a root formed by twisted β-sheets and loops

145

of the S2 subunit (Fig. 1a). In each trimer there is a C3 axis along the central stalk (Fig.

146

1a). The amino acid identity between HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes is 86%, and these

147

two spike structures are quite similar with the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.)

148

being 0.53 Å for 962 aligned Cα atoms of the monomer and 0.56 Å for 2886 aligned

149

Cα atoms of the trimer. Due to the high structural similarity, we will use the HKU2

150

structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description, whereas

151

significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary.

152

The S1 subunit of the HKU2 spike comprises two major domains, NTD and CTD,

153

which are followed by two subdomains SD1 and SD2 connecting them to the S2 subunit

154

(Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c). The S1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike,

155

in which the three CTDs in the inner part are at the apex sitting on top of the central

156

stalk and the three NTDs are located outside the CTDs surrounding the central stalk

157

(Fig. 1a). The NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 of the S1 subunit are all mainly composed of

158

β strands regarding to the secondary structure feature (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the upstream

159

helix (UH), fusion peptide (FP), connecting region (CR), heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and

160

central helix (CH) of the S2 subunit are mainly composed of helices, whereas the β-

161

hairpin (BH) and subdomain 3 (SD3) at the bottom part of the S2 subunit mainly consist

162

of β stands and loops (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the residues after the SD3, which contain the

163

heptad repeat 2 (HR2), are not resolved in the HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike structures,

164

as well as in all other reported coronavirus spike structures in the pre-fusion state.

165

The SD1 and SD2 of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit are highly similar in amino

166

acid sequence (85%, 84% and 95% identities) and structure (Cα r.m.s.d. less than 0.5

167

Å) between HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes (Supplementary Fig. 5). The NTD has the

168

lowest sequence identity of 70% among all domains. Structural superimposition also

169

gave a Cα r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å between these two NTDs, and conformational variations

170

reside in the loops, although the core β sheet structure is structurally conserved

171

(Supplementary Fig. 5a). The CTD sequence identity between HKU2 and SADS-CoV

172

spikes is 82%, but the Cα r.m.s.d. between these two CTDs is 1.1 Å, also indicating

173

structural variations in the CTD in comparison with the highly conserved SD1, SD2

174

and S2 subunit. The NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit are commonly utilized by

175

coronaviruses for binding cell-surface carbohydrates or protein receptors for cell

176

attachment20. Therefore, the sequence and/or structural variations indicate that HKU2

177

and SADS-CoV would also bind different host receptors by NTD and/or CTD of the

178

S1 subunit, although their receptors in bat and pig are unknown and the receptor-

179

binding sites on spike have not been defined.

180
181

NTD structure and comparisons

182

The NTD of HKU2 has three layers of antiparallel β-sheet with the top one consisting

183

of six strands, the middle one consisting of five strands and the bottom one consisting

184

of three strands. Below the bottom sheet is a short α-helix (Fig. 2a). The top and middle

185

β-sheets form a galectin-like β-sandwich fold, which is inserted between two stands of

186

the bottom sheet (Fig. 2a). To supplement, three disulfide bonds are detected in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.961912; this version posted February 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this

187

HKU2 NTD structure: C17-C56 connecting the N-terminus of the NTD to its upper loop,

188

C124-C149 connecting β6 and β7 stands in the top sheet and C234-C244 connecting the

189

bottom helix to the bottom sheet (Fig. 2a).

190

Although the NTDs of all coronaviruses adopt a similar overall architecture, the

191

NTD of HKU2 has the highest structural similarity with the NTD1 (named domain 0 in

192

previous reports) of α-coronavirus HCoV-NL63 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.7 Å for 186

193

aligned Cα atoms (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7d). The NTD1 of α-coronavirus

194

PEDV is not completely modeled in the spike trimer structure, however the partial

195

model still fits well with the NTD of HKU2 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.3 Å for 73 aligned Cα

196

atoms. Both HCoV-NL63 and PEDV have a second NTD (NTD2, also named domain

197

A in previous reports), and the NTD of HKU2 is structurally less similar to the NTD2

198

with an r.m.s.d. of 4.3 Å against HCoV-NL63 NTD2 and of 4.1 Å against PEDV NTD2

199

(Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7d). Recent structural determination showed that

200

another α-coronavirus, HCoV-229E, also has one NTD, which is more structurally

201

similar to the NTD2 (Cα r.m.s.d. of 2.0 Å) than the NTD1 (Cα r.m.s.d. of 3.7 Å) of

202

HCoV-NL63 (Fig. 2b). All above comparisons indicate that there are two subtypes of

203

NTD in the α-coronaviruses: the subtype I represented by the NTDs of HKU2 and

204

SADS-CoV and the NTD1s of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV, and the subtype II represented

205

by the NTD of HCoV-229E and the NTD2s of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV (Fig. 2b).

206

Although sharing an overall architecture, these two NTD subtypes have a structural

207

difference in the galectin-like β-sandwich fold containing the top and middle sheets

208

stacked together through hydrophobic interactions. These two β sheets are well aligned

209

in the galectin-like domain of subtype I, whereas there is an alignment shift in the

210

galectin-like domain of subtype II (Fig. 2b). The other notable difference is the

211

distribution of signature disulfide bonds. A signature disulfide bond C124-C149

212

(numbered in HKU2 and connecting β6 and β7 stands in the top sheet) is conserved in

213

all subtype I NTDs (Fig. 2b), and the subtype II NTDs have two signature disulfide

214

bonds: the first one C145-C168 (numbered in HCoV-229E) connecting β5 and β6 strands

215

and the second one C81-C105 (numbered in HCoV-229E) connecting β2 and neighbor

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.961912; this version posted February 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this

216

loop (Fig. 2b). Besides, C234-C244 (numbered in HKU2 and connecting the bottom helix

217

to the bottom sheet) is conserved in both subtype I and subtype II NTDs (Fig. 2b).

218

The NTDs of β-coronaviruses including BCoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43,

219

MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and MHV resemble the subtype I, rather than the subtype II

220

NTD in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 2c). These β-

221

coronavirus NTDs have additional loops in the N-terminus, between β1 and β2 strands,

222

and between β6 and β7 stands (numbered in HKU2 structure), forming an extensive

223

ceiling-like structure on top of the galectin-like fold (Fig. 2c). It has been found that the

224

evolvement of this ceiling-like structure has functional outcomes such as immune

225

evasion or receptor binding41. The NTD of γ-coronavirus IBV also resemble the subtype

226

I NTD in the topology, although its disulfide bond positions are not conserved as in the

227

subtype I NTD (Fig. 2d). To be note, the NTD of δ-coronavirus PdCoV resemble the

228

subtype II NTD in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 2e). Both

229

IBV and PdCoV NTDs also have additional insertions including loops and short helices

230

in the galectin-like fold compared to the two subtypes of NTD in α-coronaviruses (Fig.

231

2d and Fig. 2e).

232
233

CTD structure and comparisons

234

The CTD of HKU2 has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet as the core with

235

connecting loops between the stands (Fig. 3a). It contains four disulfide bonds: C277-

236

C300 and C285-C290 at the N-terminus, C341-C397 at the C-terminus and the last one C331-

237

C369 connecting the β2 and β5 strands in the core β sheet (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, the

238

CTD core of HKU2 is of high structural similarity with the conserved CTD core of β-

239

coronaviruses and the disulfide bonds in the CTD of HKU2 except for C285-C290 are

240

also detected in all β-coronavirus CTDs (Fig. 3b). These CTDs have the core of one

241

twisted β-sheet and here we name them as one-layer CTD subtype (Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b).

242

The β-coronavirus CTDs always have an insertion consisting of loops and/or stands

243

between the β5 and β6 strands of the core (Fig. 3b). SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU4

244

and HKU5 have receptor-binding motif (RBM) in this insertion region responsible for

245

binding their respective protein receptors45. In the CTD of HKU2, there is only one

246

short loop between the β5 and β6 strands of the core twisted β-sheet (Fig. 3a).

247

Although as members in the α-genus, HKU2 and SADS-CoV CTD structures are

248

significantly different from those of other α-coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E,

249

PEDV, TGEV and PRCV that contain two layers of β-sheets (Fig. 3c). And we named

250

these CTDs as two-layer CTD subtype. All available two-layer CTD structures can be

251

well aligned with Cα r.m.s.d. in the range of 1.0-3.4 Å, except for the CTDs of HKU2

252

and SADS-CoV. These two-layer CTDs contain two highly conserved disulfide bonds:

253

C540-C586 and C569-C596 (numbered in PEDV CTD) (Fig. 3c). The C569-C596 is conserved

254

among all coronaviruses, whereas the C540-C586 is conserved in all α-coronaviruses

255

(except for HKU2 and SADS) and δ-coronavirus PdCoV (Fig. 3c).

256

The CTD of δ-coronavirus PdCoV have a core of two β-sheets, belonging to the

257

two-layer CTD subtype (Fig. 3c). As for the γ-coronavirus IBV, the core of its CTD is

258

also similar to the typical two-layer CTD (Fig. 3c). However, several β strands are

259

replaced by loops and the disulfide bonds are in different positions from the two-layer

260

CTD (Fig. 3c). IBV CTD also has an extra region of loops, reminiscent of the extra

261

domain in the CTDs of β-coronaviruses (Fig. 3c).

262
263

SD1 and SD2 structures and comparisons

264

The SD1 and SD2 are two subdomains following the CTD in the S1 subunit, linking

265

the CTD to the S2 subunit. The HKU2 SD1 is a partial β barrel consisting of five β

266

strands and a disulfide bond (C409-C458) connecting its C-terminus to the β1 strand (Fig.

267

4a). This five-stranded β barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all

268

four genera of coronavirus (Fig. 4a). The HKU2 SD2 has a structure of two layers of

269

β-sheet with an additional short α-helix over the top sheet (Fig. 4b). The additional α-

270

helix and the top sheet is linked by a disulfide bond (C482-C509), and another disulfide

271

bond (C524-C533) links the C-terminal loop to the bottom sheet (Fig. 4b). The two-layer

272

core structure and the second disulfide bond are conserved among all genera of

273

coronavirus, however, the additional α helix and the first linking disulfide bond is a

274

distinct feature of β-coronaviruses plus α-coronavirus HKU2 and SADS-CoV (Fig. 4b).

275

This additional helix appears to be an insertion between the primitive β2 and β3 strands

276

of the SD2, and is retained during evolution of β-coronaviruses.

277
278

Quaternary packing of the NTD and CTD in the spike

279

It has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of

280

the S1 subunits in the trimer: intra-subunit packing and cross-subunit packing41.

281

Actually, this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between NTD

282

and CTD in the spike monomer. The HKU2 S1 subunit, similar to those in -

283

coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, HCoV-226E and PEDV and -coronavirus PdCoV, have

284

an “inward” CTD which contacts with the NTD (Fig. 5a). The three structural “NTD-

285

CTD” modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of NTD and CTD from

286

the same monomer, forming the intra-subunit packing in the spike trimer (Fig. 5a). The

287

S1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the - and -genera including MHV, SARS-CoV,

288

MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and IBV have an “outward” CTD that is far away from the

289

NTD (Fig. 5b). Therefore, the three structural “NTD-CTD” modules in the cap region

290

of these spikes have the NTD from one monomer and the CTD from the adjacent

291

monomer, forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer (Fig. 5b). Interestingly,

292

we found that the “outward” CTDs always have an insertion in the core structure, such

293

as β-coronavirus CTDs and -coronavirus IBV CTD (Fig. 5b). In contrast, all “inward”

294

CTDs only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted

295

region.

296
297

Conserved S2 subunit and a distinct CR

298

Sequence analysis suggested that the S1/S2 protease cleavage site at the boundary

299

between the S1 and S2 subunits is R544-M545 in HKU2 spike and R546-M547 in

300

SADS-CoV spike5,8,47. Compared to the S1 subunit, the topology and structure of S2

301

subunit are highly conserved in all coronavirus spikes. The HKU2 S2 subunit contains

302

a 3-helix upstream helix (UH) (residues 589-639), a fusion peptide helix (FP) (residues

303

672-684), a connecting region (CR) (residues 689-747), a 4-helix heptad repeat 1 (HR1)

304

(residues 748-836), a central helix (CH) (residues 837-887), a twisted β-hairpin (BH)

305

(residues 888-929) and a β-sandwich like SD3 (residues 930-995) (Fig. 1b and Fig. 6a).

306

Like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state, the model of HR2 after SD3 was

307

not built in the structure due to poor density. Five disulfide bonds in S2 are detected.

308

Two of them (C590-C612 and C595-C601) stabilize the folded helices of UH, C696-C706

309

bends the CR, C884-C895 links the CH and the BH, and C934-C943 is within the SD3 (Fig.

310

6a). The first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses, and the last one

311

in the SD3 has different positions in different spikes. Specifically, it links the β2 and β3

312

stands of SD3 in the spikes of HKU2, SADS-CoV and MERS-CoV (numbered in

313

MERS-CoV), and in other coronavirus spikes it links the β2 stand to the C-terminal

314

loop of SD3 (numbered in MERS-CoV) (Supplementary Fig. 6).

315

All coronavirus spikes have the S2’ protease site upstream from the FP in the S2

316

subunit, which is essential for proteolytic fusion activation of the spike. Receptor

317

binding and cleavage at the S2’ site promote large-scale conformational changes of the

318

FP, CR, HR1 and HR2, allowing the insertion of FP into host cell membrane and the

319

formation of six-helix bundle. The FP and CR, which are often not well and totally

320

resolved in other coronavirus spike structures, can be clearly modeled in the HKU2

321

spike due to the atomic resolution of the map (Supplementary Fig. 4). The typical CR

322

in the S2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand, with a disulfide bond

323

bending the first and second helix to form a turning (Fig. 6b). In HKU2, the second

324

helix is replaced by a short strand (713-716) and the third helix is replaced by a loop

325

(721-741), therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in HKU2 CR (Fig.

326

6c). The conserved disulfide bond C696-C706 makes the first helix of CR in HKU2 spike

327

turn upside down. The S2’ cleavage site (between R671 and S672) is then covered by

328

the reversed CR helix and loops, and R671 interacts with E723 in the loop and K697

329

and K698 in helix 1 (Fig. 6c). In other coronaviruses, taking the MHV S2 for example,

330

the helix 1 does not cover the S2’ site (between R869 and S870), and R869 only loosely

331

interacts with T929 in helix 3 (Fig. 6b). After the dissociation of the S1 subunit triggered

332

by receptor binding, the exposure of the S2’ site for cleavage is a prerequisite for the

333

proteolytic activation of the coronavirus spike to mediate membrane fusion. The buried

334

S2’ site indicates that HKU2 spike, compared to other coronavirus spikes, would

335

require more conformational changes around the S2’ site for the exposure.

336
337

Discussion

338

A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV (also named as SeACoV and PEAV in other

339

reports) was recently identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern China,

340

and its genome sequence was most identical (~95% identity) to that of Rhinolophus bat

341

-coronavirus HKU25-10. The SADS-CoV and HKU2 are phylogenetically located in a

342

sub-lineage closely related to the proposed -coronavirus group-1b lineage at the

343

complete genome level5-10. However, phylogenetic analysis based on the spike

344

glycoprotein indicated that they are members of a separate lineage clustered within -

345

coronavirus (Supplementary Fig. 7a), suggesting that HKU2 and SADS-CoV probably

346

resulted from recombination of an -coronavirus with an unrecognized -coronavirus

347

S gene5-10. These results, together with the lower than 28% amino acid identities to

348

other known coronavirus glycoproteins, strongly indicate that the spike glycoproteins

349

of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are unique5-10. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM

350

structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoproteins at atomic resolutions. Pairwise

351

comparisons demonstrated nearly identical overall structures, and differences mainly

352

locate in the loops of NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit between the spikes of HKU2 and

353

SADS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 5). A series of structural analysis and comparisons

354

were also performed at the domain level between HKU2 spike with other coronavirus

355

spikes with determined structures. Our results show that HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes

356

maintain primitive structural features, especially in the NTD and CTD, and provide

357

more insights into the evolution of coronaviruses.

358

The HKU2 and SADS-CoV have one NTD in the S1 subunit, and their structures

359

are more similar to the NTD1 than the NTD2 of -coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and

360

PEDV, whereas the only NTD of HCoV-229E is structurally more similar to the NTD2

361

than the NTD1 (Fig. 2). Therefore, we suggest that α-coronaviruses have two subtypes

362

of NTD. The evolution relationship between them are not clear yet. It was once

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.961912; this version posted February 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this

363

suggested that the presence of two NTDs in HCoV-NL63 is a result of gene

364

duplication31. However, the sequence identity between these two NTDs is only 15.7%

365

in HCoV-NL63 and 12.9% in PEDV. Considering that HKU2 (SADS-CoV) and

366

HCoV-229E have one NTD belonging to either subtype I or subtype II, a more plausible

367

evolution way of the NTD in α-coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate

368

primitive domains into the genome, resulting in the presence of two NTDs in the S1

369

subunit α-coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63 and PEDV. To be note, these two NTD

370

subtypes may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of

371

NTDs of other genera coronaviruses. For example, in the current available spike

372

structures, the NTDs of -coronavirus are similar to the HKU2 NTD representing the

373

subtype I in both architecture and disulfide bond positions. These -coronavirus NTDs

374

also have additional loop ceiling over the top sheet, functionally facilitating immune

375

evasion or binding protein receptor such as in MHV30. The NTD of γ-coronavirus IBV

376

is also architecturally similar to the subtype I, although the disulfide bond positions are

377

not conserved (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the δ-coronavirus PdCoV NTD is similar to the

378

HCoV-229E NTD representing the subtype II in both architecture and disulfide bond

379

positions (Fig. 2e). A previous study of the IBV spike proposed that α-coronavirus

380

NTDs are probably the most ancestral and the NTDs of the four genera form an

381

evolutionary spectrum in the order of α-, δ-, γ-, and β-genus41. Our proposal here is

382

similar to the previous one in the point that two NTD subtypes in -coronaviruses may

383

represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of NTDs.

384

However, we argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of α-, δ-, γ-,

385

and β-genus. A more plausible pathway is that the β-, γ- and δ-coronavirus NTDs may

386

evolve independently and parallelly from subtype I (β- and γ-coronavirus NTDs) or

387

subtype II (δ-coronavirus NTDs) (Supplementary Fig. 7b).

388

The HKU2 and SADS-CoV CTD structure have a one-layer core consisting of a

389

twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet. Interestingly, -coronavirus CTDs also have

390

the similar one-layer core structure and three strictly conserved disulfide bonds are also

391

present in the core of HKU2 CTD. Currently, all identified receptor-binding motif of -

392

coronavirus CTDs are within an inserted domain between two stands of the core sheet,

393

and this insertion responsible for receptor binding of -coronaviruses is replaced by a

394

short loop in HKU2 CTD. This result firstly indicates HKU2 CTD represent a primitive

395

structure in the one-layer CTD family, while the inserted domain in -coronaviruses

396

results from a recombinant event during evolution (Supplementary Fig. 7c). The second

397

indication is that HKU2 and SADS-CoV may not utilize the CTD to bind protein

398

receptors that have not been identified yet, and their different receptor usage may be

399

determined by the NTD that harbors almost 50% of residue difference between them.

400

To be note, the CTDs from other -coronaviruses, γ-coronavirus IBV and δ-coronavirus

401

PdCoV all belong to the two-layer subtype consisting of two layers β-sheets, although

402

with structural variations in different viruses. These results further confirmed the

403

previous phylogenetic analysis suggesting that HKU2 and SADS-CoV probably

404

resulted from a recombination of an -coronavirus genomic backbone with an

405

unrecognized -coronavirus spike gene5,8,47.

406

In contrast with the NTD and CTD having unique structural feathers, the SD1 and

407

SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunits of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are

408

structurally conserved as those of other coronaviruses. In the evolutionary aspect, it is

409

not surprising because this region either connects the CTD to the S2 subunit (SD1 and

410

SD2) or mediates the membrane fusion, whereas the NTD and CTD are key factors

411

determining tissue tropism and host range of coronaviruses20. Even highly conserved

412

in overall structure, the S2 subunit in HKU2 and SADS-CoV still have a secondary

413

structure arrangement in the connecting region (CR) after the fusion peptide (FP),

414

resulting in a more buried S2’ cleavage site (Fig. 6c). It indicates that although the

415

membrane fusion mechanism is highly conserved, the dynamic fusion procedures of

416

HKU2 and SADS-CoV may still have their unique features that need to be addressed

417

in the future.

418

Since the outbreak of SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, new coronaviruses including

419

MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 in human and PdCoV and SADS-CoV in

420

livestock has been identified1,16. Extensive studies also revealed a diversity of

421

coronaviruses in bats that could be the source for emergence of zoonotic epidemics such

422

as SARS in the past and new one in the future1,12,16. The spikes of bat coronavirus

423

HKU2 and porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV (1128 and 1130 residues) are the shortest

424

among all current known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and their NTDs and CTDs

425

may also represent evolutionary ancestors5-9,47. In comparing the structures of HKU2

426

and SADS-CoV spikes with other coronavirus spikes, we observed that additional

427

NTDs could be recombined, ceiling loops could be inserted into NTD core, and extra

428

domain containing receptor-binding motif could be inserted into the CTD core structure.

429

These phenomena indicate the subdomains are gradually recruited into the S1 subunit

430

during evolution, and the recruitments are required for cross-species transmission,

431

adapting to different host range, and responding to the updating of host immune system,

432

which provides a vivid example for the co-evolution of virus and host.
