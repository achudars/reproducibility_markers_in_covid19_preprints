Abstract
To detect the presence of antibodies in blood against SARS-CoV-2 in a highly sensitive and
specific manner, here we describe a robust, inexpensive ($200), 3D-printable portable imaging
platform (TinyArray imager) that can be deployed immediately in areas with minimal
infrastructure to read coronavirus antigen microarrays (CoVAMs) that contain a panel of
antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-1, MERS, and other respiratory viruses. Application includes

basic laboratories and makeshift field clinics where a few drops of blood from a finger prick
could be rapidly tested in parallel for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with a test
turnaround time of only 2-4 h. To evaluate our imaging device, we probed and imaged
coronavirus microarrays with COVID-19-positive and negative sera and achieved a performance
on par with a commercial microarray reader 100x more expensive than our imaging device. This
work will enable large scale serosurveillance, which can play an important role in the months
and years to come to implement efficient containment and mitigation measures, as well as help
develop therapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Introduction
To date, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, with many
more to come, shattered health care and social systems and crippled the economy on an
unprecedented global scale1. Long incubation periods in combination with transmission through
pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers, exacerbated by the highly contagious nature of
SARS-CoV-2, have rendered prevention of community spread very difficult2–11. As an essential
step towards recovery, to implement efficient containment measures, and to help develop
therapeutics and vaccines, we must implement broad testing, for the virus and for antibodies
against the virus.
To better understand the humoral response to viral exposure, model the spread of
COVID-19, and help orchestrate local public health containment measures, we recently
constructed a novel serology test, Coronavirus Antigen Microarray (CoVAM)12,13. CoVAM can
currently measure antibody levels in serum samples against 67 antigens from 23 strains of 10
viruses known to cause respiratory tract infections including SARS-CoV-2. New antigens can be
included as the virus evolves. Probing this large number of antigens simultaneously in a single
test allows for much higher specificity, sensitivity, and information density than conventional
antibody tests such as lateral flow assays (LIFAs). LIFAs are susceptible to false positive

results, especially for COVID-19 and current LIFA test performance has been reported
inadequate for most individual patient applications14. Testing for reactivity against only one or
two antigens is not always reliable as cross-reactivity can occur. The CoVAM test can tease out
this cross-reactivity by taking a simultaneous snapshot of the relative serum reactivity against
multiple, cross-species viral antigens. In addition, each array contains four replicates of the
same set of antigens to vastly improve statistical power. This way, CoVAM can easily
discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from SARS, MERS and other common coronaviruses12,13.
Furthermore, the highly specific CoVAM array is specifically designed for low-cost, highthroughput serological studies on the scale of >100,000 samples, which will be critical as the
virus is spreading to low-income countries with large populations.
While microarrays could be printed and distributed on a large scale, reading the slides
by fluorescence imaging currently requires expensive ($10,000 - $100,000) machines which
many clinical laboratories currently do not possess and are especially difficult to move to
makeshift testing sites including field clinics. Sending the probed slides back to designated
imaging centers is expensive and time consuming, therefore unsuitable for the required largescale testing. In the upcoming months and years, serosurveillance technology to mitigate the
continuing spread of COVID-19 and other viral pathogens must be capable of repeated testing
of a large global population. To make this possible, a robust, inexpensive, portable imaging
platform that can be deployed immediately in any basic laboratory to read coronavirus antigen
microarrays is required. This will be especially valuable in countries with otherwise highly
vulnerable populations due to restricted access to tests and lack of a suitable health care
infrastructure. To address this issue, we have developed a robust, inexpensive ($100 - $300),
and portable imaging platform, the TinyArray imager, that can be deployed immediately in any
basic laboratory. Our TinyArray imager uses a 3D printable design in which widely available
components were used to excite fluorescence of labeled secondary antibodies that can be
detected with an inexpensive 5-megapixel camera module with sufficient spatial resolution and

sensitivity to reliably read microarrays. In this work, we show that, with patient samples, this
imaging platform can match the results obtained with a 100x more expensive commercial
imager; linear regressions of microarray fluorescence intensities consistently showed R-squared
values >0.85 between imaging systems, similar to linear regressions between image replicates
acquired on the same device. By bringing low cost, high throughput, highly specific serological
testing to the public, our platform could be highly valuable for COVID-19 serosurveillance.
Results
Imager Design
Various low-cost microscopy platforms using portable devices such as cell phone cameras have
been recently developed for various applications. In mobile devices, different illumination
strategies have been reported including on-axis epi-illumination15,16, off-axis inclined
illumination17, butt-coupling18, and total internal reflection19. In order to avoid out-of-focus
background with these illumination schemes, either the sample is compressed to a thickness of
~10 µm by mounting it between two glass slides20 or physical properties of the sample such as
plasmonic enhancement due to the presence of a metal surface17 or total internal reflection due
to the presence of a refractive index change are exploited19. Yet, to reliably read microarrays, a
suitable device also needs to provide a large (5-75 mm), uniform, undistorted field of view with
high spatial resolution (~10 µm), and the sensor response across the field of view must be
calibrated to ensure a linear response. Also, probing of multiple antibody isotypes such as IgA,
IgM, and IgG in a single test requires several spectral windows for illumination and detection of
secondary antibodies labeled with different dyes; the light sources must be arranged to ensure
consistent, homogeneous illumination and detection. Finally, the imager should be linked to a
data bank or computational facility to safely store and analyze patient data. To test a broad
population in an inexpensive, high throughput manner, the microarray reader should combine all
these traits while being portable, of low cost, and easy to use by non-experts with minimal

training. The device should also feature low power consumption to allow battery powered
operation and be possible to manufacture on a large scale in a simple fashion. Our TinyArray
imager combines all these traits to read microarrays on a large scale (Fig. 1a).
We focused on imaging microscope slides of 25 mm x 75 mm x 1 mm as these are the
most common for microarray printing. Other formats could be imaged by adjusting the slide
holder size or by using an adapter. As the best compromise between ease-of-use and hardware
requirements, the slide is imaged in two steps using a slot-in design.

Raspberry Pi 4 single board computer interfacing the camera and 75 mm x 25 mm x 1 mm microarray slide inserted
into the device. Scale bars, 30 mm.

This way, the slide can be positioned precisely into the camera field of view by inserting it into
the reader until it reaches a stop. This process is repeated by inserting the slide from the other
end. To image the entire slide as a whole, the resolution of the camera chip and size of optics
would need to be very large, while capturing more than two smaller fields of views would require
a more complicated slide positioning mechanism. Microarray images are acquired from the top
with a 5-megapixel OmniVision OV5647 sensor that is widely available as a camera module for
popular single board computers such as the Raspberry Pi (Fig. 1b). Placed immediately before
the camera lens (3.6 mm focal length), long pass (LP570, LP660) and band pass filters (BG40)
were used to spectrally select for the fluorescence emission of the employed fluorophores.
Fluorescence excitation was realized from the top with two LEDs (470 nm) along the long axis
of the microarray slide next to the camera at a slight angle to ensure homogeneous illumination
of the field of view. All components including illumination, detection optics, and the sample
holder are integrated in a CAD/CAM model that can be manufactured on a large scale at low
cost, for example, by 3D printing or injection molding (Fig. 1c). A picture of the 3D printed and
assembled microarray imager prototype is shown in Fig. 1d.
Evaluation with Microarrays of Serial Dilutions of Quantum Dot Probes
To evaluate the performance of the imaging device, we printed microarrays with serial dilutions
of QD655-Streptavidin, sample fluorescence images are shown in Fig. 2a,b. For testing, 16-pad
microarray slides (Oncyte Avid, Grace Bio-Labs) with pad dimensions 7 mm x 7 mm were used,
and microarray dots in a configuration of 18 x 18 spots per pad (150 µm diameter, 280 µm
spacing) were printed with serial dilutions of QD655-Streptavidin across a concentration range
of three orders of magnitude (Fig. 2c). For evaluation, images of these test slides were acquired
with a camera-based system (ArrayCAM 400-S, Grace Biolabs) and our TinyArray imaging

module. For illumination, two 470-nm LEDs were used with a battery-powered driver circuit
(LD06AJSA, Amazon). Fluorescence was detected through a 570-nm long pass filter (Schott
OG570, Thorlabs). Our data show that the 5-megapixel sensor employed has enough spatial
resolution and sensitivity to reliably read microarrays. Images were acquired and processed
using the Python programming language and related libraries and packages (available at
https://www.python.org/). The camera exposure time was adjusted to optimize the dynamic
range to the fluorescence signal and to ensure a linear response. Before microarray imaging,
reference images of a well-defined 7 x 14 square checkerboard pattern were taken and the
camera lens aberrations were measured and corrected using the Open Computer Vision
(OpenCV) package (available at https://opencv.org/). Background was removed by subtraction
of a median-filtered (15 pixel radius) version of the same image to eliminate spatial variations of
the signal offset. Fluorescence signal in the individual dots is not affected by this as they occupy
areas less than 15 pixels across. Image data was uploaded to a workstation through the single
board computer’s integrated WiFi connection where it was quantified with Mapix (Innopsys), as
shown in Fig. 2d,e. From the images and the cluster analysis, it can be seen that the data
obtained with the TinyArray imager is comparable to the ArrayCam 400-S. To further quantify,
we evaluated the TinyArray imager with microarrays that had been probed with serum samples
and developed for antibody signals using anti-human IgG and anti-human IgA secondary
antibodies that were conjugated to QD800 and QD655, an exemplary raw fluorescence image
of 2 x 2 microarray pads is shown in Fig. 2f, the corresponding background-subtracted image is
show in in Fig. 2g. In comparison with data from an ArrayCAM 400-S commercial imager, we
obtained R2 >0.85 through linear regression (Fig. 2f). This is similar to differences between
image repeats of the same samples taken by the ArrayCam and confirms that it is possible to
use our simple design instead of expensive, bulky, lab-based laser scanners.

Evaluation with Coronavirus Microarrays
We previously used CoVAM to detect IgG and IgA antibodies against a panel of antigens
including coronavirus spike protein (S) as separated receptor binding (RBD), S1, and S2
domains or whole protein (S1+S2) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) from multiple coronaviruses

including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and common cold coronaviruses (HKU1,
OC43, NL63, 229E)12,13. In Assis et al., high-performing antigens for IgG and IgA detection,
defined by Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve (ROC AUC) >0.95, were found
to discriminate between the positive group and negative groups with high significance including
all SARS-CoV-2 antigens and MERS-CoV S2 for IgG and SARS-CoV-2 S2 and S1+S2 for IgA.
As the microarray reader was specifically designed to enable broad access to microarray-based
SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, we repeated probing of a cohort of samples and imaged the
corresponding microarrays with our TinyArray imager prototype and the ArrayCAM 400-S
commercial imager. Coronavirus microarray slides were developed with secondary antibodies
against human IgG (Qdot 800 conjugated anti-human IgG, CAT#110610, Grace BioLabs)
labeled with quantum dot fluorescent probes as previously described12,13. Example images of
microarrays probed with positive sera are shown in Fig. 3a (ArrayCAM 400-S) and Fig. 3b
(TinyArray imager). The background-subtracted median fluorescence intensities were quantified
for each spot. The normalized intensities measured with the TinyArray imager were plotted
against the values obtained with the ArrayCAM 400-S in Fig. 3c; linear regression resulted in R2
values of 0.82-0.92. CoVAM heat maps of the 5 SARS-CoV-2-positive (9 arrays including 4
duplicates) and 10 negative control samples were generated from the Array Cam 400-S and
TinyArray imager data as shown in Fig. 3d. Antibodies in positive sera binding to the seven
SARS-CoV-2 antigens were further quantified in Fig. 3e for the Array Cam data and Fig. 3f for
the TinyArray imager data.

Discussion
It is well accepted that official infection numbers of COVID-19 are widely underestimated. This is
due to a shortage of tests, limiting testing to people with symptoms and the time-sensitive
nature of RT-PCR as it depends on the presence of viruses and/or viral genetic material in
respiratory tract mucosa. Broad availability of highly specific, high-throughput, inexpensive
serological testing can help manage COVID-19 over the coming months and years as it will be
able to determine the true density of exposed, seropositive people to enable containment and
mitigation measures to avoid formation of new COVID-19 hot spots. Massive serological testing
could also help devise strategies to restart the economy in a controlled way, minimizing the risk
of further waves of infections and COVID-19 related deaths. Furthermore, our assay can identify
potential blood donors who have recovered from COVID-19, thereby enabling plasma
transfusion to treat COVID-19 patients via passive immunization21. Lastly, our serology testing
can reveal information about the global host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and provide
insights to guide therapeutic and vaccine research and development.
In order to get a comprehensive view of the serological status of a large population as
well as better predict disease distribution and outcome to help develop more efficient control
measures, microarrays are an invaluable tool. CoVAM is specifically designed for highthroughput serological studies on the scale of >100,000 samples with a minimal number of

reagents, which will be critical to enable massive, repeated testing of large populations. For this
purpose, testing can be highly parallelized using multi-pad slides or well plates where 16 or 96
patient samples can be probed simultaneously per plate. Imaging with the TinyArray imager
only takes tens of seconds such that many slides/plates can be imaged quickly after parallel
incubation to scale up throughput. As a robust and inexpensive ($200) imaging platform, we can
deploy this powerful technology anywhere in the world to fight COVID-19. After imaging,
microarray data could be uploaded for cloud-based analysis using a smartphone. This capability
will be especially important in the upcoming months as the disease is spreading to countries
with minimal health care infrastructure and high population densities.
Materials and Methods
TinyArray Imager Design
The sample slides were illuminated with two 3-W LEDs (2 x 365 nm or 2 x 470 nm) from the top;
LEDs were driven by a DC-DC driver circuit to adjust the current (max 300 mA). LED
illumination was switched with the Raspberry Pi GPIO through a MOSFET switch. All electronics
were powered by a 5 V, 3.5 A power supply. Images of microarray slides were acquired with a
5-megapixel OmniVision OV5647 sensor without IR filter coupled to a lens of 3.6 mm focal
length adjusted to a field of view of 35 x 26 mm. Fluorescence was detected through a
combination of a 570-nm long pass filter (Schott OG570, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) with a
335 – 610 nm band pass filter (Schott BG40, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) to select for QD585
emission and 630-nm/660-nm long pass filters (Schott RG630, Thorlabs/Hoya R-66, Edmund
Optics) to select for QD655/QD800 emission. The camera was controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4
single board computer running Raspian 4.19 with software written in Python 3.7. A 3D
CAD/CAM model to house the components and hold the microarrays slides was created in
Solidworks 2019/2020 (Dassault Systemes, Waltham, MA). After 3D printing of the model
(Ender-3 pro, Creality3D, Hong Kong), all relevant optical components were inserted and

attached. The microarray slides used consisted of 2 x 8 pads of 7 mm x 7 mm each (Oncyte
Avid, Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR). In this configuration, 2 x 4 pads were imaged simultaneously
with ample spatial resolution (13.5 µm sample pixel size) to resolve the individual dots (150 µm
diameter, 280 µm spacing) of the 18 x 18 dot microarrays. Hence, the whole 2 x 8 array could
be read by taking only two images. The microarray slides could be inserted directly into the
device in a dedicated slot that maintains the correct distance/position to the illumination and
detectors (here, 40 mm). After slide insertion into the slot in either direction, bump stops at the
end ensure the correct position (pads 1-8 and pads 9-16, respectively) of the slide to reliably
image all pads and to make sure that the individual pads of the slide were indexed correctly.
Image Acquisition and Data Transfer
Software deployed on the microarray imaging device ensured acquisition of reproducible,
quantifiable images of antigen arrays. In the prototype, we used the Python programming
language and the following libraries: picamera, numpy, Image, scipy. Python and packages are
freely available at https://www.python.org/. Images were transferred through the Raspberry Pi’s
internal WiFi connection. Camera exposure times (1s – 5 s) and sensitivity settings (ISO 100 –
ISO 800) were adjusted to optimize the dynamic range to the fluorescence signal and ensure a
linear response. To reliably quantify microarrays, it is important that the individual spots appear
in a defined grid at constant distances. Therefore, spherical aberrations of the imaging lens
were characterized by taking a reference image of a checkerboard pattern (7 x 14 squares) and
corrected in the microarray images using the Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) package for
Python (https://opencv.org/). Background was subtracted to eliminate spatial variations of the
signal offset. For this purpose, a 15-pixel median filter was applied to the image data and the
result subtracted from the raw image.

To enable quantification of the dye concentration indicative of the antibody concentration in all
spots of the array, the intensity must be determined in each spot. For this purpose, microarray
slides were printed with a distinct pattern of 18 x 18 dots (150 µm diameter, 280 µm spacing).
The slides were imaged using both the TinyArray imager and the commercial ArrayCam system
(Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR). As the size and distances of the spots were known, the
background-subtracted median spot fluorescence intensity was measured and quantified using
Mapix (Innopsys) as previously described22–24. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the four
replicate spots for each antigen was utilized for antigen heat map generation and data analysis.
Coronavirus Antigen Microarray Probing
Coronavirus microarrays (CoVAMs) were probed as previously described12,13. CoVAM included
67 antigens against 23 respiratory virus strains including SARS-CoV-2, provided by Sino
Biological Inc. (Wayne, PA). Four replicates of antigen patterns were printed in a 18 x 18 dot
arrangement onto each 7 mm x 7 mm pad of the 2 x 8 pad nitrocellulose-coated microarrays
slides (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR) with an OmniGrid 100 microarray printer (GeneMachines).
Before printing, lyophilized antigens were reconstituted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in
printing buffer containing protein stabilizers. Each pad was probed with human sera, imaged,
and analyzed as previously described22–24. Briefly, slides were probed with 1:100 dilutions of
human sera with 1x GVS Fast Blocking Buffer (Fischer Scientific) and incubated for 2 h at room
temperature. The microarrays were then washed 3x with T-TBS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150
mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, adjusted to pH 7.5 and filtered), labeled with secondary antibodies
to human IgA and IgG conjugated to quantum dot (QD) fluorophores for 1 h at room
temperature, followed by a second 3x wash with T-TBS before drying.

sera were collected in the context of a larger study to identifying acute respiratory infection (ARI)
cases in a college resident community in the Eastern United States monitored using
questionnaires and RT-qPCR25. From among de-identified blood specimens for which future
research use authorization was obtained, five specimens that showed high IgG reactivity
against human coronaviruses in the larger study were chosen for validation of the coronavirus
antigen microarray13.
