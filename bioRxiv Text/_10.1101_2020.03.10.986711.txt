Abstract

2

The recent emergence of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

3

CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is a major burden for health care systems worldwide. It is

4

important to address if the current infection control instructions based on active

5

ingredients are sufficient. We therefore determined the virucidal activity of two

6

alcohol-based hand rub solutions for hand disinfection recommended by the World

7

Health Organization (WHO), as well as commercially available alcohols. Efficient

8

SARS-CoV-2 inactivation was demonstrated for all tested alcohol-based disinfectants.

9

These findings show the successful inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 for the first time and

10

provide confidence in its use for the control of COVID-19.

11
12

Importance

13

The current COVID-19 outbreak puts a huge burden on the world’s health care

14

systems. Without effective therapeutics or vaccines being available, effective hygiene

15

measure are of utmost importance to prevent viral spreading. It is therefore crucial to

16

evaluate current infection control strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We show the

17

inactivation of the novel coronavirus for the first time and endorse the importance of

18

disinfectant-based hand hygiene to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

20

Introduction

21

SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic human CoV to have crossed the species

22

barrier into humans during the last 20 years1,2,3. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated

23

with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is characterized by severe

24

respiratory distress, fever and cough, leading to a high percentage of fatalities,

especially in the elderly or patients with comorbidities4. As of March 6th 2020 there are

2

101604 globally confirmed cases and related 3460 deaths5. Health care experts suspect

3

that a global pandemic is inevitable mainly because human-to-human transmission of

4

SARS-CoV-2 is very efficient and infected individuals can transmit the virus without

5

or with only mild symptoms4. Given that so far, no therapeutics or vaccines are

6

available, virus containment and prevention of infection are of highest priority.

7

Effective hand hygiene is crucial to limit virus spread. Therefore, easily available but

8

efficient disinfectants are crucial. The World Health Organization's 'Guidelines for

9

Hand Hygiene in Health Care' suggests two alcohol-based formulations for hand

10

sanitization to reduce pathogen infectivity and spreading. These recommendations are

11

based on fast-acting and broad-spectrum of microbicidal activity, as well as easy

12

accessibility and safety3. We have previously shown that WHO formulation I and II

13

were able to inactivate the closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV6. So far,

14

recommendations to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 were only translated from findings with

15

other coronaviruses7. To evaluate if alcohol-based disinfectants are also efficient for

16

the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, we tested different concentrations of WHO

17

formulation I and II, as well as the alcohols ethanol and 2-propanol for their virucidal

18

activity.

Results

21

SARS-CoV-2 was highly susceptible to the WHO formulations (Fig. 1). WHO

22

formulation I, based on 85 % ethanol, efficiently inactivated the virus with reduction

23

factors (RFs) of  5.9 and concentrations between 40 % – 80 % (Fig. 1A). Subsequent

24

regression analysis revealed similar inactivation profiles compared to SARS-CoV,

MERS-CoV and bovine CoV (BCoV), which is often used as surrogate for highly

2

pathogenic human CoVs (Fig. 1A). WHO formulation II, which is based on 75 %

3

isopropanol, demonstrated a better virucidal effect at low concentrations, with

4

complete viral inactivation and RFs of  5 at a minimal concentration of 30 % (Fig.

5

1B). The regression analysis showed an inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2, which

6

was in between SARS-CoV, BCoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1B).

7

Next, we addressed the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 against the individual

8

components of the WHO recommended formulations which are also the main

9

ingredients of commercially available hand disinfections. Both alcohols, ethanol (Fig.

10

2A) and 2-propanol (Fig. 2B) were able to reduce viral titers in 30 s exposure to

11

background levels with RFs between  4.8 and 5.9 after 30 sec. Furthermore, we could

12

show that a minimal concentration of 30 % ethanol or 2-propanol is sufficient for viral

13

inactivation (Fig. 2).

14
15

Discussions

16

This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently inactivated by both WHO

17

formulations implicating their use in health care systems and viral outbreak situations.

18

Notably, both tested alcohols, ethanol and 2-propanol were efficient in inactivating the

19

virus in 30 s at a minimal final concentration of at least 30 %. Alcohol constitutes the

20

basis for many hand rubs routinely used in health care settings. Our findings are

21

therefore of utmost importance in the current outbreak situation to minimize viral

22

transmission and maximize virus inactivation.

Chemicals

WHO I formulation consists of 85 % ethanol (v/v), 0.725 % glycerol (v/v) and 0.125 %

10

hydrogen peroxide (v/v). The isopropyl-based formulation, WHO II, contains 75 %

11

isopropanol (w/w), 0.725 % glycerol (v/v) and 0.125 % hydrogen peroxide (v/v)8 . In

12

addition, ethanol (CAS 64-17-5), and 2-propanol (CAS 67-63-0) were investigated.

Quantitative Suspension Test and Virus Titration

14

Virucidal activity studies were performed with a quantitative suspension test with 30

15

seconds exposure time3. Briefly, one part virus suspension was mixed with one part

16

organic load (0.3 % bovine serum albumin [BSA] as interfering substance) and eight

17

parts disinfection solution of different concentrations. Following 30 seconds exposure,

18

samples were serially diluted and the TCID50/mL values were determined by crystal

19

violet staining and subsequent scoring the amounts of wells displaying cytopathic

20

effects. TCID50 is calculated by the Spearman & Kärber algorithm as described9.

21

Cytotoxic effects of disinfectants were monitored by crystal violet staining and optical

22

analysis for altered density and morphology of the cellular monolayer in the absence of

23

virus and were quantified analogous to the TCID50/mL of the virus infectivity.
