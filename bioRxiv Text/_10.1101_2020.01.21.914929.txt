Abstract

26

Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic

27

fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California

28

serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often

29

asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals

30

have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential

31

antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral

32

molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that

33

exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore,

34

was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in

35

multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or

36

infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a

37

known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that

38

the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift

39

Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika),

40

and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant

41

reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of

42

potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus

43

replication.

44
45

Importance

46

No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen

47

compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses

48

with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against

49

La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis.

50

We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium

51

ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that

52

valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus

53

as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has

54

activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion

55

homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.

Introduction

59

Bunyaviruses are the largest family of viruses, composed of hundreds of members. These

60

segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses are transmitted primarily by an arthropod vector, and

61

several family members pose significant threats to human health. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV)

62

frequently infects humans and ruminants, resulting in severe morbidity and mortality. While RVFV

63

is primarily transmitted in Africa and the Middle East, the threat of global spread looms, and recent

64

examples of Zika1 and chikungunya2 viruses illustrate this tangible hazard. In addition to RVFV,

65

several other bunyaviruses infect humans and are associated with severe pathologies as well. La

66

Crosse virus (LACV), distantly related to RVFV, is a bunyavirus present primarily in the

67

midwestern and eastern United States3. LACV is transmitted by Aedes triseriatus, though Aedes

68

albopictus4–6 efficiently carries the virus as well. While relatively unknown and frequently

69

undiagnosed, LACV infects and causes neuroinvasive disease in dozens of people every year. In

70

fact, from 2009 to 2018, 679 such cases were reported according to the Centers for Disease

71

Control7. Further, LACV cases recently have emerged in the southeastern United States,

72

suggesting spread of the virus8. The ability of LACV to infect Aedes albopictus mosquitos will

73

likely lead to its continuing spread. Despite this spread and the severe disease associated with

74

LACV infection, no antivirals or vaccines are available to prevent or treat infection. Thus, LACV

75

presents a significant threat to human health.

76
77

Despite their prevalence, no antivirals are available to treat bunyavirus infection and palliative

78

care is given to patients presenting with LACV encephalitis. While several vaccine candidates

79

have been developed to target RVFV9–11, no similar effort has been invested in anti-LACV

80

therapeutics. With the increasing availability of drug panels to screen molecules for antivirals,

81

rapid investigation and deployment of antivirals for emerging viruses is possible. Several prior

82

screens for antivirals have successfully identified lead molecules and highlighted cellular

83

pathways critical to virus infection. For example, recent screens with chikungunya virus

84

highlighted berberine, abamectin, and ivermectin as promising antivirals12. Additionally, Zika virus

85

screens have uncovered known and novel antivirals13–15, including mycophenolic acid and

86

daptomycin, among others. More closely related to LACV, a RVFV screen highlighted azauridine

87

and mitoxatrone16. The ability to rapidly screen molecules highlights an opportunity to identify both

88

unique virus-specific and broad-spectrum antivirals, as these reports have highlighted.

89
90

Antivirals may target viral particles, viral processes and critical host-targeted antivirals17. Host-

91

directed antivirals have gained appreciation recently, as interfering with host processes crucial to

92

viral processes has several benefits, including potential for broad-spectrum activity and a

93

heightened requirement for antiviral resistance beyond minor mutations in the virus. Additionally,

94

numerous approved and available drugs are already available that can be repurposed as

95

antivirals18,19. While significant work remains to be done to identify and verify such antivirals,

96

rapidly screening compounds can provide insight.

97
98

Using the NIH’s Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), we obtained and screened >500

99

compounds for activity against LACV. We identified several known antivirals, including

100

deoxyuridine and quinonone. Importantly, we also identified a variety of novel classes of antivirals,

101

including metal ion chelators. Valinomycin, a top hit in our screen, functions by transporting

102

potassium ions against the electrochemical gradient. We investigated the antiviral activity of

103

valinomycin, observing that valinomycin exhibits antiviral activity in several cellular systems, in a

104

dose-dependent manner and independent of treatment time. We also found that valinomycin does

105

not directly inactivate viral particles, highlighting a cellular role for potassium ions in virus infection.

106

We expanded our results to additional ionophores, observing that some but not all effectively

107

blocked LACV replication. Finally, we determined that valinomycin is broadly antiviral, as it

108

reduced replication of several viruses from diverse families, including flaviviruses and

109

enteroviruses. Together, these data highlight the utility in rapid screening of antiviral molecules

110

as well as a crucial role for potassium ions in LACV infection.

111
112

Results

113

Development of rapid screening of NIH DTP compounds active against LACV. We

114

developed a simple, rapid assay to measure antiviral activity in Huh7 cells (Figure 1A). We plated

115

Huh7 cells to confluency in 96-well plates, to which we added 2 µM drug from the NIH NCI

116

Development Therapeutics Program (DTP). Two hours late, cells were infected at multiplicity of

117

infection (MOI) of 0.1 plaque-forming units (pfu) per cell. At 48 h post infection (hpi), cells were

118

fixed with formalin and stained with crystal violet stain. Because viable cells robustly stain with

119

crystal violet, while dead cells do not, we could discriminate between live and dead cells.

120

Importantly, any cytotoxic molecule would not stain with crystal violet; thus, stained cells indicate

121

antiviral molecules that are not cytotoxic at 2 µM. Crystal violet stain was subsequently

122

resuspended in 10% acetic acid and absorbance read at 595 nm. To control for inter-plate

123

variability, each plate contained an untreated and infected (low survival), untreated and uninfected

124

(high survival), and ribavirin-treated (400 µM) control (high survival). Absorbances of drug-treated

125

and infected wells (Figure 1B) were compared to untreated and uninfected controls by dividing

126

their absorbance values (Figure 1C). This ratio highlighted several candidate antivirals, including

127

lagistase, lapachol, superacyl, and valinomycin. Interestingly, we identified several known

128

antivirals in our screen, including deoxyuridine and nelarabine (summarized in Table 1). Thus,

129

our assay identified molecules with novel activity against LACV, including some recognized

130

antivirals.

131
132

Valinomycin restricts LACV replication. We focused on valinomycin, as the molecule was a

133

prominent hit in our screen, had a known mechanism relevant to LACV infection, and was not

134

previously described to have antiviral activity against LACV. As an initial consideration of its

135

antiviral activity, we performed secondary screening on Huh7 cells. Cells were seeded to

136

confluency, treated with increasing doses of valinomycin, from 1 to 64 µM, and infected at MOI

137

0.1. At 48h, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and stain was quantified by absorbance

138

reading. We observed that valinomycin exhibited antiviral activity at doses above 10 µM, as crystal

139

violet staining was stronger, suggesting more surviving cells (Figure 2A). Doses as high as 64 µM

140

did not affect crystal violet stain, suggesting that cellular viability was not compromised. To

141

confirm this phenotype with titers, we treated cells with increasing doses of valinomycin 2h prior

142

to infection at MOI 0.1 and measured titers by plaque assay at 48 hpi. We observed that viral

143

titers were significantly decreased compared to untreated controls (Figure 2B, dotted line) at

144

concentrations above 1 µM. In fact, viral titers were reduced over 100-fold at 10 µM. We calculated

145

an IC50 value of 1.4 µM. To confirm that cellular viability was not compromised, we used a

146

fluorescent assay to measure cellular ATP content after treatment with increasing doses of

147

valinomycin. We observed cellular toxicity at doses at and above 16 µM (Figure 2C, CC50 value

148

of 14 µM), though no toxicity was observed either by cellular morphology or fluorescent ATP assay

149

below 10 µM.

150
151

As further confirmation of valinomycin’s antiviral activity, we measured cell-associated viral

152

genomes. Huh7 cells were treated and infected as above and cell-associated RNA was collected

153

at 48 hpi. RNA was purified, reverse transcribed, and analyzed via qPCR for Small, Medium, and

154

Large genome segments, normalizing to cellular β-actin. Paralleling our titer data, valinomycin

155

treatment reduced viral genome content in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2D). Viral genome

156

content was reduced upwards of 100-fold with 10 µM valinomycin treatment. To extend these

157

results to other cell types, we treated and infected Vero-E6 cells as above and determined viral

158

titers by plaque assay at 48 hpi. Again, we observed a significant reduction in viral titer with an

159

IC50 value of 900 nM. In sum, our data suggest that valinomycin is antiviral at non-cytotoxic doses

160

in multiple cell types, reducing both viral titers and cell-associated viral genomes in a dose-

161

dependent manner.

162
163

Valinomycin is antiviral over multiple rounds of infection. Our initial assays were performed

164

at low MOI and viral titer measured at 48 hpi. To determine if valinomycin was antiviral over

165

several rounds of replication, we treated Huh7 cells with 2 µM valinomycin two hours prior to

166

infection at MOI 0.1 and subsequently collected samples to titer every 8h for 56h total. We found

167

that LACV titers were significantly reduced at all times after 8 hpi (Figure 3A); in fact, virus failed

168

to replicate above input virus titers (0h). To confirm that valinomycin was reducing virus

169

replication, we measured viral RNA genomes. To this end, we treated cells with increasing doses

170

of valinomycin, infected with LACV and collected cell-associated RNA in Trizol at 24 hpi. After

171

purifying and reverse-transcribing, we performed qPCR using primers specific to the small,

172

medium, and large genome segments. We observed that treatment with valinomycin significantly

173

reduced the number of viral genomes by >90% with treatment and that no individual genome

174

segment was affected more than another (Figure 3B). Together, these data suggest that

175

valinomycin blocks virus replication and reduces viral RNA accumulation.

176
177

Valinomycin does not reduce viral particle infectivity. Because we observe significant

178

reductions in LACV titers with valinomycin treatment, we hypothesized that valinomycin might be

179

directly affecting cellular processes to reduce virus infection. Nonetheless, valinomycin is a cyclic

180

peptide and could potentially directly inactivate viral particles, as seen previously20. To test

181

whether valinomycin directly reduced virus infectivity, we directly incubated LACV with 2 µM

182

valinomycin for 24h and directly titered the surviving virus at regular intervals. We found that

183

valinomycin did not significantly alter viral titer over the time examined (Figure 4A), suggesting

184

that valinomycin is not directly inactivating viral particles. We further examined the capacity of

185

valinomycin to inactivate particles by incubating with increasing doses, up to 10 µM valinomycin,

186

for 24h prior to directly titering. As in our timecourse, we observed no significant change in viral

187

titers at any dose (Figure 4B), again suggesting that valinomycin does not directly inactivate LACV

188

particles. As final confirmation of this phenotype, we measured viral RNA in viruses exposed to

189

increasing doses of valinomycin. We then compared the relative number of genomes to the titer

190

to calculate the genome-to-PFU ratio. We observed that this number did not change with

191

valinomycin treatment, suggesting no change in specific infectivity (Figure 4C). In sum, these data

192

suggest that valinomycin does not affect virus infectivity by directly acting on the virion.

194

Valinomycin activity alters host cell activity. We thus hypothesized that valinomycin’s antiviral

195

activity was due to its effect on the cell. The role of potassium in bunyavirus infection has been

196

well-documented, and bunyavirus entry is potassium dependent21,22. To test if valinomycin was

197

affecting the cell rather than the virus, we treated Huh7 cells with 2 µM valinomycin and,

198

immediately before infection, we washed away the drug. As a control, we maintained valinomycin

199

on cells or replaced the valinomycin after washing away the initial treatment. We observed that

200

even after removing and washing valinomycin from the cells, the antiviral activity persisted, as

201

viral titers remained reduced to the same level as when valinomycin treatment is concurrent with

202

infection (Figure 4D). Together, these data suggest that valinomycin does not directly inactivate

203

viral particles but that treatment of cells reduces LACV infection, potentially by disrupting

204

potassium-dependent entry.

205
206

Ionophores are selectively antiviral. Given that valinomycin is a potassium ionophore, we

207

wished to investigate whether other ionophores, for potassium or otherwise, were antiviral.

208

Potassium ions play a crucial role in cellular entry; however, a role for sodium or calcium ions is

209

not as well described. Marituba virus (MTBV) infection results in a sodium ion influx

210

origin or function of these ionic changes are not known. To determine if other ionophores might

211

exhibit antiviral activity, we treated cells with increasing doses of nonactin (potassium and sodium

212

ionophore), nigericin (hydrogen and potassium ionophore), calcium ionophore I, and sodium

213

ionophore III (Figure 5A). Two hours later, we infected with LACV at MOI 0.01 and measured viral

214

titers at 48 hpi. Both nonactin and nigericin exhibited significant antiviral activity, and viral titers

215

were not measurable above 4 and 1 µM, respectively (Figure 5B). Treatment with sodium

216

ionophore III resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viral titers, and virus was not recovered

217

above 10 µM. Interestingly, treatment with calcium ionophore I showed no changes in viral titer,

218

even at the highest dose. Thus, we observe that LACV replication is disrupted by several

219

ionophores, especially potassium ionophores, highlighting the role for potassium in virus infection.

23,

but the

220
221

Valinomycin is broadly antiviral. LACV is related to several other medically-relevant

222

bunyaviruses, including Keystone virus and Rift Valley fever virus. To determine whether these

223

viruses respond to valinomycin treatment, we treated and infected Huh7 cells with these viruses

224

and measured viral titers at 48 hpi. As with LACV, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in

225

viral titers, with titers decreasing greater than 100-fold at concentrations above 2 µM (Figure 6A).

226

To expand beyond bunyaviruses, we performed the same analysis with Zika virus (flavivirus)

227

infection (Figure 6B), Coxsackievirus B3 and human rhinovirus 2 (picornaviruses) (Figure 6C),

228

and SARS and MERS coronaviruses (coronaviruses) (Figure 6D). In all cases, valinomycin

229

significantly reduced viral titers. Zika virus titers were most sensitive to valinomycin treatment,

230

and virus was not recovered above 500 nM valinomycin treatment. Similarly, valinomycin

231

treatment significantly disrupted both 229E-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. Thus, valinomycin

232

exhibits broad antiviral activity, highlighting cellular potassium as a conserved and crucial host

233

factor in virus replication.

234
235

Discussion

236

Treating virus infected patients, including encephalitic patients, is limited in the scope of available

237

therapeutics. La Crosse virus lacks any approved treatment, and antiviral development could

238

benefit not only LACV-infected patients but perhaps patients infected with related bunyaviruses.

239

Unfortunately, antiviral development is a nonlinear process that has provided no promising targets

240

for this specific virus to date. Our screen is the first to investigate a large number (>500) of

241

compounds in their ability to reduce LACV infection in vitro, and our hits demonstrate that several

242

known antivirals may exhibit anti-LACV activity. Additionally, the identification of novel antivirals,

243

such as valinomycin provides novel avenues of antiviral development.

244
245

In our screens, valinomycin consistently exhibited antiviral activity and was selected for follow-up

246

experiments. Based on our results, valinomycin is a host-targeted antiviral with broadspectrum

247

activity. In fact, our tests against eight distinct viruses and four diverse families of virus suggest

248

(1) valinomycin has activity against evolutionarily-distant viruses and (2) these viruses rely on this

249

conserved host process for efficient replication. Precisely why each virus is sensitive to

250

valinomycin is likely virus-specific, though mechanisms for bunyaviruses have been

251

described22,24. As a potassium ionophore, valinomycin disrupts potassium ion gradients, resulting

252

in aberrant cellular events, including endocytosis. This potassium-dependent endocytosis is

253

required for efficient bunyavirus entry24. Additionally, a study using Hazara virus, a distantly

254

related bunyavirus, demonstrated that the viral fusion spike conformation was potassium-

255

sensitive21. Thus, valinomycin’s antiviral activity fits with the prescribed role of potassium ions

256

during virus infection, both highlighting the importance of this pathway for virus infection and its

257

potential as an antiviral target.

258
259

Valinomycin is a naturally occurring cycling peptide, synthesized by Streptomyces species as an

260

antibiotic25. In our assays, we did not observe significant cellular toxicity, as measured either by

261

gross cellular morphology or by measuring cellular ATP levels, until doses above 10 µM, while
8

262

our IC50 of 1.4 µM suggests there is a window of therapeutic potential. However, given the drug’s

263

toxicity in vivo, modification of the valinomycin structure may tune toxicity while maintaining

264

antiviral activity. Additionally, using other, less toxic potassium ionophores may similarly function

265

to inhibit LACV infection, as we observed with nonactin and nigericin. For outbreak viruses like

266

SARS CoV or ZIKV, however, limited valinomycin usage might be beneficial. Interestingly,

267

valinomycin was identified in an earlier screen for anti-SARS-CoV molecules26, underscoring the

268

antiviral potential of valinomycin despite its negative characteristics. Importantly, the emergence

269

of a new group 2B CoV, nCoV-2019 signals the ongoing threat and need to rapidly respond to

270

novel emergent virues. Additional in vivo testing, combined with medicinal chemistry approaches

271

to structural modification, would be necessary prior to clinical use.

272
273

In addition to valinomycin, our screen identified several tantalizing antiviral candidates. In fact,

274

several known antivirals were identified (summarized in Table 1). Dasatinib has previously been

275

described to inhibit dengue virus and HIV infection27,28. Quininone has activity against enterovirus

276

proteases as well as reverse transcriptases29,30. As mentioned previously, mitoxantrone was

277

identified in a screen for anti-RVFV molecules16. Additionally, we identified a number of cancer

278

therapeutics, targeting processes such as angiogenesis and topoisomerase, that show significant

279

promise. Nonetheless, further verification of antiviral activity and investigation of the mechanisms

280

of action is necessary. Regardless, the development of novel antivirals is crucial to combat virus

281

infection and to respond to the possibility of rapid virus dissemination and evolution. LACV is a

282

significant threat to human health, and continued development of novel antivirals may prove

283

fruitful if the virus were to spread, as arboviruses are wont to do.

Materials and Methods

286

Cell culture. Cells were maintained at 37⁰C in 5% CO2, in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium

287

288

Resources) were supplemented with 10% new-born calf serum (NBCS; Thermo-Fischer) and

incubated at 37⁰C in 5% CO2 for 48 hours. For direct incubation experiments 100 µL of LACV

297

stock virus was incubated with increasing concentrations of valinomycin over various time periods

298

at 37⁰C. For wash away experiments cells were seeded as stated above for standard treatment

299

experiments. Cells were treated four hours prior to removing media and washing with phosphate

300

buffer saline (PBS). Media containing LACV was then replaced and cells were incubated for 48

301

hours. Chemical structures were recreated using MarvinSketch 19.26 (ChemAxon Ltd.).

302
303

Rapid screening antiviral compounds. Huh7 were seeded in 96 well plates, infected with LACV

304

at a MOI of 0.01 and concurrently treated with 100 µM of each compound from the NIH DTP

305

compound plates. Cells were incubated at 37⁰C in 5% CO2 for 48 hours. Media was aspirated and

306

cells were fixed with 4% formalin and live cells were stained with crystal violet solution (Sigma-

307

Aldrich). Excess stain was removed in a mild bleach solution and allowed to dry for 24h.

308

Remaining crystal violet stain was resuspended in 10% acetic acid. Absorbance at 590 nm was

309

detected using a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader.

310
311

Infection and enumeration of viral titers. RVFV MP-1231, LACV, and KEYV were derived from

312

the first passage of virus in Huh7 cells. ZIKV (MR766) was derived from the first passage of virus

313

in Vero cells. CVB3 (Nancy strain) and HRV2 were derived from the first passage of virus in HeLa

314

cells. ZIKV, LACV, and, KEYV were obtained from Biodefense and Emerging Infections (BEI)

315

Research Resources. HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV were propagated and quantitated via

316

standard methods as previously described20.For all infections, drug was maintained throughout

317

infection as designated. Viral stocks were maintained at -80⁰C. For infection, virus was diluted in

318

serum-free DMEM for a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 on Huh7 cells, unless otherwise

319

indicated. Viral inoculum was overlain on cells for 10 to 30 minutes, and the cells were washed

320

with PBS before replenishment of media. Supernatants were collected at the times specified.

321

Dilutions of cell supernatant were prepared in serum-free DMEM and used to inoculate confluent

322

monolayer of Vero cells for 10 to 15 min at 37⁰C. Cells were overlain with 0.8% agarose in DMEM

323

containing 2% NBCS. CVB3 and HRV2 samples incubated for 2 days, RVFV MP-12, ZIKV, and

324

LACV samples incubated for 4 days and KEYV samples incubated for 5 days at 37⁰C. Following

325

appropriate incubation, cells were fixed with 4% formalin and revealed with crystal violet solution

326

(10% crystal violet; Sigma-Aldrich). Plaques were enumerated and used to back-calculate the

327

number of plaque forming units (pfu) per milliliter of collected volume.

329

RNA purification and cDNA synthesis. Media was cleared from cells and Trizol reagent (Zymo

330

Research) directly added. Lysate was then collected, and RNA was purified according to the

331

manufacturer’s protocol utilizing the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research). Purified

332

RNA was subsequently used for cDNA synthesis using High Capacity cDNA Reverse

333

Transcription Kits (Thermo-Fischer), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with 10-100 ng of

334

RNA and random hexamer primers.

335
336

Viral genome quantification. Following cDNA synthesis, qRT-PCR was performed using the

337

QuantStudio3 (Applied Biosystems by Thermo-Fischer) and SYBR green mastermix

338

(DotScientific). Samples were held at 95⁰C for 2 mins prior to 40 cycles of 95⁰C for 1s and 60⁰C

339

for 30s. Primers were verified for linearity using eight-fold serial diluted cDNA and checked for

340

specificity via melt curve analysis following by agarose gel electrophoresis. All samples were used

341

to normalize to total RNA using the ΔCT method.

342
343

Genome-to-PFU ratio calculations. The number of viral genomes quantified as described above

344

were divided by the viral titer, as determined by plaque assay, to measure the genome-to-PFU

345

ratio. Values obtained were normalized to untreated conditions to obtain the relative genome-to-

346

PFU ratio. Primers used were: Small 5'-GGC-AGG-TGG-AGG-TTA-TCA-AT-3' (forward), 5'-AAG-GAC-

Statistical Analysis. Prism 6 (GraphPad) was used to generate graphs and perform statistical

353

analysis. For all analyses, one-tailed Student’s t test was used to compare groups, unless

354

otherwise noted, with a = 0.05. For tests of sample proportions, p values were derived from

355

calculated Z scores with two tails and a = 0.05.
