Abstract (limit 250 words):

18

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

19

2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 386,000 deaths globally as of June 4, 2020. In this study, we

20

developed a novel multiplex real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR test for detection of SARS-CoV-2,

21

with primers designed to amplify a 108 bp target on the spike surface glycoprotein (S gene) of SARS-CoV-

22

2 and a hydrolysis Taqman probe designed to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2. Following our design, we

23

evaluated the Limit of detection (LOD) and clinical performance of this laboratory-developed test (LDT).

24

A LOD study with inactivated whole virus exhibited equal performance to that seen in the modified CDC

25

assay with a final LOD of 1,301 ± 13 genome equivalents/ml for our assay vs 1,249 ± 14 genome

26

equivalents/ml for the modified CDC assay. In addition, a clinical evaluation with 270 nasopharyngeal (NP)

27

swab specimens exhibited 98.5% positive percent agreement and 99.3% negative percent agreement with

28

the modified CDC assay. The multiplex design of this assay allows the testing of 91 patients per plate,

29

versus a maximum of 29 patients per plate on the modified CDC assay, providing the benefit of testing

30

significantly more patients per run and saving reagents during a time when both of these parameters have

31

been critical. Our results demonstrate that our multiplex assay performs as well as the modified CDC

32

assay, but is more efficient and cost effective and is therefore adequate for use as a diagnostic assay and

33

for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction:

37

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered as etiologic

38

agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, Hubei providence, China by the end

39

of December of 2020 (1), and is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans and also to be

40

transmitted from human to human. The four seasonal coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E) are

41

associated with mild symptoms, whereas SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe acute

42

respiratory disease (2,3). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus and is an enveloped, single-

43

strand RNA virus with a ~29.8 kb genome, which can cause a wild range of clinical presentations from

44

asymptomatic or mild illness to fatal outcomes (4,5). Furthermore, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients

45

can be similar to that of patients with other seasonal respiratory infections. Presently, there are no

46

available specific therapeutics or vaccinations against COVID-19, making early and accurate diagnosis for

47

this very contagious disease the key mitigation strategy.

48

Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT)-based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory

49

specimens have been the standard diagnostic method. To date, the FDA has issued 34 lab developed

50

COVID-19 molecular assays Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) (6). The US CDC has developed the most

51

widely used SARS–CoV-2 assay which includes primers and probes to detect the N1 and N2 regions of the

52

nucleocapsid gene and also the human RNase P gene to monitor RNA extraction and ensure specimen

53

quality (7). For each specimen performed on the modified CDC assay, there are three Master Mix sets,

54

including N1, N2 and RNase P. Each master mix needs to be independently prepared and dispensed into

55

the appropriate wells before the extracted clinical sample RNA is added to each well. The modified CDC

56

assay has been shown to have high analytical sensitivity and ideal clinical performance when compared

57

to three commercially available COVID-19 diagnostic platforms issued EUA status by the FDA (8).

58

The aim of our current study was to develop and then evaluate the analytical sensitivity and

59

clinical performance of an efficient and cost effective laboratory-developed test (LDT) on the 7500 Fast

60

Dx real time PCR instrument. To that end, we developed an LDT that targets the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 and

61

compared it’s clinical performance to the modified CDC assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in

62

nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens from individuals suspected of potentially having COVID-19.

Materials and Method:

64

Primers and probe design: Available whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (as of February 27, 2020)

65

retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Database

66

(GISAID) were aligned using Clustal Omega software from EMBL-EBI. The primers and probe were

67

designed using Primer Express 3.0 software in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 and were synthesized by

68

Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT). In addition, the primers and probe of human RNase P gene used

69

for the assay internal control were also synthesized by IDT and were the same sequences used in the CDC

70

assay for this gene target (7). Here, the 5’ base of probe of RNase P gene was modified and labeled with

71

Cy5, and the 3’ base of probe was labeled with Black Hole Quencher 2(BHQ2) to allow multiplexing of our

72

LDT assay.

73
74

Study design: A modified version (v3) of the CDC assay was used as a reference method in this study (8).

75

A total of 270 NP specimens (130 positive and 140 negative specimens) originally submitted for SARS-CoV-

76

2 testing at Northwell Health Laboratories between March and April 2020 were selected for this study.

77

The 270 specimens were initially tested by the modified CDC assay and extracted RNA was stored at -80°C

78

until testing with our LDT was performed. The specimens were selected as any consecutive specimen that

79

was performed on the modified CDC assay during the timeframe of this study and represented our true

80

positivity rate (~50%), including positive specimens spanning the range of positivity levels, including 24

81

specimens with low viral load that characterized by high Cycle threshold (Ct) value in range of 31.7- 39.7

82

by the modified CDC assay. For discordant results, molecular testing was repeated from RNA extraction

83

on both assays. This study was performed in order to validate this LDT for clinical use.

84
85

RNA extraction: Total RNA was extracted from 110 µl of patient NP specimen by the NucliSENS easyMag

86

platform (BioMérieux, Durham, NC) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the final elution

87

volume was 110 µl. In order to monitor the extraction process, a Negative Extraction Control was included

88

in each extraction run.

89
90

Laboratory developed real time RT-PCR assay specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection: In this one-step,

91

qualitative real time RT-PCR assay, TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR kit (Catalog no. A15299, Thermo Fisher

92

Scientific) was used to perform cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification on the 96- well plate at a 20 µl final

93

reaction volume. The per reaction mix contained 5 µl of 4X RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.72 µl of S gene forward

94

primer at 25 µM, 0.72µl of S gene reverse primer at 25 µM, 0.16 µl of S gene probe at 25µM, 0.64 µl of

95

RNase P gene forward primer at 25 µM, 0.64 µl of RNase P gene reverse primer at 25 µM, 0.16 µl of RNase

96

P probe at 25 µM, 6.96 µl of nuclease free water and 5 µl of extracted RNA. The thermal cycler profile

97

consisted of 25°C for 2 min, 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 2 min and followed by 45 cycles at 95°C 3 sec, 55°C

98

for 30 sec, and was conducted on the 7500 Fast Dx real time PCR instrument. Each run included a No

99

Template Control, Negative Extraction Control and a SARS-CoV-2 positive control. The LDT used the same

100

RT-PCR reagents and conditions as the modified CDC assay, except for the target primer and probe.

101
102

Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection): Limit of detection (LOD) was determined by extracting and

103

testing serial dilution panels of quantified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 from Isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-

104

52287, BEI Resources, Manassas, VA) SARS-CoV-2 viral material was provided at a concentration of 4.1 x

105

10^9 genome equivalents (GE)/ml, from which the following serial dilutions were prepared in GE/ml:

106

4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 250, 125 using Ambion® RNA Storage Solution (Catalog No. AM7001, ThermoFisher

107

Scientific) to prevent the potential RNA degradation, and replicates ranging from 4-10 at each dilution

108

went through nucleic acid extraction on different days and were tested on both the modified CDC assay

109

and our LDT. LOD was defined as the concentration of the lowest dilution that can be detected with

110

greater than 95% probability and was determined by Probit analysis.

111
112

Analytical Specificity: The specificity of our LDT primers and probe for SARS-CoV-2 detection was

113

evaluated by in silico analysis and by testing a SARS-CoV control (GenBanK: MG772933.1) (Cat no.

114

10006624, IDT) , MERS-CoV control (GenBank: MK796425.1)(Cat no. 10006623, IDT) and a panel of

115

respiratory pathogens covering Coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1), Influenza A, H3, Influenza B, 2009

116

H1N1, RSV A, RSV B, Parainfluenza virus type 1-4, Human metapneumovirus, Adenovirus, Mycoplasma

117

pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae that were initially identified using a multiplex respiratory panel

118

at Northwell Health laboratories.

119
120

Statistical methods: The final result interpretation algorithm for reporting a positive specimen requires

121

both N1 and N2 targets to be detected in the modified CDC assay (7), and both of the modified CDC assay

122

and our LDT use a Ct < 40 as the criterion for positivity. Percent positive agreement (PPA), percent

123

negative agreement (NPA), Kappa, and two-sided (upper/lower) 95% confidence interval (CI) were

124

calculated using Microsoft® Office Excel 365 MSO software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). As a measure of

125

overall agreement, Cohen's kappa values (κ) were calculated, with values categorized as follows: >0.90 =

126

almost perfect, 0.90 to 0.80 = strong, 0.79 to 0.60 = moderate, 0.59 to 0.40 = weak, 0.39 to 0.21 = minimal,

127

0.20 to 0 = none (9, 10).

Results:

129

Design of primers and probe for SARS-CoV-2 detection: Using primer and probe design tool, the assay

130

primers and probe specifically targeting S gene of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) were designed to amplify a 108

131

bp target on the conserved S gene based on multiple sequence alignment and In silico analysis for our LDT

132

primers and probe was performed. The primers and probe designed for S gene detection were designed

133

using all available SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences. Our analysis of sequence alignments revealed

134

that region of the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 targeted by designed primer and probe set have 100% similarity

135

with all available SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence from GenBank and GISAID database at the time of

136

development.

137
138

Analytical Sensitivity: Quantified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles were used to prepare serial

139

dilutions (4,000 GE/mL to 125 genome equivalents (GE)/ml, in 2-fold dilutions) to determine the LOD of

140

our LDT as well as the modified CDC assay. The LOD was defined as the lowest dilution in which all

141

replicates were detected with 95% positivity rate by Probit analysis. The LOD of LDT was 1301±13 GE/ml

142

for the S gene target. For the modified CDC assay, the LOD was 1249±14 GE/mL for the N1 target and

143

946±11 GE/ml for the N2 target (Table 2). The final LOD of modified CDC assay was 1249±14 GE/mL in

144

accordance with the result interpretation algorithm.

145
146

Analytical specificity: The analytical specificity of our LDT was evaluated using in silico analysis and also

147

by testing a panel of common respiratory viruses, including the four strains of circulating coronaviruses.

148

In silico analysis and Blastn analysis were performed against the standard and betacoronavirus database

149

of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and results showed no cross reactivity with other

150

respiratory pathogens; A panel of respiratory pathogens was also tested to further evaluate the specificity

151

of our LDT. According to our results (Data not shown), a specificity of 100% was achieved and our LDT had

152

no cross-reaction with any of the pathogens tested.

153
154

Clinical performance: The clinical performance of our LDT was evaluated by comparing to the modified

155

CDC assay. A total of 270 clinical NP specimens from standard of care testing for SARS-CoV-2 on the

156

modified CDC assay from March 2020 to April 2020 at Northwell Health Laboratories were tested. The

157

LDT demonstrated a PPA of 98.5% (95% CI, 0.946-0.996), and NPA of 99.3% (95% CI, 0.961-0.999), with

158

the overall percent agreement between both assays being 98.9%. A kappa value of 0.978 (95% CI 0.953-

159

1.0) indicated perfect agreement (Table 3). For discordant results from three specimens, two specimens

160

were detected by the modified CDC assay and were not detected by LDT and had a Ct value of 37.3 for

161

N1, 39.6 for N2 and 38.2 for N1 and 39.2 for N2, respectively. Following a fresh RNA extraction and

162

retesting, the specimen with 37.3 N1 and 39.6 N2 Ct values was detected by both assays, and the other

163

specimen resulted as not detected by both assays. One specimen was initially detected by LDT and not by

164

the modified CDC assay, exhibiting a Ct value of 32.0 on the LDT. After retesting, both the modified CDC

165

assay and the LDT assay were positive.

Discussion:
In the present study, a multiplex real time RT-PCR assay was developed and validated for SARSCoV-2 specific detection in NP specimens on the 7500 Fast Dx real time PCR instrument.

169

The findings demonstrate that our LDT design has comparable clinical performance for the specific

170

detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP specimens and is more efficient and cost effective in comparison to

171

the modified CDC assay. Our LDT also showed significant advantages over the modified CDC assay, since

172

only one set of primer and probe Master Mix is required to prepare and dispense per specimen, in contrast

173

to three sets of Master Mix preparation and the use of three wells for each patient specimen by the

174

modified CDC assay. Our multiplex design allows us to run 91 patients per plate, versus a maximum of 29

175

patients per plate on the modified CDC assay. Overall, this allows us to run more than 3 times as many

176

patients per run and also adds to the ease of setting up each run. Additionally, the saving of reagents and

177

consumables is another advantage at a stage where there are currently global shortages of reagents and

178

major assay supply chain issues.

179

The design of the primers and probe for our LDT is based on multiple sequence alignment of all

180

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that were available between January 11 and February 27 of 2020. Since

181

RNA viruses are well known for its high mutation and recombination rates (11), we wanted to confirm

182

that there were no significant new mutations of the region of S gene of SARS-CoV-2 that is the target in

183

our assay that could potentially affect assay performance. To this end, we analyzed an additional 140

184

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences uploaded after February 27, 2020 to GenBank and the GISAID database

185

from different countries and performed an alignment with Clustal Omega. This alignment showed that

186

the forward primer and probe are conserved (with 100% homology) to the S gene target regions of the

187

SARS-CoV-2 sequences. One exception was seen with the reverse primer, a single base mismatch of S gene

188

target region in one sequence (MT385417.1) from a total of 240 SARS-CoV-2 sequence analyzed both

10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.04.135608; this version posted June 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

189

before and after late Febuary. This one mismatch is questionable, since it is not in keeping with the other

190

sequences available and the databases are not curated, and therefore occasionally contain errors.

191

Limitations of our study include that our LDT is a single site evaluation at Northwell Health

192

Laboratories. In addition, we only use a single target gene for SARS-CoV-2 detection. While there has been

193

a trend toward dual-target design in commercial assay for the detection of pathogens (8,12), occasional

194

monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 sequences to verify that mutations have not developed in the region targeted

195

by our primers and probe is an adequate quality monitor to ensure continued consistent analytical

196

performance.

197

In summary, our LDT has comparable analytical sensitivity and accuracy for specific detection of

198

SARS-CoV-2 RNA when compared to the modified CDC assay. In addition, it also showed superior efficiency

199

and cost-effectiveness and can be somewhat easily-established in other laboratories. These findings make

200

our novel multiplex SARS-CoV-2 assay a suitable alternative for the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, with

201

the added benefit of superior efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
