Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that causes fatal disorders

76

including severe pneumonia. To develop a therapeutic drug for COVID-19, a model that

77

can reproduce the viral life cycle and evaluate the drug efficacy of anti-viral drugs is

78

essential. In this study, we established a method to generate human bronchial organoids

79

(hBO) from commercially available cryopreserved human bronchial epithelial cells and

80

examined whether they could be used as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome

81

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) research. Our hBO contain basal, club, ciliated, and

82

goblet cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a receptor for

83

SARS-CoV-2, and transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), which is an

84

essential serine protease for priming spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, were highly

85

expressed. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, not only the intracellular viral genome, but

86

also progeny virus, cytotoxicity, pyknotic cells, and moderate increases of the type I

87

interferon signal could be observed. Treatment with camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2,

88

reduced the viral copy number to 2% of the control group. Furthermore, the gene

89

expression profile in SARS-CoV-2-infected hBO was obtained by performing RNA-seq

90

analysis. In conclusion, we succeeded in generating hBO that can be used for

91

SARS-CoV-2 research and COVID-19 drug discovery.

Introduction
The “2019-new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in China in

103

December 2019 1 and declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020 2. Severe

104

pneumonia is most frequently observed in COVID-19 patients, and the number of

105

COVID-19 patients and deaths are still increasing. These conditions have made it

106

difficult for research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

107

(SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative virus of COVID-19, to keep pace. SARS-CoV-2

108

is composed of four proteins: S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N

109

(nucleocapsid) proteins. It is known that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a

110

SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential

111

for priming S protein 3. Thus, to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 research, a novel lung model

112

that reproduces the viral life cycle with intact expression of these host factors is

113

indispensable.

114

A number of animal and cell models that can be used for SARS-CoV-2 research

115

have been reported (Takayama et al., in revision), but an in vitro lung model that can

116

evaluate candidate therapeutic agents for COVID-19 is essential for conducting

117

large-scale drug screening. Human lung organoids are excellent tools that can faithfully

118

mimic the lung functions of living organisms 4. The lungs consist of bronchi and alveoli.

119

Lukassen et al. have performed single-cell analysis of alveoli and bronchi and reported

120

that ACE2 is predominantly expressed in the transient secretory cell type, which

121

displays a transient cell state between goblet and ciliated cells, in bronchi, but

122

TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in both lung tissues 5. Therefore, a bronchial organoid

123

containing transient secretory, goblet, and ciliated cells could be a useful model for

125

SARS-CoV-2 research.
Several reports have verified the usefulness of two-dimensional (2D) culturing

126

airway epithelial cells in SARS-CoV2 studies. For example, SARS-CoV-2 infection

127

experiments using human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEpC) showed cytopathic effects

128

96 hr after the infection on the layers of human airway epithelial cells 6. In addition,

129

hBEpC cultured using an air-liquid interface culture system can be used to evaluate

130

viral infection, replication, and the drug efficacy of remdesivir 7. 2D culture systems of

131

hBEpC are relatively easy to use, but they cannot reproduce the cellular

132

microenvironment in the living body and are difficult to use for long-time culture.

133

Recently, it was shown that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in human pluripotent

134

stem cell (PSC)-derived lung organoids containing bronchial epithelial cells and

135

alveolar epithelial cells 8. However, these organoids exhibit a fetal phenotype rather than

136

an adult type 9,10. Adult-type bronchial organoids are essential because of the severe

137

infection caused by COVID-19 in adults. Human bronchial organoids (hBO) with adult

138

phenotype can be established from intact human lung tissue 11. However, it is difficult

139

for many researchers to obtain an intact lung biopsy sample, because the process

140

requires the approval of an ethics committee and informed consent from the donor.

141

Therefore, in this study, we developed a method for generating hBO from commercially

142

available cryopreserved adult hBEpC and applied it to SARS-CoV-2 research.

148

hBEpC. We found that after embedding the hBEpC in Matrigel and culturing with

149

advanced DMEM/F12 medium containing FGF2, FGF7, FGF10, Noggin, R-spondin 1,

150

Y-27632, and SB202190 (expansion medium), hBO could be established (Table S1).

151

Furthermore, we could mature the hBO by culturing them with advanced DMEM/F12

152

medium containing FGF2, FGF7, FGF10, Y-27632, and A83-01 (differentiation

153

medium) (Table S1). Among the growth factors included in the differentiation medium,

154

FGF2 is important for enhancing the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. S1).

155

Approximately 100 hBO were present in 50 μL of Matrigel, and the diameter of each

156

hBO was around 100-200 μm (Fig. 1A). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

157

images showed the presence of cilia and goblet cells (Fig. 1B, Fig. S2). The ACE2 and

158

TMPRSS2 expression levels in hBO were higher than in cryopreserved adult hBEpC

159

(Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that ACE2 was expressed in part of

160

the outer edge of hBO, while TMPRSS2 was expressed in part of the outer edge and

161

lumen (Fig. 1D, Fig. S3). Because bronchi are composed of basal, ciliated, goblet, and

162

club cells, a gene expression analysis of markers specific to these four cell types was

163

performed. The gene expression levels of basal, ciliated, goblet, and club cell markers in

164

hBO were higher than in cryopreserved adult hBEpC (Figs. 1E-1H). Consistently, hBO

165

were also positive for α-tubulin, CC10, mucin 5AC, and KRT5 (Fig. 1I). The outer edge

166

and lumen of hBO was positive for KRT5 and acetylated α-tubulin, respectively. These

167

results suggest that basal cells are positive for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but ciliated

168

cells are positive only for TMPRSS2. Based on these observations, we succeeded in

169

generating expandable and functional hBO from cryopreserved adult hBEpC.

172

RNA-seq analysis was performed to further characterize hBO. A heat map,

173

principal component analysis (PCA), and scatter plot of gene expression profiles all

174

show hBO is closer to hBEpC than to A549 cells (Figs. 2A-2C). A second heat map of

175

bronchial epithelial markers showed that hBO expressed bronchial epithelial markers

176

more strongly than did hBEpC or A549 cells (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that hBO

177

have higher bronchial functions than A549 cells or hBEpC.

178
179
180

SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments using human bronchial organoids
Next, we investigated whether hBO can be applied to SARS-CoV-2 research.

181

HBO were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then cultured in differentiation medium for

182

5 days (Fig. 3A). We observed a significant accumulation of LDH in the culture

183

medium of infected hBO (Fig. 3B), suggesting that cytotoxicity was caused by the

184

infection. At day 5 after the infection, viral gene expression in infected hBO was clearly

185

detected (Fig. 3C). IHC analysis showed that S protein-positive cells were observed in

186

part of the outer edge of hBO (Fig. 3D). In addition, S protein co-localized with KRT5

187

(Fig. 3E), but not with CC10 (Fig. S4), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infected and

188

replicated in basal cells. Overall, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and

189

replicate in hBO.

190

Currently, clinical trials using camostat, favipiravir, nafamostat, chloroquine,

191

ritonavir/lopinavir, and remdesivir are underway around the world to develop

192

therapeutic agents for COVID-19. However, the evaluation of these drugs using in vitro

193

lung models is rare. Therefore, in this study, the effect of camostat, an inhibitor of

194

TMPRSS2, was examined using our hBO because camostat was demonstrated as a

195

promising candidate in cell culture models 3. Upon camostat treatment, the amount of

196

SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was reduced to 2% of untreated infected hBO (Fig. 3C). In

197

addition, LDH release from infected hBO was significantly reduced after camostat

198

treatment (Fig. 3B). Finally, we examined the culture supernatants of infected hBO. We

199

found that infectious virus was significantly observed in infected hBO, but the

200

production of infectious virus was impaired by treatment with camostat (Fig. 3F).

201

Collectively, our data indicated that hBO can secrete infectious virus into the culture

202

medium, suggesting that our hBO system can investigate the entire life cycle of

203

SARS-CoV-2.

204

Next, we examined the pathological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We

205

observed that the number of pyknotic cells seemed to increase with the infection (Fig.

206

3G). In addition, the expression levels of type I IFN (IFN-I) and IFN-stimulated genes

207

were moderately increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. S5A). Furthermore,

208

SARS-CoV-2 infection did not change the gene expression levels of ACE2 or TMPRSS2

209

(Fig. S5B). From the above, these results suggest that hBO can be used to reproduce

210

SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary disorder and to evaluate the effect of therapeutic

211

agents.

212
213
214

RNA-seq analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected human bronchial organoids
RNA-seq analysis was performed to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2

215

infection and camostat treatment in detail. A heat map shows that the gene expression

216

profile of SARS-CoV-2-infected hBO is closer to SASR-CoV-2-infected hBO treated

217

with camostat than uninfected hBO (Fig. 4A). A PCA and scatter plot of the gene

218

expressions agree with this finding (Figs. 4B, C). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection

219

increased the expression levels of IFN-I signaling-related genes in hBO (Fig. 4D).

220

PGSEA applied on GO biological process gene sets shows that the expression levels of

221

genes involved in positive regulation of immune effector process, regulation of

222

inflammatory response, interferon-gamma production, and positive regulation of acute

223

inflammatory response were increased by SARS-CoV-2 infection and that this increase

224

was suppressed by camostat treatment (Fig. 4E). These results indicated that

225

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces IFN-I signaling-related genes and that camostat

226

treatment reversed this phenotype.

227
228

Discussion

229

In this study, we succeeded in generating hBO from cryopreserved adult hBEpC

230

and applied it to SARS-CoV-2 research. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect

231

and replicate in these cells and that camostat could suppress the replication. If small

232

airway organoids and alveolar organoids can be produced from cryopreserved adult

233

human small airway epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, respectively, the

234

infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in each part of the lung can be evaluated.

235

Recently, it was shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication can be observed in

236

kidney 12, liver ductal 13, and gut organoids 14. By comparing the infection and

237

replication ability of SARS-CoV-2 in these organoids, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2

238

in each organ could be compared.

239

The incorporation of mechanical stress into our organoid system could improve

240

the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 research. The human airway is always exposed to shear

241

stress due to air flow. It has been reported that a functional in vitro lung model can be

242

generated using a device capable of medium perfusion and expansion/contraction

243

(organ-on-a-chip) 15. Recently, it was reported that the infection and replication of

11

244

SARS-CoV-2 can be observed by culturing primary human lung airway epithelial basal

245

stem cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells on a chip device 16. By

246

applying our hBO to a similar device, we may be able to construct an in vitro bronchi

247

model that more closely mimics the living body.

248

Nevertheless, even in its current condition, we used our hBO to evaluate the

249

efficacy of a COVID-19 therapeutic agent and observe the cytotoxicity and innate

250

immune responses caused by the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we could clarify the

251

localization of SARS-CoV-2 in the hBO. These results could be obtained because hBO

252

reproduce the cell populations and functions of the bronchi. Our data of RNA-seq

253

analysis would give us a change to understand the virus affects cellular and bronchial

254

functions.

255

Finally, we showed that camostat has a positive effect against COVID-19

256

infection in hBO, demonstrating its usefulness for COVID-19 drug discovery. Similar

257

studies on experimental COVID-19 drugs including those currently undergoing clinical

258

trials should be considered. Furthermore, because hBO can be generated from

259

commercially available cryopreserved hBEpC quickly (10 days) and at large scale, we

260

expect hBO will shorten the search for effective COVID-19 agents.

264

Human bronchial organoid culture

265

Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEpC, Lonza) were suspended in 10

266

mg/ml cold Matrigel growth factor reduced (GFR) basement membrane matrix. 50 μL

267

drops of cell suspension were solidified on pre-warmed Nunc cell-culture treated

268

multidishes (24-well plate) at 37°C for 10 min, and then 500 μL of expansion medium

269

(composition is shown in Table S1) was added to each well. The expansion medium

270

was changed every 2 days. HBO were passaged every 10-12 days. For passaging, the

271

hBO were suspended in 1 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS (Nacalai tesque) and mechanically

272

sheared using a P1000 pipette tip. Then, 2 mL TrypLE Select (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

273

was added to the suspension. After incubating for 5 min at room temperature, the hBO

274

were again mechanically sheared using a P1000 pipette tip. 7 mL of expansion medium

275

was added, and the organoid suspension tubes were centrifuged at 400 rpm. Organoid

276

fragments were re-suspended in cold expansion medium and seeded as above. HBO

277

were passaged every 10 days. To mature the hBO, the expanded hBO were cultured

278

with differentiation medium (composition is shown in Table S1) for 5 days. HBO can

279

be cryopreserved by using STEM-CELLBANKER GMP grade (TaKaRa Bio).

280

282

A549 culture
A549 cells were cultured with Ham’s F12 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

283

containing 10% FBS, 1×GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and

284

penicillin-streptomycin. A549 cells were passaged every 4 days.

and analysis of the virus will be described elsewhere (manuscript in preparation). The

291

virus was plaque-purified and propagated in Vero E6 cells. SARS-CoV-2 was stored at

292

-80°C. All experiments including virus infections were done in the biosafety level

293

facility at Osaka University strictly following regulations.

SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug treatment
Approximately 100 organoids were infected with 5.0×104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2

297

in a 24-well plate containing 500 uL differentiation medium. One-half of the

298

differentiation medium containing SARS-CoV-2 was replaced with fresh differentiation

299

medium every day. At 5 days after the infection, the hBO and their supernatant were

300

collected. In the drug treatment experiments, the infected hBO were cultured with

301

differentiation medium containing 10 μM camostat (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 days.

302

304

SARS-CoV-2 virus plaque assays
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (JCRB1819, JCRB Cell Bank) 17 were seeded on 12 well

305

plates (1.7x105 cells/well) and incubated for 24 hr. The culture supernatants serially

306

diluted by medium were inoculated and incubated for 2 hr. Culture medium was

307

removed, fresh medium containing 1% methylcellulose (1.5mL) was added, and the

308

culture was further incubated for 3 days. The cells were fixed with 4%

309

Paraformaldehyde Phosphate Buffer Solution (Nacalai Tesque) and plaques were

Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from hBO using ISOGENE II (NIPPON GENE). cDNA

314

was synthesized using 500 ng of total RNA with a Superscript VILO cDNA synthesis

315

kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-time RT-PCR was performed with the SYBR Green

316

PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system

317

(Applied Biosystems). The relative quantitation of target mRNA levels was performed

318

by using the 2-ΔΔCT method. The values were normalized by those of the

319

housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The PCR

320

primer sequences are shown in Table S2.

321

HBO fixed in phosphate buffered 2% glutaraldehyde, and subsequently post-fixed

326

in 2% osmium tetra-oxide for 2 hr at 4°C. After fixation, they were dehydrated in a

327

graded series of ethanol and embedded in the epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut

328

and then stained with uranyl acetate and lead staining solution and were examined using

329

an electron microscope (HITACHI H-7600) at 100 kV.

Histopathology and immunofluorescence

332

Fixed bronchial organoid samples were processed and embedded in paraffin.

333

Then they were cut into 2 μm-thick sections. The sections were deparaffinized,

334

rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The sections were then

335

examined using a microscope (BX53 microscope with DP73 camera, Olympus

336

Corporation).

337

For the immunohistochemical stain assay, the formalin-fixed and

338

paraffin-embedded bronchial organoid samples were treated with pH 6.0 citrate buffer

339

for 30 sec at 125°C in a pressure cooker (Dako Japan) as antigen retrieval. Sections

340

were incubated with each antibody (Table S3), followed by Histofine Simple Stain

341

MAX-PO (Nichirei Biosciences). The sections were visualized using Peroxidase Stain

342

DAB Kit (Nacalai Tesque) before counterstaining with Meyer's hematoxylin.

343

For the double immunofluorescence staining assay, the sections were

344

deparaffinized and subjected to antigen retrieval by treating them with 0.5% trypsin for

345

30 min. Then the sections were blocked by 5% skim milk with albumin obtained from

346

Bovine Serum Cohn Fraction V, pH 7.0 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), in PBS for 30

347

min at room temperature to avoid non-specific reactions. The sections were then

348

incubated with primary antibody (Table S3) overnight at 4°C, washed, and incubated

349

with secondary antibody (Table S3) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with

350

PBS, the specimens were mounted with glycerol. All observations were performed

351

using the BX53 fluorescence microscope with a DP73 camera equipped with a suitable

352

filter set (red filter with excitation range 530-550 nm and emission range 575 nm, and

353

green filter with excitation range 470-495 nm and emission range of 510 nm).

performed using a NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina

359

(NEB) or a TruSeq stranded mRNA sample prep kit (Illumina) according to the

360

manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 or

361

NovaSeq6000 platform in 152- or 101-base single-end mode, respectively. Fastq files

362

were generated using bcl2fastq2. Adapter sequences were trimmed from the raw reads

363

by cutadapt ver 2.7. The trimmed reads were mapped to the human reference genome

364

sequences (hg19) using HISAT2 ver 2.1.0. The raw counts were calculated using

365

featureCounts ver 2.0.0 and used for heatmap visualization with integrated differential

366

expression and pathway analysis (iDEP, (http://ge-lab.org/idep/)) 18. Access to raw data

367

concerning this study was submitted under Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession

368

number GSE150819.

369
370
371

LDH assay
After the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the release of LDH was monitored from an

372

aliquot of 250 μL supernatant using the LDH-Glo cytotoxicity assay (Promega)

373

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was determined with a

374

Bio-Rad microplate reader (Bio-Rad, US) at wavelength 490 nm. The release of LDH in

375

uninfected cells was used as a control.

376
377
378

Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.

379

Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)

380

followed by Tukey’s or Dunnett’s post hoc tests to compare all groups.

Figure S1 FGF2 promotes the maturation of human bronchial organoids
Expanded hBO were cultured with differentiation medium containing FGF2, EGF, HGF,
R-spondin 1, or Noggin for 5 days. The gene expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
were examined by qPCR. The gene expression levels in “FGF2” were normalized to 1.0.
All data are represented as means ± SD (n = 3). Statistical significance was evaluated by
one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc tests (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, as

519

compared with control).

hBO were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (5.0×104 PFU/well) in the presence or absence of
10 μM camostat and then cultured with differentiation medium for 5 days. (A, B) The
gene expression levels of type I interferon (IFN alpha and IFN beta),
interferon-stimulated genes (ISG56, ISG15, and MxA) (A), and SARS-CoV-2-associated
genes (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) (B) in uninfected organoids (control), infected organoids
(SARS-CoV-2), and infected organoids treated with camostat (SARS-CoV-2 +
camostat) were examined by qPCR. The gene expression levels in control were
normalized to 1.0. All data are represented as means ± SD (n = 3).
