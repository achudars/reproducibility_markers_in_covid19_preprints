Abstract: The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emphasized the urgent need for
antiviral therapeutics. The viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) is a promising target
with polymerase inhibitors successfully used for the treatment of several viral diseases. Here we
show that Favipiravir exerts an antiviral effect as a nucleotide analogue through a combination of
chain termination, slowed RNA synthesis and lethal mutagenesis. The SARS-CoV RdRp
complex is at least 10-fold more active than any other viral RdRp known. It possesses both
unusually high nucleotide incorporation rates and high-error rates allowing facile insertion of
Favipiravir into viral RNA, provoking C-to-U and G-to-A transitions in the already low cytosine
content SARS-CoV-2 genome. The coronavirus RdRp complex represents an Achilles heel for
SARS-CoV, supporting nucleoside analogues as promising candidates for the treatment of
COVID-19.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are large genome, positive-strand RNA viruses of the order
Nidovirales that have recently attracted global attention due to the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. Despite significant efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 has caused substantial
health and economic burden, emphasizing the immediate need for antiviral treatments. As with
all positive strand RNA viruses, an RdRp lies at the core of the viral replication machinery and
for CoVs this is the nsp12 protein. The pivotal role of nsp12 in the viral life-cycle, lack of host
homologues and high level of sequence and structural conservation makes it an optimal target for
therapeutics. However, there has been remarkably little biochemical characterization of nsp12
and a lack of fundamental data to guide the design of antiviral therapeutics and study their
mechanism of action (MoA). A promising class of RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues
(NAs), small molecule drugs that are metabolized intracellularly into their active ribonucleoside
5'-triphosphate (RTP) forms and incorporated into the nascent viral RNA by error-prone viral
RdRps. This can disrupt RNA synthesis directly via chain termination, or can lead to the
accumulation of deleterious mutations in the viral genome. For CoVs, the situation is
complicated by the post-replicative repair capacity provided by the nsp14 exonuclease (ExoN)
that is essential for maintaining the integrity of their large ~30 kb genomes1–3. Nsp14 has been
shown to remove certain NAs after insertion by the RdRp into the nascent RNA, thus reducing
their antiviral effects4–6. Despite this, several NAs currently being used for the treatment of other
viral infections have been identified as potential anti-CoV candidates7–9. Among these is the
purine base analogue T-705 (Favipiravir, Avigan, Extended data Fig. 1a,b) that has broadspectrum activity against a number of RNA viruses and is currently licensed in Japan for use in
the treatment of influenza virus10. Clinical trials are currently ongoing in China, Italy, and the
UK for the treatment of COVID-19, although a precise MoA of the drug against CoVs is lacking.
We infected Vero cells with CoV-SARS-2 in the presence or absence of 500 µM T-705
and performed deep sequencing of viral RNA. A 3-fold (P<0.001) increase in total mutation
frequencies is observed in viral populations grown in the presence of the drug as compared to the
no-drug samples (Fig. 1). Similar to previous findings with influenza11, Coxsackie B35 and
ebola12 viruses, a 12-fold increase in G-to-A and C-to-U transition mutations is observed,
consistent with T-705 acting predominantly as a guanosine analogue. The increase in the
diversity of the virus variant population suggests that once incorporated into viral RNA, T-705 is
acting as a mutagen capable of escaping the CoV repair machinery. Interestingly, the SARSCoV-2 genome has an already low cytosine content of ~17.6% and T-705 treatment may
therefore place additional pressure on the already unbalanced CoV nucleotide content.
Associated with this increase in mutation frequency, T-705 has an antiviral effect on SARSCoV-2, as illustrated by a reduction in virus-induced cytopathic effect, viral RNA copy number,
and infectious particle yield. Altogether these observations show that the mutagenic effect
induced by T-705 is, at least in part, responsible for the inhibition of the replication.
To determine the efficacy and MoA of T-705 against SARS-CoV we first characterized
nsp12 primer-dependent activity using traditional annealed primer-template (PT) and selfpriming hairpin (HP) RNAs that may confer additional stability on the elongation complex

(Extended data Fig. 1c). Consistent with prior findings, nsp12 alone is essentially inactive13,14
and RNA synthesis requires the presence nsp7 and 8 cofactors whose stimulatory effect is
enhanced by linking them as a nsp7L8 fusion protein6,15. Structures of nsp12 show a fourcomponent complex with a nsp7/nsp8 heterodimer and an additional nsp8 monomer16,17 and
accordingly we found that addition of supplementary nsp8 to the nsp12:nsp7L8 complex further
increases activity (Extended data Fig. 2). The resulting nsp12:7L8:8 complex is highly active on
both PT and HP RNAs, with reactions containing 0.2 µM of each substrate and 1 µM nsp12
showing comparable initiation rates, with a rapid burst phase resulting in >50% primer
consumption followed by remaining primer use over a period of a few minutes (Fig. 2a,
Extended data Fig. 3). Interestingly however, the apparent processivity for the two substrates
differs substantially. When provided with an annealed PT pair, intermediate products account for
~60% of the total lane intensity across all timepoints suggesting distributive polymerase activity
(Fig. 2a, Extended data Fig. 4). In contrast, extension of a HP substrate has few intermediate
products, indicating a processive elongation mode. This pattern is consistently observed across
RNA substrates of different lengths, showing that the distributive PT mode does not convert into
a processive state within a 30-nucleotide long template. Notably, the Nidovirales RNA
replication/transcription scheme involves precise recombination-like events to generate
subgenomic RNAs through a discontinuous mechanism along the ~30,000 nt genome18. The
different processivities and complex stabilities we observe may be connected to these peculiar
RNA synthesis events.
We sought to determine the extent to which the RdRp complex could incorporate the NA
inhibitors T-705 and T-1105 (a non-fluorinated T-705-related analogue, Extended data Fig. 1a,b)
into RNA. T-1105 shows improved potency against influenza virus in certain cell lines and is
more stable than T-705 in the RTP form used in enzyme assays19–21. The MoA for these
compounds is currently controversial. T-705 has been shown to act through lethal mutagenesis
for several viruses, predominantly by competing with guanosine to cause transition
mutations11,22–25. However, two separate studies support an antiviral effect mediated by chain
termination, with incorporation of either a single or two consecutive T-705 molecules blocking
further extension by influenza polymerase26,27.
For the nsp12 complex, omission of ATP and/or GTP from elongation reactions results in
rapid incorporation of T-705 and T-1105 at multiple sites with both substrates (Fig. 2b,c). In
reactions with 10 µM T-1105-RTP, multiple incorporation events are seen within 10 seconds,
while T-705-RTP is less efficient. Neither compound is incorporated in the place of cytosine or
uracil, clearly showing they function as purine analogues (Extended data Fig. 5). For the
processive HP complex, efficient incorporation and elongation occurs opposite both uracil and
cytosine, resulting in rapid accumulation of full-length products, advocating for lethal
mutagenesis as the MoA for these compounds (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, the PT substrate reveals a
striking difference in the MoA depending on whether the analogues are incorporated in place of
guanine or adenine. Opposite uracil, both are rapidly incorporated but further extension is slow
and inefficient, leading to an accumulation of RNA products consistent with a non-obligate chain

termination mechanism. The presence of a non-natural 3’ nucleotide analogue may destabilize
the complex and promote template dissociation. In contrast, opposite cytosine there is a stall
before each analogue incorporation step, but elongation past the analogue is rapid, even at
consecutive sites. More full-length product is observed in these no-GTP experiments, suggesting
both compounds are more efficient as guanosine analogues. A similar observation has been made
for the poliovirus RdRp that efficiently incorporated and bypassed T-1105 opposite cytosine but
was prone to pausing opposite uridine. These pause events were attributed to RdRp backtracking,
which was therefore assigned the primary cause of the inhibitory activity28. We conclude that for
nsp12 the T-705/T-1105 MoA is a combination of chain termination, slowed RNA synthesis and
lethal mutagenesis, dictated by the structural and functional properties of both the polymerase
and the RNA.
The reactions performed without ATP also showed detectable amounts of GTP:U
mismatch products, allowing us to make a direct comparison of the T-1105 incorporation rate
with that of a natural GTP:U mismatch (Extended data Fig. 6). Reactions using 50 µM GTP and
1 µM T-1105-RTP show ~5-fold more T-1105:U produced relative to GTP:U. Considering the
concentration difference, T-1105 incorporation is calculated to be ~250-fold more efficient than
the native GTP mismatch, the most common naturally occurring transition mutation. These high
incorporation rates likely overwhelm the CoV error-correcting mechanisms, consistent with our
infectious virus data, although it remains to be determined if nsp14 can excise T-705/T-1105, as
is the case for ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil4,6,29.
We carried out pre-steady state rapid-quench experiments to further understand the
molecular basis of nsp12 elongation rates and fidelity. We initially attempted to form stalled
elongation complexes, as is commonly done for the structurally related picornaviral RdRps 30–32
but nsp12 complexes showed half-lives of only ~1 minute across a range of conditions and
cofactor stoichiometries (Extended data Fig. 7). The significant rapid burst phase, however,
allowed characterization of elongation rates under single-turnover conditions using millisecond
timescale EDTA quench-flow (Fig. 3 and Extended data Fig. 8). Experiments were performed at
three NTP concentrations based on estimated steady-state Kd values of 3-15 µM. CTP was
omitted to allow elongation by only 7 and 8 nucleotides on PT and HP substrates respectively,
while avoiding end-effects that can slow elongation rates. At 17 µM NTP we observe multiple
incorporation steps within a mere 10-20 ms and formation of the +7/8 products by 100 ms (Fig.
3). Analysis of the data using a minimal model of identical nucleotide incorporation steps yields
elongation rates of 66±1.3 and 95±8 nt/s for the PT and HP substrates at 50 µM NTP at 22 °C
(Extended data Table 1). Fitting the rate concentration dependence yields maximal elongation
rates of 90±4 nt/s on annealed primer-templates and 150±30 nt/s on hairpin templates (Fig. 3d).
These data reveal that the SARS-CoV nsp12 is the fastest viral RdRp known, with rates
significantly faster than the 5-20 nt/s observed for picornaviral polymerases at room
temperature32–34 and 4-18 nt/s for hepatitis C and dengue virus polymerases at 30 and 37° C35,36.
Based on its structure, nsp12 is expected to use the palm domain based active site closure

mechanism that is unique to viral RdRps31 and which exhibits a 3-to-5 fold rate increase between
22 °C and 37 °C33,34, suggesting nsp12 can elongate at a staggering 600-700 nt/s at physiological
temperatures.
Such a fast viral RdRp is consistent with the need to rapidly replicate ~30,000 nt long
RNA genomes, but raises questions as to how fidelity of nucleotide incorporation is impacted. In
our data, we consistently observe nucleotide misincorporations and subsequent elongation on
templates where nsp12 should stall due to the lack of CTP (Extended data Fig. 2b, 3, 9). In
contrast, RdRps that form highly stable elongation complexes show limited or no read-through
products under comparable conditions30,35,37. The efficiency of the nsp12 bypass is UTP
concentration dependent (Extended data Fig. 3), indicative of uracil misincorporation opposite a
templating guanosine (UTP:G). The UTP:G elongation product is also observed in the PT
quench-flow data at reaction times as short as 100 ms, yielding a misincorporation rate of ~0.2
nt/s (Extended data Table 1). This is only 400–500-fold lower than the cognate UTP:A rate
measured in the same experiment, more than one order of magnitude less accurate than the
generally admitted 10-4-10-6 error rate of viral RdRps38.
The molecular basis for fast and low fidelity replication by nsp12 is not yet known, but a
comparison of RdRp structures reveals that a key NTP interaction is absent in CoV enzymes
(Fig. 4). Viral RdRps use an electrostatic interaction with an arginine residue in motif F to
position the NTP during catalysis31. For most positive strand RNA virus polymerases, this
arginine is stabilized by a salt bridge to a glutamic acid residue, also from motif F. Notably, the
CoV nsp12 has an alanine in place of this glutamate (A547) and as a result, the arginine (R555)
is not rigidly anchored above the active site (Fig. 4a)31,39. This flexibility could allow catalysis to
occur with a relaxed triphosphate positioning, decreasing fidelity by lowering the requirement
for strict Watson-Crick base pairing in the active site. Interestingly, the CoV and other largegenome nidoviral polymerases also have an SDD rather than a more typical GDD sequence in
the palm domain of motif C (Fig. 4b). This serine residue can hydrogen bond with the 2’
hydroxyl of the priming nucleotide, theoretically stabilizing the position of the primer in the
active site and compensating for the less rigid interactions with the bound NTP. These unique
features have likely played a central role in genome expansion and stability by providing a fast
RNA synthesis machinery whose inaccuracy is mitigated by the presence of an RNA repair
exonuclease. Our data demonstrate that nucleoside analogues are pertinent candidates for the
treatment of COVID-19. Favipiravir, with its already defined safety profile and mode of action,
may well find a place as an anti-RdRp component in combination therapies targeting
coronaviruses.

Materials and Methods
Nucleotide substrates
T-1105-ribose-TP (RTP), the 5'-triphosphate of the non-fluorinated derivative of T-705ribose, was synthesized as described previously21 following the iterative route from mono- via
di- to triphosphate with minor modifications. To overcome low solubility of T-1105ribonucleotides in organic solvent, the 2’- and 3’-acetyl groups were kept until the final TPsynthesis and were then cleaved by treatment with base. This reaction sequence resulted in an
increased yield of up to 90% (for di-) and 46% (for triphosphate), nearly double of previously
reported. T-705-RTP was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals. Lyophilized aliquots
were resuspended in TE buffer pH 7.0 and used the same day. Stability can be verified by
measuring Abs at 372 nm and 350 nm for T-705-RTP and T-1105-RTP respectively. Other NTPs
were purchased from GE Healthcare.
Synthetic Oligonucleotides
Primer-template (PT) pairs were purchased from Biomers (HPLC grade). RNA
oligonucleotides ST20 (20-mer) and LS1 (40-mer), corresponding to the 3’-end of the SARSCoV genome (excluding the poly A tail) were used as templates, annealed to a 5’ cy5 labeled
SP10 primer (10-mer) corresponding to the 5’-end of the anti-genome. For simplicity, these were
named PT10/20 and PT10/40 throughout the manuscript. Annealing was performed by
denaturing primer:template pairs (molar ratio of 1:1.5) in 110 mM KCl at 70⁰ C for 10 min, then
cooling slowly to room temperature over several hours. Hairpin RNAs were synthesized by
Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), resuspended at 100 uM concentration in 50 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and heated to 95°C for 15 minutes before snap cooling
on ice.

Expression and Purification of SARS-CoV proteins
All SARS-CoV proteins used in this study were expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli),
under the control of T5 promoters. Cofactors nsp7L8 and nsp8 alone were expressed from
pQE30 vectors with C-terminal and N-terminal hexa-histidine tags respectively. TEV cleavage
site sequences were included for His-tag removal following expression. The nsp7L8 fusion
protein was generated by inserting a GSGSGS linker between nsp7- and nsp8-coding sequences.
Cofactors were expressed in NEB Express C2523 (New England Biolabs) cells carrying the
pRare2LacI (Novagen) plasmid in the presence of Ampicillin (100 µM/mL) and
Chloramphenicol (17 µg/mL). Protein expression was induced with 100 µM IPTG once the
OD600 = 0.5–0.6, and expressed overnight at 17°C. Protein was purified first through affinity
chromatography with HisPur Cobalt resin (Thermo Scientific), with a lysis buffer containing 50
mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, supplemented with 20 mM MgSO4, 0.25
mg/mL Lysozyme, 10 µg/mL DNase, 1 mM PMSF, with lysis buffer supplemented with 250
mM imidazole. Eluted protein was concentrated and dialyzed overnight in the presence of
histidine labeled TEV protease (1:10 w/w ratio to TEV:protein) for removal of the protein tag.
Cleaved protein was purified through a second cobalt column and protein was purified through
size exclusion chromatography (GE, Superdex S200) in gel filtration buffer (25 mM HEPES pH
8, 150 mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, 5 mM TCEP). Concentrated aliquots of protein were flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. A synthetic, codon-optimized SARS-CoV nsp12 gene
(DNA 2.0) bearing C-terminal 8His-tag preceded by a TEV protease cleavage site was expressed
from a pJ404 vector (DNA 2.0) in E. coli strain BL21/pG-Tf2 (Takara). Cells were grown at

37°C in the presence of Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol until OD600 reached 2. Cultures were
induced with 250 µM IPTG and protein expressed at 17°C overnight. Purification was performed
as above in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% CHAPS. Two additional wash steps were
performed prior to elution, with buffer supplemented with 20 mM imidazole and 50 mM arginine
for the first and second washes respectively. Polymerase was eluted using lysis buffer with 500
mM imidazole and concentrated protein was purified through gel filtration chromatography (GE,
Superdex S200) in the same buffer as for nsp7L8. Collected fractions were concentrated and
supplemented with 50% glycerol final concentration and stored at -20 °C.

Steady-state elongation complex reactions
Nsp12, nsp7L8 and nsp8 were mixed just prior to each experiment at a 1:3:3 molar ratio
(unless otherwise stated) and preincubated on ice for 10 mins. The protein complex was
subsequently mixed with the RNA pre-mix (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2)
containing either a single RNA substrate, or both HP and PT RNAs at equimolar ratios.
Reactions were initiated with 50 µM (final concentration) of all four NTPs, or without CTP for
partial elongation reactions. Final reaction concentrations were 1 µM nsp12, 0.2 µM RNA.
Reactions were quenched at indicated timepoints with 5X volume of FBD stop solution
(formamide, 10 mM EDTA). To verify that activity was not due to either nsp7L8 or nsp8, which
have been shown to contain primase-like noncanonical RdRp activities40–43 assays were run in
the absence of nsp12. The NTP Kd was estimated using the same setup described here, but with
final (equimolar) concentration of ATP, GTP and UTP ranging from 0.78 – 100 µM (2-fold
dilution series). The time course of product formation was fit to single exponential equation for
each concentration of NTP to give the observed rate constant (kobs). Observed rates were
subsequently plotted against NTP concentration, and the data was fit via hyperbolic regression to
give the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum rate constant for incorporation
of NTPs (kpol).
Formation of stalled elongation complex
Attempts to form a stalled elongation complex were performed with HP8-22 RNA with
varied ratios of nsp12:nsp7L8:nsp8 (using a constant nsp12 concentration 0.8 µM). Protein,
HP8-22 RNA (0.2 µM) and 50 µM final concentrations of GTP and ATP were incubated for 5
min at room temperature to allow formation of a +4-lock stalled complex. Reactions were diluted
1:2 in high salt to prevent RNA rebinding, and chased at various timepoints (1 – 50 minutes)
with 50 µM all NTPs. Chase reactions were quenched after 30 sec in FBD. Stability half-life was
calculated from the ratio of full-length (FL) product produced relative to the total amount of +4lock + FL product at each timepoint. Half-life was obtained by fitting the data through a single
exponential.
Pre-steady state quenched-flow kinetics
Experiments were carried out in a Bio-Logic QFM-300 rapid chemical quench-flow
apparatus that controls reaction time by flow rate through a 2.5 uL chamber between the reaction
mixer and the quencher mixer. The nsp12-nsp7L8-nsp8 complex was assembled by first
preincubating the proteins on ice for 10 minutes at a 1:3:3 molar ratio, then adding this to
SP10/20 and HP8-29 hairpin RNA in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5mM MgCl2, 50
mM NaCl) and further incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes prior to beginning the
rapid-quench experiments, which took ~10 minutes to complete a set of 22 different reaction

times. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes (18 ul each) of the protein-RNA
complex with NTP solutions containing equimolar concentrations of ATP, GTP and UTP, and
then quenched with 18 uL of 200 mM EDTA. Final concentrations in the reactions were 1 uM
nsp12, 0.2 uM primer-template RNA, 0.2 uM hairpin RNA, and 50, 16.7 or 5.6 uM NTP, and the
final EDTA concentration after quenching was 67 mM.
Product Analysis
Quenched reactions were mixed 1:1 with FBD loading dye and heated for 10 min at 70°C,
and cooled on ice for 2 min before analysis on 17 – 20% polyacrylamide, 7 M Urea TBE gels.
Gels were run at a constant 65 W using Sequi-Gen GT Systems from Bio-Rad or vertical
electrophoresis systems from CBS Scientific and visualized using an Amersham™ Typhoon™
Biomolecular Imager (GE Healthcare). The intensity of each band was quantified using the
ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare)/Image Gauge (Fuji) and/or using ImageJ as implemented
in the Fiji package, with background subtraction. Product yield was determined by dividing the
intensity of the product by total intensity of the product + remaining primer, and multiplying by
the input concentration of RNA. For the rapid quench data, the program PeakFit (Systat
Software) was used to fit gel lane profiles to a set of gaussian peaks and the fractional area
contained within each peak was multiplied by the RNA concentration in the experiment to
calculate the amount of each elongation species as a function of reaction time.
Pre-steady state kinetic data analysis
Rapid quench date were analysed using the program KinTek Explorer44 to model the
reactions as a series of seven (PT substrate) or eight (HP substrate) irreversible nucleotide
addition steps. Data from each NTP concentration series were fit independently (not globally) to
obtain observed rates using either a model with i) a single average rate or ii) individual rates for
each nucleotide addition step (fig S8). Modeling the remaining intermediate species due to low
processivity elongation using formal RNA dissociation and rebinding steps (at rates comparable
to non-burst phase primer utilization) was a not successful, suggesting the nsp12-RNA complex
exists in some form of inactive state. Low processivity elongation was instead accommodated in
the kinetic model by adding a reversible inactivation/reactivation equilibrium step for each
elongation product, allowing intermediate products to depart from the immediate processive
pathway toward full length product formation, but then rejoin the pathway for further elongation.
The rate constants for these steps were shared among all intermediates species as there was
insufficient data to fit them individually.
The single average rate models were fit using data from primer loss and the expected fulllength (+7 or +8) product, but not the intermediate species. Note that for the PT template we
observed detectable amounts of additional +8 and +9 bands at the higher 16.7 and 50 µM NTP
concentrations and therefore included them in the model. This is presumably due to a UTP:G
mismatch to yield the +8 product in the absence of CTP, followed by a cognate ATP:U addition
that is slow because it is priming on a mismatched base pair. For the HP substrate, we were
unable to definitively identify the gel migration bands for the +6 and +7 species and therefore
did not model individual rates for these incorporation events. Data from the HP RNAs are can be
challenging to analyze because the high thermodynamic stability of the folded RNA structure
can make it difficult to fully denature the helix during electrophoresis. This leads to a mixture of
species that transition from denatured single stranded RNA for the initial species to more

NTP-analog incorporation
Enzyme mix (20 µM nsp12, 60 nsp7L8, 60 µM nsp8) in complex buffer (25 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, 5 mM TCEP, 5 mM MgCl2) was incubated 10 min on ice and then diluted
with reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) to 4 µM nsp12 (12
nsp7L8 and 8). The resulting enzyme complex was mixed with the same volume of 0.8 µM
primer/ template (P/T) with or without 0.8 µM hairpin (HP) carrying 6-FAM or Cy5 fluorescent
labels at their 5’ ends in reaction buffer, and incubated at 25°C (or 30°C as given in Figure
legends) for 10 min. Reactions were then started with the same volume of 100 µM NTPs
(leaving out one or two as given in Figure legends) and TE buffer or NTP-analogs (T-1105-RTP
or T-705-RTP) in reaction buffer. Final concentrations in the reactions were 1 µM nsp12 (3 µM
nsp7L8 and 8), 0.2 µM P/T (and 0.2 µM HP), 50 µM NTPs and the given concentrations of
NTP-analogs. Samples of 8 µl were taken at given time points and mixed with 40 µl of
formamide containing 10 mM EDTA. Ten-µl samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE (20 %
acrylamide, 7 M urea, TBE buffer); and product profiles visualized by a fluorescence imager
(Amersham Typhoon).
In vitro infection assays
Cell line: VeroE6 (ATCC CRL-1586) cells were grown in minimal essential medium (Life
Technologies) with 7 .5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 with 1
% penicillin/streptomycin (PS, 5000 U.mL-1 and 5000 µg.mL-1respectively; Life Technologies)
and supplemented with 1 % non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies).
Virus strain: SARS-CoV-2 strain BavPat1 was obtained from Pr. Drosten through EVA
GLOBAL (https://www.european-virus-archive.com/). Virus stock was prepared as previously
described45. All experiments were conducted in a BSL3 laboratory.
Antiviral experiments: For EC50 and CC50 determination, one day prior to infection, 5×104
VeroE6 cells were seeded in 100 µL assay medium (containing 2.5 % FCS) in 96 well plates.
The next day, seven 2-fold serial dilutions of T-705 (500 µM to 3.9 µM in triplicate) were added
to the cells (25 µL/well, in assay medium). Four virus control wells were supplemented with 25
µL of assay medium. After 15 min, 25 µL of a virus mix diluted in medium was added to the
wells. The amount of virus working stock used was calibrated prior to the assay, based on a
replication kinetics, so that the replication growth is still in the exponential growth phase for the
readout as previously described46,47. Four cell control wells (i.e. with no virus) were
supplemented with 50 µL of assay medium. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C prior to
quantification of the viral genome by real-time RT-PCR. RNA extraction and viral RNA
quantification was performed has previously described45. The 50% and 90% effective
concentrations (EC50, EC90; compound concentration required to inhibit viral RNA replication
by 50% and 90%) were determined using logarithmic interpolation as previously described46.
For the evaluation of CC50 (the concentration that reduces the total cell number by 50%), the
same culture conditions were set as for the determination of the EC50, without addition of the
virus, then cell viability was measured using CellTiter Blue® (Promega). Cell supernatant media
were discarded and CellTiter-Blue® reagent (Promega) was added following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Plates were incubated for 2 hours prior recording fluorescence (560/590nm) with a

logarithmic interpolation. For EC50 determination using CPE inhibition, cells and T-705 were
prepared as previously described (EC50 determination). Eight virus control wells were
supplemented with 25 µL of assay medium and eight cell control were supplemented with 50 µL.
After 15 min, 25 µL of a virus mix diluted in 2.5 % FCS-containing medium was added to the
wells at MOI 0.002. Three days after infection, CPE were assessed using CellTiter-Blue®
reagent (Promega). For the infectivity test cells and compound were prepared as described above
(EC50 determination) with only three 2-fold serial dilutions of T-705 (125µM to 500µM, in
triplicate). Three virus control wells were supplemented with 25 µL of assay medium. The
experiment was conducted as previously described for the EC50 determination. At day 3 the
supernatant was collected and each triplicate was titrated by measuring the 50 % tissue culture
infectivity dose (TCID50); briefly, 3 replicates were infected with 100 µL of tenfold serial
dilutions of the previous supernatant, and incubated for 3 days. CPE was measured by CellTiterBlue® reagent (Promega) and TCID50 was calculated and expressed as TCID50/mL based on the
Reed and Muench (43). Antiviral experiments data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7
software (Graph pad software). Graphical representations were also performed on GraphPad

Sequence analysis
Eight overlapping amplicons were produced from the extracted viral RNA using the
SuperScript IV One-Step RT-PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and specific primers
(supplemental data). PCR products were pooled at equimolar proportions. After Qubit
quantification using Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific) amplicons were fragmented by sonication in ~200bp long fragments. Libraries were
built adding barcodes for sample identification to the fragmented DNA using AB Library Builder
System (ThermoFisher Scientific). To pool the barcoded samples at equimolar ratio a
quantification step by real time PCR using Ion Library TaqMan™ Quantitation Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) was realised. An emulsion PCR of the pools and loading on 530 chip was
realised using the automated Ion Chef instrument (ThermoFisher). Sequencing was performed
using the S5 Ion torrent technology v5.12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s
instructions. Consensus sequence was obtained after trimming of reads (reads with quality score
<0.99, and length <100pb were removed and the 30 first and 30 last nucleotides were removed
from the reads) mapping of the reads on a reference (determined following Blast of De Novo
contigs) using CLC genomics workbench software v.20 (Qiagen). A de novo contig was also
produced to ensure that the consensus sequence was not affected by the reference sequence.
Quasi species with frequency over 0.1% were studied.
