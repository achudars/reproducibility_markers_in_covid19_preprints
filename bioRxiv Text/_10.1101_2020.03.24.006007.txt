Note: The main ideas and results of this research were first presented at the International Conference on Nonlinear
Systems and Dynamics (CNSD-2013) held at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, December 12, 2013. In this
manuscript, we have extended our preliminary analysis to include SARS-CoV-2 virus as well.

A BSTRACT
Finding vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for global pandemic of virus diseases (such as the
ongoing COVID-19) requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic libraries
to enable a quick and efficient screening of nucleotide sequences. Traditional sequence alignment
methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis.
Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group
(Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as
Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information
content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for
automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments
of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish
SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences.
This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and
characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete
segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.

1 Introduction
SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARSCoV1 ) and having flu-like symptoms. It was first identified in Guandong province, China, in 2002 and spread rapidly
to different parts of the world in a span of just a few months [1]. The primary route of transmission of the SARS
coronavirus is through mucosal contact with respiratory droplets or fomites of infected persons. Marra et al. [1] and
Rota et al. [2] have done extensive studies to show that SARS-CoVs forms a separate group of coronaviruses and are
not closely related to other previously sequenced coronaviruses (mammalian and avian viruses).

A PREPRINT - M ARCH 24, 2020

SARS-CoV-2 is the latest strain of the coronavirus, first discovered in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, that is responsible for
the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Apart from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, there are
hundreds of other strains of SARSr-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus) that are known to
infect only non-human species such as bats (and palm civets and other mammals). SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious in
humans with the World Health Organization (WHO) designating it as a pandemic, the first ever caused by a coronavirus.
Pandemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 virus that leads to enormous loss of life globally can only be controlled
by finding a vaccine or a very effective antiviral treatment. Finding a vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for such
global pandemic of virus diseases requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic libraries to enable
quick and efficient screening of nucleotide sequences. Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable since
they are computationally intensive and cannot be easily scaled up as the number of sequences increase. Thus, there is a
need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis [3, 4]. Further, one may have only short segments and/or
incomplete fragments of nucleotide sequences to analyze [5]. Information theory and data compression algorithms
provide a rich set of mathematical and algorithmic/computational tools to capture essential patterns in data that could
be used for matching nucleotide sequences.
Genome sequences are inherently described by character strings and hence amenable to mathematical and computational
techniques for extracting information. Exactly what information is being sought from such character strings depends
on the string itself and the domain as well as the kind of application. Some targets of interest for analyzing genome
sequences include:
•
•
•
•

Various genes that constitute the genome.
Identifying the origin of the genome sequence.
Understanding the information content present in the coding and non-coding regions.
Reconstructing the phylogenetic tree to study evolutionary patterns.

An important objective is to automate the above tasks so that a large number of sequences can be quickly, robustly and
efficiently analyzed (as one of the steps in the endeavor for finding a vaccine).
A cursory glance at these character strings doesn’t tell us much about how they can be used for these applications. But a
harmonious blending of complexity analysis with the field of information theory provides deep insight in this regard.
Application of complexity measures on these information bearing character strings may reveal many surprising features
that generally can’t be discerned by intuition or visual inspection of the data alone.
In this study, we propose a novel compression-complexity based distance measure for sequence analysis and identification. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, a brief overview of genetic sequences and methods of analysis are
described. Section 3 deals with the materials used (genome primary sequence data with their details) and the methods
proposed in this study (novel distance measure for identification). Results on real data (nucleotide sequences) followed
by their analysis and discussion can be found in section 4. We conclude with future research directions in section 5.

2 Genetic Sequences and their Analysis: An Overview
The basic building blocks of DNA and RNA are primary nucleobases, namely Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), Adenine (A),
Thymine (T) and Uracil (U). A, C, G and T occur in DNA sequences and are known as DNA bases while A, C, G and
U occur in RNA sequences and are called RNA bases. A string of these nucleobases forms a nucleic acid sequence
that has the capacity to represent information. These information strings are called genetic sequences. Each species
has unique characteristics differentiating it from other species and these characteristics are defined by the information
content of the DNA sequences [6].
2.1 Genome and gene
The total DNA content (RNA for viruses) of an organism is known as the genome, thus representing the entire
information coded in a cell, while a gene represents a section of the DNA that codes for RNA or protein. A genome
consists of a sequence of multiple genes interspersed with non-coding sequences of nucleic bases [6, 7].
2.2 Genome sequence comparison
Genome data classification comes under the broad field of bioinformatics, an established multidisciplinary field for over
three decades, encompassing physical and life sciences, computer science and engineering. Many fundamental problems
in the fields of medicine and biology are being tackled using the tools of bioinformatics. The main requirement for

accomplishing such tasks is the availability of sequenced genome data. This has been the focus of researchers for the
past few decades and efforts have been put by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish Genbank R 2 , a genetic
sequence database containing annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences. Ever since its inception
in 1982, there has been an exponential rise in the number of sequences in Genbank. This has provided the required
resources for researchers and industry people alike for delving in to the field of bioinformatics.
Among the various aspects involved in bioinformatics, one key element is sequence comparison or analysis of sequence
similarity [8, 9]. This is used in database searching, sequence identification and classification, phylogenetic tree3
creation and in gene annotation and evolutionary modeling. Since it is impossible to recreate/simulate past evolutionary
events, computational and statistical methods for comparison of nucleotide and protein sequences are used for these
kinds of studies [10, 11].
There are basically two kinds of sequence comparison methods:
• Alignment based methods: These involve either shifting or insertion of gaps in sequences for alignment of two
or more sequences, which make these methods computationally intensive.
• Alignment-free methods: These are computationally less intensive methods that consider the genome sequences
as character strings and use distance-based methods involving frequency and distribution of bases [12–14]. Our
focus in this paper is on alignment-free methodology, especially on using complexity measures for sequence
comparisons.
Sequence comparison and genome data classification got a boost in the early 1990s with the use of data compression
algorithms that have the ability to identify regularities in sequences [15]. They provided a means to define distances
between two sequences that greatly aided in the comparison of sequences. The history behind the usage of data
compression algorithms in this field has been elucidated by Otu et al. in [15]. We succinctly summarize that history
here.
The first attempt at using data compression for phylogenetic tree construction was by Grumbach et al. in [16]. They
explored the idea of compressing a sequence S using a sequence Q, where the degree of compression obtained by doing
so would be an indicator of the distance between them. Although their definition was not mathematically valid, it set a
platform for researchers to explore in this area. Varre et al. [17] defined a transformation distance when sequence Q is
transformed to sequence S by various mutations like segment-copy, segment-reverse copy and segment-insertion. Li et
al. [18] define a relative distance measure by using a compression algorithm called GenCompress [19] that is based on
approximate repeats in DNA sequences. Using the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, the compression algorithm has
been used to propose a distance between sequences S and Q. But Kolmogorov complexity, [20] being an algorithmic
measure of information and a theoretical limit, can’t be directly computed but only approximately estimated [21]. Hence
it is not an optimum choice as a complexity measure.
Even though the idea of relative distance is an efficient one, GenCompress is a complicated algorithm that is computationally intensive. To overcome the above mentioned difficulties, Otu et al. [15] proposed similar but computationally
simpler relative distance measures based on the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) [22] complexity measure. Given two sequences S
and Q, sequences SQ and QS are formed by concatenation4 . These four sequences are used to define four distance
measures using the LZ complexity measure, as given below:
d(S, Q) = max{LZ(SQ) − LZ(S), LZ(QS) − LZ(Q)}.

(1)

To eliminate the effect of length of the sequence, a normalized measure is defined as follows:
d(S, Q) =

max{LZ(SQ) − LZ(S), LZ(QS) − LZ(Q)}
.
max{LZ(S), LZ(Q)}

(2)

A third distance metric based on sum distance is defined as follows:
d(S, Q) = LZ(SQ) − LZ(S) + LZ(QS) − LZ(Q).

(3)

Finally, normalized version of the sum distance is defined as:
d(S, Q) =

LZ(SQ) − LZ(S) + LZ(QS) − LZ(Q)
.
LZ(SQ)

A phylogenetic tree, also called an evolutionary tree, is a tree diagram that shows the evolutionary relationships among different
species according to the composition of their genes.

Using these distance measures on mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) samples of a wide range of eutherans (placental
mammals), they have successfully re-created phylogenetic trees showing the evolutionary patterns. Other researchers
have used these and slight variants of these measures to identify families of coronaviruses, mammals, vertebrates and
salmons. Interested readers are referred to [23–30] for further details on these. Apart from these complexity based
measures, distance measures using Markov chain models [31–33] and measures of probability [34–36] have also been
proposed for the study of genome identification.
2.3 Effect of data length on complexity of sequences
Monge et al. in [29] have pointed out that complexity is not uniform throughout a genome. Regions including genes are
more regular and have less complexity than regions that don’t include a gene. This raises the issue of the length of the
genome to be analyzed. Since the complexity is not uniform, it will be inaccurate to use the entire genome sequence for
analysis and may possibly give erroneous results. Also the use of complete genome/gene sequences is computationally
intensive and is practically infeasible for scaling up for matching a large number of genetic sequences. [5].
Our primary interest in this work lies in showing that it is not necessary to have the entire genome/gene for complexity
analysis. In this work, we use LZ and Effort-To-Compress (ETC) [37] complexity measures to analyze short length
segments that are randomly chosen from genome sequences. In particular, short length contiguous segments (length
< 100) are randomly chosen from the sequence for analysis.

3 Materials and Methods
In this section, we describe in detail the data that was used in this study as well as the various methods that were
employed for automatic identification of sequences.
3.1 Sequence analysis of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1)
We first analyzed the genome primary sequences of the following viruses: SARS coronavirus Urbani (AY278741.1),
SARS coronavirus BJ01 (AY278488.2) and Avian Infectious Bronchitis coronavirus reference sequence (NC_001451.1).
The first two virsues belong to the SARS-CoV-1 strain. The genome sequences were obtained from Genbank database,
the details of which were mentioned in Section 2.2. Table 1 gives the details of the genome sequences that we use for
the analysis.

3.1.1 0-1 sequences
The first step in our analysis is the conversion of primary sequences into 0-1 sequences before we can evaluate
complexity values. For this, we have considered three different methods to categorize the nucleotide bases and map
them to the symbols 0 and 1 based on their:
• Chemical structure
• Carboxylic acid group they belong to
• Strength of the hydrogen bonds
The four bases are mapped into two classes (labelled 0 and 1) in order to create a 0-1 sequence. For every input primary
sequence, we create three independent sets of 0-1 sequences using three different methods as described in Table 2. It
has been shown in [38] that these three characteristic sequences give the complete information of the primary sequence.

3.1.2 Lempel-Ziv (LZ) and Effort-To-Compress (ETC) complexity measures
For measuring complexity of short length segments of the nucleotide sequences, we have used Lempel-Ziv (LZ [22])
and Effort-To-Compress (ETC [37]) complexity measures. Lempel–Ziv complexity (LZ), a popular and widely used
complexity measure, estimates the degree of compressibility of an input sequence. Effort-To-Compress, a more recently
proposed complexity measure (by our research group), determines the number of steps required by the Non-Sequential
Recursive Pair Substitution Algorithm to compress the input sequence to a constant sequence (or a sequence of zero
entropy). It should be noted that both LZ and ETC are complexity measures derived from lossless data compression
algorithms (hence we term them as compression-complexity measures). It has been demonstrated that both LZ and
ETC outperform Shannon Entropy in characterizing complexity of noisy time series of short length arising out of
stochastic (markov) and chaotic systems [37, 39, 40]. Further, ETC consistently performs better than LZ in a number of
applications as shown in recently published literature [39–42]. For details of how to compute LZ and ETC on actual
input sequences, we refer the readers to [22, 37, 43].
3.1.3 Distance measure and identification
We propose a very simple criteria for identification of sequences by proposing a distance measure which is computed
using a compression-complexity measure (LZ or ETC). Let us say that we have genome sequences of three viruses
V1 , V2 and V3 . Firstly, we form new sequences V1 V2 and V2 V1 by concatenation5 . We then compute the complexity
measures ET C(V1 ), ET C(V2 ), ET C(V1 V2 ) and ET C(V2 V1 ) (similarly for LZ). In line with what has been used by
Otu et al. [15] in Equation 4, we propose a distance measure given by the average of the relative distances between the
complexity values of the two concatenated sequences V1 V2 and V2 V1 . Mathematically, they are described as:
dLZ (V1 , V2 ) =

(LZ(V1 V2 ) − LZ(V1 )) + (LZ(V2 V1 ) − LZ(V2 ))
,
2

(5)

(ET C(V1 V2 ) − ET C(V1 )) + (ET C(V2 V1 ) − ET C(V2 ))
.
(6)
2
Note that the above distances will always be non-negative and symmetric6 . In a similar fashion, we determine the
distances dET C (V1 , V3 ) (dLZ (V1 , V3 )) and dET C (V2 , V3 ) (dLZ (V2 , V3 )). We then determine the minimum of the set
{d(V1 , V2 ), d(V1 , V3 ), d(V2 , V3 )}7 . We identify those viruses Vi and Vj which have the minimum distance to belong to
the same group.
dET C (V1 , V2 ) =

In our experiment, the sequences are converted to three independent sets of 0-1 sequences (by using the three methods
listed in Table 2) and the LZ and ETC distances are independently calculated for all three sets. The average values of
these are taken as the distance between the two sequences. In order to automatically identify the SARS viruses, the two
SARS coronaviruses (Urbani and BJ01) should have the minimum distance (in complexities) as compared with the
distance between the avian strain and any of the SARS coronaviruses (Urbani and BJ01). This method of identification
can be easily extended if there are more than 3 sequences.

4 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 depicts the boxplots of pairwise distances (for LZ and ETC based measures) between the three viruses – Avian,
BJ01 and Urbani, estimated for 100 short contiguous segments of length 30 nucleotide bases each of which were chosen
independently at random locations of the entire genome sequence.
The mean pairwise distances (and standard deviations) are reported in Table 3. As it can be seen, both LZ and ETC
based distance measures yield the least value for the SARS-CoV-1 virus pair.

d(A, B) ≥ 0, d(A, A) = 0 and d(A, B) = d(B, A). The triangle inequality is also likely to hold.

4.1 Distinguishing SARS-CoV-1 vs. SARS-CoV-2
Having demonstrated the efficiency of LZ and ETC based distance measures in successfully distinguishing viruses
by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences, we extend our work to identify SARS-CoV-2 virus from
SARS-CoV-1 viruses. To this end, we use the following sequences (Table 4) for this experiment.

Figure 3 depicts the boxplots of pairwise distances (for LZ and ETC based measures) between the three viruses –
SARS-CoV-1:BJ01, SARS-CoV-1:Urbani and SARS-CoV-2 estimated for 300 short contiguous segments of length 25
nucleotide bases each of which were chosen independently at random locations of the entire genome sequence. The
mean pairwise distances (and standard deviations) are reported in Table 5. It was found that only ETC based distance
measure yielded the least value (statistically significant) for the SARS-CoV-1 virus pair (BJ01 and Urbani), and not the
LZ based distance measure. The statistical validation of the results is depicted using 95% confidence interval plots
as shown in Figure 4. Based on the sample data, at an overall error rate of 5%, we can conclude that ETC is able to
distinguish between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses by using only short contiguous segments consisting of
25 nucleic bases chosen independently from random locations (300 such segments) of the entire sequence. LZ based
distance measure fails to do so.
To highlight the effect of segment length on distinguishing SARS-CoV-1 virsues from SARS-CoV-2 virus, we plot
the pairwise distances (both LZ and ETC measures) for the three viruses for a single randomly chosen contiguous
segment of length 5000 bases in Figure 5(left) and for another single randomly chosen contiguous segment of length 25
bases in Figure 5(right). It is evident that only ETC based measure is able to yield the least distance between the two
SARS-CoV-1 pair of viruses for both lengths. LZ based distance measure fails to identify this pair for the short length
segment and instead yields the least distance for the pair SARS-CoV-2 and Urbani which is not desirable.
Though these are still preliminary results, they are highly encouraging to further test ETC based distance measure for
automatic identification/segregation of nucleotide sequences using only short segments.

5 Conclusion and Future Research Directions
Compression-complexity measures such as LZ and ETC which are based on lossless compression algorithms are good
candidates for developing fast alignment-free methods for genome sequence analysis, comparison and identification.
The main reason for this is their ability to characterize and analyze information in biological sequences with very short
length contiguous segments. As we have demonstrated in this study, our preliminary results suggests that ETC could be
very useful for identifying an unknown sequence from a large database of nucleotide sequences since we can quickly
compute the measure on the candidate sequences for a small set of nucleic bases. LZ complexity requires slightly larger
nucleotide sequences and that needs more computation. Other information theoretic methods in literature which employ
Shannon Entropy, Mutual Information etc. would also need larger nucleotide sequences for computation and are not
robust to noise. Some areas for further research are:
1. We have presented only preliminary results in this study and there is a need to rigorously test on distinguishing
more sequences to further establish the reliability, robustness and universality of the proposed approach.
2. Construct a complete phylogenetic tree using the distance measure that we have proposed.
3. Compare ETC and LZ based distance measures with other methods in literature – both alignment-based and
alignment-free methods.

4. Integrate ETC with existing open source packages that perform genetic sequence comparison and matching. To
this end, we provide an open MATLAB R and Python implementation of ETC that can be freely downloaded
and used (link provided below).
The ideas presented in this study could potentially be extended further to enable medical practitioners to rapidly
and automatically identify an unknown coronavirus sample (to be either a SARS coronavirus strain or a non-SARS
coronavirus) in a fast and efficient fashion using only short and/or incomplete segments of genetic sequences. Further
speed up can be obtained by parallelizing the analysis on individual short segments. Potentially, the need for sequence
assembly can be completely circumvented.

Software implementation of ETC
We provide open implementation of ETC (in MATLAB R and Python) for free download and use (for research and
academic purposes only). Please visit: https://sites.google.com/site/nithinnagaraj2/journal/etc.

Acknowledgements
