Abstract

2

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory

3

coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Till date,

4

no vaccine or completely effective drug is available to cure COVID-19. Therefore, an effective

5

vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed. This study was conducted to design an

6

effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins

7

were taken as targets and different epitopes (B-cell, T-cell and IFN-γ inducing) were predicted.

8

Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated

9

significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the world’s

10

population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class

11

I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were

12

added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the MEV. The antigenicity, allergenicity,

13

physiochemical properties and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety

14

and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible.

15

Molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis, demonstrated a

16

stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR),

17

TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning of MEV ensured increased

18

expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. Designed MEV in present study could be a

19

potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19. However, to

20

ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally

21

validated.

1. Introduction

2

Viruses are dangerous pathogens and can cause irreversible losses to human lives and economy.

3

The world hardly learns to deal with a virus when new emerges and threatens the future of

4

humanity. A similar situation arises when a new strain of coronavirus (CoV) not previously

5

identified in humans was reported last year (2019) [1]. Positive-sense RNA viruses called corona

6

viruses belong to the Coronaviridae family that are distributed broadly among human and

7

mammals. In the last two decades there have been more than 10,000 reported infections of two

8

types of coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-COV) or Middle East

9

Coronavirus (MERS-COV) [2]. Last year December (2019), few cases of unknown viral based

10

pneumonia were reported in Wuhan city (Hubei province, P.R. China). Later it was identified

11

that, this pneumonia is linked with a novel type of CoV outbreak. World Health Organization

12

(WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 and linked disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-

13

19). The COVID-19 quickly widespread around the globe and claimed thousands of human lives.

14

WHO announced global health emergency and recognized COVID-19 as pandemic [3-5]. SARS-

15

CoV-2 was indicated root cause of COVID-19 through deep sequencing analysis from lower

16

respiratory tract samples of patients [6]. SARS-COV-2 genome sequence is almost 70% similar

17

to SARS-COV, and 40% similar to the MERS-COV [7]. Symptoms of SARS-COV-2 may arise

18

within 2 days or up-to 14 days of exposure. Symptoms such as fever, diarrhea and respiratory

19

disorder are found in infected patients [4]. According to latest research SARS-CoV-2 has an

20

identical genomic organization as of beta-coronaviruses; 5’-untranslated region (UTR), orf1ab

21

(replicas complex), nsps (encoding non-structural proteins), S (spike) protein, E (envelope)

22

protein, M (membrane) protein, Oraf6, orf7a, orf8, N (nucleocapsid) protein, orf10, 3’-UTR and

23

several unknown non-structural open reading frames [3, 8].

24

There is currently no vaccine or approved treatment for COVID-19. Few traditional

25

Chinese medicine such as Shufengjiedu capsules and Lianhuaqingwen capsules were reported

26

effective against COVID-19 [9, 10]. Nonetheless, no clinical trials support the safety and

27

efficacy of these medicinal products. Similarly, clinical trials are in process for few experimental

28

drugs, including remdesivir and chloroquine which were found effective in vitro against COVID-

29

19 [11]. However, there is no clinical trial-based drug or vaccine reported yet. To prevent viral

30

diseases vaccine is the most effective approach. Now a days, availability of genomic

information, advance software and immunological data sets could greatly facilitate researchers to

2

identify the effective epitopes from pathogens’ proteins that can be used to develop active sub-

3

unit vaccines [12-15]. The subunit vaccine contains the fragments of antigenic proteins of

4

pathogen that can trigger an immune response against the target pathogen [16, 17]. In recent

5

studies, few candidate vaccine constructs were reported against MERS-CoV [18], Chikungunya

6

virus [19], Ebola virus [20], Zika virus [21], HCV [22], Flavivirus [23] and Cytomegalovirus

7

[24] with promising results. The in silico methods reduce the number of in vitro experiments and

8

save time, overcome cost obstacles and increase the potential for successful vaccine design [25-

9

27].

10

In present study, SARS-CoV-2 proteome was explored to determine the potent antigenic

11

proteins and their further screening for B-cell, T-cell and IFN-γ inducing epitopes prediction

12

with their MHC (major histocompatibility complex) alleles. Antigenicity, allergenicity and

13

toxicity of predicted epitopes were analyzed. Multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) construct was

14

designed by using the most potential and interacting epitopes, with the addition of suitable

15

linkers and an adjuvant. Adjuvants are generally defined as molecules that may increase or

16

modulate the intrinsic immunogenicity of an antigen [28]. Adjuvants are essential to reduce the

17

amount of antigen and the number of injections, as they help to induce effective and persistent

18

immune responses [29]. Several in silico approaches were utilized to validate the antigenicity,

19

immunogenicity, allergenicity, structural stability/flexibility and physiochemical properties of

20

designed MEV. Furthermore, molecular docking and MD simulations analyses were carried out

21

to investigate binding interaction and stability of the MEV with human pathogenic receptors. At

22

the end, the MEV codons were optimized for E. coli system and in silico cloning was performed

23

to ensure its expression profiling (Figure 1).

2.1. Sequence retrieval and analysis of antigenic proteins

6

In the first step, whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from GENBANK [30]. After

7

that, individual protein sequences were extracted and stored as FASTA format for further

8

analysis.

2.1.1. Antigenicity and physiochemical properties evaluation

10

The Expassy Protparam tool was used to determine the physical and chemical properties of

11

selected proteins [31]. To check protein antigenicity, the Vaxijen 2.0 software was used [32].

12

The threshold value was held at 0.5, and the secondary structure of proteins was predicted by

13

using SOPMA tool [33].

2.1.2. Tertiary structure prediction and refinement of target proteins

2

Tertiary stores of most of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are not reported yet. Therefore, combinations of

3

different approaches were employed to predict good quality structures for further analysis.

4

Online tools such as Swiss model which work on homology based modeling algorithms and

5

Raptor X which work on deep learning modules, were primarily used for the tertiary structure

6

prediction of SARS-COV-2 proteins [34-36]. Predicted Models were then refined by galaxy

7

refine server and validated by Ramachandran plot analysis.

8

2.2. Epitopes prediction and validation

9

2.2.1. B-cell epitope prediction

10

In immune system the B-Cell epitope helps to detect viral infection and activities. B-cells

11

provide humoral immunity by secreting immunoglobulins which can neutralize antigen upon

12

binding. A surface receptor of B-cell recognizes B-cell epitopes, resulting the generation of

13

antigen-specific immunoglobulins [37]. B-cell epitopes are two types, linear (continuous) and

14

conformational (discontinuous). An online database of ABCPred was used to predict linear B-

15

cell epitopes [38, 39]. Conformational epitopes were predicted by Ellipro server [40].

16

2.2.2. T-cell Epitope prediction

17

T-cells express TCRs (T-cell receptors), that could recognize specific antigens and can generate

18

cellular and humoral immune response against them [41]. The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)

19

consensus method [42, 43] was used to predict MHC classes I and MHC II epitopes with

20

consensus score less than 2 filter cut.

21

2.2.3. Immunogenicity prediction of epitopes

22

To evaluate the antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity of B-cell and T-cell epitope, Vaxijen v2.0

23

and AllerTOP v2.0 were used. The filtering criteria 0.5 was used. Only filtered, non-antigenic,

24

non-allergenic and non-toxic epitopes were selected for further studies.

2.2.4. Conservation analysis of epitopes

2

IEDB conservancy analysis tool [44] was used, to monitor the degree of conservation in the

3

sequence of B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Epitopes showing 100 percent conservation were

4

shortlisted for further analysis.

5

2.2.5. Interferon-γ inducing epitope prediction

6

IFN-γ is acknowledged to elicit intrinsic safe responses and can directly detain viral duplication

7

[45, 46]. Besides, they can trigger the versatile immune reactions by preparing cytotoxic T

8

lymphocyte (CTL) and Helper T lymphocyte (HTL). IFN epitope server was used to calculate

9

IFN-γ epitopes of selected proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using SVM hybrid algorithms along with

10

Motif [47].

11

2.2.6. Epitopes modeling and molecular docking

12

Epitopes which show favorable strong binding affinities with a common experimentally

13

validated allele, are good choice to design MEV construct. Therefore, molecular docking

14

between screened epitopes and human allele was performed. Molecular docking is an in silico

15

approach which determined the binning affinity between ligand and its target proteins, and also

16

highlight the important residues involve in the interaction. 3D structures of overlapping, highly

17

antigenic and conserved epitopes with corresponding common alleles were predicted using

18

PEPFOLD [48]. The X-ray crystallographic structure of a common human allele (HLA-B7) was

19

retrieved from protein data bank (PDB ID: 3VCL). Molecular docking was performed using

20

same protocol of our previously published studies [5, 18, 19, 49, 50]. To visualize the

21

docked complexes and draw figures, the PyMOL molecular graphics system was used

22

[51].

23

2.2.7. Population coverage analysis of selected epitopes

24

The selected epitopes for MEV construct should effectively cover major populations across the

25

globe. For population coverage, overlapping, antigenic, conserved and strongly interacting with

26

HLA-B7 allele epitopes were selected and further analysed using the IEDB population coverage

27

analysis tool by maintaining the default analysis parameters [44]. This tool is designed to estimate

1

the population coverage of epitopes from diverse counties based on the distribution of their

2

MHC-binding alleles. As SARS-CoV-2 is global pandemic, therefore, worldwide analysis has

3

been performed.

4

2.3. Construction of multi epitope vaccine

5

To construct a sub-unit vaccine, the epitopes with following properties are usually preferred: (a)

6

100% conserved, (b) overlapping, (c) highly immunogenic, (d) non-allergic, (e) non-toxic, (f)

7

with significant population coverage, (g) having strong binding affinity with common human

8

allele and (h) have no similarity with the human proteins. Therefore, only those CTLs, HTLs and

9

B-cell epitope were further selected which passed all the eight above parameters to construct

10

SARS-CoV-2 MEV. To boost the immune response an adjuvant was attached with the first CTL

11

epitope with the EAAAK linker, while other epitopes were connected using AAY and GPGPG

12

linkers to preserve their independent immunogenic activities after their inter-interaction

13

compatibility validation using HADDOCK Guru interface [52].

14

2.3.1. Immunogenic and physicochemical properties evaluation of the vaccine construct

15

The vaccine construct should be stable, antigenic and non-allergic. The ProtParam tool [53] was

16

used to evaluate the physicochemical properties of MEV. It analyzes different physical and

17

chemical features of proteins including grand average hydropathy, half-life, stability/instability

18

index, theoretical pI, aliphatic index hydropathy and half-life. The MEV properties were further

19

verified using VaxiJen 2.0 and AllerTOP V2.0 servers [54]. Moreover, PSIPRED was used to

20

analysed the secondary structure of MEV [55].

21

2.3.2. Tertiary structure prediction of vaccine construct

22

As vaccine construct is combination of different epitopes, therefore, the RaptorX server was used

23

to develop MEV 3D tertiary structure. The RaptorX server use a multi-template threading

24

approach to determine the tertiary structure of query protein [34].

25

2.3.3. Refinement and validation of vaccine construct

26

Galaxy Refine server MD simulation approach was used to refine the MEV predicted 3D

27

structure [56]. To verify refined MEV structure quality, Ramachandran plot analysis was

performed using RAMPAGE server [57], followed by structural validation analysis using

2

ProSA-web server [58]. The quality scores outside the normal range of natural proteins during

3

structure validation process reveal potential defects in the protein structure model. Therefore,

4

ERRAT server was further used to evaluate the statistics of non-bonded interactions in MEV

5

construct [59]. Furthermore, MEV structural flexibility was also analysed using CABS-Flex 2.0

6

server [60]. The flexibility of vaccine is an important aspect for its functionating, and CABS-

7

Flex server provides a detail overview of flexibility and stability of query protein by simulating

8

its residues [61].

9

2.3.4. Immunogenicity evaluation of the vaccine construct

10

An in silico immune simulation was performed using C-ImmSim 10.1 server [62], in order to

11

validate immunological response of constructed MEV. This server simulates the three major

12

functional mamal system components (bone marrow, thymus and lymph node) [62]. The MEV

13

has been tested for the ability to simulate various types of immune cells such as HTL, CTL, B-

14

cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, Immunoglobulins and cytokines. Clinically the minimum

15

recommended interval between two doses of vaccines is four weeks [24, 41, 63, 64].

16

Consequently, three injections (each injection contain a thousand units of MEV) were

17

administered using C-ImmSim immunostimulatory, with the recommended interval of four

18

weeks (1, 84 and 168 time-steps parameters were set as 1 time-step is equal to eight hours of real

19

life) for a total of 1000 steps of simulation. Other parameters were kept as default.

20

2.4. Molecular docking of vaccine construct with human immune receptor

21

The host produces an efficient immune response if an antigen / vaccine interacts properly with

22

the target immune cells. Therefore, molecular docking analysis was performed to analyse

23

integrations between the MEV and the human immune receptors. TLR3 and TLR8 have been

24

extensively studied and studies found their vital roles in the generation of antiviral immune

25

response. HADDOCK was used for the MEV docking with TLR3 (PDB ID: 1ZIW) and TLR8

26

(PDB ID: 3W3 G). To visualize the docked complex and draw figures, the PyMOL

27

educational version was used [51]. In addition, the online database PDBsum was used to

28

demonstrate the interacting residues of docked complexes [65].

2.5. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis of vaccine construct and receptors complexes

2

MD simulation is an important approach to analyse the stability of the receptor-ligand complex

3

[41, 66]. Complexes of MEV with TLR3 and TLR8 were simulated at 20 ns using GROMACS

4

5.1.4 [67] by following the same protocol of our previously published studies [5, 49, 68]. The

5

trajectories were saved for each complex after every 2 fs and root mean square deviation

6

(RMSD) and root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) analysis were performed using GROMCAS

7

tools.

8

2.6. Codon optimization and in silico cloning

9

Codon adaptation is a way of increasing the translation efficacy of external genes in the host if

10

the use of codon in both species varies. After carefully evaluating MEV properties and immune

11

response, finally its codon optimization was performed followed by in silico cloning. The Java

12

Codon Adaptation Tool (JCAT) server [69] was used for codon optimization of MEV to make it

13

compatible with widely used prokaryotic expression system; E. coli K12 [70]. The available

14

additional options were selected to evade (a) rho-independent transcription termination, (b)

15

prokaryote ribosome binding site and (c) restriction enzymes cleavage sites. The GC (guanine

16

and cytosine) contents together with codon adaptation index (CAI) [71] were evaluated.

17

Furthermore, to facilitate restriction and cloning, sticky ends restriction sites of XhoI and HindIII

18

restriction enzymes were introduced at the start/N-terminal and end/C-terminal of the optimized

19

MEV sequence, respectively. Finally, the adapted nucleotide sequence of MEV was cloned into

20

the E. Coli pET28a(+) vector with SnapGene 4.2 tool (https:/snapgene.com/) to ensure the in

21

vitro expression.

ORF6 [QHD43420.1], ORF7a [QHD443421.1], ORF8 [QHD43422.1], N [QHD43423.2] and

ORF10 [QHI42199.1]) were retrieved and saved in FASTA format. Vaxijen server was used to

28

check the antigenicity of proteins. Total 7 highly antigenic proteins were detected. The most

1

antigenic protein found was ORF10, followed by E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, and N, with

2

antigenic values 0.7185, 0.6502, 0.6441, 0.6131, 0.6025, 0.5102 and 0.5059 respectively. ORF1,

3

S, and ORF3 proteins had antigenic values less than 0.5, therefore they were excluded from

4

further analysis. Among selected 7 highly antigenic SARS-CoV-2 proteins for further analysis, 5

5

were non-structural proteins (M, N, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF10) and 2 were structural proteins

6

(E, ORF8). Other physicochemical characteristics of selected proteins including theoretical pi,

7

molecular weight, half-life, stability profile, aliphatic index, etc were analysed using ProtParam

8

server (Supplementary Table 1) and their secondary structures was predicted using SOPMA tool

9

(Supplementary Table 2).

10

The 3D models of selected proteins tertiary structures were predicted using Swiss model tool

11

and Raptor X tool, and in order to select best quality models, predicted structures were further

12

refined by galaxy refine server followed by Ramachandran plot validation. The most of

13

structures predicted using Swiss model were of better quality than Raptor X predicted structures,

14

except for N and Orf7a proteins. Therefore, good quality models were selected for further

15

analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). There was no suitable structure predicted for ORF10 because

16

of small number of residues. So, its structure was predicted by PEPFOLD server [48]

17

(Supplementary Table 3).

18

3.2. Prediction of B-cell, T-cell and IFN- γ inducing epitopes

19

Screened out B-cell epitopes were 100% conserved in all protein sequences and ere highly

20

antigenic. All the target proteins were predicted to have a total 55 linear epitopes (E-4, M-12,

21

ORF6-1, ORF7a- 6, ORF8-9, N- 22, and ORF10-1) (Supplementary Table 4). Moreover, a total

22

of 24 (E-4, M-2, ORF6-3, ORF7a- 4, ORF8-4, NC- 4, and ORF10-3) conformational epitopes

23

were predicted in all target proteins (Supplementary Table 5).

24

As mentioned before, epitopes that can bind to multiple alleles because of their strong

25

defense capabilities are considered the most appropriate epitopes. Therefore, total 31 MHC class

26

I (E-9, M-4, ORF6-2, ORF7a-3, ORF8-7, N-4, ORF10-2) (Supplementary Table 6) and 40 MHC

27

class II (E-4, M-5, ORF6-4, ORF7a-7, ORF8-12, N-4, ORF10-4) epitopes, 100% conserved

28

among target protein sequences and highly antigenic were chosen for further study

29

(Supplementary Table 7).

inducing epitopes from target proteins (E-67, M-214, ORF6-53, ORF7a-100, ORF8-113, N-411,

5

ORF10-30) were obtained (Supplementary Table 8).

3.3. Interaction analysis of epitopes with HLA-B7 allele

7

As stated before, to construct a sub-unit vaccine, the chosen epitopes should be 100% conserved,

8

overlapping and antigenic. Therefore, total 50 conserved/antigenic epitopes from selected

9

proteins overlapping in all 3 categories (B-cell, T-cell and IFN-γ) were selected for further

10

validation of their interactions with a common human allele. The 3D structures of selected

11

epitopes were predicted using PEPFOLD. The binding patterns of selected epitopes with a

12

common conserved allele HLA-B7 were analyzed through molecular docking and it was found

13

that only 27 epitopes bind deep inside in the HLA-B7 binding pocket (Supplementary Figure 2-

14

3). Each bound epitope to HLA-B7 depict stronger than -10.00 Kcal/mol docking affinity.

15

Docking binding energy scores together with their detail information is mentioned in Table 1.

16

All the 27 selected epitopes ensured their binding efficiency as well as their suitability to be used

17

in multiple epitope-based vaccine construct.

3.4. Population coverage

2

The distribution and expression of HLA alleles vary by ethnic groups and regions of the world.

3

Therefore, it affects the successful development of an epitope-based vaccine. The IEDB

4

population tool was used to check the population coverage of selected epitopes and their

5

suitability for vaccine construct. Selected epitopes showed the 99.29% world population

6

coverage. The highest coverage of population found within a country Sweden 99.79%. The

7

population coverage for worst COVID-19 hit countries; China, Italy, Spain and Singapore were

8

84.51%, 96.59%, 99.26% and 85.23%, respectively (Figure 2). Likewise, significant population

9

coverage was identified for other seriously affected countries with SARS-CoV-2 including

10

Australia, USA and France. The result suggested that our MEV could help to combat against

11

COVID-19 in most of the regions round the globe.

3.5. Construction of multiepitope based vaccine

2

All 27 selected epitopes (E-2, M-15, ORF6-2, ORF7a-4, ORF8-7, N-5, ORF10-2) were validated

3

for their inter-interactions and further used to develop an MEV construct. An adjuvant (45 amino

4

acid long β-defensin) was linked with the help of EAAAK linker at the start (to the N-terminal of

5

the MEV). EAAAK linker reduce interaction with other protein regions with efficient separation

6

and increase stability [73, 74]. The vaccine's immunogenicity may increase with an adjuvant.

7

Epitopes were merge together based on their interaction’s compatibility in sequential manner

8

with AAY and GPGPG linkers respectively. AAY and GPGPG prevents the generation of

9

junctional epitopes, which is a major concern in the design of multiepitope vaccines; On the

10

other hand, they facilitates the immunization and presentation of epitopes [75, 76]. The final

11

vaccine construct comprises 505 amino acid residues (Figure 3).

3.6. Evaluation of multiepitope based vaccine

2

First, Blast-p analysis was performed against Homo sapiens proteome with default parameters to

3

validate that MEV is non-homologous. Protein with less than 37% identity generally considered

4

as non-homologous protein. However, MEV showed no similarity (higher or equal to 37%) with

5

the human proteins.

6

Next, allergenicity, antigenicity and toxicity of the vaccine construct were evaluated.

7

Results described that MEV is highly antigenic (0.6741 at 0.5% threshold), non-allergenic and

8

non-toxic.

9

Further, the physiochemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 MEV construct were

10

determined using Protparam. It contains 505 amino acids with 55426.35 KDa molecular weight,

11

indicating good antigenic nature. The isoelectric point (PI) of MEV was 9.12 which show its

12

negative. Negatively charged MEV showed the value of isoelectric point (pI) less than 7. MEV

13

was categorized as stable as instability index computed by the Protparam was 33.41. The

14

aliphatic index was 82.75, which represents the idea of the proportional volume of the aliphatic

15

side chains. The protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.105, indicating the hydrophobic

16

nature of the MEV. Total time taken for a protein to disappear after it has been synthesized in

17

cell depicted as the half-life of the protein which was computed as > 20 h for yeast, 30 h for

18

mammalian-reticulocytes and > 10 h for Escherichia coli.

20

21

3.7. Structural analysis of multiepitope based vaccine

22

Secondary structure of MEV was predicted by PSIPRED. Among the 505 amino acids, the

23

formation of α-helix is comprised of 176 amino acids representing 35.20%, 109 amino acids in

24

β-strands representing 21.59% and 215 amino acids forms the coils which are 42.58% of the

25

whole MEV construct (Supplementary Figure 4).

MEV computed formula wa

26

To determine the tertiary structure of vaccine RaptorX server was used. Structure was refined

27

by Galaxy refine server (Figure 4). The improved model depicted that 95% amino acids are in

28

revealed qRMSD is 0.428, poor rotamers are 0%, MolProbity is 1.889, clash score is 13.6, and Z

3

score is −2.25 Z. In addition, the refined model showed 0 errors with PROCHECK validation.

4

The refined model score was 85.7143 in quality check analysis through ERRAT. These results

2

high flexibility and endorse it as a potential vaccine construct (Supplementary Figure 5B).

3.8. Prediction of B-cell epitopes in multiepitope based vaccine

4

B-lymphocytes besides secreting cytokines, also produce antigens, which in return provide

5

humoral immunity [77]. Therefore, MEV ideally should have B-cell epitopes with its domains.

6

Three conformational/discontinuous and 92 linear/continuous B-cell epitopes from the MEV

7

were predicted without altering the prediction parameters of Ellipro and ABCPred 2.0

8

(Supplementary Tables 9-10).

3.9. Immunogenicity evaluation of multiepitope based vaccine

10

The in silico immune system simulation against MEV showed significant activity of B-cells and

11

T-cells, which was consistent with the actual immune responses. Primary immune response was

12

observed with the increased levels of IgM in the start. Later, secondary and tertiary immune

13

responses were observed comparitively higher than the primary response. The immunoglobulin

14

activity (i.e., IgG1 + IgG2, IgM, and IgG + IgM antibodies) was normally at high levels with a

15

consistent decrease in MEV concentration. The high levels of triggered B-cells and memory B-

16

cell formation was observed, that is indicator of an effective long-lasting immune response

17

produced by the MEV (Figure 5A-D). Similarly, higher levels of HTL and CTL as well as

18

development of memory Th and Tc were observed which is vital for triggering the immune

19

response (Figure 5E-H). The significant levels of T regulatory cells and the continuous and

20

increased proliferation of macrophages and dendritic cells were observed during introduction of

21

MEV. The higher levels of cytokines like IL-2, and IFN-γ were also observed (Figure I-L).

22

These observations indicated the generation of promising antiviral response by the proposed

23

MEV construct.

3.10. Molecular docking of multiepitope based vaccine with TLR3 and TLR8

9

An appropriate association between immune receptor molecules and the antigen molecule is

10

essential to activate an immune responsiveness. HADDOCK server has thus been used to

11

perform the docking of the MEV with human immune receptors TLR3 and TLR8. TLR3 and

12

TLR8 can efficiently induce the immune response after virus recognition. The docking analysis

13

showed good interactions between the MEV and TLR3/TLR8. The binding scores of MEV-

14

TLR3 and MEV-TLR8 were -293.90 Kcal/mol and -283.20 Kcal/mol, respectively. TLR3 is

15

shown in the orange color, while the MEV is shown in the blue color, respectively, in Figure 6A.

16

It was observed that MEV made 11 hydrogen bond interactions within range of 3.00 Å with

17

3.11. MD simulation of TLR3-MEV and TLR8-MEV complexes

12

MD simulation is a common approach used to analyse the micro-interactions between

13

ligand/vaccine and protein/receptor structures [66, 78]. In order to further assess MEV dynamics

14

and stability, its docking complexes with TLR3 and TLR8 were simulated by 20 ns MD followed

15

by Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) and Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF)

analysis. The values of RMSD of backbone atoms were computed to monitor the structural

2

stability of MEV and immune receptor complexes (Figure 8A). The RMSD average values for

3

both complexes TLR3-MEV and TLR8-MEV are 4.5 ± 0.02 Å and 5.6 ± 0.02 Å, respectively.

4

There were no significant variations noticed in both docked complexes. Both the systems remain

5

stable throughout 20 ns simulation. To further compute, the residual and side-chain flexibility,

6

RMSF over 20 ns time were computed. Little fluctuations at the terminal constituent residues of

7

both complexes were observed, while middle residues depicted stable behavior with an average

8

1.5 ± 0.02 Å RMSF (Figure 8B). In general, both complexes were stable without obvious

9

fluctuations. These results validate the docking interaction analysis and endorsed that MEV can

10

strongly bind with immune receptors to generate significant immune response against SARS-

11

CoV-2.

3.12. In silico cloning

19

In silico cloning was performed to ensure expression of SARS-CoV-2 derived MEV in

20

commonly used E. coli host. First, codons of MEV construct were adapted as per codon usage of

21

E. coli expression system. JCAT server was used to optimize the MEV codons according to E.

22

coli (strain K12). The optimized MEV construct contained 1515 nucleotides (Supplementary

23

4. Discussion

2

Vaccination has many useful effects for improving people health at a low-cost and best aid to

3

inhibit transmission of diseases around the world. However, the development and production of

4

the vaccine is labour-intensive and costly. Immunoinformatics approaches can reduce this

5

burden. Today researchers are searching methods for the development of subunit vaccines from

6

complete genome/proteome of pathogens [79]. Epitope prediction for antibodies becomes more

7

significant with the advancement of the computational tools for designing a vaccine [80]. In the

8

field of bioinformatics, Immuno-informatics is a sub-branch that includes a lot of tools &

9

databases. Immunological datasets prediction and in silico analysis are done with the help of

10

those tools. With the advancement of tools and a variety of data availability like genomic,

11

proteomic, and different algorithms made it more effective for scientists to accurately predict

12

epitopes that are much effective in the development of the sub-unit vaccines [12, 13, 81].

13

An outbreak of SARS-COV-2 in late December 2019 that later turned into a global

14

pandemic resulted in thousands of deaths around the globe [6]. After the outbreak, remarkable

15

progress has been made towards the structural genomics, proteomics and drug repurposing

16

against the SARS-CoV-2, yet there is no exact cure has been identified for COVID-19. Till date,

17

no effective vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccine need to be

18

designed so that global pandemic situation could be controlled effectively.

19

The recent study was conducted to design a multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against

20

SARS-COV-2 by using immunoinformatics and in silico approaches. MEV is advantageous

21

compared to monovalent vaccine because it can elicit humoral, innate and cellular immunity

22

responses together [82]. Three different studies have been reported yet, which reported lists of

23

potential epitopes using Surface glycoprotein, Envelope protein, and Membrane glycoprotein

24

[10, 47]. However, no other sub-unit vaccine construct has been reported against SARS-CoV-2

25

to date. The current MEV construct is therefore is very important to curb COVID-19. Amino

26

acid sequences of ten proteins of SARS-COV-2 were taken from Genbank and their antigenicity

27

was checked. Highly antigenic proteins were selected for further analysis. After the complete

28

physiochemical analysis of antigenic proteins, B-cell, T-cell and IFN-γ inducing epitopes were

29

predicted. Antigenic and overlapped T-cell epitopes with B-cells and IFN-γ epitopes were further

validated using molecular docking with HLA-B7 allele and their population coverage was

2

estimated. Finally, MEV was designed with the help of linkers and adjuvant. An adjuvant was

3

added to the N-terminal of the MEV and epitopes were linked with the help of AAY and GPGPG

4

linkers. Adjuvant was added to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine [83]. Linkers were

5

added to help maintain the function of each epitope so that after being imported into the human

6

body they can function independently/properly [35, 84].

7

MEV was found to be highly antigenic, immunogenic, non-toxic and non-allergenic

8

indicating an epitope-based vaccine’s potential to cause robust immune responses. During in

9

silico immunological validation analysis, higher B and T-cell activity was observed that is

10

rationally identical with typical immune responses. B and T-cell memory formation was evident,

11

and results depicted it last for several months. Molecular docking analysis followed by MD

12

simulation revealed that the MEV is potentially able to properly/firmly occupy the TLR3/TLR8

13

receptors with minimal energy. Furthermore, the expression of MEV construct inside the host E.

14

coli K12 was improved through codon optimization. The results of recent study suggest that the

15

MEV being designed is a potential candidate to undergo in vivo and in vitro experimental

16

analysis to develop a potential vaccine against COVID-19.

17

5. Conclusion

18

Recent global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 claimed hundreds of precious lives in various regions

19

of the world and crumble the economies of several countries. There is no drug or vaccine

20

reported against SARS-CoV-2 yet. Few antiviral drugs and vaccines are in clinical trials, but

21

none have yet been declared as clinically approved anti-COVID-19 therapeutic. In this study, a

22

successful

23

Immunoinformatics and in silico approaches were used to develop a potential and safe MEV that

24

could trigger three types of the immune responses: humoral, innate and cellular. A highly

25

immunogenic, safe, stable and strongly interacting with human receptors, MEV has been

26

reported in present study that could be a potential candidate for vaccine production. However,

27

current research is the result of an integrated vaccinomics approach. Therefore, further

28

experimental research by the vaccinologists is required to demonstrate the efficacy of the

29

designed vaccine.
