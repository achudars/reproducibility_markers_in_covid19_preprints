Abstract: the recent epidemic outbreak of a novel human coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and
causing the respiratory tract disease COVID-19 has reached worldwide resonance and a global
effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this
virus. In this paper, we set out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2/host receptor recognition, a crucial
factor for successful virus infection. Based on the current knowledge of the interactome between
SARS-CoV-2 and host cell proteins, we performed Master Regulator Analysis to detect which parts
of the human interactome are most affected by the infection. We detected, amongst others, affected
apoptotic and mitochondrial mechanisms, and a downregulation of the ACE2 protein receptor,
notions that can be used to develop specific therapies against this new virus.

1. Introduction
Beta-coronaviruses are a subgroup of the coronavirus family, large enveloped positive-stranded
RNA viruses able to infect a wide variety of mammals and avian species, causing mainly respiratory
or enteric diseases [1]. They present surface spikes formed by (S) glycoproteins which mediate
binding to susceptible host cell receptors to initiate the infection [2]. To date, seven betacoronaviruses are known to cause human disease. The prevalent strains (HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63
and OC43) typically cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract in humans [3], while three
strains were found to pose a severe health threat, leading in some cases to a fatal outcome: SARSCoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 [4]. SARS-CoV was recognized as the causal
agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak occurring in China in 2002 and 2003 [5],
while MERS-CoV was responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome occurring in 2012 [6].
In both cases, the infected patients manifested severe acute pneumonia, but while SARS-CoV
infected mainly the lower respiratory tract, MERS-CoV caused more pronounced gastrointestinal
symptoms, often associated with kidney failure [7]. This can be possibly explained by a difference
in recognition of host surface receptors. While the primary human receptor for SARS S
glycoprotein is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely expressed on the
surface of the cells in the lower respiratory tract, MERS-CoV preferentially binds to surface enzyme
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26), which is present both in the lower respiratory
tract as well as kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract [8–10]. This distribution may also explain the
observed difference in transmission of the two viruses [7]. The third highly pathogenic strain of
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [11].
It is a highly aggressive new coronavirus which has infected more than 83,000 people (at February
29), with an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% [12]. In less than two months, the SARS-CoV-2

outbreak spread from the Hubei Province to 26 other countries, reaching also the US and Europe,
being Italy the European country with the highest number of patients tested positive for the new
coronavirus [13]. Given the emergency, the characterization of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and
features of virus-host interactions is demanding to identify candidate molecules to inhibit viral
functions. Sequence similarity of new coronavirus with SARS and MERS was previously reported
and close similarities with wild bat coronaviruses has been reported [14]. New coronavirus spike
S glycoprotein sequence shares a sequence identity above 72% with human SARS, showing a
unique furin-like cleavage site which is a feature absent in the other SARS-like CoVs [15].
Biophysical and structural evidence that new SARS-CoV-2 may bind ACE2 receptor with higher
affinity than SARS-CoV has been recently reported [9]. The wide distribution and similarity of this
receptor in the animal kingdom may account for cross-species transmission [16], while the pattern
of expression of ACE2 in human respiratory epithelia and oral mucosa may explain the fast humanhuman transmission [17].
Despite the crucial need for a clinical strategy to counteract this epidemiological outbreak, no
specific drug has been identified yet. This will require the elucidation of genetic features, molecular
constituents and mechanisms of infection, which ultimately reside in the mechanisms regulating
virus-host interaction and host responses. However, there is a lack of molecular data describing
the COVID-19, and those available are related to the genomic and protein sequence of this virus
[14] and there is currently no high-throughput dataset describing the mechanism of infection, e.g.
transcriptomics of infected lung cells.
In this context, the use of bioinformatics approaches may help filling the gap of missing data and
improve the process of knowledge discovery by elucidating molecular mechanisms behind virus
replication, the process of viral attachment to the host cells and the effect on the host molecular
pathways [18]. The final understanding of the molecular action of the virus may improve or
accelerate the development of anti-viral therapeutic approaches using information and data
available for other coronaviruses [19].
Here, we applied a network approach to investigate cellular responses to the interaction of human
cells with SARS and MERS viruses to get more insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating
susceptibility to infection and transmission. The analysis of cell-context specific repertoires of
molecular interactions, or interactomes, are becoming increasingly useful to dissect molecular
pathways and biological processes, because they offer the possibility to get a comprehensive
overview of cellular regulatory programs [20]. Integration of interactome maps to gene-regulatory
networks (i.e. topological maps representing relationships between transcription factors and their
target genes), can better provide insights into critical cellular elements that regulate a certain
phenotypic state or response [21]. It has been observed that a number of large-scale
transcriptional cascades behind complex cellular processes can be explained by the action of a
relatively small number of transcription factors, or Master Regulators [22–24]. The identification
of most crucial factors governing a determined phenotypic state is known as Master Regulator
Analysis (MRA) [25]. In this study, we set out to apply an integrated network approach combining
protein interactions and transcriptional networks to identify Master Regulators of coronavirus
infections in human airway cells, in the hope of shedding more light on the virus/host interaction
mechanism and also on the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2.
2. Materials and Methods
Interactome model for SARS-CoV-2/human cell interaction

We obtained a recently generated interactome of all the physical interactions between SARS-CoV2 and human proteins based on the work by Korkin and colleagues [26]. In brief, the interactome
contains both virus-virus and virus-host protein-protein interactions based on structural
interaction modeling and established experimental knowledge. The resulting interactome consists
of 125 proteins (31 viral proteins and 94 human host proteins) and 200 unique interactions. The
interactome is available at http://korkinlab.org/wuhan.
Coexpression-based lung network
Coexpression-based networks were generated using the corto algorithm with default parameters,
freely available on the CRAN repository of R packages [27], using the SARS-CoV-2/human
interactome proteins derived from [26] and the largest human Lung RNA-Seq dataset available
from the GTEX consortium, generated from 427 patients gene expression profiles [28]. In brief,
corto calculates a coexpression network for each protein and then removes indirect interactions
using Data Processing Inequality [29], which has been shown to provide a more robust readout of
single protein abundance alone [30].
Datasets of MERS and SARS infection
We obtained two datasets describing transcriptome-wide effects of coronavirus infection of
human cultured 2B4 bronchial epithelial cells. The first dataset (available as ArrayExpress [31]
dataset E-GEOD-17400) measured SARS-CoV infection using the microarray platform Affymetrix
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 [32], producing 9 infected samples and 9 mock samples. The dataset
was normalized using RMA [33] and probeset mapping was performed using the most updated
annotation from CustomCDF v24.0.0 [34]. The second dataset (available as ArrayExpress dataset
E-GEOD-56677) measured gene expression upon MERS-CoV infection using Agilent-039494
SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K microarrays [35] and contained 18 infected samples and 15
mock samples.
Master Regulator Analysis
Master Regulator Analyses were performed by comparing infected and mock samples in both
MERS and SARS datasets separately with the corto algorithm [27] using default parameters and
the coexpression network derived from human Lung samples. In brief, a gene-by-gene signature
of viral-induced differential expression is generated, and a combined value for each coexpression
network is generated by weighting every gene’s likelihood in the network, providing a final
Normalized Enrichment Score for each human/SARS-nCoV-2 interactome member, which is
positive if the network is upregulated by the infection, and negative if it’s downregulated, as in
[36].
BLAST
Pairwise protein identity and coverage was calculated using BLAST protein v2.6.0 [20] with
BLOSUM62 matrix and default parameters. Nucleotide sequence identity and coverage were
calculated using BLAST nucleotide v2.6.0 [20].
Phylogenetic Analysis

201 genome sequences were obtained from Gisaid and Genbank. Specifically, we obtained 8
pangolin coronavirus sequences, 6 bat coronavirus sequences, 6 SARS coronavirus sequences, 3
MERS coronavirus sequences and all 177 SARS-nCoV-2 genome sequences available on 25
February 2020. A full description of all Gisaid sequences is available at Supplementary Table S1.
To obtain the pangolin virus sequence PRJNA573298 we performed a deeper data mining analysis.
FASTQ sequences were retrieved from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using SRA-toolkit v2.9.61 [37] using project PRJNA573298 run ids SRR10168377 and SRR10168378, which provided a
DNA readout of the pangolin viral metagenome [38]. Reads were mapped over the reference 2019nCoV genome NC_045512.2 using Hisat2 v2.1.0 [39] with default parameters (with option --nospliced-alignment). Environment programs were samtools v1.9 and bedtools v 2.26.0. Genome
assembly of the virus genome-mapping reads was performed using Abyss v 2.1.5 with default
parameters [40].
Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of all 201 genomic sequences was performed using MUSCLE
v3.8.31 [41] and is available in FASTA format as Supplementary File S1. MSA visualization was
generated via Jalview v 2.11.0 [42]. Phylogenetic model generation and tree visualization was done
using MEGAX v 10.1.7 [43], using the Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model [44].
The tree structure was validated by running the analysis on 100 bootstrapped input datasets [45].
Branching points with bootstrap validation below 30% were collapsed. The tree in Figure 4
collapsed the SARS-nCoV-2 subtree, but a full tree is available at Supplementary Figure S1.
3D structural analysis
The protein structure representation has been produced with Chimera v1.14 [46] based on Protein
Data Bank structure id 1R42 [47].
3. Results
3.1 Human/COVID-19 interactome response to coronavirus infection
We obtained the most up-to-date specific SARS-CoV-2/human interactome from [26]. This
network, which we represent in Figure 1, highlights the complex interaction between the 31 viral
proteins (coded by a surprisingly compact genome of only 30kb) and 94 human proteins, ranging
from surface reenzymes (ACE2) to RNA-processing proteins (DDX5) to mitochondrial constituents
(BCL2). In order to understand how this interactome is functionally affected by the viral infection,
we obtained transcriptome wide microarray data depicting gene expression changes upon MERSCoV [35] and SARS-CoV [32] on human bronchial-derived 2B4 cells. We therefore performed
Master Regulator Analysis (MRA) [22] using a context-specific network model derived from the
largest available human Lung RNA-Seq dataset from GTEX [28]. This allowed us to have a robust
readout not only of the changes of the transcript of each protein-encoding human gene in the
interactome, but also of its proximal functional network [30]. Since transcriptomics data of SARSCoV-2 infection is not yet available, we reasoned that combining the SARS-CoV-2 specific
interactome with transcriptome-wide datasets from two viruses belonging to the same family
would provide a robust readout of the human cell response to this new virus.
The combined results of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection are depicted in Figure 1 using
Stouffer integration of the Normalized Enrichment Scores (NES) of both analyses. Individual MRAs
of beta-coronavirus infections are available in Figure 2 for MERS-CoV analysis (panel A) and SARSCoV analysis (panel B) for the 8 protein networks with the highest integrated NES. Figure 3 shows

the compared MRAs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and we decided to focus on the 8 proteins that
share the highest response similarity in both experiments, as they are more likely to be conserved
host responses to beta-coronavirus infection. Full results for all human interactome proteins are
available in Supplementary File S2, for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and both integrated by Stouffer
integration.
Our MRA results show a strong, shared upregulation of MCL1, a positive regulator of apoptosis
[48]. Apoptosis is a complex molecular cascade usually activated to eliminate unwanted cells in a
living organism, for example during development, and it can be self-initiated or induced by
immune system cells [49]. Also during virus attacks, induced cell death is a known mechanism to
get rid of infected cells: specifically, the activation of MCL1 in coronavirus infection has been
observed as an early host cell mechanism of antiviral defense [50]. It is therefore likely that the
host cell is able to sense the virus, perhaps even by the direct interaction between MCL1 and the
viral ORF7a (Figure 1), to start the apoptotic cascade and shut down both itself and the replicating
viruses. However, apoptosis has been reported to help the spreading of the virus by increasing
replication rates and virion release from the dying cell in avian coronaviruses [51].
We also report several concordantly human proteins down-regulated by beta-coronavirus
infections. One of these is EEF1A1 (Elongation factor 1-alpha 1), which is involved in tRNA delivery
to the ribosome, and is known to be activated upregulated upon inflammation [52]. This protein
has been shown to physically interact to proteins of several viral species, specifically hepatitis delta
[53] and avian reoviruses [54]; in the latter, knock-down of EEF1A1 has been shown to
significantly impair the virus infection cycle. Therefore, the downregulation of EEF1A1 could be
the result of an innate cell strategy to deprive SARS-CoV-2 of a key support for RNA replication.
Similar to EEF1A1, the NDUFA10 protein network is downregulated by viral infection. NDUFA10
is a member of the mitochondrial complex I [55]. This protein is known to be shut-down upon viral
infection of lung A549 cells by human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), a paramyxovirus, also
RNA-based [56]. The down-regulation of mitochondrial components in both coronaviruses and
paramyxoviruses shows the conservation of RNA viruses strategies to attack the host cell, which
passes through the disruption of mitochondria.
Another down-regulated network is centered around the T cell anergy-related E3 ubiquitin ligase
RNF128, also called GRAIL [57], which has been reported to provide positive reinforcement of
antiviral immune response to RNA viruses [58]. In this case, the inactivation of RNF128, which gets
physically bound by two viral nonstructural proteins, NSP7 and NSP13, could be a coronavirus
resistance mechanism against the cell innate defense.
MRA shows up-regulation (significant in MERS infection, not significant in SARS) of DDX5, DEADbox polypeptide 5, a prototypical member of the RNA helicase family. DDX5 plays multifunctional
roles involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism [59]. Since SARS-CoV-2, like all coronaviruses, is a
single strand RNA virus, it uses both its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and host proteins
to promote the replication of its genetic material. The up-regulation of DDX5 could be another
mechanism of viral-triggered cell activation, especially since this protein has been shown to
promote the infection capability of encephalitis flaviviruses [60], which are also RNA viruses.
It is important to note that all protein activities are calculated based on physiological coexpression
network models, but they are based on largely non-overlapping coexpressed genes, thanks to the
DPI step in the corto algorithm. This allows to identify complementary signatures and coresponding networks based on independent gene measurements.
3.2 ACE2: implications for coronavirus origin

Perhaps the most well-known human protein in relation with beta-coronavirus infection is ACE2
(Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2), a zinc metalloprotease able to hydrolize angiotensin I,
angiotensin II, apelin-13 and dynorphin A 1-13 and 7 additional small peptides [61]. ACE2 is
exploited by SARS-CoV as its cellular entrance, which is based on the initial interaction between
the viral S (spike) protein and ACE2 [62]. Given the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
sequences and symptoms it has been suggested that it is the main entry target for both viruses
[63]. Its down-regulation upon SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection could intuitively be an innate
cell defense mechanism to remove this extracellular marker to reduce the capability of the virus to
enter the host cell, while at the same time reducing the RNA metabolic machinery through EEF1A1
down-regulation. ACE2 is also targeted by the neuraminidase protein of influenza A virus [64].
However, the down-regulation of ACE2 has also be shown to be beneficial to viral infection, as it
can trigger lung injury and faster cell-to-cell virus spreading [65]. In influenza A (cause by
orthomyxoviruses, also RNA-based) high levels of ACE2 have in fact been correlated to increased
resistance to the infection [64]. So, like in apoptosis induction, the down-regulation of ACE2 could
be a SARS-CoV-2-induced mechanism, from which the virus gains in capability to spread faster by
damaging the host lung tissue.
Our analysis so far has shown effects on human proteins interacting SARS-CoV-2 based on SARSCoV and MERS-CoV signatures. We conjectured that proteins similarly affected by both infections
(like ACE2) could have a similar role in all beta-coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Our
analysis confirms previous reports [14] that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are indeed highly related to
SARS-CoV-2, with genome sequence identity of ~80%. However, these two human viruses are not
the most likely most direct ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, as highlighted by our phylogenetic analysis
(updated on 28-February-2020) based on several beta-coronaviruses (Figure 4). The evolutionary
history model shows that SARS and MERS viruses are more distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 than
wild beta-coronaviruses infecting bats and pangolins. Indeed, there has been an open debate
wether pangolins or bats have been the most direct culprits for the zoonotic origin of this virus
[66]. Our analysis shows that at least one bat beta-coronavirus sequence derived from the Gisaid
database (EPI_ISL_402131) appears to be the closest to the group of human SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
However, this is based on a low bootstrap tree branching confidence (37%), and we observed a
large quantity of pangolin beta-coronaviruses which are likely to be equidistant from the human
causes of COVID-19.
Based on our confirmation that ACE2 is an extremely important host protein for viral infection, we
set out to compare ACE2 sequences in both bats and pangolins, to detect the most similar sequence
to human ACE2. We obtained representative sequences from human ACE2 (NP_068576.1),
pangolin ACE2 (Manis javanica XP_017505752.1) and bat ACE2 (AGZ48803.1, from the species
Rhinolophus sinicus, being the closest species with a full protein sequence to Rhinolophus affinis,
where the closest bat_CoV was retrieved). These sequences appear to be conserved in these
species, having the exact same aminoacid length (805aa). The sequence identity between the
human and pangolin ACE2 is 84.76%, while the identity between human and bat ACE2 is lower:
80.60% (Figure 5 A). In Figure 5 B, we provide a visualization of the human ACE2 structure,
inferred via X-ray crystallography at 2.20 Å, one of the highest resolutions for this protein [67], and
highlighting all the residuals identical in human and pangolins, but different between humans and
bats. Finally, the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the proteins from the three mammals
reports the specific ACE2 aminoacids that differ between the species (Figure 5 C and
Supplementary Table S2). The higher similarity between human and pangolin ACE2 proteins could
support the hypothesis that pangolin is a better candidate for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.

4. Discussion
Our analysis integrates genome-wide and transcriptome-wide complementary network
information on SARS-CoV-2/human interaction to provide a map of host proteins affected by the
viral infection. Given the importance of finding new targets to effectively treat this new virus,
understanding the molecular effects of this virus on human proteins might be pivotal in prioritizing
pharmacological strategies. One of the SARS-CoV-2-interacting protein networks most downregulated by beta-coronaviruses in our analysis was ACE2, and in fact the administration of
recombinant ACE2 to compensate this protein loss has been shown to be effective in treating acute
respiratory distress syndrome, which is often caused by severe pulmonary infections [68]. This
recombinant ACE2, called APN-01, has been proposed as a potential cure for SARS-CoV-2 most
severe symptoms [69–71], which could be extremely helpful given the observed clinical inefficacy
of common antiviral drugs, like corticosteroids [72].
Another point of clinical intervention could be to down-regulate apoptotic mechanisms induced
by the virus, e.g. by our reported MCL1 activation upon both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
As we reported, this response is in agreement to previous findings discussing the involvement of
MCL1 upregulation in viral replication across many RNA-based viruses [50], possibly resulting
from protein synthesis impairment eliciting ER-stress-induced apoptosis via unfolded protein
response (UPR) [73]. Since beta-coronavirus-induced UPR has been shown to modulate innate
immunity [74], targeting aberrant monocytes/macrophages activation may be another possible
intervention strategy to reduce severity of coronavirus-induced symptomatology.
We also highlighted how mitochondrial proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 appear to be
downregulated in beta-coronavirus infections as a general viral mechanism to control host cell
metabolism and ultimately steering apoptosis [75]. The goal of preventing mitochondria-induced
apoptosis is shared by clinical strategies to slow neurodegenerative pathologies, mainly
Alzheimer’s disease, where mitochondrial dysfunctions are directly linked to neuronal death [76].
Our study highlights several other proteins that could be directly repressed or enhanced by specific
drugs. For example, a mildly virus-activated protein in our network is the serine/threonine kinase
MARK2 (Figure 1), which is one of the target of the drug Fostamatinib in the treatment of
Rheumatoid Arthritis and Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura [77]. Apart from drug repurposing
[78], the recent advances in drug discovery by virtual screening [79] give scientists the chance to
quickly develop novel molecules to specifically target not only viral proteins but also the human
proteins on whose interaction SARS-CoV-2 depends for infection and replication [80].
