ABSTRACT
There is a well-known and established link between high lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
levels in blood and the metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a risk factor for developing
severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we define
an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to
aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions
demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high
molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the
interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and
the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of
LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and cytokine responses in monocytic
THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized

inflammation, employing NF-κB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in
conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when
compared with S protein and LPS alone. Apart from providing information on LPS as
a ligand for S protein, our results are of relevance for studies on comorbidities involving
bacterial endotoxins, such as the MS, or co-existing acute and chronic infections in
COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that consist of
four structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein,
membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (1). Spike glycoprotein is the
most important surface protein of coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2, which can
mediate the entrance to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with the cell
surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (2). COVID-19 disease is
associated with a major inflammatory component. Increased cytokine and chemokine
production in response to virus infection has been the focus of several recent
investigations, and patient morbidity and mortality is mainly caused by the severe
systemic inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) affecting
these patients (3, 4) although differences in ARDS disease phenotypes are noticed
(5).
ARDS is a general systemic inflammatory reaction common for many disease states,
such as pneumonia, severe infection, sepsis, burns, or severe trauma. During ARDS,
activation of TLRs, such as TLR4 via LPS stimulation, induces an initial systemic proinflammatory phase characterized by a massive release of cytokines, acute phase
proteins and reactive oxygen species. Additionally, activation of proteolytic cascades,
like the coagulation and complement system, takes place in combination with impaired
fibrinolysis, and consumption of coagulation factors and other mediators (6-8). Clinical
symptoms of patients with ARDS therefore in many ways correspond to the
pathophysiology seen during severe COVID-19 disease. There is a well-known and
established link between high LPS levels in blood and MS (9), and obesity (10).
Moreover, recent evidence shows that patients with MS are at risk of developing
severe COVID-19 disease and ARDS. However, whether LPS plays a role in the
pathogenesis of COVID-19 per se is at present unknown.
The above clinical and pathogenetic clues prompted us to investigate possible
connections between LPS and S protein from a structural as well as functional
perspective. Using electrophoresis under native conditions as well as microscale
thermophoresis we indeed found that S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS. S protein
also boosted inflammatory responses when combined with low levels of LPS in
monocytic THP-1 cells as well as in human blood. In nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)
reporter mice, S protein significantly increased the inflammatory response in
conjunction with ultra-low, threshold levels of LPS.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence and endotoxin content
2019-nCoV full-length His-tagged S protein (R683A, R685A), composed of the S
sequence Val 16 - Pro 1213 was produced in HEK293 cells and 1 µg was analyzed on
SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue (Fig. S1A). The results
identified a major band of ~180-200 kDa. Although the protein has a predicted
molecular weight of 134.6 kDa, the result is compatible with the expected mass due to
glycosylation. Next, the band was cut off from the gel and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Fig.
S1B). 110 peptides covered 56% of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence, confirming
identity. Using a limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, the LPS content in the
recombinant S protein was determined to 30 fg/µg protein.

Studies on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and LPS
Native gel electrophoresis is used as a tool to assess structural differences in proteins,
but also alterations induced by binding to external ligands. We therefore decided to
study the migration of S protein alone, or in presence of increasing doses of
Escherichia coli LPS (Fig. 1A). Under the conditions used, S protein migrated at the
molecular mass range of 400-500 kDa. A second higher molecular 700-800 kDa band
of less intensity was however observed. Addition of increasing doses of LPS indeed
yielded a shift in the migration of S protein, with a reduction of particularly the 400-500
kDa band and an increase of high molecular weight material not entering the gel. Mass
spectrometry of the excised protein bands was then performed. The results verified
that the bands of 400-500 and 700-800 kDa were composed of S protein. S protein
was also identified in the high molecular weight fraction found in the samples incubated
with LPS (Fig. 1B). Analogously, microscale thermophoresis (MST), a highly sensitive
technique probing interactions between components in solution, demonstrated
interactions of fluorescence-labeled S protein with E. coli LPS, with a KD of 46.7 ± 19.7
nM (Fig. 1C). For control in these experiments, we used the well-known human LPSreceptor CD14, which exhibited a KD of 45.0 ± 24.3 nM to LPS. In order to gain more
information on the interaction specificity, we evaluated binding of S protein to the lipid
part of LPS, lipid A (Fig. S2A), as well as other microbial agonists (Fig. S2B). S protein
was found to interact with lipid A (Fig. S2A) and also LPS from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, whereas no shift in the migration was observed after addition of
lipoteichoic acid (LTA), peptidoglycan (PGN), or zymosan. Taken together, using two
independent methods probing molecular interactions, a binding of LPS to S protein

was identified. Notably, the affinity of LPS to S protein was in the range of the one
observed for LPS binding to the human receptor CD14.

Effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein on LPS-induced responses in vitro
LPS effects depend on specific interactions with components of innate immunity such
as LPS-binding protein (LBP), culminating in transfer of lipopolysaccharide from CD14
to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its co-receptor MD-2 on the cell surface, leading to
activation of downstream inflammatory responses (11). In order to probe whether the
presentation and hence, activity of LPS was altered by the interaction with S protein,
we decided to study the pro-inflammatory effects of S with or without LPS using THP1XBlue-CD14 cells. After 18–24 h of incubation, NF-κB/AP-1 activation and cell
metabolic activity was determined. In order to assess potential changes in the LPSresponse we used a low dose of LPS of 2.5 ng/ml, which is a dose that regularly yields
about 20-40% of the maximal response elicited by 100 ng/ml LPS. Addition of S protein
at increasing concentrations resulted in a gradual and significant increase in NFκB/AP-1 activation (Fig. 2A). It was also observed that S protein alone did not induce
any significant increase in NF-kB/AP-1 activation at the concentrations used. Of
relevance for the above is that the endogenous levels of LPS in the S preparation were
negligible, as they were in the order of 100-1000 lower than the threshold level required
for NF-κB activation. In general, patients with a systemic inflammatory response such
as seen in sepsis show increased levels of LPS in plasma, with levels ranging from 0.1
to 1 ng/ml (12). In order to mimic those LPS levels, we therefore determined the
response of the THP-1 cells to doses ranging from 0.25 ng/ml to 1 ng/ml LPS, with or
without the presence of 5 nM of S protein. It was observed that NF-κB activation was
significantly boosted even at those low doses of LPS. Notably, LPS at 0.25 ng/ml,
which alone did not induce a significant increase of NF-κB activation, yielded a
significant response together with S protein. It was also observed that LPS at doses of
0.5-1 ng/ml, combined with S protein, yielded response levels produced by 10 ng/ml
LPS (Fig. 2B). In these studies, cell viability was regularly measured by the MTT
assay, and no significant toxic effects were detected (Fig. 2A, B). Finally, using human
blood, we observed a similar increase of the LPS response. Again, particularly ultralow levels of LPS, 50 pg/ml, showed boosted TNF-a levels together with S protein (Fig.
2C). Taken together these results unequivocally demonstrate that S protein increases
LPS responses in vitro in monocytic cells and human blood, and in particular, that the
activation seen by low, threshold levels of LPS is boosted several-fold by the addition
of S protein.

Effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein on endotoxin responses in an experimental
mouse model
In an experimental animal model, we wanted to simulate a situation of localized
endotoxin induced inflammation. In previous models, we utilized doses of 100 µg LPS
injected subcutaneously, a dose level which yielded a robust and significant LPS
response (13). In this modified model, similar to the strategy described above on the
THP-1 cells, we employed low, threshold levels comprising 2 µg LPS which were
injected subcutaneously with or without 5 µg S protein. Using mice reporting NF-κB
activation, we indeed found that the addition of S protein significantly increased the
inflammatory response (Fig. 3). S alone at the dose of 5 µg did not yield any significant
inflammatory response. Apart from a strongly increased response by the LPS and S
combination, we also observed that the LPS-S protein mix resulted in a prolonged
inflammatory response. Taken together, the results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S
protein also retains its boosting effect in conjunction with LPS in a subcutaneous model
of endotoxin-driven inflammation.

Discussion
Here we demonstrate a previously unknown interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S
protein and LPS, leading to a boosting of pro-inflammatory actions in vitro as well as
in vivo. These results on the synergism between LPS and S protein are of clinical
importance, as this could give new insights in the comorbidities that may increase the
risk for severe COVID-19 disease and ARDS, and its pathogenetic steps.
As mentioned in the Introduction, the observed link between high LPS levels in blood
and the MS (9), and the fact that MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19
prompted this study (1). However, as summarized in Table 1, the clinical implications
may be broader and go beyond MS. Notable, in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), COVID-19 infection is associated with substantial severity
and mortality rates (14). Therefore, a causative link between LPS derived from
bacterial colonization and infection of the lungs in COPD patients and COVID-19
severity could also be proposed here. Related to this, is the finding that there is a
correlation between LPS levels and bacterial loads during pneumonia (15). Moreover,
compared to former and never smokers with COPD, current smokers are at greater
risk of severe COVID-19 complications and higher mortality rate (14), and intriguingly,

bacterial LPS is an active component of cigarette smoke (16). Increased endotoxin
levels are also observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (17). The
observations that all these comorbidities are risk factors for severe COVID-19 lend
further support for a pathogenetic link to SARS-CoV-2 infection and endotoxinemia,
Moreover, intriguingly, Kawasaki disease in children, which has been reported in
young COVID-19 patients (18) as well as in patients with SARS HCoV-NH (19) has
been linked to LPS as a trigger (20). Other possible comorbidities that should be
considered is periodontitis, where LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis and other
bacteria can reach the systemic circulation (21). Indeed, a recent hypothesis on this
matter has been raised (22). All these observations on links between LPS levels and
several diseases and conditions (Table 1), and the risk for developing severe COVID19 (1) implies that measurement of endotoxin levels in COVID-19 patients could have
significant diagnostic implications and be of relevance for patient management and
treatment decisions. Clearly, clinical prospective studies are mandated in order to
assess whether the findings from the present study can be translated to the clinical
setting.
Although the here disclosed binding of LPS to SARS-CoV-2 S protein is novel, the
interaction between S proteins and endotoxins is not necessarily new to nature.
Indeed, interactions between viruses and bacteria for the induction of severe
respiratory disease have been described since the early thirties (23). Obviously,
multiple complex and diverse inflammatory mechanisms may underlie this general
finding. However, it is worth noting that recent observations from porcine animal
models indeed demonstrated that infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus, a
highly prevalent virus in swine populations significantly sensitizes the lungs to LPS
(24). Notably, the effects of separate virus or LPS inoculation were subclinical and
failed to induce sustained cytokine levels, whereas the combination of the two agents
significantly triggered severe respiratory disease and enhanced particularly TNF-a
levels (25), findings indeed relevant in the light of the present results showing boosted
TNF-a levels in human blood with the combination of LPS and SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
In agreement with this, it is also worth noting that the disease denoted “Shipping fever”,
which affects cattle particularly in relation to stress and transports, can be triggered by
a combination of bovine respiratory corona virus (BCoV) and inhaled LPS (26).
The exact molecular mechanism underlying the observed boosting of inflammation by
SARS-CoV-2 S protein remains to be investigated. Clearly, MST analysis measuring

the interaction between S protein and LPS yielded a KD in the nM range, which
indicates a high-affinity binding. Moreover, electrophoresis under native conditions
confirmed the interaction, and also showed that higher molecular weight S protein
aggregates were formed upon this interaction. Notably, such aggregates were also
induced by lipid A, the core of the LPS molecule, common for endotoxin producing
bacteria. Previous reports indicate that both LPS and protein aggregates can be
proinflammatory (27, 28), and moreover, the well-known LPS-binding protein (LBP)
forms proinflammatory aggregates with LPS particularly at a high LPS/LBP ratio (29).
It is therefore possible that LPS-triggered oligomerization or aggregate formation by
SARS-CoV-2 S protein help explain the observed boosting of inflammation. In addition,
the observation that LPS showed a similar affinity to S protein as for CD14, implies
that S protein interference with the normal presentation and clearance of LPS induces
a dysfunctional inflammatory state.
In conclusion, we report a previously undisclosed interaction between the Spike protein
of SARS CoV-2 and LPS, and its link to induction of NF-κB and cytokine responses in
monocytes and human blood, as well as increased NF-κB responses in experimental
animal models. The interaction between S protein and LPS therefore provides a new
therapeutic target enabling development of drugs that can ameliorate the
hyperinflammation seen during COVID-19 infection.

Materials and Methods
Proteins
SARS-Cov-2 S protein was produced by ACROBiosystems (USA). The sequence
contains AA Val 16 - Pro 1213 (Accession # QHD43416.1 (R683A, R685A)). Briefly,
the 2019-nCoV Full Length S protein (R683A, R685A), His Tag (SPN-C52H4) was
expressed in human 293 cells (HEK293) and purified. The protein was lyophilized from
a 0.22 μm filtered solution in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.5. Lyophilized product
was reconstituted in endotoxin free water, aliquoted and stored at -80 °C according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The purity was >85%. Human His-Tag-CD14 (hCD14-his)
was produced recombinantly in insect cells by using the Baculovirus Expression Vector
System (BEVS). Since this construct is secreted, media was centrifuged in a JLA81000 rotor at 8000 g, 20 min, 4°C and then the supernatant was filtered with a PES
0.45 μm filter top (0.45 μm pore size). Subsequently hCD14-his was purified on a 5

mL HisTrap Excel column (GE Healthcare) by employing ÄKTA Pure system (GE
Healthcare). Eluted fractions were analyzed by precast SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad)
stained with BioSafe Coomassie (Bio-Rad) or subjected to Western blot. Peak
fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and digested with tobacco etch
virus (TEV) protease to remove the His-Tag. After TEV digestion, the protein solution
was run a second time on the His-Trap column. Fractions containing the protein were
collected, pooled and purified further on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 pg gel filtration
column. At the end of purification, the purity of hCD14 was estimated to >90%. The
protein was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C before use.
Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay
The content of endotoxin in 1 µg purified SARS-CoV-2 S protein was analyzed using
a commercially available PierceTM Chromogenic Endotoxin Quant Kit (Thermo-Fisher,
USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol with small modifications. In particular,
the standard curve was done with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli (Sigma, USA)
in the range between 0.01-10 pg/ml. All samples were prepared in endotoxin-free
tubes kept in a thermoblock set to 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, 150 µl of each
sample were transferred to 96-wells plates and analyzed for absorbance at 405 nm
using a spectrophotometer. Pyrogen-free water, used to dissolve the protein, was used
as negative control.
SDS-PAGE
1 µg of SARS-Cov-2 S protein was diluted in loading buffer and loaded on 10–20%
Novex Tricine pre-cast gel (Invitrogen, USA). The run was performed at 120 V for 1 h.
The gel was stained by using Coomassie Brilliant blue (Invitrogen, USA). The image
was obtained using a Gel Doc Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).
Blue Native (BN)-PAGE
2 µg of SARS-Cov-2 S protein were incubated with 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 mg/ml of E. coli
LPS or Lipid A for 30 min at 37 °C in 20 µL as final volume. At the end of the incubation
the samples were separated under native conditions on BN-PAGE (Native PAGE
BisTris Gels System 4–16%, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining. For Western blotting, the material
was subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo (BioRad, USA). Primary antibodies against the His-tag (1:2000, Invitrogen) were followed
by secondary HRP conjugated antibody (1:2000, Dako, Denmark), for detection of S

protein. The protein was visualized by incubating the membrane with SuperSignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Denmark) for 5 min
followed by detection using a ChemiDoc XRS Imager (Bio-Rad). In another set of
experiments, 2 µg of SARS-Cov-2 S protein were incubated with 0.25 mg/ml of LPS
and Lipid A from E. coli, LPS from P. aeruginosa, LTA and PGN from S. aureus, and
zymosan from S. cerevisiae. BN-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as
described above. LPS from E. coli and P. aeruginosa as well as Lipid A were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, whereas LTA, PGN and zymosan were purchased
from InvivoGen.

Mass Spectrometry analysis
After separation by SDS- or BN-PAGE and Coomassie staining, bands in the gels were
cut out and the digestion was performed according to Shevchenko et al. (30). Briefly
the gel pieces were washed with water, then with a mix of 50 mM ammonium carbonate
in 50% acetonitrile (ACN). Gel pieces were shrunk with 100% of acetonitrile and then
reduced with 10 mM DTT 30 min 56 °C. Alkylation was performed with 55 mM
idoacetamide at RT. 10 ng/µl of trypsin solution was added to cover the gel-pieces
placed on ice and after 1 hour the samples were placed at 37 °C and overnight
digestion was performed. The supernatant was acidified using 5% of formic acid and
then analyzed by MALDI MS or LC-MS/MS.
MALDI mass spectrometry analysis
For MALDI mass spectrometry analysis, digested SARS-CoV-2 S protein samples
were mixed with a solution of 0.5 mg/ml α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) 50%
ACN/0.1 % phosphoric acid solution directly on a stainless MALDI target plate.
Subsequent MS analysis was performed on a MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometer (ThermoScientific, Bremen, Germany). Full mass spectra were obtained
by using the FT analyser (Orbitrap) at 60,000 resolution (at m/z 400). Recording of
Mass spectra was performed in positive mode with a 800–4000 Da mass range. The
nitrogen laser was operated at 27 μJ with automatic gain control (AGC) off mode using
10 laser shots per position. Evaluation of the spectra was performed with Xcalibur v
2.0.7. software (from Thermo Fisher Scientific, San José, CA).
LC-MS/MS
The LC-MS/MS detection was performed on HFX orbitrap equipped with a Nanospray
Flex ion source and coupled with an Ultimate 3000 pump (Thermo Fischer Scientific).

Peptides were concentrated on an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 precolumn (75 μm x 2
cm, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and then were separated on an Acclaim PepMap
RSLC column (75 μm x 25 cm, nanoViper, C18, 2 μm, 100 Å) with heating at 45 °C for
both the columns. Solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80%
ACN) were used to create a nonlinear gradient to elute the peptides. For the gradient,
the percentage of solvent B increased from 4% to 10% in 20 min, increased to 30% in
18 min and then increased to 90% in 2 min and kept it for a further 8 min to wash the
columns.
The Orbitrap HFX instrument was operated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA)
mode. The peptides were introduced into mass spectrometer via stainless steel Nanobore emitter (OD 150 µm, ID 30 µm) with the spray voltage of 1.9 kV and the capillary
temperature was set 275 °C. Full MS survey scans from m/z 350-1600 with a resolution
1200,000 were performed in the Orbitrap detector. The automatic gain control (AGC)
target was set to 3 × 106 with an injecting time of 20 ms. The most intense ions (up to
20) with charge state 2-5 from the full scan MS were selected for fragmentation in
Orbitrap. MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole mass filter set to a width of
1.2 m/z. Precursors were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID) with a
collision energy of 27%. The resolution was set at 15000 and the values for the AGC
target and inject time were 2 × 103 and 60 ms, respectively for MS/MS scans. The
duration of dynamic exclusion was set 15 s and the mass tolerance window 10 ppm.
MS/MS data was acquired in centroid mode. MS/MS spectra were searched with
PEAKS (version 10) against UniProt Homo Sapiens (version 2020_02). A 10 ppm
precursor tolerance and 0.02 Da fragment tolerance were used as the MS settings.
Trypsin was selected as enzyme with one missed cleavage allowance, methionine
oxidation and deamidation of aspargine and glutamine were treated as dynamic
modification and carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification. Maximum
of post-translational modifications (PTM) per peptide was 2.
Microscale thermophoresis
Microscale thermophoresis (MST) was performed on a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115
apparatus (Nano Temper Technologies, Germany). 40 μg SARS-CoV-2 S protein and
100 μg of recombinant hCD14 were labeled by Monolith NT Protein labelling kit RED
– NHS (Nano Temper Technologies, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. 5 μl of 20 nM labeled SARS-CoV-2 S protein or 20 nM labeled hCD14 were
incubated with 5 μl of increasing concentrations of LPS (250–0.007 μM) in 10 mM Tris
pH 7.4. Then, samples were loaded into standard glass capillaries (Monolith NT

Capillaries, Nano Temper Technologies) and the MST analysis was performed
(settings for the light-emitting diode and infrared laser were 80%). Results shown are
mean values ± SD of six measurements.
NF-κB activation assay
THP1-XBlue-CD14 reporter cells (InvivoGen, San Diego, USA) were seeded in 96 well
plates in phenol red RPMI, supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS and 1%
(v/v) Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (180,000 cells/well). Cells were treated with 2.5
ng/ml LPS (Sigma, USA) with increasing concentrations (0.1-10 nM) of SARS-CoV-2
S protein or with 5 nM SARS-CoV-2 S protein with increasing concentrations of LPS
(0.25-1 ng/ml). Then, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. At the end of
incubation, the NF-κB activation was analyzed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (InvivoGen, San Diego, USA), i.e. by mixing 20 μl of supernatant with 180
μl of SEAP detection reagent (Quanti-BlueTM, InvivoGen), followed by absorbance
measurement at 600 nm. Data shown are mean values ± SEM obtained from at least
four independent experiments all performed in triplicate.

The cytotoxicity of the treatments was evaluated by adding 0.5 mM Thiazolyl Blue
Tetrazolium Bromide to the cells remaining from NF-κB activation assay. After 2 h of
incubation at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min and then the medium
was removed. Subsequently, the formazan salts were solubilized with 100 µl of 100 %
DMSO (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem). Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of
550 nm. Cell survival was expressed as percentage of viable cells in the presence of
different treatment compared with untreated cells. Lysed cells were used as positive
control. Data shown are mean values ± SD obtained from at least four independent
experiments all performed in triplicate.
Blood assay
Fresh venous blood was collected in the presence of lepirudin (50 mg/ml) from healthy
donors. The blood was diluted 1:4 in RPMI-1640-GlutaMAX-I (Gibco) and 1 ml of this
solution was transferred to 24-well plates and stimulated with 0.05 or 0.1 ng/ ml of LPS
in the presence or the absence of 5 nM of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. After 24 h incubation
at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the plate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 g and then the
supernatants were collected and stored at -80 °C before analysis. The experiment was
performed at least 4 times by using blood from different donors each time.

ELISA
The cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and
interleukin-6 (IL-6), were measured in human plasma obtained after the blood
experiment described above. The assay was performed by using human inflammation
DuoSetâ ELISA Kit (R&D Systems) specific for each cytokine, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm.
Data shown are mean values ± SEM obtained from at least four independent
experiments all performed in duplicate.

Mouse inflammation model
The immunomodulatory effects of 5 µg SARS-CoV-2 S protein in combination or not
with 2 µg LPS/mouse were tested employing BALB/c tg (NF-B-RE-Luc)-Xen reporter
mice (Taconic Biosciences, Albany, NY, USA, 10–12 weeks old). The dorsum of

the mouse was shaved carefully and cleaned. SARS-CoV-2 S protein was mixed
with LPS immediately before subcutaneous injection on the dorsums of the mice

anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA). Then the animals were
transferred to individually ventilated cages and imaged at 1, 3, and 6 h after the
injection. An In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS Spectrum, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was
used for the longitudinal determination of NF-κB activation. Fifteen minutes before
the IVIS imaging, mice were intraperitoneally given 100 µl of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg
body weight). Bioluminescence from the mice was detected and quantified using Living
Image 4.0 Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
Ethics statement
All animal experiments are performed according to Swedish Animal Welfare Act SFS
1988:534 and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Malmö/Lund,
Sweden.
Statistical analysis
All in vitro assays were repeated at least three times. Unless otherwise stated. Data
are presented as means ± SEM. Differences in the mean between two groups were
analyzed using Student’s t test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney test
otherwise. To compare means between more than two groups, a one-way ANOVA
with Dunnet or Holm-Sidak posttest were used. Statistical analysis, as indicated in

Figure 1. Analysis of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and LPS in
vitro. A) SARS-CoV-2 S protein was incubated with LPS (0-500 µg/ml), separated
using Blue Native gel electrophoresis and detected by Western blot. One
representative image of three independent experiments is shown (n=3). The marker
lane is from the same gel but not transferred to the membrane. It is aligned and
included for clarity. B) Gel pieces corresponding to the area denoted by the dotted red
squares on the Western blot were cut out, in gel digestion was performed and the
material was subjected to MALDI mass spectrometry analysis. Representative high
resolution MALDI mass spectra are presented. The most intense tryptic fragments
obtained from S protein are denoted with the sequence numbers, tryptic peptides from
the autodigestion of trypsin are denoted with T. C) Microscale thermophoresis assay
quantifying SARS-CoV-2 S protein interaction with LPS. CD14 was used as positive
control. KD constant for S protein = 46.7 ± 19.7 nM, CD14 = 45 ± 24.3 nM was
determined from MST analysis. Mean ± S.D. values of six measurements are shown
(n=6).

Figure 2. Effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein on LPS-induced responses in THP-1
cells. THP-1-XBlue-CD14 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of SARSCoV-2 S protein (0-10 nM) and a constant dose of LPS (2.5 ng/ml) (A) or with
increasing doses of LPS (0.25-1 ng/ml) and constant amount of S protein (5 nM) (B).
MTT viability assay for analysis of toxic effects of S protein and LPS on THP-1 cells is
shown in lower panels for A and B. C) Cytokine analysis of blood collected from healthy
