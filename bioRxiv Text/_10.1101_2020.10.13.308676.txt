Abstract

15

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a global public health crisis. Vital to the development of

16

informed treatments for this disease is a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions

17

involved in disease pathology. One lens through which we can better understand this pathology is

18

through the network of protein-protein interactions between its viral agent, SARS-CoV-2, and its human

19

host. For instance, increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV can be explained by

20

rapid evolution along the interface between the Spike protein and its human receptor (ACE2) leading to

21

increased binding affinity. Sequence divergences that modulate other protein-protein interactions may

22

further explain differences in transmission and virulence in this novel coronavirus. To facilitate these

23

comparisons, we combined homology-based structural modeling with the ECLAIR pipeline for interface

24

prediction at residue resolution, and molecular docking with PyRosetta. This enabled us to compile a

25

novel 3D structural interactome meta-analysis for the published interactome network between SARS-

26

CoV-2 and human. This resource includes docked structures for all interactions with protein structures,

27

enrichment analysis of variation along interfaces, predicted ΔΔG between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-

28

2 variants for each interaction, predicted impact of natural human population variation on binding affinity,

29

and a further prioritized set of drug repurposing candidates predicted to overlap with protein interfaces†.

30

All predictions are available online† for easy access and are continually updated when new interactions

31

are published.

Introduction

42

The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2 has to date infected

43

more than 30 million people and caused more than 940,000 deaths worldwide1. Coronaviruses are a

44

family of enveloped viruses that cause respiratory and/or enteric tract infections in a wide range of avian

45

and mammalian hosts2. To date, seven well characterized coronaviruses infect humans3-5 with severity

46

ranging from a mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome

47

(ARDS). Among these, SARS-CoV-2 is unique in its characteristics being both highly transmissible and

48

capable of causing severe disease in a subset of individuals; whereas other human coronaviruses are either

49

highly transmissible yet generally not highly pathogenic (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43) or highly

50

pathogenic but poorly transmissible (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 is also unique in its range

51

of infection and pathogenesis6, 7. While the vast majority of infected individuals (~25-35%) experience only

52

mild or minimal symptoms, ~1-2% of infected patients die primarily from severe respiratory failure and acute

53

respiratory distress syndrome8, 9. The differences in morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality among different

54

ethnic groups—particularly Blacks and Hispanics10-15—could not be fully explained by cardiometabolic,

55

socioeconomic, or behavioral factors, suggesting that human genetic variation may significantly impact

56

SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Therefore, insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, its markedly elevated

57

transmission rate relative to SARS-CoV, and dynamic range of symptoms are currently of key areas of

58

interest. These traits are likely driven by differences in the mechanism of pathology and interactions

59

between the virus and its host cells, but their specific causes are yet to be characterized.

60

One avenue to better understand the mechanisms of either viral- or bacterial- infection and

61

pathology is through studying the network of protein-protein interactions that occur between a pathogen

62

and its host. Viral-human interactome maps have previously been compiled for SARS-CoV16, HIV17,

63

Ebola virus18, and Dengue and Zika viruses 19 among others. Recently, an affinity-purification mass-

64

spectrometry approach has been applied to 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins uncovering 332 viral-human

65

interactions 20. These inter-species interactions play central roles in disease progression including,

66

acting as facilitators of pathogen entry into host cells 21-26, inducing an inhibitory effect on host response

67

proteins and pathways27-29, and hijacking cell signaling or metabolism to accelerate cellular—and

68

consequentially viral—replication30-32. Understanding the structure and dynamics of these interactions

69

can provide critical insights into their effect on the cell. For instance, determination of the structure of

70

an interaction between poxvirus chemokine inhibitor vCCI and human MIP-1β revealed that the viral-

71

human binding interface occluded domains vital to chemokine homodimerization, receptor binding, and

72

interactions with GAG, thus explaining how this interaction elicits an inhibitory effect on chemokine

73

signaling29. Additionally, the dynamics of an interaction between a herpesvirus cyclin and human cdk2

74

revealed that although the binding interface was distinct from that between human cyclin A and cdk2,

75

the net conformational impact on cdk2 effectively mimicked that of the native interaction leading to

76

dysregulated cell cycle progression31.

77

Because protein-protein interactions are responsible for mediating the majority of protein

78

function33-35, targeted disruption of these interactions by small molecule inhibitors that compete for the

79

same binding site can offer a precise toolkit to modulate cellular function33, 35-38. For example, BCL-2

80

inhibitors that displace bound anti-apoptotic BCL-X interactors can treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia

81

pathogenesis39,

82

networks due to their small proteomes with highly optimized function, and potent inhibitors of key

83

interactions have been developed against viral proteins. Targeted disruption of viral complexes—

84

particularly those responsible for viral replication—has been successful in vaccinia virus41 and human

85

papilloma virus therapies 42, 43. In particular, disruption of viral-host protein-protein interactions explicitly

86

involved in early viral infection is an important therapeutic strategy. Discovery that a population variant in

87

the membrane protein CCR5 conferred resistance to HIV-1 by disrupting its interaction with the viral

88

envelope glycoprotein led to the development of Maraviroc as an FDA approved treatment for HIV-1

89

that functions by blocking the interface for this interaction23, 44.

40.

Targeted disruption of protein interactions can be particularly effective in viral

90

Here we apply a comprehensive interactome modeling framework to construct a 3D structural

91

interactome between SARS-CoV-2 and human protein based on the current interactome map published

92

by Gordon et al.20 Our framework consists of homology modeling to maximize structural coverage of the

93

SARS-CoV-2 proteome, applying our previous ECLAIR classifier45 to identify interface residues for the

94

whole SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, followed by atomic resolution interface modeling through

95

guided docking in PyRosetta46. We additionally carried out in-silico scanning mutagenesis to predict the

96

impact of mutations on interaction binding affinity and performed a comparison of protein-protein and

97

protein-drug binding sites. We compile all results from our structural interactome into a user-friendly

98

web server allowing for quick exploration of individual interactions or bulk download and analysis of the

99

whole dataset. Further, we explore the utility of our interactome modeling approach in identifying key

100

interactions undergoing evolution along viral protein interfaces, highlighting population variants on

101

human interfaces that could modulate the strength of viral-host interactions to confer protection from or

102

susceptibility to COVID-19, and prioritizing drug candidates predicted to bind competitively at viral-

103

human interaction interfaces.

105

Enrichment of divergence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at spike-ACE2 binding interface

106

To highlight the utility of computational and structural approaches to model the SARS-CoV-2-human

107

interactome, we first examined the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and human

108

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Fig 1.a). This interaction is key for viral entry into human

109

cells3 and is the only viral-human interaction with solved crystal structures available in both SARS-CoV47

110

and SARS-CoV-248-50. Comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed that sequence

111

divergence of the S protein was highly enriched at the S-ACE2 interaction interface (Fig 1.a;

112

Log2OddsRatio=2.82, p=1.97e-5), indicating functional evolution around this interaction. To explore the

113

functional impact of these mutations on this interaction, we leveraged the Rosetta energy function51 to

114

estimate the change in binding affinity (ΔΔG) between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 versions of the

115

S-ACE2 interaction (Fig 1.b and 1.c). The predicted negative ΔΔG value of -14.66 Rosetta Energy Units

116

(REU) indicates an increased binding affinity using the SARS-CoV-2 S protein driven by better optimized

117

solvation and hydrogen bonding potential fulfillment along the ACE2 interface. Our result is consistent

118

with the hypothesis that increased stability of the S-ACE2 interaction is one of the key reasons for

119

elevated transmission of SARS-CoV-252. Moreover, recent experimental energy kinetics assays have

120

shown that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds ACE2 with 10-20-fold higher affinity than that of SARS-CoV S

121

protein53 supporting the conclusions from our computational modeling.

122

Medical experts have also noted a wide range in severity of and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2

123

among individuals6, 7, 54. Several hypotheses for genetic predisposition models have been proposed

124

including that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) may up- or down-regulate host response genes

125

and that functional coding variants may alter viral-human interactions55, 56. For instance, a recent RNA-

126

sequencing analysis suggested that higher expression of ACE2 in Asian males effectively provides more

127

routes of entry for the virus and could explain increased susceptibility among this population57.

128

Alternatively, missense population variants in ACE2 could modulate susceptibility to infection by

129

strengthening or weakening the S-ACE2 interaction. A total of six missense population variants reported

130

in gnomAD58 localize to the S-ACE2 interface. Using a mutation scanning pipeline in PyRosetta59, 60 we

131

predicted the impact on binding affinity for each variant (Fig 1.d). The three population variants

132

predicted to have the largest impact on S-ACE2 binding affinity— ACE2_E37K (ΔΔG=1.50), ACE2_M82I

133

(ΔΔG=2.95), and ACE2_G326E (ΔΔG=5.74)—were all consistent with previous experimental screens

134

which identified them as putative protective variants exhibiting decreased binding of ACE2 to S61, 62.

135

Cumulatively, our results highlight the usefulness of a 3D structural interactome modeling approach in

136

identifying interactions and mutations important for viral infection, pathogenesis, and transmission.

137

Constructing the 3D Structural SARS-CoV-2-Human Interactome

138

After successfully applying our modeling approaches to recapitulate the effect of mutations along the S-

139

ACE2 interface, we expanded our efforts to compile a complete 3D structural interactome between

140

SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. An early interactome screen by Gordon et al.20 uncovered 332 viral-

141

human interactions that provide the foundation for our 3D interactome. To model these interactions, we

142

first constructed homology models for 18 of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with suitable templates

143

(Supplemental Figure 1). Then, we predicted the interface residues for each interaction using our

144

Ensemble Classifier Learning Algorithm to predict Interface Residues (ECLAIR) framework 45. In total,

145

our pipeline identified 692 interface residues across 18 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with an average 24.7

146

residues per interface and 6,763 across 190 human proteins with an average 20.3 residues per

147

interface. A summary of the classifier utilization, prediction confidences, and interface size is provided

148

in Supplemental Figure 2.

149

In order to add a structural component to our interactome map, and thereby enable modeling of

150

the binding affinity for these interactions, we additionally performed docking in PyRosetta using our

151

ECLAIR interface likelihood predictions to refine the search space (Supplemental Figure 3). Structural

152

models were available for both the human and SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 250 out of 332 interactions

153

(75%) making them amenable to guided docking experiments. After performing up to 50 independent

154

docking experiments for each interaction and retaining the top-scored conformation we report 959

155

interface residues across 18 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with an average 18.2 residues per interface and

156

4,483 across 250 human proteins with an average 17.9 residues per interface (Supplemental Figure

157

2.g). For all analyses, interface annotations provided from docking experiments were prioritized over

158

our ECLAIR predictions. The full interface annotations from our ECLAIR and docking predictions are

159

available in Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2 respectively.

160

Perturbation of Human Proteins by Disease Mutations and Binding of SARS-CoV-2 Interactions Occur

161

at Distinct Sites

162

After constructing the 3D interactome between SARS-CoV-2 and human, we first looked for evidence

163

of interface-specific variation by mapping both gnomAD58 reported human population variants

164

(Supplemental Table 3) and sequence divergences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

165

(Supplemental Table 4) onto the predicted interfaces. In general, conserved residues have been shown

166

to cluster at protein-protein interfaces63, and a recent analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structure and evolution

167

likewise concluded that highly conserved surface residues were likely to drive protein-protein

168

interactions 64. Consistent with these prior findings at an interactome-wide level, we observed significant

169

depletion for both viral and human variation along the predicted interfaces comparable to that observed

170

on solved human-human interfaces (Fig 2.a).

171

Nonetheless, considering each interaction individually, our analysis uncovered a 13 interaction

172

interfaces enriched for human population variants (Fig 2.b), and 7 enriched for recent viral sequence

173

divergences (Fig 2.c). A breakdown of variant enrichment on each interface is provide in Supplemental

174

Table 5. The individual viral interfaces showing an unexpected degree of variation may—like the

175

previously discussed S-ACE2 interface—be indicative of recent functional evolution around the viral-

176

human interaction. Considering the slower rate of evolution in humans, enrichment of population

177

variants along the human interfaces is unlikely to be a selective response to the virus. Rather, these

178

interfaces with high population variation along the interfaces may represent edges in the interactome

179

whose strength may fluctuate among individuals or between populations. Alternatively, enrichment and

180

depletion of variation along the human-viral interfaces could help distinguish viral proteins that bind

181

along existing—and therefore conserved—human-human interfaces from those that bind using novel

182

interfaces—that would be less likely to be under selective pressure.

183

To further explore the functional impact of naturally occurring variants on the human interactors

184

of SARS-CoV-2, we considered variants with phenotypic associations as reported in HGMD 65, ClinVar66

185

or the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog67. Interactors of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly more likely than the

186

rest of the human proteome to harbor phenotypic variants in each of these databases (Fig 2.d). Notably,

187

among the individual disease categories enriched in this gene set, several were consistent with reported

188

comorbidities including heart disease, respiratory tract disease, and metabolic disease68, 69 (Fig 2.e;

189

Supplemental Table 6). Disruption of native protein-protein interactions is one mechanism of disease

190

pathology, and disease mutations are known to be enriched along protein interfaces70,

191

population variants on the predicted human-viral interface were more likely to be annotated as

192

deleterious by SIFT72 and PolyPhen73 but showed identical allele frequency distributions compared to

193

those off the interfaces (Supplemental Figure 4). However, mapping annotated disease mutations onto

194

the protein interfaces only revealed significant enrichment along known human-human interfaces; no

195

such enrichment was found on human-viral interfaces (Fig 2.f). This is likely because unlike with human-

196

human interactions, mutations disrupting human-viral interactions would not disrupt natural cell function,

197

and therefore would be unlikely to be pathogenic. Our finding that disease mutations and viral proteins

198

affect human proteins at distinct sites is consistent with a two-hit hypothesis of comorbidities whereby

199

proteins whose function is already affected by genetic background may be further compromised by viral

200

infection.

Analysis of Binding Affinity Changes Between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Helps Identify Key Interactions

202

We next sought to explore the impact of sequence divergence in SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV on

203

viral-human interactions. Mutations between the two viruses were identified by pairwise alignment and the

204

impacts of these mutations on the binding energy (ΔΔG) for 250 interactions amenable to docking were

205

predicted using a PyRosetta pipeline46,

206

unchanged—either because no mutations occurred near the interface or because the mutations that did

207

had marginal effect—we observed an increased likelihood of the divergence from SARS-CoV to SARS-

208

CoV-2 resulting in decreased binding energy (i.e. more stable interaction) (Fig 3.a; Supplemental Table

209

7). The significant outliers in these ΔΔG predictions can help pinpoint key differences between the viral-

210

human interactomes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We further note a wide range of affinity impacts

211

among various human interactors of a single viral protein (Fig 3.d) and hypothesize that these differences

212

may help identify the most important interactions.

59, 60.

Although the binding energy for most interactions was

213

To further explore the significance of these changes in interaction affinity, we considered those

214

interactions with the largest decrease in binding energy; corresponding to the largest predicted increase in

215

affinity. Specifically, we highlight the interaction between coronavirus orf9c and human mitochondrial NADH

216

Dehydrogenase (Ubiquinone) 1 Alpha Subcomplex, Assembly Factor 1 (NDUFAF1) (Fig 3.e; ΔΔG=-21.7

217

REU). Two mutations contribute to the increased stability of this interaction in SARS-CoV-2. During the

218

transition from the unbound to bound states of orf9c, His-34 rotates inwards to accommodate NDUFAF1

219

resulting steric tensions with orf9c residue 61. The mutation from the bulkier Val-61 (SARS-CoV) to Ala-61

220

(SARS-CoV-2) helps alleviate this tension resulting in overall more favorable energy state transition.

221

Second, the mutation from the polar Glu-60 (SARS-CoV) to the nonpolar Met-60 (SARS-CoV-2) contributes

222

to overall better solvation energy along the interface involving residue 60 of orf9c and the Ser-148, Glu-

223

149, Val-150 stretch of NDUFAF1.

224

Although the precise role of coronavirus orf9c (sometimes annotated as orf14) has not yet been

225

characterized, experiments in SARS-CoV have shown that it localizes to vesicular components74 and

226

interactome data from SARS-CoV-2 reveal that it targets host mitochondrial proteins and could impact

227

proteins responsible for modulating IkB kinase and NF-kB signaling pathways20. NDUFAF1 is a chaperone

228

protein involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial complex I75,

76.

RNAi screens have associated

229

knockdown of NDUFAF1 with increased vaccinia virus infection77. Moreover, properly assembled

230

mitochondrial complex I—including NDUFAF1—has been shown to be indispensable for reactive oxygen

231

species based signaling to trigger expression of interleukins 2 and 4 and activate signaling of TLR778, a

232

SARS-CoV-2 ARDS predisposition gene79. Recent reports have suggested that the virus may hijack host

233

metabolism through complex I to increase replication80. Additionally, NDUFAF1 harbors disease mutations

234

for complex I deficiency and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that may be linked to SARS-CoV-2 comorbidities.

235

Our result predicting increased stability of the interaction between orf9c and NDUFAF1 in SARS-CoV-2

236

relative to SARS-CoV suggests a stronger impact on complex I assembly and potential disruption of

237

downstream pathways.

238

We further identified several interactions with significantly altered binding energy in SARS-CoV-2

239

with potential links to cellular response to viral infection. In orf9c we additionally predicted increased affinity

240

with a Golgi signaling protein, TMED5 (ΔΔG=-21 REU). Phenotypic screens have linked TMED5 to altered

241

viral infectivity77, 81, 82 and decreased interleukin 8 secretion83. Although no known mechanisms directly link

242

TMED5 to immune response, one of its interactors, TMED284, is known to potentiate interferon response

243

to viral infection85. Interaction with TMED5 may additionally be linked to viral transport within and secretion

244

from its host86. Finally, the mitochondrial protein TOMM70 was predicted to bind orf9b with greater affinity

245

(ΔΔG=-11 REU) in SARS-CoV-2. TOMM70 has been linked to mitochondrial antiviral signaling through

246

downstream activation of interferon regulatory factors87.

247

Predicting the Impact of Human Populations Variants on SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein Interactions

248

A dynamic range of patient responses and symptoms have been reported for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In

249

previously studied viruses including HIV, underlying genetic variation can explain up to 15% of variation in

250

patient response and overall viral load88. Moreover, previous high-throughput experiments suggest that, up

251

to 10.5% of missense population variants can disrupt native protein-protein interactions89. Therefore, we

252

hypothesize that some fraction of patient response to SARS-CoV-2 can be explained by missense

253

variations and their impact on viral-human interactions. To explore this hypothesis, we performed in-silico

254

scanning mutagenesis along all docked interfaces in PyRosetta. We identified as binding energy hotspot

255

mutations all mutations with a predicted ΔΔG at least one standard deviation away from the mean for

identical amino acid substitutions across the rest of the interface. In total, out of 2,241 population variants

257

on eligible interfaces, 161 (7.2%) were identified as hotspots predicted to disrupt interaction stability, and

258

116 (5.2%) were identified as hotspots predicted to contribute to interaction stability (Fig 3.b). Most of the

259

hotspot mutations were predicted to be driven by solvation or repulsive forces, with disruptive hotspots

260

primarily being driven by repulsive forces and stabilizing hotspots primarily being driven by solvation forces

261

(Fig 3.c). Results summarizing the predicted impact of all 2,241 population variants on the docked

262

interfaces are provided in Supplemental Table 8.

Prioritization of Candidate Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-Human Interactions Through Binding Site Comparison

264

A Web Server to Present the SARS-CoV-2-Human 3D Structural Interactome

265

In order to present the results from our experiments as a comprehensive easy-access resource to the

266

general public, we constructed the SARS-CoV-2 human structural interactome web. All structures used

267

for modeling, interface predictions, raw docking outputs, mutation binding impacts, and analyses

268

described herein are directly available for download through our downloads page. Our homepage allows

269

users quick navigation through the reported interactome to view results summarizing specific

270

interactions of interest. Aside from providing a 3D view of the interaction and predicted interface

271

residues, our results page provides four main functionalities (Fig 5).

272

The interface comparison panel (Fig 5 top left) provides a linear representation of protein

273

sequence with interface annotations. Linear representations of all other known or predicted interfaces

274

from the same protein are shown for comparison along with navigation links to explore other interaction

275

partners either within the site (for viral-human interactions) or through InteractomeINSIDER45 (for

276

human-human interactions). In particular, from the human perspective, this comparison may reveal

277

biologically meaningful insights about the interface overlap and possible competition between viral and

278

human interactors.

279

The mutations panel (Fig 5 top right) provides information on variation in each interaction

280

partner. For the viral side, mutations are reported based on divergence from the SARS-CoV version of

281

the protein. For the human side, all known population variants as reported in gnomAD are listed58.

282

Additionally, we provide a log odds ratio describing the enrichment or depletion of variation along the

283

interface. These results may help highlight interactions undergoing functional evolution along the viral

284

interface.

285

For each interaction amenable to docking, the ΔΔG Information panel (Fig 5 lower left)

286

compiles the results from our in-silico scanning mutagenesis to report binding affinity predictions for all

287

possible mutations across the docked interface. Individual mutations and colored by their z-score

288

normalized ΔΔG prediction. The results can be toggled to only show the impacts of known variants. On

289

the viral side, a cumulative ΔΔG value is provided describing the predicted change in binding affinity

290

between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 versions of the protein.

291

The current version of the SARS-CoV-2 human structural interactome web server describes 332

292

viral-human interactions reported by Gordon et al.20. We will continue support for the web server with

293

periodic updates as additional interactome screens between SARS-CoV-2 and human are published.

294

As we update, a navigation option to select between the current or previous stable releases of the web

295

server will be provided.

296

Discussion

297

Overall, we present a comprehensive resource to explore the SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein

298

interactome map in a structural context. Analysis through this framework allows us to consider the recent

299

evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of its interactome map and to prioritize for further functional

300

characterization key interactions. Likewise, our consideration of underlying variation in the human

301

proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 may be valuable in explaining differences in response to

302

infection. We particularly note that our observation that perturbation from underlying disease mutations

303

and viral protein binding occur at distinct sites on the protein is of clinical interest. Further investigation

304

into the combined role of these two sources of perturbation to better understand the mechanisms linked

305

to comorbidities is warranted.

306

However, our work is not without limitation. Firstly, we note that although structural coverage

307

from our homology modelling of SARS-CoV-2 proteins was robust (Supplemental Figure 1), the same

308

could not be universally said of the human proteins. Although guided molecular docking was always

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.13.308676; this version posted October 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

309

done to orient the most likely interface residues on each structure towards each other, protein-protein

310

docking using incomplete protein models introduces some bias and low coverage may exclude some

311

true interface residues. For this reason, the initial ECLAIR interface annotations—which are less subject

312

to structural coverage limitations—may provide orthogonal value. We additionally note that direct

313

quantitative interpretation of predicted ΔΔG values using the Rosetta scoring function is often difficult

314

since different term weights can be used in different setups. Although the same scoring function was

315

used for all predictions described here, the relative magnitude of each term may change based on the

316

size and composition of different proteins between interactions. For these reasons, we only employ a

317

relative qualitative comparison of similar predictions when interpreting our scanning mutagenesis

318

results. Moreover, the structure optimization after each mutation is applied focuses on side-chain

319

repacking, therefore, our results focus only on mutations at or near the interface where the impact of

320

side-chain repacking could be measured. We expect there may be some mutations with significant

321

impact on binding affinity that act through refolding or other allosteric effects that are missed by our

322

method.

323

Perhaps

most

importantly,

we

emphasize

the

importance

of

further

experimental

324

characterization to confirm the predictions made here. Nonetheless we believe our 3D Structural SARS-

325

CoV-2-human Interactome web server will prove to be a key resource in informing hypothesis driven

326

exploration of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathology and host response. The scope, and potential

327

impacts of our webserver will continue to grow as we incorporate the results of ongoing and future

328

interactome screens between SARS-CoV-2 and human. Additionally, we note that our 3D structural

329

interactome framework can be rapidly deployed to analyze future viruses.

Online Methods

331

Generation of Homology Models for SARS-CoV-2 Proteome

332

Homology-based modeling of all 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins was performed in Modeller90 using a multiple

333

template modeling procedure. In brief, a list of candidate template structures for each protein to be

334

modelled was obtained by running BLAST91 against a reference containing all sequences in the Protein

335

Data Bank (PDB)92. Templates were filtered to only retain those with at least 30% identify to the protein

336

to be modelled, and the remaining templates were ranked using a weighted combination of percent

337

identity and coverage as described previously93. To compile the final set of overlapping templates for

338

modeling, first the top ranked template was selected as a seed. Overlapping templates were iteratively

339

added to the set so long as 1) the new template increased the overall coverage by at least 10%, and 2)

340

the new template retained a total percent identity no more than 25% worse than the initial seed template.

341

Pairwise alignments between the protein to be modelled and the template set were generated using a

342

Modeller alignment object with default settings. Alignments were manually trimmed to remove any

343

regions with large gaps (at least 5 gaps in the alignment in a 10 residue window). Finally, alignment was

344

carried out using the Modeller automodel function.

345

This approach generated suitable homology models for 18 out of 29 proteins. A visual

346

representation of each structure and templates used is provided in Supplemental Figure 1.

347

Phase One Interface Prediction Using ECLAIR

348

Interface predictions for all 332 interactions reported by Gordon et al.20 were made in two phases. In

349

phase one, we leveraged our previously validated Ensemble Classifier Learning Algorithm to

350

predict Interface Residues (ECLAIR) 45 to perform an initial prediction of likely interface residues across

351

all interactions. ECLAIR compiles five sets of features; biophysical, conservation, coevolution,

352

structural, and docking. In brief, biophysical features are compiled using a windowed average of several

353

ExPASy ProtScales94, conservation features are derived from the Jensen-Shannon divergence95,

354

across all available homologs for each protein, coevolution features between interacting proteins are

355

derived from direct coupling analysis (DCA)97 and statistical coupling analysis (SCA) 98 among paired

356

homologs, structural features are obtained by calculating the solvent accessible surface area of

96

357

available PDB92 or ModBase99 models using NACCESS100, and docking features are derived from an

358

average of docking predictions made using Zdock 101.

359

To accommodate predictions between SARS-CoV-2 and human, slight alterations were made.

360

First calculation of coevolution features was impossible because the calculation of SCA and DCA

361

requires analysis of multiple sequence alignments from paired homologs of both interacting proteins

362

across at least 50 species. Because we here consider inter-species interaction, no one species could

363

contain homologs of both the viral and human proteins. Second, the calculation of conservation features

364

for the viral proteins were modified to account for conservation between both related viral species and

365

various strains that have been sequenced in a single species. We typically only include one homolog

366

per species in these calculations, but expanded our criteria here because availability of the protein

367

conservation feature is a requirement for all of our higher-confidence classifiers. Finally, the calculation

368

of structural features for the viral protein were overruled to use the manually provided homology models

369

instead of pulling structures from the PDB or ModBase. A visual summary of the ECLAIR interface

370

predictions is presented in Supplemental Figure 2 and the initial prediction results are provided in

371

Supplemental Table 1.

372

Phase Two Interface Prediction Using Guided PyRosetta Docking

373

Interface predictions for all 332 interactions reported by Gordon et al.20 were made in two phases. In

374

phase two, we generated atomic resolution models of 250 interactions by leveraging the Rosetta scoring

375

function51 and prior probabilities obtained from ECLAIR predictions to perform guided docking. The

376

remaining 82 interactions were missing reliable 3D models for at least one of their members and

377

therefore were not amenable to docking. A schematic summary of our docking methodology is presented

378

in Supplemental Figure 3.

379

Using the predicted interface probabilities reported by ECLAIR, we set up the initial docking

380

conformation to explore a restricted search space for each docking simulation. In cases where multiple

381

structures were available for the human protein, all structures were weighted based on the ECLAIR

382

scores for the covered residues in each structure to maximize both coverage age inclusion of likely

383

interface residues. For each protein in the interaction, we performed a linear regression classification in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.13.308676; this version posted October 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

384

scikit-learn102 to optimally separate the likely interface residues from likely non-interface residues. The

385

plane defined by this linear regression served as a reference to orient the structures along the y-axis

386

with their most probable interface sides facing each other. The two chains were centered at (0, 0) along

387

the x-z plane and separated a distance of 5 Å along the y-axis. For each docking attempt, a series of

388

random perturbations from these initial conformations were made to search the nearby space. First, the

389

human protein was rotated up to 360° along the y-axis to allow full exploration of different rotations of

390

the two interfaces relative to each other. Second, to apply some flexibility to the plane predicting the

391

interface vs. non-interface sides of each protein, up to 30° of rotation along the x- and z- axis were

392

allowed for both the viral and human proteins. Finally, a random translation up to 5 Å in magnitude was

393

applied to the human protein along the x-z plane so that the docking could explore contact points other

394

than the center of masses along these axes.

395

After initializing these guided starting conformations, docking was simulated in PyRosetta46

396

using a modified version of the protein-protein docking methodology provided by Gray 2006103. The

397

initial demo (https://graylab.jhu.edu/pyrosetta/downloads/scripts/demo/D100 Docking.py) takes two

398

chains from a co-crystal structure, applies a random perturbation, and re-docks them. Because

399

randomized initial orientation was already handled as described previously, these steps were removed

400

from our docking runs. In brief, the protein models were converted to centroid representation, slid into

401

contact using the “interchain_cen” scoring function, and converted back to full atom representation,

402

before having their side-chains optimized using the predefined “docking” and “docking_min” scoring

403

functions. Up to 50 iterations of this guided docking were performed for each interaction, and the docked

404

conformation resulting in the lowest Rosetta energy score was retained. The final docked interface

405

annotations are provided in Supplemental Table 2.

406

Definition of Interface Residues

407

To annotate interface residues from atomic resolution docked models, we used a previously described

408

and established definition for interface residues 45. In brief, the solvent accessible surface area (SASA)

409

for both bound and unbound docked structures was calculated using NACCESS.100 We define as

410

interface residue, any residue that is both 1) at the surface of a protein (defined as ≥ 15% relative

411

accessibility) and 2) in contact with the interacting chain (defined as any residue whose absolute

412

accessibility decreased by ≥ 1.0 Å2).

413

Compilation of Viral SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 Mutations and Human Population Variants

414

For analysis of genetic variation that may impact the viral-human interactome, two sets of mutations

415

were compiled; 1) viral mutations between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and 2) human population

416

variants on proteins shown to interact with viral proteins.

417

For viral mutations, variations between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 versions of each proteins

418

were collected. The representative sequences used for the 16 proteins in the SARS-CoV proteome were

419

taken from the Proteomes section of UniProt (ID UP000000354)104, 105. Sequences for 29 SARS-CoV-2

420

proteins were obtained from the annotations by Gordon et al.20 based on genbank accession

421

MN985325106, 107. Notably, UniProt accessions for the SARS-CoV proteome report two sequences for

422

the uncleaved ORF1a and ORF1a-b which correspond to NSP1 through NSP16 in SARS-CoV-2.

423

Variations between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were reported after pairwise Needleman Wench

424

alignment108, 109 (using Blosum62 scoring matrix, gap open penalty of 10 and gap extension penalty of

425

0.5) between the corresponding protein sequences in each species. A total of 1,003 missense variants

426

were detected among 23 SARS-CoV-2 proteins. No variations were reported for orf3b, orf8, or orf10

427

because no suitable alignment could be made with a SARS-CoV sequence. Additionally, orf7b, nsp3,

428

and nsp16 were excluded from this set because they were not involved in any viral-human interactions.

429

The full list of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is reported in Supplemental Table 4.

430

Human population variants in all 332 human proteins shown to interact with SARS-CoV-2

431

proteins were obtained from gnomAD58. Programmatic queries to fetch all variants for a given gene were

432

performed using gnomAD’s graphQL API. For details on performing gnomAD queries in this manner see

433

the

434

browser/tree/master/projects/gnomad-api). Population variants were filtered to only retain missense

435

variants. In order to map these gnomAD DNA-level SNPs to equivalent protein-level UniProt

436

annotations, we used the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)110. After all mapping was completed,

437

all variants were parsed to make sure that the reported reference amino acid and position matched up

438

with the UniProt sequence. Roughly 95.6% of cases matched and the remaining variants that could not

439

reliably be mapped to UniProt coordinates were dropped from our dataset. In total 127,528 human

440

population variants were curated. The full list of human population variants from GnomAD is reported in

441

Supplemental Table 3.

442

Log Odds Enrichment Calculations

443

In order to determine if viral mutations or human populations variants were enriched at predicted

444

interaction interfaces, odds ratios were calculated as described previously 111. All odds ratios were log2

445

transformed to maintain symmetry between enriched and depleted values. For this particular use case,

446

the equation for the odds ratio was…

447

where “Variant” vs. “NonVariant” distinguishes positions in a protein sequence that respectively did and

449

did not overlap with the set of variants, and “InterfaceResidues” vs. “NonInterfaceResidues”

450

distinguishes positions in a protein sequence that respectively did and did not overlap with the predicted

451

interface for a given interaction. To avoid arbitrary odds ratio inflation or depletion from missing data, in

452

all cases where the interface residues were predicted by molecular docking, the odds ratio was altered

453

to only account for positions that were included in the structural models used for docking. Enrichment

454

calculations for disease mutations and overlap between drug and protein binding sites were calculated

455

in the same manner with appropriately adjusted case and exposure categories.

456

Curation of Disease Associated Variants

457

To explore whether human proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins were enriched for disease or

458

trait associated variants, three datasets were curated; the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)65,

459

ClinVar66, and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog67. Disease annotations from HGMD and ClinVar were

460

obtained directly from their respective downloads pages and mapped to UniProt. For overall enrichment

461

of individual disease terms among all human proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2, disease terms were

462

linked

(https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/medgen/MGREL.RRF.gz). When calculating enrichment, counts for

each term were propagated through all parent nodes up to a singular root node. Significant terms were

reported as the most general term with no more significant ancestor term (Supplemental Table 6, sheet

468

(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/)67, lead SNPs (p-value<5e-8) for all diseases/traits were retrieved on June

469

16, 2020. Proxy SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (Parameters: R2 > 0.8; pop: “ALL”) for

470

individual lead SNPs were obtained through programmatic queries to the LDproxy API112, which used

471

phase 3 haplotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project as reference for calculating pairwise metrics

472

of LD. Both lead SNPs and proxy SNPs were filtered to only retain missense variants.

473

Gene-level enrich calculations for disease / trait associated mutations in known interactors for

474

SARS-CoV-2 and variant-level enrichment at the predicted interaction interfaces (either human-human

475

interactions or human-viral interactions) were performed as described above.

476

Estimation of ΔΔG from variation at the interfaces

477

In order to predict the impact of variation at viral-human interaction interfaces on binding affinity, two

478

sets of ΔΔG predictions were made using PyRosetta46. First, to explore the overall binding energy

479

contributions of each interface residue, and to predict the impact of all possible mutations along the

480

interface, a scanning mutation ΔΔG approach was implemented based on protocols described

481

previously59,

482

documentation (https://graylab.jhu.edu/pyrosetta/downloads/scripts/demo/D090 Ala scan.py) with one

483

major exception: interface residues in the original demo are defined using an 8.0 Å inter-chain distance

484

cutoff, which we overrule with our definition described above. In brief, we iterate over all interface

485

residues for a given docked structure. For each position, the binding for the interaction from the wildtype

486

structure is first estimated. The energy for the complex state is estimated following a

487

PackRotamersMover optimization constrained to only adjust the side-chains of residues within 8.0 Å of

488

the residue to be mutated. To estimate energy from the unbound state, the chains are first separated

489

500.0 Å to eliminate any interchain energy contributions, the structures are then optimized and scored

60.

The implementation is essentially identical to a demo provided by the PyRosetta

490

identically to the complex state. The difference between these two values provides the binding energy

491

for the wildtype structure.

492

∆𝐺𝐺𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 = 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 − 𝐸𝐸𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢

493

To estimate the binding energy for all 19 amino acid mutations possible at the given position, each

494

mutation is made iteratively, and the ΔG Mut is estimated identically to the wildtype except using the

495

mutated structures. Finally, the overall impact on binding energy for each mutation is calculated as the

496

difference between these two binding energies.

497

∆∆𝐺𝐺 = ∆𝐺𝐺𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 − ∆𝐺𝐺𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊

498

The scoring function used for these calculations is as described previously59 using the following weights;

499

fa_atr=0.44, fa_rep=0.07, fa_sol=1.0, hbond_bb_sc=0.5, hbond_sc=1.0. To account for the

500

stochasticity of the PackRotamersMover optimization between trials, all ΔΔG values are reported from

501

an average of 10 independent trials which yielded overall low standard deviation between trials. To

502

check whether an individual mutation’s average ΔΔG was significantly non-zero, a two-sided z-test

503

between the 10 independent trials was performed. To account for average impact other same amino

504

acid mutations at other positions along the interface, each average ΔΔG was z-normalized relative to

505

the rest of the interface and outliers were called at ≥ 1 standard deviation away from the mean. Mutations

506

that passed both criteria were identified as significant interface binding affinity hotspots.

507

Second, estimates of the overall impact of the cumulative set of mutations between SARS-CoV

508

and SARS-CoV-2 were made using the same general framework. For each interaction, the binding

509

energy for the SARS-CoV-2 version of the interaction was estimated identically to the wildtype binding

510

energy. The binding energy for the SARS-CoV version of the interaction was estimated after applying

511

all mutations between the two viruses (for simplicity, only amino acid substitutions were applied, a

512

minority of mutations that comprised insertions or deletions could not be modelled). The only difference

513

compared to the single mutation ΔΔG calculation was that multiple mutations were applied at once, and

514

consequentially, the interface packing was done allowing side-chain rotamer optimization for all residues

515

within 8.0 Å of any of the mutated residues. The ΔΔG values were calculated such that an interaction

516

predicted to be more stable (lower binding energy) in the SARS-CoV-2 version of the interaction

517

compared to the SARS-CoV version of the interaction would have a negative ΔΔG.

519

To account to stochasticity between trials for these predictions (which notably had a much larger impact

520

likely due to the decreased constraints on rotamer optimization in these cases), this set of ΔΔG values

521

was reported as an average of 50 trials. Significant outliers for overall binding affinity change from

522

SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 were called based on similar criteria to the individual mutations, except the

523

z-score normalization was performed relative to all other interactions.

Protein-ligand Docking Using Smina

525

The previous viral-human interactome screen by Gordon et al.20 reported 76 candidate drugs targeting

526

the 332 human proteins. In order to further prioritize this list and search for drugs that share a binding

527

site with the viral interactor, we performed protein-ligand docking. Among this list, 71 interaction-drug

528

pairs involving 49 unique drugs that were amenable to docking were identified. To prep for docking, 3D

529

structures for all ligands were first generated using Open Babel113 and the command:

530

obabel -:”[SMILES_STRING]” --gen3d -opdb -O [OUT_FILE] -d

531

Protein-ligand docking was executed using smina114 with the following parameters. The autobox_ligand

532

option was turned on and centered around the receptor PDB file with an autobox_add border size of 10

533

Å. The exhaustiveness was set to 40 to increase the number of independent stochastic sampling

534

trajectories and increase the likelihood of identifying a global minimum. The num_modes was set to

535

1000 to so that a multitude of lower ranked models could be compared for internal purposes. To reduce

536

real wall time each docking process was run using 5 CPU cores, although it should be noted runtime is

537

affected in a strictly linear manner and CPU cores has no impact on net CPU time. Finally, each protein-

538

ligand docking command was repeated 45 times with a unique seed on each interaction. The final smina

539

command used was as follows:

540

smina -r [RECEPTOR] -l [LIGAND] --autobox_ligand [RECEPTOR] --autobox_add 10

541

-o [OUT_FILE] --exhaustiveness 40 --num_modes 1000 --cpu 5 --seed [SEED]

542

Multiple trials for the same docking problem were performed in order to saturate the ligand binding

543

search space as thoroughly as possible. Practically speaking this batched docking approach was only

544

taken so that time spent docking would cycle through each protein-drug pair equally, thus producing

545

results from each pair at an even rate. The net effect is merely as if one docking process had been run

546

for each protein-drug pair with exhaustiveness parameter set to ~2,000. It should be noted that this level

547

of sampling was overkill relative to common practices and usually a single run with exhaustiveness

548

ranging from 30-50 would be suffifient114. Docked conformation from all iterations on each protein-drug

549

pair were compiled into a final set of up to 10 of the best scoring poses. To retain poses that cover

550

different low-energy binding sites, these poses were selected such that the center of mass of each

551

docked pose added must be at least 1 Å away from the center of mass of any of the higher ranked

552

poses. All results described in this manuscript are reported based on only the top ranked pose for each

553

protein-drug pair. Protein residues involved in the drug binding site were annotated using the same

554

criteria used to define interface residues. Of note, to include ligand molecules as part of the NACCESS

555

solvent accessible surface area calculations, the Record Type for all ligand atoms must be manually

556

changed from HETATM to ATOM.

Human interactions.

a, Predicted changes in binding affinity from sequence divergences between SARS-CoV and SARS-

614

CoV-2 on SARS-CoV-2-human interactions were predicted in PyRosetta. An overall representation of

615

these ΔΔG predictions is reported (mean=-1.40 REU, std=6.16 REU) with interactions sorted from those

616

with the largest decrease in binding energy (most stabilized relative to SARS-CoV) to those with the

617

largest increase in binding energy (most destabilized relative to SARS-CoV). Outlier interactions with

618

the change in binding energy at least one standard deviation from the mean are labeled. b, Distribution

619

of the predicted binding affinity change from all human population variants on a SARS-CoV-2-human

620

interface. Values were z-score normalized across each interface. Interface binding energy hotspots

621

were binned as strongly disruptive (z-score ≥ 2, n=74), disruptive (1 ≤ z-score < 2, n=87), stabilizing (-

622

2 < z-score ≤ -1, n=85), or strongly stabilizing (z-score ≤ -2, n=31). All other population variants (-1 < z-

623

score < 1, n=1,964) showed minimal impact of binding affinity. c, Breakdown of the contribution of each

624

term in the PyRosetta energy function used for in-silico scanning mutagenesis for all population variants.

625

Distributions for each term are shown on the left. A breakdown of which term contributed most heavily

626

to the classification of all 277 interface hotspot population variants is shown on the right. d, Individual

627

SARS-CoV-2-human interactions involving the same viral protein can have distinct interfaces with

628

distinct predicted changes in binding affinity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 versions of the

629

protein. An example involving orf9b is highlighted where some interactions (e.g. TOMM70 and PTBP2)

630

are predicted to be more stabilized in SARS-CoV-2 whereas others (e.g. BAG5, SLC9A3R1, and

631

MARK2) are predicted to me unaffected. e, Docked structure for the interaction between SARS-CoV-2

632

orf9c and human NDUFAF1, alongside comparisons of the predicted interface using SARS-CoV (top)

633

or SARS-CoV-2 (bottom) orf9c. Interface residues are colored by their predicted energy contribution

634

from blue (stabilizing) to white (no impact) to red (destabilizing). Residues that differ between SARS-

635

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are labeled in red, while other residues with a major contribution to the binding

636

affinity are labeled in green (NDUFAF1) or blue (orf9c). The overall predicted change in binding energy

637

(ΔΔG=-21.7 REU) suggests the interaction is more stable (lower energy) in the SARS-CoV-2 version of

638

the interaction.

Figure 5. 3D-SARS2 Structural Interactome Browser Overview.

641

Overview of the main results page for exploring a given interaction in our 3D-SARS2 structural

642

interactome browser. The main display contains information for both the SARS-CoV-2 and human

643

proteins including structural displays for either the docked or single crystal structures as well as a table

644

summarizing the interface residues for both proteins. Interface residues are colored dark blue and dark

645

green for the viral and human proteins respectively. By default the page will display the docked structure

646

if available. The display can be toggled between docked structures and single structures using the

647

button in the bottom middle. When single structures display is selected residues will instead be colored

648

based on the initial ECLAIR interface definition. Four categories of expandable panels containing

649

additional analyses are provided. upper left, The interface view shows a linear representation of the

650

protein sequence with interface residues annotated in dark blue or dark green. Interfaces for other

651

interactors of the protein are shown underneath for easy comparison. upper right, The mutations panel

652

summarizes either human population variants or viral sequence divergences on the protein. Mutations

653

on the interface are labeled. lower left, The ΔΔG information panel summarizes the results from in-

654

silico mutagenesis scanning along the interface. Results for each mutation are z-score normalized

655

relative to the rest of the interface and colored on a blue (negative ΔΔG, stabilizing) to yellow (minimal

656

impact) to red (positive ΔΔG, destabilizing). The heatmap can be filtered to only show values

657

corresponding to known mutations on the interface.

Supplemental Figure 3. Visual representation of the guided docking protocol used.

680

For each SARS-CoV-2-human interaction with 3D structure available for both proteins, 50 independent

681

guiding docking trials were used to select a final docked configuration. The structure for the viral protein

682

is colored from white to blue with darker blue corresponding to higher ECLAIR prediction. The structure

683

for the human protein is colored similarly using a green to white gradient. Initial semi-random docked

684

configurations were generated using five steps. First a plane separating ECLAIR predicted likely

685

interface from likely non-interface residues was drawn to divide each protein. Second, the two protein

686

chains were separated 5 Å apart on the y-axis using the previously defined plane to orient the likely

687

interface sides of each protein towards each other. Third, the human protein was randomly rotated up

688

to 360° along the y-axis to sample different orientations of the two interfaces relative to each other.

689

Fourth, the human protein was randomly rotated up to 30° along the x- and z-axes with the point of

690

rotation centered on the viral protein. Fifth a random translation up to 5 Å was applied to the human

691

protein along the x- and z-axes. The first two steps constitute the ECLAIR-based guiding of the docking

692

space. The last three steps serve to randomly perturb the initial docking configurations to sample the

693

space near the ECLAIR predicted interface. After this initial perturbation docking is performed using a

694

combination of low resolution and high-resolution scoring. During the low-resolution scoring, the proteins

695

are initially converted to a centroid representation and slid into contact. During the high-resolution

696

scoring, the proteins are converted back to a full-atom representation and the contact and side-chain

697

packing is optimized. The best (lowest) scored docked pose is retained and used for docked interface

698

definition.
