Abstract

18

Emerging infectious diseases due to coronavirus (CoV) infections have received significant global

19

attention in the past decade and have been linked to bats as the original source. The diversity, distribution,

20

and host associations of bat CoVs were investigated to assess their potential for zoonotic transmission.

21

Phylogenetic, network, and principal coordinate analysis confirmed the classification of betacoronaviruses

22

(BetaCoVs) into five groups (2A to 2E) and a potentially novel group, with further division of 2D into five

23

subgroups. The genetic co-clustering of BetaCoVs among closely related bats reflects host taxon-

24

specificity with each bat family as the host for a specific BetaCoV group, potentially a natural barrier

25

against random transmission. The divergent pathway of BetaCoV and host evolution suggests that the

26

viruses were introduced just prior to bat dispersal and speciation. As such, deviant patterns were

27

observed such as for 2D-IV, wherein cross-taxon transmission due to overlap in bat habitats and

28

geographic range among genetically divergent African bat hosts could have played a strong role on their

29

shared CoV lineages. In fact, a few bat taxa especially the subfamily Pteropodinae were shown to host

30

diverse groups of BetaCoVs. Therefore, ecological imbalances that disturb bat distribution may lead to

31

loss of host specificity through cross-taxon transmission and multi-CoV infection. Hence, initiatives that

Importance

38

Bat Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) pose a significant threat to global public health and have been

39

implicated in several epidemics such as the recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome

40

coronavirus 2. Here, we show that bat BetaCoVs are predominantly host-specific, which could be a

41

natural barrier against infection of other host types. However, a strong overlap in bat habitat and

42

geographic range may facilitate viral transmission to unrelated hosts, and a few bat families have already

43

been shown to host multi-CoV variants. We predict that continued disturbances on the ecological balance

44

may eventually lead to loss of host specificity. When combined with enhanced wildlife-livestock-human

45

interfaces, spillover to humans may be further facilitated. We should therefore start to define the

46

ecological mechanisms surrounding zoonotic events. Global surveillance should be expanded and

47

strengthened to assess the complete picture of bat coronavirus diversity and distribution and their

48

potential to cause spillover infections.

Introduction

51

Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases greatly affect public health and global economies

52

(1). These diseases involve pathogenic strains that recently evolved, pathogens that infect human

53

population for the first time, and pathogens that re-occur at higher frequency (2). Majority of these

54

emerging infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms from non-human source or zoonotic

55

pathogens from wild animals (3). In particular, emerging infectious diseases due to coronavirus (CoV)

56

infections have been receiving significant global attention as exemplified by the severe acute respiratory

57

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002-2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome

58

coronavirus (MERS CoV) outbreak in 2012, and the recent SARS-CoV2 pandemic which causes the

59

Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), all of which have been linked to bats as the original source (4-

60

7).

61

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are pleiomorphic, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses with three

62

major structural proteins; a nucleocapsid protein (N) which functions in encapsidating genomic RNA and

63

facilitating its incorporation into virions, a small integral membrane protein (M) with intrinsic membrane-

64

bending properties that plays a central role in viral assembly, an envelope glycoprotein (E), and a large

65

spike protein (S) which functions in viral entry and pathogenesis (8-11). CoVs are considered to have the

66

largest genome among RNA viruses at approximately 27 to 30 kb (6). There are four genera by which

67

CoVs are classified, namely Alphacoronaviruses, Betacoronaviruses, Gammacoronaviruses and

68

Deltacoronaviruses (12). Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) are of particular importance as the SARS-CoV,

69

MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 which have caused global epidemics belong to this lineage (5).

70

Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) are further classified into subgenera Embecovirus (also lineage 2A and

71

includes Murine CoV and ChRCoV HKU24), Sarbecovirus (lineage 2B and includes SARS-related CoVs),

72

Merbecovirus (lineage 2C and includes Ty-BatCoV HKU4, Pi-BatCoV HKU5, Hp-BatCoV HKU25, and

73

MERS-related CoVs), Nobecovirus (lineage 2D and includes Ro-BatCoV HKU9 and Ro-BatCoV

74

GCCDC1), and Hibecovirus (lineage 2E and includes Bat Hp-betaCoV Zhejiang2013) (13).

75

HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both human coronaviruses (HCoVs), were first discovered in

76

patients with mild respiratory illness (14). Two new species of HCoVs, the HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1

77

were also discovered in 2004 and 2005, respectively (15). Disease types caused by HCoVs usually range

78

from gastrointestinal infections, upper respiratory infections, and lower respiratory infections such as

79

pneumonia (16). Further studies revealed that CoVs cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological

80

diseases in animals like bats, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, mice, horses, and whales (17). Moreover, the

81

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which have clear zoonotic origins have also been found to cause lower

82

respiratory infections such as pneumonia. In particular, SARS-CoV has been associated with diffuse

83

alveolar damage (DAD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while MERS-CoV has been

84

linked to renal failure (16). Recently, SARS-CoV2 has been reported to cause pneumonia, ARDS and

85

multiple organ failure (7,18). CoVs can be transmitted via fecal-oral route, respiratory, as well as contact

86

transmission (19). The spread of SARS-CoV has been primarily attributed to human-human transmission

87

via direct contact with respiratory droplets and exposure to fomites (20). Similarly, although no evidence

88

of being sustained, human-human transmission has also been reported for MERS-CoV infections (21).

89

The World Health Organization (WHO) released guidelines on how to limit human-human transmission,

90

and reduce the risk of animal-human transmission in order to contain the rapidly spreading COVID-19

91

disease that started in Wuhan, China (22).

92

There is increasing evidence for the role of bats as hosts of emerging pathogens, specifically

93

viruses (23). Bats (Order: Chiroptera) are one of the most diverse and widely distributed animals, second

94

only to rodents as the most speciose order in class Mammalia (24). They are classified into two suborders,

95

Yinpterochiroptera, which include

96

(Rhinolophidae), and megabats or fruit bats (Pteropodidae); and Yangochiroptera which includes vesper

97

bats (Vespertilionidae), sac-winged bats (Emballonuridae) and bulldog bats (Noctilionidae) (25). A

98

significant number of CoVs can be found in bats, thus future spill-over events presents a constant threat

99

to global health (26). In particular, emerging human coronaviruses have been linked to bat sources.

100

Although camels were the source of the MERS-CoV in the Middle East, a coronavirus with 100% nt

101

identity to that of human Î²-CoV 2c EMC/2012 isolated from a case-patient has been found in bats at a

102

detection rate of 3.5% (27). SARS-like coronaviruses with 92% identity to that of human SARS-CoV

103

isolates have also been detected in horseshoe bats in China. Three species of horseshoe bats from

104

China namely Rhinolophus pearsoni, R. pussilus and R. macrotis demonstrated 28%, 33% and 78%

105

SARS-CoV seroprevalence, respectively (28). Furthermore, SARS-CoV2 was found to be 96% identical

106

to a bat coronavirus at the whole genome level (29). Bat CoVs (BtCoVs) comprise only 6% of the current

107

CoV database although roughly 3,000 genetic lineages of BtCoVs are believed to circulate worldwide (30).

108

It has also been suggested that future CoV outbreaks can be geographically predicted based on the

109

specific bat species distribution (12). These highlight the need to expand our knowledge on BtCoVs,

110

particularly on their diversity, distribution, host association, and evolution to understand their potential for

111

zoonotic transmission. In this study, these parameters were assessed by classifying representative and

112

unresolved BetaCoVs based on network and phylogenetic analysis of their RNA-dependent RNA

113

polymerase sequences and evaluating patterns of geographic and host distribution. The analysis

114

validated the current classification scheme of BetaCoVs with potentially novel groupings and

the false vampire bats (Megadermatidae), horseshoe

bats

115

subgroupings identified. Comparative phylogenetics demonstrated a strong tendency towards host

116

specificity of bat BetaCoVs although there was poor evidence of co-evolution with their hosts.

Results

119

CoV detection in fruit bats from Southern Philippines

120

Small and large intestine samples were collected from 49 bat individuals, 67.35% of which belong

121

to the lesser dog-faced fruit bat Cynopterus brachyotis mostly from residential sites but also present in the

122

agricultural and forest sites, 20.41% to Rousettus amplexicaudatus all from agricultural sites, and 10.2%

123

to the long-tongued nectar bat Macroglossus minimus mostly collected from agricultural sites (Table 1).

124

Only one (2.04%) cave nectar bat Eonycteris spelaea was collected, which was captured in a forest site.

125

Out of the 49 fruit bats tested, seven (14.29%) were positive for BtCoV based on RT-nPCR detection, all

126

of which were from the bat species C. brachyotis (Table 1). The species-level detection rate of CoV

127

among the C. brachyotis samples was 21.2% (7 out of 33), with five individuals positive for the small

128

intestine samples, and two other individuals positive for the large intestine samples (Table 1). Most of the

129

CoV-positive bats were females and juveniles that were captured in residential and forest sites near a

130

watershed reservation (supplemental data).

131
132

Phylogenetic relationships of global CoVs

133

A phylogenetic tree based on the partial RdRp gene sequences of CoVs obtained from this study

134

and those mined from the NCBI database representing CoVs from various bat species, domestic and wild

135

animals, as well as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the SARS-CoV2, all from human patients was generated

136

(Figure 1). Alpha and BetaCoVs each formed a distinct lineage from a common ancestor. Based on

137

reference sequences, BetaCoVs diverged to five major phylogenetic clades classified as 2A

138

(Embecovirus), 2B (Sarbecovirus), 2C (Merbecovirus), 2D (Nobecovirus), the recently proposed 2E

139

(Hibecovirus) (13), and an unresolved clade which formed a genetic cluster distinct from the rest of the

140

currently recognized BetaCoV subgroups. The same CoV groupings were supported by the network

141

analysis using median-joining (Fig. 2A) and principal coordinate analysis using the distance matrix (Fig.

142

2B), wherein sequences from each clade and sub-clade formed corresponding unique and distinct

143

clusters. Clade 2A was composed of human CoV (HCoV-OC43), porcine CoV (JL/2008), BtCoV

144

(KX285045), and cattle CoV (NC_003045). Clade 2B was composed of human SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2,

145

SARS-like CoVs, and unclassified BtCoVs, while clade 2C was composed of human MERS-CoV, camel

146

MERS-like CoVs, BtCoVs such as HKU5-1, and unclassified BtCoVs. BtCoVs such as HKU9 and

147

GCCDC1 formed clade 2D along with many unclassified BtCoVs, which further diverged into five distinct

148

subgroupings 2D-I to 2D-V. Clade 2E was composed of Bat HP-BetaCoV/Zhejiang2013 which is currently

149

the only recognized strain that belongs to the subgenus Hibecovirus (13). Finally, the unresolved clade is

150

composed of unclassified BtCoVs. The phylogenetic tree captured the current classification scheme for

151

BetaCoVs with novel information on Nobecovirus subclassification. However, deviant samples were also

152

observed such as BetaCoVs from Rhinolophus pusillus and Myotis dasycneme that clustered with the

153

AlphaCoV lineage as consistently demonstrated by the phylogenetic, network, and principal coordinate

154

analyses (Fig. 1 and 2).

155
156

Geographical distribution of bat CoVs

157

The regional distribution of bat CoVs comprising the major clades and subclades were examined

158

using the network analysis as shown in Figure 3 and Table 2. Results showed a heterogeneous

159

geographical distribution of CoVs for most of the clades, except for the 2D-II and 2D-IV subclade, which

160

were exclusively found in bats from Southeast Asia and Africa, respectively. In contrast, Clade 2B or the

161

Sarbecoviruses was distributed in Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Clade 2C or the

162

Merbecoviruses also had regionally diverse distribution in East Asia, Middle East, Europe, Africa, and

163

South America. The fruit bat subclade 2D-I also has a wide distribution from Africa, East Asia, and

164

Southeast Asia, 2D-III in East and Southeast Asia, and 2D-V in South and Southeast Asia. The single

165

representative CoV in 2E was from East Asia. The mammalian CoVs in 2A were from East Asia,

166

Southeast Asia and North America, while the unresolved clade consisted of unclassified BtCoVs from

167

South America.

Bat hosts of BetaCoV groups

170

The bat hosts were further evaluated to determine common patterns within the BetaCoV lineages.

171

Network analysis revealed a heterogenous composition in most of the clades or subclades in terms of the

172

bat source (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Clade 2A included one BtCoV from Pteropus alecto. Clade 2B, which

173

includes the human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, was primarily composed of BtCoVs from horseshoe

174

bats (family Rhinolophidae) belonging to Rhinolophus sp. (67%), along with some Old World leaf-nosed

175

bats (family Hipposideridae) such as Rhinonicteris aurantia and Hipposideros galeritus. Clade 2C of

176

MERS-CoV was primarily composed of vesper bat hosts (family Vespertilionidae) such as Pipistrellus sp.,

177

Neoromicia capensis, Hypsugo savii, Nyctalus noctula, Eptesicus sp., and Vespertilio sinensis, wherein

178

majority were sampled from Pipistrellus (46%). A CoV from Eumops glaucinus of the free-tailed bats

179

(family Molossidae) was also found to cluster with this group. Meanwhile, clade 2D consisted primarily of

180

fruit bat hosts (family Pteropodidae) and showed distinct subgroupings. CoVs from subfamilies

181

Rousettinae (Rousettus sp. and Eonycteris spelaea), Pteropodinae (Dobsonia sp.), and Macroglossini

182

(Macroglossus minimus) formed the subclade 2D-I and 2D-III, majority of which were sampled from the

183

genus Rousettus (67%). CoVs from subfamilies Cynopterinae (Cynopterus sp., Dyacopterus spadiceus,

184

Megaerops niphanae, and Ptenochirus jagori), and Macroglossini (Macroglossus minimus) formed

185

subclade 2D-II, with the genus Cynopterus (83%) as the predominantly sampled group. 2D-IV was

186

composed of CoVs mostly sampled from the African bat Eidolon helvum (subfamily Pteropodinae) (32%),

187

and the rest from other African fruit bats of subfamily Epomophorinae (Micropteropus pusillus,

188

Epomophorus sp., Epomops franqueti, Megaloglossus woermanni, and Mynonycteris angolensis),

189

subfamily Rousettinae (R. aegyptiacus), and family Hipposidiridae (Triaenops persicus). Subclade 2D-V

190

was composed solely of CoVs from Pteropus sp., commonly known as flying foxes (subfamily

191

Pteropodinae), while the sole BtCoV representative in clade 2E has been detected in Hipposideros pratti

192

(family Hipposidiridae). Finally, the unresolved clade was composed of American leafed (family

193

Phyllostomidae) and mustached (family Mormoopidae) bat hosts.

194
195

Comparative phylogenetics of BetaCoVs and their bat hosts

196

Phylogenetic analysis using the cytB gene was subsequently conducted to understand the

197

evolutionary relationships of the bat hosts within BetaCoV lineages (Fig. 5A). The microbats (suborder

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.076281; this version posted May 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

198

Yangochiroptera) formed two distinct lineages: the vesper bats versus the American leafed, mustached,

199

and free-tailed bats. The megabats (suborder Yinpterochiroptera) also formed lineages corresponding to

200

the three families: horseshoe, Old World leaf-nosed, and fruit bats. Furthermore, the fruit bats were sub-

201

divided accordingly into Macroglossini, Pteropodinae, Cynopterinae, Rousettinae, and Epomophorinae

202

lineages, except for E. helvum which was separated from the Pteropodinae group.

203

In general, there was a genetic clustering of bat hosts found within BetaCoV lineages. The 2B

204

BetaCoVs was comprised of horseshoe and Old World leaf-nosed bat hosts that shared a common

205

ancestor. A similar pattern was observed for 2C and the 2D subgroups. The 2C BetaCoVs was composed

206

of vesper bat hosts, 2D-I/2D-III of Rousettinae bat hosts, 2D-II of Cynopterinae bat hosts, and 2D-IV of

207

Epomophorinae bat hosts, wherein each bat group also formed their corresponding genetic clade. The

208

2D-V subgroup was composed of solely Pteropus sp. which belongs to Pteropodinae. Finally, the

209

unresolved CoV clade was represented by American leafed and mustached microbat hosts (P. davyii and

210

A. lituratus) that clustered with a common ancestor. Meanwhile, 2E was represented by only one bat host:

211

Hipposideros sp. of the Old World leaf nosed bats.

212

However, some deviations were also noted. For example, bat hosts that belong to genetically

213

unrelated taxa were mixed in some BetaCoV groups. The Mollosidae bat Eumops glaucinus was found in

214

2C BetaCoV of vesper bats, the Pteropodinae Dobsonia moluccensis in 2D-I of Rousettinae bats, the

215

Pteropodinae Macroglossus minimus both in 2D-II of Cynopterinae bats and 2D-III of Rousettinae bats,

216

and the Pteropodinae Eidolon helvum, Rousettinae Rousettus aegyptiacus, and Hipposideridae/Old

217

World leaf-nosed bat Trianeops persicus in 2D-IV of Epomophorinae bats. Looking at the host, certain bat

218

families were observed to harbor BetaCoVs that belong to various lineages. The Rousettinae bats were

219

found to carry both 2D-I/2D-III and 2D-IV BetaCoVs, and the Old World fruit bats 2B, 2D-IV, and 2E. The

220

subfamily Pteropodinae also hosted Nobecoviruses from various groups such as 2A (P. alecto), 2D-I (D.

221

moluccensis), 2D-II (D. spadiceus and M. minimus), 2D-III (M. minimus), 2D-IV (E. helvum), and 2D-V

222

(Pteropus sp.).

223

The divergence of the bats and their BetaCoVs were compared to evaluate common evolutionary

224

pathways (Fig. 5B). The vesper microbats diverged as a separate group from the rest of the bats. The

225

remaining bats further diverged into different clades: the first one comprised of the other microbat families

226

(American leafed, mustached and free-tailed bats), and the second clade splitting into horseshoe bats,

227

Old World leaf-nosed bats, and fruit bats, with the former two sharing a much recent common ancestor.

228

For the corresponding viruses however, the evolutionary pattern was different. The unresolved microbat

229

CoVs were the first to diverge from the rest of the bat BetaCoVs. The vesper microbat CoVs (2C) on the

230

other hand appear to have diverged together with the Old World leaf-nosed megabat CoVs (2E). Finally,

231

the mammalian CoVs (2A) emerged from a lineage of bat BetaCoVs.

232
233

Discussion

234

A global analysis was conducted for BetaCoVs of human, animal, and bat origins including a

235

complete set of representatives from the updated CoV classification (13). The major clades inferred from

236

the generated Bayesian phylogenetic tree using partial RdRp sequences was consistent with previously

237

reported classification of BetaCoVs (2A or Embecoviruses, 2B or Sarbecoviruses, 2C or Merbecoviruses,

238

2D or Nobecoviruses, and 2E or Hibecoviruses) using whole genome sequences of representative strains

239

(12) and was able to position formerly unclassified bat CoVs. A new clade of unclassified bat BetaCoVs

240

that is genetically distinct from the currently recognized groups was also observed. This classification can

241

correct the GenBank annotation of deviant samples such as the BetaCoVs that grouped with AlphaCoVs,

242

and add information on the currently unclassified BetaCoVs in GenBank. This is also the first report on

243

the comprehensive classification of Nobecoviruses, of which there are currently only two recognized

244

groups: Ro-BtCoV HKU9 and Ro-BtCoV GCCDC1 (12). Our analysis of unclassified BetaCoVs suggests

245

that Nobecovirus diversity may have been underestimated in previous reports. We therefore propose the

246

subclassification of Nobecoviruses into five subgroups (2D-I to 2D-V), which can help update surveillance

247

records and facilitate monitoring of CoV populations in the wild.

248

The congruent association between the genetic clustering of bat CoVs and their bat hosts at

249

different taxonomic levels (family, subfamily, and genus) and regardless of location suggests bat taxon-

250

specific BetaCoV lineages: horseshoe and Old World leaf-nosed bats for 2B Sarbecoviruses, vesper bats

251

for 2C Merbecoviruses, fruit bats for 2D Nobecoviruses, and the closely related American leafed and

252

mustached bats for the new BetaCoV clade. Similar trends were observed upon further analysis of the

253

Nobecoviruses and their subclades: 2D-I and 2D-III BetaCoVs were found mostly in Rousettinae bats,

254

2D-II in Cynopterinae bats, and 2D-V in Pteropus bats. A conclusive finding could not be generated from

255

the single representative Old World leaf-nosed bat for 2E Hibecovirus. These findings support previous

256

reports (31) which we have expanded here to identify the specific bat taxon associated with each

257

BetaCoV group and a more extensive analysis of fruit bat CoVs. Network analysis showed no clear trends

258

in the geographical distribution of closely related BetaCoVs except for 2D-IV, which is composed of four

259

genetically distinct bat hosts (family Pteropodidae subfamily Pteropodinae, Epomophorinae, and

260

Rousettinae; and family Hipposideridae), but all of which are found in Africa. Hence, host specificity could

261

play a major role in BetaCoV diversity, except for 2D-IV for which geography may have a stronger

262

influence.

263

Host specificity is uncommon in other bat-infecting viruses such as Paramyxoviruses and

264

Papillomaviruses, which have been reported to have prevalent host switches (32,33). Indeed, bats have a

265

predominant viral sharing network, suggesting that cross-species transmission events are common (34).

266

In contrast, our findings support a previously proposed hypothesis that CoVs limit cross-species

267

transmission within related bat taxa (31), which is indicative of a preferred adaptation to a certain range of

268

hosts. Various lines of evidence have indicated bat-specific infectivity of CoVs. In one study, BtCoVs from

269

primary infection of C. brachyotis had a reduced level of replication when experimentally inoculated to

270

Rousettus leschenaultii (35). Similarly, the SARS-like WIV1-CoV, which was isolated from Rhinolophus

271

sinicus bats and demonstrated positive replication in R. sinicus cell lines, showed weak infection in

272

Rousettus sp. bats and cell lines (36-38). Indeed, our analysis showed that BetaCoVs from Rousettus sp.

273

(2D-I, 2D-III or 2D-IV) are genetically distinct from Cynopterus sp. (2D-II) or Rhinolophus sp. (2B).

274

Analysis of bat SARS-like CoV proteins demonstrated the absence of any selective pressure for evolution

275

(39), suggesting that bat CoVs have already reached optimal fitness in their host. Factors that limit

276

transmission to a different host taxon include cell surface receptors, the immune response, and

277

replication fitness (40). These factors may serve as important natural barriers in the transmission of bat

278

BetaCoVs, which can advantageously limit host jumping and co-infection, which otherwise may generate

279

new virus strains with the ability to switch animal hosts (41,42).

280

Although bat BetaCoVs are host taxon-specific, their evolutionary pathways are different from

281

bats, as has been reported in another study (31), suggesting that the virus did not have a long-term co-

282

evolution with its host. Instead, this is indicative that the currently circulating viruses may have been

283

introduced relatively recently, i.e. to the most recent common ancestors of each bat taxon but prior to

284

global dispersion and speciation, during which the virus acquired adaptation to its host. The recent

285

introduction of BetaCoVs in bats implies that other factors may have had the opportunity to influence

286

virus-host dynamics. In the succeeding discussions, we will present two deviant phenomena that

287

exemplify this: cross-taxon transmission of CoVs and bat hosts with multi-CoV lineages.

288

We provide genetic evidence for cross-taxon transmission as indicated by genetically unrelated

289

bats that host BetaCoVs of the same lineage. For example, the Mollosidae bat Eumops glaucinus and

290

vesper bats harbored CoVs that belong to 2C. E. glaucinus has a wide distribution in South America that

291

overlaps with the vesper bat Eptesicus sp. (43,44), which is an opportunity for cross-species transmission

292

of CoVs. Another example is the Pteropodinae bat Dobsonia moluccensis, Dyacopterus spadiceus, and

293

M. minimus that carried Nobecoviruses from various subgroups. Dobsonia sp. and Rousettinae bats are

294

primarily cave dwellers that have been documented to co-roost in the same cave habitat (45-49), which

295

could explain their shared BetaCoVs from lineage 2D-I . Evidence of forage site overlap has also been

296

documented for Cynopterus sp. and other Pteropodinae bats such as M. minimus which also feeds on

297

banana and palm trees, and Dyacopterus spadiceus which have been documented to feed together with

298

Cynopterus horsfieldii in the same foliage site (45). Here, we reported that these Cynopterinae and

299

Pteropodinae bats have BetaCoVs that commonly belong to 2D-II. A final example is 2D-IV, which is

300

composed of four genetically distinct bat hosts from Epomophorinae, Pteropodinae (E. helvum),

301

Rousettinae (R. aegyptiacus), and Hipposidiridae/Old World leaf-nosed bats (T. persicus). The diverse

302

hosts of 2D-IV could be explained by overlaps in foraging, roosting, and distribution of African bats. For

303

example, Rousettus aegyptiacus has been reported to share the same foraging site with Epomophorus

304

gambianus (50). Meanwhile, Eidolon helvum roosts gregariously, exhibiting an annual migration pattern

305

as a function of food supply and has a wide distribution range in the African continent (51-53), which

306

overlaps with the distribution and range of other Epomophorinae fruit bats in Africa. Triaenops persicus is

307

also widely distributed in Eastern Africa, Middle East, and South Western Asia (54,55). Altogether, these

308

imply that cross-taxon transmission of CoVs is most likely facilitated by close interactions brought about

309

by an overlap of roosting and foraging habitat as well as geographic range of the bat hosts.

310

Our analysis also revealed that certain bat taxa such as Rousettinae, Hipposideridae (Old World

311

fruit bats), and Pteropodinae harbor multi-CoV lineages. We hypothesize that certain host factors such as

312

conserved cellular receptor motifs unique to some bat families are accessible to various forms of the CoV

313

Spike protein (S) specifically the corresponding receptor-binding motif (RBM), thereby predisposing them

314

to infection by various CoV lineages. It has been reported that different receptor-binding S1 subunit C-

315

terminal domains (S1-CTDs) from different coronavirus lineages can recognize the same receptor (56).

316

For example, the Lys353 amino acid in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) plays a crucial role

317

for the binding of the SARS-CoV and the HCoV-NL63, both of which are very divergent coronaviruses,

318

the former being a Betacoronavirus, and the latter belonging to the alphacoronavirus lineage.

319

Independent evolution of different RBDs in coronaviruses could lead to the recognition of the same virus-

320

binding hotspot (56). Bats that can host a wide range of CoVs have the potential to propagate novel

321

viruses. It is therefore recommended that the BtCoV database be expanded through sustained

322

surveillance efforts covering more bat species especially from these three families in order to determine

323

their full range of CoV lineages.

324

The phylogenetic analysis in this study points to bats as potential origins of other mammalian

325

CoVs (2A).

326

infection of a different host species (40). This entails a strong selection pressure, and all the more when

327

switching to other animal hosts (35-38). A good demonstration of this is the evolution of human SARS-

328

CoV which is believed to have occurred in a stepwise fashion, with the spike protein undergoing early

329

selective pressure probably to mediate the switch from animal to human hosts, followed by the RdRp in

330

the late stages to facilitate a more efficient replication in humans (42). Furthermore, the human MERS-

331

CoV EMC/2012 was found to replicate in Artibeus jamaicensis bats, as well as in various cell lines from

332

different bat families that have never been reported to host MERS-CoV strains (37,57). Viral strains with

333

broad-spectrum tropism such as human SARS and MERS CoV are the result of an evolutionarily

334

acquired ability that combined the use of new receptors, host immune evasion, and efficient replication in

335

various host species (36,38,57,58). Anthropogenic activities such as climate changes affect the

336

distribution of previously geographically restricted disease vectors (59). Continued ecological imbalances

337

that alter bat distribution may eventually lead to loss of host specificity for bat BetaCoVs through cross-

Switching to another taxon would require specific genetic alterations that will facilitate

338

taxon transmission and adaptation of multiple CoV lineages. Diverse wildlife-livestock-human interfaces

339

created by urbanization (60) could further increase the selection pressure resulting to spillover events in

340

human populations. For example, SARS-CoV likely evolved to infect humans through a series of

341

transmission events due to close or sustained contact between humans and animals in a wildlife market

342

in China (61). Furthermore, the recent SARS-CoV2 outbreak in China has been reported to originate from

343

a seafood market in Wuhan with exposure to wild animals (62). Considering all these factors, another

344

novel human CoV outbreak originating from bats is imminent. These highlight the need to monitor and

345

maintain the natural state of CoVs in the wild by strengthening routine surveillance of circulating CoVs,

346

proper urban planning to minimize the destruction of wildlife habitats, and limiting wildlife-livestock-human

347

interfaces such as by controlling wildlife consumption.

348

The detection rate of BtCoVs has been reported at a range of 2-30% in bats from various Asian

349

countries, wherein our 14.29% detection rate in Southern Philippines is within range (63-67). Moreover,

350

the 21.2% detection rate of CoVs in Cynopterus brachyotis from this study is lower compared to two

351

separate studies in Northern Philippines at 37% and 39%, respectively (35,63), but higher compared to

352

other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand (11%) and Singapore (5.6%) (65,66). C. brachyotis is

353

locally abundant and widely distributed throughout urbanized and secondary forests in both South and

354

Southeast Asian regions, and have a high fruit species diversity in its diet (68). It is therefore

355

recommended to explore the incidence of CoVs in the wild population of C. brachyotis in the Philippines,

356

which may present a higher risk for future spillover infection in animal and/or human populations due to

357

their presence in urban communities. On the other hand, the absence of CoV detection in other fruit bat

358

species in this study does not rule out the possibility of these bats as reservoirs. This could have been

359

due to sampling bias, i.e. non-Cynopterus species comprised only ~30% of the captured bats, which

360

highlights the need to strengthen surveillance efforts for BtCoVs in individual countries to estimate the

361

true burden of viral diversity and distribution. Should there be a novel zoonotic CoV arising from fruit bats

362

such as C. brachyotis, it is predicted to be genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2, or MERS-

363

CoV. However, this novel virus may be just as virulent or highly contagious.

Bat sampling and tissue collection

367

BtCoV samples from Southern Philippines were obtained from an exploratory surveillance. Five

368

sampling sites consisting of two agricultural sites, two residential sites and one forest site were selected

369

for bat collection at Malagos, Davao City. Forty-nine individuals, all fruit bats, non-threatened and non-

370

endemic, were collected through purposive sampling for two nights on November 16 and 17, 2018 and

371

their morphometric measurements were recorded. Bat samples collected were identified using the Key to

372

the Bats of the Philippines by Ingle and Heaney (1992) (69). Bat samples were anesthetized through an

373

intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 ml tiletamine-zolazepam and euthanized via cardiac exsanguination to

374

obtain small and large intestine samples. Prior to the conduct of the study, Wildlife Gratuitous Permit

375

(WGP No. XI-2018-07) and IACUC approval (protocol no.: 2018-019) were secured from the Department

376

of Environment and Natural Resources XI and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the

377

University of the Philippines Manila, respectively.

Coronavirus detection

380

Genomic RNA was extracted from small intestine and large intestine samples using the SV Total

381

RNA Isolation kit (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. All RNA extracts were

382

subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the one-step RT-PCR kit

383

(Qiagen, USA) and PanCoV F2 (5â-AAR TTY TAY GGH GGY TGG-3â) and PanCoV R1 (5â-GAR CAR

384

AAT TCA TGH GGD CC-3â) primers (70). The RT-PCR mix was prepared as follows: 0.4 Âµl One-step RT-

385

PCR enzyme mix, 0.4 Âµl 10 mM dNTP mix, 2 Âµl 5x One-step RT-PCR buffer, 0.2 Âµl of 10 ÂµM each of

386

PanCoV F2 and PanCoV R1 primers, 4.0 Âµl of RNase-Free water and 3 Âµl RNA extracts for a total of 10

387

Âµl per reaction. The cycling conditions were as follows: 30 minutes at 50ÂºC, 15 minutes at 95ÂºC, 40 cycles

388

at 94ÂºC for 40 seconds, 48ÂºC for 40 seconds and 72ÂºC for 1 minute. The final extension was at 72ÂºC for

389

10 minutes. Nested-PCR was subsequently performed to amplify a 435 bp bat specific region of the RNA

390

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene using in-house designed primers BatCoV F1 (5â-

391

TGACAGAGCACTGCCCAA-3â) and BatCoV R1 (5â-TTGTAACAAACAACGCCATC-3â) (71), and the 2X

392

Taq Master Mix (Vivantis, Subang Jaya, Malaysia). The nPCR mix was prepared as follows: 5 Âµl 2X Taq

393

Master Mix, 0.4 Âµl of 10 ÂµM each of BatCoV F1 and BatCoV R1 primers, 2 Âµl one-step RT-PCR product

394

and 2.2 Âµl nuclease-free water for a total of 10 Âµl per reaction. The cycling conditions for nPCR were as

395

follows: 2 minutes at 94ÂºC, 35 cycles of 40 seconds at 94ÂºC, 40 seconds at 48ÂºC, 1 minute at 72ÂºC, and a

396

final extension for 10 minutes at 72ÂºC. The expected 435 bp amplicon of the BtCoV RdRp gene was

397

visualized through electrophoresis using a 1.5% agarose gel.

398
399

Sequence processing

400

Positive amplicons with an expected size of 435 bp were excised and purified using the GF-1

401

AmbiClean Kit (Vivantis, Subang Jaya, Malaysia) and were sent to Macrogen, Korea for standard DNA

402

sequencing. Sequences were cleaned using the FinchTV software (Geospiza, USA) and distance

403

analysis was performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of the National Center for

404

Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

405
406

Phylogenetic analysis of global CoV sequences

407

CoV sequences obtained from this study, including 223 RdRp sequences of BtCoVs, 22 Human

408

CoV sequences which include SARS, MERS and the 2019-nCoV isolated from patients, and 19 CoV

409

sequences from other animal hosts such as camels, cats, dogs and pigs that were obtained from the

410

National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database were used for phylogenetic analysis.

411

Multiple sequence alignment was performed with the MAFFT software using the default algorithm and the

412

leave gappy regions function. The final alignment was trimmed and cleaned in MEGA 7 software in order

413

to come up with a 325 bp alignment of the CoV partial RdRp gene. The best phylogenetic model was

414

calculated using jModelTest v.2.1.10 (72). The executable xml file for phylogenetic analysis was prepared

415

using BEAUTi v.1.10.4 with the GTR+G+I DNA substitution and site heterogeneity model, which had the

416

lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as previously calculated in jModelTest, a length of chain of

417

100 million, strict molecular clock, and coalescent constant size model. The rest of the tree priors were

418

set to the default value. Phylogenetic inference was performed using BEAST v.1.10.4 and the log files

419

were evaluated using Tracer v.1.7.1 to see if the estimated sampling size (ESS) values for most of the

420

continuous parameters are sufficient (>200) (73,74). A Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree was

421

generated using TreeAnnotator v.1.10.4. and the resulting MCC tree was visualized with FigTree v.1.4.4

(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree). Results from phylogenetic analysis were compared with

423

principal coordinate analysis using the pairwise distance matrix of the CoV sequences using Past 3 (75)

424

and with the network analysis using median joining in terms of major clades, geographical region and

425

host genus.

426
427

Phylogenetic analysis of bats

428

Cytochrome B (Cyt B) gene of 43 different bat species representing the bat hosts of the

429

betacoronavirus lineage were obtained from the NCBI database. Phylogenetic analysis was performed in

430

the same manner as previously described for CoV sequences using a GTR+G+I DNA substitution and

431

heterogeneity model, which had the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as calculated in

432

jModelTest. The resulting bat phylogenetic trees were plotted against the CoV phylogenetic tree to

433

assess virus and host evolutionary congruence.

Figure 5. Phylogenetic relationships between CoVs (RdRp gene) and their bat host (Cyt B gene), A) bayesian phylogenetic trees generated using
bayesian inference (BEAST v.1.10.4) with the GTR+G+I DNA substitution and site heterogeniety model, strict molecular clock and coalescent
constant size, with posterior values of the well supported clades written in the nodes, B) evolutionary divergence patterns of CoVs and their bat
hosts based from the generated Bayesian phylogenetic trees.
