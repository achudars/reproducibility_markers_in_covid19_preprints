Abstract

24

Detailed genomic and structure-based analysis of a new coronavirus, namely 2019-nCoV,

25

showed that the new virus is a new type of bat coronavirus and is genetically fairly distant from

26

the human SARS coronavirus. Structure analysis of the spike (S) protein of this new virus

27

showed that its S protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells whereas the

28

human SARS coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ACE receptor. These findings suggest

29

that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to

30

cause very serious human infection. These data are important to guide design of infection control

31

policy and inform the public on the nature of threat imposed by 2019-nCov when results of direct

32

laboratory tests on this virus are not expected to be available in the near future.

33

A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, the capital City of

34

Hubei Province of China in December 2019. As of 18th January 2020, a total of 44 such cases

35

were documented, among whom two patients have died, five in critical condition, and six have

36

been discharged from hospital. Most patients had visited or worked in a seafood wholesale

37

market in Wuhan. An exception being one woman who had not been to the market but has close

38

contact with her husband, one of the patients who worked in the market before falling sick,

39

suggesting the possibility that the agent can at least undergo a limited degree of human to human

40

transmission. Apart from this couple, there is no strong evidence which suggests that the

41

unknown agent is highly infectious as no health care personnel in the hospitals where the patients

42

were admitted were infected. Three suspicious cases were reported outside China, two in

43

Thailand and one in Japan. These three patients were known to originated from or have been to

44

Wuhan.

45
46

On 6th January 2020, the Chinese authority released the sequence (accession#: MN908947) of a

47

novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, which was isolated from one of the pneumonia

48

patients and confirmed to be the causative agent for this outbreak. Coronaviruses are a large

49

family of viruses, most of which cause mild infections such as the common cold, but some such

50

as the SARS and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) viruses cause severe and potential

51

fatal respiratory tract infections. Some coronaviruses are known to be transmitted easily between

52

humans, while others do not. Based on currently available information, the 2019-nCoV virus

53

belongs to a category that can cause severe illness in some patients but does not transmit readily

54

between people. It is necessary to investigate the genetic and functional data of this new virus

55

and compare to other coronaviruses so as to guide future research and design of appropriate

56

infection control policy to prevent widespread dissemination of another potentially deadly

57

coronavirus since the emergence of the SARS and MERS viruses. In this study, we performed

58

in-depth genetic analysis of 2019-nCoV and generated data which provide timely and valuable

59

insight into the potential origin of this virus, its ability to cause human infection, and its genetic

60

relatedness with SARS and MERS.

61
62

Phylogenetic analysis of genomic sequences of coronaviruses deposited in the GenBank revealed

63

that 2019-nCoV belonged to betacoronavirus and exhibited the closest linkage with two SARS-

64

like coronavirus from bat (bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21) (Fig 1a). According to the

65

phylogenetic tree, human SARS viruses were closest to bat SARS-like viruses but with a lesser

66

degree to bat coronaviruses, and was least related to other coronaviruses. The 2019-nCoV stands

67

in a position between bat SARS-like viruses and bat coronaviruses, suggesting it is less related to

68

the human SARS virus than other bat SARS-like viruses, and is likely a new type of bat

69

coronavirus. Nevertheless, all coronaviruses that exhibit close linkage with 2019-nCoV

70

originated from bat, strongly suggesting that this new coronavirus originated from bat (Fig 1a).

71

Coronaviruses of other species including the murine coronavirus are genetically distant from this

72

new coronavirus, indicating that 2019-nCoV did not originate from other animal hosts. As bats

73

are not sold in the Wuhan market, animals that serve as the transmission vehicle remains to be

74

identified (1, 2).

75
76

The sequence of 2019-nCoV was annotated and aligned with several representative

77

coronaviruses selected according to the degree of genetic relatedness depicted by the

78

phylogenetic tree (Fig 1b). These included two highly homologous human SARS coronavirus:

79

SARS CoV P2 (FJ882963) and SARS CoV ZJ02 (EU371559), one bat SARS virus that exhibits

80

high homology with human SARS virus and similar potential to infect human as human SARS

81

coronavirus: bat SARS CoV W1V1 (KF367457) (3), two bat SARS-like viruses that were not

82

able to infect human: (bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Rp Shaanxi2011), and two un-related

83

coronaviruses, the MERS virus MERS CoV (NC019843) and the Avian Infectious Bronchitis

84

(IBV) virus IBV CoV (AY646283). The new 2019-nCoV was annotated slightly different from

85

the human SARS virus and other coronaviruses, but the functionally important ORFs, ORF1a

86

and ORF1b, and major structural proteins including the spike (S), membrane (M) and envelop (E)

87

and nucleic capsid (N) proteins are well annotated (Fig 1b). Consistent with the phylogenetic

88

tree data, 2019-nCoV did not align well with the MERS and IBV virus (Fig S1). Among the

89

SARS viruses, bat coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV, the non-structural proteins generally aligned

90

well but variations were observable in major structural proteins and some small ORFs (Fig 1b).

91

Detailed sequence alignment showed that 2019-nCoV exhibited significant sequence variation at

92

several regions with the human SARS coronavirus including the N-terminal region of ORF1a

93

and S protein, ORF3, E, ORF6, 7 and 8, and the middle part of N protein. Bat SARS-like virus

94

W1V1 aligned well with human SARS virus P2, with some variations at ORF8 and an insertion

95

between ORF6 and 7. Coronavirus 2019-nCoV aligned best with the bat SARS-like virus bat-

96

SL-CoVZX45, with the majority of genetic variations being seen at the N-terminal part of S

97

protein. The bat-SL-CoVZX45 virus itself exhibited a high degree of variation with another bat

98

SARS-like CoV Rp Shaanxi2011 at ORF1a, the N-terminus of S protein and other structural

99

proteins. However, bat SARS-like CoV Rp Shaanxi2011 exhibited high homology with human

100

SARS virus ZJ02, with variation being seen at the N-terminus of S protein and the middle part of

101

N protein (Fig 1b). To check if 2019-nCoV is more close to bat SARS like virus or bat

102

coronavirus, we selected two adjacent viruses from each group, bat SARSCoV Rf1/2004 and bat

103

coronavirus BM48-31/BGR/2008, to perform alignment with the new virus with result showing

104

that 2019-nCoV showed similar diversity from these two strains (Fig S1b). When 2019-nCoV

105

was aligned with bat CoV HKU9-1, another bat coronavirus with further distance, it showed that

106

2019-nCoV was very different from this virus (Fig S1c). These sequence alignment data were

107

consistent with results of phylogenetic tree analysis and indicated that 2019-nCoV exhibited

108

stands in between bat SARS like viruses and bat coronaviruses, but is genetically distant from

109

the human SARS virus. It should be considered a new type of bat coronavirus.

110
111

Since the S protein is the protein that exhibits the highest degree of genetic variations among

112

different coronaviruses, we performed phylogenetic analysis of the S protein of different

113

coronaviruses (Fig S2). Our data showed that the S protein of 2019-nCoV exhibited high

114

homology with bat SARS-like coronaviruses such as bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21,

115

human SARS virus and bat coronaviruses. Homology of S protein of 2019-nCoV with

116

representative human SARS virus, bat SARS like viruses and bat coronaviruses was determined

117

as shown in Table S2. S protein of 2019-nCoV showed about 76% homology to human SARS

118

virus P2 and high homology to bat SARS like viruses, while it showed 72% homology to closest

119

bat coronavirus, bat coronavirus BM48-31, even lower homology with other bat coronaviruses.

120

These data further suggested that 2019-nCoV is more likely a new type of bat coronavirus with

121

only loose linkage with the SARS virus. Interestingly, different regions of the S proteins

122

exhibited different levels of homology among the known coronaviruses (Fig 1b). Amino acid

123

sequence alignment showed consistently that the N-terminal regions were far more diverse than

124

the C-terminus, which seemed to be highly conservative (Fig S3a). Aligning these regions to the

6

125

structure of S protein indicated that the structurally conserved C-terminal aligned well to the

126

transmembrane domain which consists of a double helix, whereas the most variable region

127

aligned to the N-terminal domain; on the other hand, the receptor binding domain exhibited

128

intermediate level of sequence variation (Fig S3b).

129
130

Due to the high amino acid sequence homology of the S protein in 2019-nCoV and the SARS

131

virus which can cause severe human infection, we analyzed the structural similarity of this

132

protein in various viruses. Protein structure modeling was performed to obtain high quality

133

structure of S proteins from different coronaviruses (Table S1). The high level similarity

134

observable between the structures of S protein from different viruses implied that the S protein of

135

2019-nCoV and bat coronaviruses would most likely use the same human cell receptor as SARS

136

virus. It was shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the cellular receptor of

137

the SARS virus S protein (4). Complex structure of ACE2 with the receptor binding domain

138

(RBD) of S protein of SARS virus has been resolved and demonstrated tight interaction between

139

these two proteins at the interaction interface (5). These data prompted us to determine the level

140

of interaction between the S protein of 2019-nCoV with its potential cellular receptor ACE2.

141

Using modeled S protein structure and by further performing structure-based alignment, we

142

obtained the complex structure of RBD of the S protein of 2019-nCoV and several bat

143

coronaviruses with human ACE2, using the complex structure of RBS of S protein from human

144

SARS virus and ACE2 (2ajf) as reference (5). Structural analysis of potential interactions

145

between RBD of S protein from human SARS virus and ACE2 protein depicted several

146

interaction points including four hydrophobic interactions: ACE2(Y41)/ RBD(Y484), ACE2(L45)/

147

RBD(Y484), ACE2(L79, M82)/ RBD(L472), ACE2(Y83)/ RBD(Y475), one salt-bridge: ACE2(E329)/

148

RBD(R426) and one cation-π interaction: ACE2(K353)/ RBD(Y491) (Fig 2a, 2e). However,

149

examination of interaction between RBD of 2019-nCoV and human ACE2 depicted only one

150

potential hydrophobic interaction between ACE2(L79, M82) and RBD(F486) and one cation-π

151

interaction interaction ACE2(K353)/ RBD(Y492). Further examination of interactions between

152

RBD from bat SARS like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Rp Shaanxi2011 that do not

153

infect human, showed only one cation-π interaction interaction, ACE2(K353)/ RBD(Y481).

154

Another bat-originated coronavirus, bat SARS CoV W1V1 that displayed strong binding to

155

ACE2 and exhibited potential to cause human infection was also included for analysis. Binding

156

affinity of RBD from this virus to ACE2 was as tight as that of the human SARS virus, involving

157

four hydrophobic interactions: ACE2(Y41)/ RBD(Y485), ACE2(L45)/ RBD(Y485), ACE2(L79,

158

M82)/ RBD(F473), ACE2(Y83)/ RBD(Y476), one salt-bridge: ACE2(E329)/ RBD(R427) and one

159

cation-π interaction site ACE2(K353)/ RBD(Y492). These data suggested that the higher binding

160

affinity of RBD of coronavirus to ACE2 will confer the virus higher infectivity and

161

pathogenicity. The fact that the RBD of 2019-nCoV exhibited much lower affinity to ACE2

162

implies that the virulence potential of 2019-nCoV should be much lower than that of human

163

SARS virus, but is nevertheless stronger than viruses that do not cause human infection; such

164

finding is also consistent with the current epidemiological data in that 2019-nCoV only caused

165

severe pneumonia in patients with weaker immune system such as the elderlies and people with

166

underlying diseases. The weaker binding affinity of 2019-nCoV to human cell might also explain

167

the limited human to human transmission potential of this virus observed to date.

168
169

In this study, we utilized the whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus, 2019-

170

nCoV, that caused an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China to perform comparative genetic

171

and functional analysis with the human SARS virus and coronaviruses recovered from different

172

animals. Phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus of different species indicated that 2019-nCoV

173

might have originated from bat, but the intermediate transmission vehicle is not known at this

174

stage. Genetic linkage analysis showed that 2019-nCoV lied at the interface between bat SARS

175

like coronavirus and bat coronavirus and should belong to a novel type of bat coronavirus owing

176

to high degree of variation from the human SARS virus. Analysis of the potential interaction of

177

RBD of 2019-nCoV with human ACE2 receptor protein indicated that its affinity to human cell

178

is much lower than that of human SARS virus due to the loss of several important interaction

179

sites, implying that the infectivity and pathogenicity of this new virus should be much lower than

180

the human SARS virus. These data facilitate design of appropriate policies to control further

181

dissemination of this new coronavirus.

182
183

As of Jan 22, 2020, the infection cases were sharply increased in the past few days reaching a

184

total of 440 cases with 9 confirmed death. Sporadic new cases were reported in more and more

185

provinces in China. Human to human transmission has been confirmed as over 15 healthcare

186

personnel have been confirmed to be infected. These epidemiological data were quite different

187

from the data reported in the beginning and may suggest that the new virus could undergo human

188

host adaption / evolution and become more adaptive to human host leading to more efficient

189

human to human transmission. It is urgent to isolate and sequence the virus from the most recent

190

cases to trace the evolutional mutations of the new virus. Using the analysis platform that we

191

have developed above, we should be able to predict whether the new mutations could lead to the

192

increase of infectivity of the mutated virus in a very short time.
