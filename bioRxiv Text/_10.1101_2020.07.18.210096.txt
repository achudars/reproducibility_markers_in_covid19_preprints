Abstract

14

Therapies with new drugs have been appearing in tests worldwide as potential inhibitors

15

of sars-cov-2 virus replication. Recently, one of these drugs, Ivermectin, was reported as

16

an inhibitor of the nuclear import of HIV-1 proteins in vitro, soon becoming the target of

17

an international prospecting work (not yet published), with patients tested for COVID-

18

19. However, understanding the evolutionary aspects of the biological components

19

involved in the complex drug-nuclear import helps in understanding how these

20

relationships exist in the deactivation of viral infections. Thus, 153 sequences of the HIV-

21

1 integrase gene were analyzed for their genetic structure and molecular diversity and the

22

presence of two distinct groups for the Gene and not only one, was detected; As well as

23

different degrees of structuring for each of these groups. These results support the

24

interpretation of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of

25

existing polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency

26

of a drug at population levels. Thus, the molecular diversity found in HIV-1 can be

27

extrapolated to other viruses, such as Including, SARS-CoV-2 and the functionality of

28

the drug, interacting with the integrase-importin complex, can be further decreased.

1. Introduction

31

As a flattening measure of the growth curve of the number of cases of COVID-19

32

in Brazil, the recommendations of the Ministry of Health continue to be limited to the

33

monitoring and containment of the virus as well as to those of maintaining social

34

distancing, the use of face protection masks and constant hand washing. These

35

recommendations, which follow the recommendations of all the world's health agencies,

36

seem to be the most effective to inhibit the outbreak of this pandemic, which, as a direct

37

consequence of non-control, would result in the breakdown of our health system

38

(MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 2020).

39

However, a number of therapies are in tests worldwide and these range from

40

vaccines to the use of some drugs (WHO, 2020). With regard to the new drugs tested to

41

combat COVID-19, a not-so-new one (for other treatments) called IVERMECTIN,

42

figured as an alternative for its power to inhibit the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

43

in vitro. Ivermectin, a pre-tested food and drug administration (FDA) for antiparasitic use,

44

demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and

45

even two hours after infection was able to reduce the amount of viral RNA by

46

approximately 5,000 times after 48 hours. This made ivermectin a candidate for in-depth

47

investigations for possible human benefits (CALY, L. et al., 2020).

48

Even thinking about the "in vitro" characteristics of the study with ivermectin, its

49

usefulness and potentiality as therapy did not reach exhaustion. Contrary to some drugs

50

such as Chloroquine and hydroxichloroquine, discarded by who and many health agencies

51

and research centers around the world, it ended up becoming a target in an international,

52

multicenter and observational prospecting work, controlled on a case-by-case basis, using

53

data collected from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and March 31,

54

2020. These patients were exposed to doses of Ivermectin compared to patients with

55

COVID-19 who received medical treatment without ivermectin. In this study (in vivo)

56

and not yet published, the researchers assume that, in addition to being safe for use, the

57

administration of ivermectin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was directly

58

associated with the fact that a lower mortality and a shorter length of hospital stay, making

59

the difference in the survival of hospitalized patients (PATEL A.N. et al., 2020).

60

The question then became the understanding of how ivermectin acted in the

61

inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, since as an antiparasitic agent the issue of its

62

antiviral activity was still unknown. In some studies (BOLDESCU et al, 2017; CALY et

63

al, 2020; FRIEMAN et al, 2007; CAO et al., 2020; GREIN et al., 2020; FERNER et al.,

64

2020; CRUMP et al., 2017), ivermectin had been reported as an inhibitor of the nuclear

65

import of viral proteins, as the non-structural protein of the tumor antigen of the ape virus

66

SV40 (an old known molecular biology as cloning vector in ancient techniques of

67

recombinant DNA technology), and also acting in the limitation of infections of other

68

RNA viruses such as viruses of types 1 to 4 of dengue, West Nile, Venezuelan equine

69

encephalitis and influenza. Until, in studies with the HIV-1 virus (human

70

immunodeficiency virus type 1), it was finally associated with the breakdown of the

71

interaction between the ENZYME INTEGRASE of the HIV-1 virus and the heterodimer

72

α / β1 of IMPORTIN, which is the protein responsible for the nuclear import of the

73

INTEGRASE itself.

74

Since the decade of 1990, the role of integrase as an inhibitor of HIV replication

75

has been suggested by scientists as a promising opportunity in the treatment of viral

76

infections because it is a highly conserved enzyme from an evolutionary point of view

77

and therefore with less genetic variability (SPRINZ, E. 2016). Because it is very

78

conserved, it has greater difficulty in selecting mutations associated with resistance,

79

besides presenting potential synergism with other RNA viruses, including those viruses

80

that had resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors. (PURAS L. et al, 1995);

81

(ROBINSON, W.E., 1998) (BEALE K.K., ROBINSON W.E. JR. 2000); (REINKE R,

82

STEFFEN N.R., ROBINSON W.E. JR. 2001)

83

Although it has been tested in humans for three decades (SMART, T. 1996), its

84

development has been quite "truncated" by the high cost of production and its

85

pharmacokinetic limitations (such as low selectivity due to integrase, difficulties

86

encountered in its injectable use and short half-life time) preventing its clinical use

87

(SPRINZ, E. 2016). However, understanding the evolutionary aspects of this enzyme can

88

help the scientific community understand what possible relationships exist between it and

89

the drugs that interact in its connection with IMPORTIN, especially in the role of

90

destabilization of the import complex that disables viral infections, such as ivermectin.

91

Thinking like this, the team of the Laboratory of Population Genetics and Computational

92

Evolutionary Biology (LaBECom-UNIVISA) designed a study of phylogeny and

93

molecular variance analysis to evaluate the possible levels of genetic diversity and

94

polymorphisms existing in a PopSet of the integrase gene of human immunodeficiency

95

121

Of the 153 sequences of the gene segment of the integrase gene of human

immunodeficiency virus 1 with 882 bp of extension, the analyses revealed the presence

123

of 343 polymorphic sites and of these, 70 sites were parsimoniously informative. The

graphical representation of these sites could be seen in a logo built with the WEBLOGO

possible to understand that the 153 haplotypes comprised two distinct groups, here

was observed between the two groups (Figure 2).

new values θ for before and after a supposed demographic expansion and in this case

5. Discussion

197

As the use of phylogenetic analysis and population structure methodologies had

198

not yet been used in this PopSet, in this study it was possible to detect the existence of

199

these two distinct groups for the integrase gene of human immunodeficiency virus 1 in

200

the Kyrgyz region. The groups described here seem to correspond to two HIV-1

201

subpopulations that co-exist in the same locality and that had their genetic distances

202

supported by FST analyses using the marker in question and its structure sufficiently

203

significant for such interpretation. Different degrees of structuring were detected for each

204

group, being essentially smaller among one of them (Bishkek). These data suggest that

205

the high degree of structuring present in Oshi may be related to a loss of intermediate

206

haplotypes over the generations, possibly associated with an absence of gene flow.

207

These levels of structuring were also supported by simple phylogenetic pairing

208

methodologies such as UPGMA, which in this case, with a discontinuous pattern of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.210096; this version posted July 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

209

genetic divergence between the groups (supporting the occurrence of geographic

210

undercalculations resulting from past fragmentation events), was observed a large number

211

of branches with many mutational steps. These mutations possibly settled by drift due to

212

the founding effect, which accompanies the dispersal behavior and/or loss of intermediate

213

haplotypes over the generations. The values found for genetic distance support the

214

presence of this discontinuous pattern of divergence between the studied groups, since

215

they considered important the minimum differences between the groups, when the

216

haplotypes between them were exchanged, as well as the inference of values greater than

217

or equal to that observed in the proportion of these permutations, including the p value of

218

the test.

219

The discrimination of the two genetic entities in the same locality was also

220

perceived when the inter-haplotypic variations were hierarchized in all covariance

221

components: by their intra and interindividual differences or by their intra- and intergroup

222

differences, generating dendrograms that supported the idea that the significant

223

differences found in the Bishkek group, for example, can even be shared in their form,

224

but not in their number, since the result of estimates of the mean evolutionary divergence

225

within the Oshi group were so low.

226

Since no relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance was made

227

in this study, the lack of gene flow (observed by non-haplotypic sharing) should be

228

supported by the presence of geographic barriers. The estimators θ, although being

229

extremely sensitive to any form of molecular variation (Fu, 1997), supported the

230

uniformity between the results found by all the methodologies employed, and can be

231

interpreted as a phylogenetic confirmation that there is no consensus in the conservation

232

of the gene of human immunodeficiency virus integrase 1 in samples from the same

233

geographical region, being therefore safe to state that the large number of polymorphisms

234

existing , should be reflected, including, in its protein product (integrase enzyme). This

235

consideration provides certainty that an efficient response of drugs that destabilize the

236

integrase-importin link such as ivermectin should not be expected for all HIV1 viruses

237

from humans, whether they come from the same geographic region (as this study shows),

238

or even more from samples from geographically distinct regions and thus, by

239

extrapolating the levels of polymorphism and molecular diversity found in the samples

240

of this study , for other RNA viruses, such as Sars-Cov-2, the integrase-importin

241

relationship may be even more diverse, and may bring less and less functionality to drugs

243

turn inhibit or reduce the infectious potential of any RNA virus.
