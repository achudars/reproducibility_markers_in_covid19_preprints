SUMMARY
Translation of open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) in severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF)
promoted by an RNA pseudoknot. The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 replication may be
sensitive to changes in −1 PRF efficiency is currently unknown. Through an unbiased, reporterbased high-throughput compound screen, we identified merafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone
antibacterial, as a −1 PRF inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin is
robust to mutations within the pseudoknot region and is similarly effective on −1 PRF of other
beta coronaviruses. Importantly, frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin substantially impedes
SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, thereby providing the proof of principle of targeting −1
PRF as an effective antiviral strategy for SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of
COVID-19, belongs to a family of zoonotic human coronaviruses. Upon the entry of SARS-CoV2 into host cells, the first set of viral proteins being translated from the single-stranded genomic
RNA are encoded by the long (>21kb) ORF1ab, which takes up ~2/3 of the entire viral genome
(Figure 1A) (Finkel et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). The long polyprotein encoded by ORF1ab is
subsequently processed into 16 individual nonstructural proteins (nsp) by two proteases,
PLpro/nsp3 and 3CLpro/nsp5. The 3ʹ half of ORF1ab, ORF1b, encodes enzymes critical for viral
transcription and replication, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp/nsp12), an
RNA helicase (Hel/nsp13), a proofreading exoribonuclease and N7-guanosine
methyltransferase (ExoN/nsp14), an endonuclease (NendoU/nsp15), and a 2'-Omethyltransferase (nsp16). In all coronaviruses, translation of ORF1b requires a −1 PRF event
(Plant et al., 2005). When ribosomes arrive at the end of ORF1a, instead of continuing
elongation and soon terminating at an adjacent stop codon in the 0 frame, a subset of
ribosomes backtrack by one nucleotide and are repositioned in the -1 reading frame before
continuing the translation elongation cycle, thereby producing a complete ORF1ab fusion
polyprotein. The −1 PRF region often contains two main components: a heptanucleotide
slippery sequence (UUUAAAC in SARS-CoV-2) and a downstream stable secondary structure
acting as a frameshift-stimulating element (FSE), which is thought to facilitate −1 PRF in part by
transiently pausing the incoming ribosome, allowing tRNAs to realign within the slippery
sequence. RNA pseudoknots are the most common type of FSEs found in a variety of RNA
viruses (Atkins et al., 2016; Namy et al., 2006). In SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other beta
coronaviruses, a three-stem pseudoknot (Figure 1B) has been proposed to act as the
productive conformation (Plant et al., 2005), although conformational dynamics of this region
have recently been observed (Huston et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).

Sun et al., page 4
In contrast to its wide adoption by RNA viruses, −1 PRF is much less prevalent in endogenous
mRNAs (Atkins et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2007; Michel et al., 2012). Therefore, viral PRF has
been considered an attractive target for specifically interfering with viral gene expression
(Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012; Dinman et al., 1998). Indeed, mutations and drugs that alter PRF
efficiency have been shown to handicap HIV-1 replication (Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012; GarciaMiranda et al., 2016; Hung et al., 1998). In addition, an interferon-induced host protein,
Shiftless(SHFL), has been shown to interact with HIV-1 FSE RNA, inhibit −1 PRF, and restrict
HIV-1 replication (Wang et al., 2019), suggesting that frameshift inhibition has become part of
the host antiviral response. Several compounds have recently been shown to modulate −1 PRF
of SARS-CoV-2 to varying degrees (Chen et al., 2020; Haniff et al., 2020; Kelly et al., 2020),
although the specificity of these compounds and their antiviral activity remain unclear.
Here we show that merafloxacin, a member of a large family of antibacterial compounds known
as fluoroquinolones, inhibits −1 PRF of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, as well as that of other beta
coronaviruses. Inhibition of −1 PRF by merafloxacin impeded SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero
E6 cells, indicating that merafloxacin represents a promising lead compound for the
development of a novel class of PRF-targeting antivirals.

RESULTS
A high-throughput screen identifies SARS-CoV-2 PRF modulators
To quantify −1 PRF efficiency in uninfected cells, we constructed a plasmid-based frameshift
reporter (Figure 1B), replacing the stop codon of a firefly luciferase (FLuc) coding sequence (0
frame) with the SARS-CoV-2 FSE (nucleotide 13,460-13,548) including the slippery sequence
and the three-stem pseudoknot, followed by a Renilla luciferase (RLuc) coding sequence in the
−1 frame. Similar designs have been described in recent studies (Kelly et al., 2020). Several

Sun et al., page 5
observations confirmed that the relative ratio between RLuc and FLuc activity indeed reported
−1 PRF. First, a stop codon is embedded in the −1 frame near the C-terminus of FLuc, ruling
out the possibility that RLuc translation initiated within FLuc coding sequence. Second, deleting
the slippery site (ΔSS), disrupting Stem 1 of the pseudoknot by a UAC trinucleotide deletion
(ΔStem 1), and adding a 0-frame stop codon between FLuc and PRF element (FLuc-Stop), all
abolished RLuc activity (Figure 1C), further supporting that RLuc reported on −1 PRF. By using
a positive control construct in which FLuc and RLuc were translated continuously without
frameshifting, we estimated the PRF efficiency to be ~20% in HEK293T cells, consistent with
previous measurements (Kelly et al., 2020).
To make the PRF reporter more suited for high-throughput microscopy screen, we replaced
FLuc and RLuc with mCherry and GFP (Figure 1D), respectively. Similar to the luciferasebased reporter, mCh-FSE-GFP(−1) reporter yielded reduced GFP signals compared to the nonframeshifted mCh-GFP fusion construct without an in-frame stop codon (Figure 1D, E). Shifting
the GFP back to the 0 frame (mCh-FSE-GFP(0)) completely abolished GFP signal (Figure 1D,
E), consistent with the expectation that non-frameshifted ribosomes would terminate at an inframe UAA stop codon within Stem 1 (Figure 1B).
We treated HEK293T cells in 384-well plates with each of 4,434 compounds at 10 μM final
concentration (Figure 1F; Table S1A), which included 640 FDA-approved drugs, 1,600
compounds from the Pharmakon 1600 collection, and 1,872 compounds from a Tested-InHuman collection, and transfected cells with the mCherry-FSE-GFP(−1) reporter plasmids. 24
hours after transfection, total cell numbers, as well as mCherry and GFP signals in transfected
(mCherry+) cells were quantified. GFP/mCherry ratios were compared to the no-PRF mCherryGFP fusion positive control as well as the mCherry-FSE-GFP(0) negative control. Our highthroughput microscopy screens showed high robustness, with Zʹ scores ranging between 0.91
and 0.95.

Sun et al., page 6
As expected, the vast majority of the tested compounds had little or no effect on the
GFP/mCherry ratio (Figure 1G). Screen actives were selected using mean ± three standard
deviations as cutoffs. The majority of top screen actives were false positives due to their
intrinsically fluorescence (e.g., doxorubicin (red) and ampiroxicam (green)), which we ruled out
by manual inspection of images (Table S1B). We repurchased remaining eight candidates and
tested each of them using the dual luciferase-based PRF reporter assay. Out of these
candidates, two compounds, ivermectin and merafloxacin, were validated as an enhancer and
an inhibitor of −1 PRF, respectively (Figure S1). Although ivermectin has been recently shown
to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro (Caly et al., 2020) and is currently under clinical trials
against COVID-19, it showed significant cytotoxicity concomitantly with −1 PRF enhancement,
as indicated by decreased ATP production (Figure S2A) and increased cell death (Figure
S2B). In contrast, merafloxacin exhibit modest cytostatic effects at high concentrations (Figure
S2C) and did not cause cell death (Figure S2D).

Merafloxacin specifically inhibits −1 PRF of beta coronaviruses
Merafloxacin, also known as CI-934, belongs to a large group of antibacterial compounds
known as fluoroquinolones (Hooper and Jacoby, 2016; Mandell and Neu, 1986). However, none
of the 40 other fluoroquinolones in our compound library (Figure 2A) nor additional
fluoroquinolones subsequently tested (Figure S3) inhibited −1 PRF, suggesting that the varying
moieties at N1, C7, and potentially other positions may be critical for frameshift inhibition
(Figure 2B). As expected from the nearly identical FSE sequences of SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2, which differ only by one unpaired nucleotide between Stem 2 and Stem 3 (C13533A),
merafloxacin inhibited −1 PRF of both coronaviruses with virtually equal efficacy, with IC50 of
~20 µM (Figure 2C, D). By comparison, overexpression of SHFL, which has previously been

Sun et al., page 7
shown to broadly inhibit −1 PRF, only reduced SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting by ~25% (Figure
S4), consistent with a recent report (Schmidt et al., 2020).
To test whether merafloxacin may inhibit other viral or cellular −1 PRF, we constructed
additional reporters using known FSEs from four common human coronaviruses (hCoV-HKU1,
hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E, and hCoV-NL63), avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), human
immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), West Nile virus (WNV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and
human PEG10 (paternally expressed gene 10) mRNA. Interestingly, merafloxacin inhibited −1
PRF of other human beta coronaviruses, hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-OC43, with similar efficacy
(Figure 2E, F). In contrast, merafloxacin had much weaker inhibitory effect on −1 PRF of alpha
coronaviruses, hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63 (Figure 2G), whose FSEs have been proposed to
form an elaborated pseudoknot structure that substantially differs from that of beta
coronaviruses (Herold and Siddell, 1993). Lastly, merafloxacin did no inhibit −1 PRF of HIV-1,
WNV, EAV, nor human PEG10 mRNA (Figure 2G). These results suggest that −1 PRF
inhibition by merafloxacin is specific to beta coronaviruses, which share a common three-stem
pseudoknot architecture.

Frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin is robust to mutations
A rapidly replicating virus may acquire mutations that confer resistance to an antiviral. To test
whether frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin may be escaped by mutations that arise within the
FSE, we first introduced mutations that have been documented in the expanding SARS-CoV-2
genome sequence database. Consistent with the essential role of −1 PRF, mutations within the
FSE are exceedingly infrequent. Out of 20 documented single-nucleotide substitutions in this
region (Hadfield et al., 2018), only four have been observed more than once (Figure 3A). Two
of them (C13476U and C13501U) are in Stem 1, each changing a G:C pair to a G:U pair.

C13517U is in the terminal loop of Stem 3, whereas C13536U changes a G:C pair in Stem 2 to
a G:U pair. Therefore, none of these mutations are expected to disrupt the three-stem
pseudoknot architecture. Regardless of the baseline effects of these mutations, merafloxacin
inhibited −1 PRF of all of these variants with similar efficacy (Figure 3B).
Having tested these naturally occurring, structure-preserving mutations, we next introduced sets
of synonymous mutations intended to perturb the pseudoknot structure (Figure 3C). U13494G
(mutant 1, orange) disrupts a basal U:A pair in Stem 2, causing a 10% reduction in frameshifting
(Figure 3D). A13519U/G13520C/U13521A/A13533C (mutant 3, cyan) disrupt the palindromic
sequence in the terminal loop of Stem 3 (Ishimaru et al., 2013), causing a 27% decrease in
frameshifting. G13503A/C13506U/C13509A/A13512C (mutant 4, green) disrupt multiple base
pairs in Stems 1 and 3, causing a 77% reduction in frameshifting. U13524A/U13527C/C13530A
(mutant 5, purple) disrupt Stem 3, causing a 42% decrease in frameshifting. Unexpectedly, the
U13485C mutation (mutant 2, red) within the loop of Stem 1 caused a 62% decrease in
frameshifting (Figure 3D), suggesting an uncharacterized function of this presumably unpaired
uridine in promoting −1 PRF. Indeed, U13485 and the subsequent G13486 are invariable
among all human coronaviruses (Gussow et al., 2020). Despite the wide range of effects of
these structure-perturbing mutations, frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin was virtually
unchanged (Figure 3D), suggesting that −1 PRF inhibition of merafloxacin is robust to
perturbations to the FSE sequence or structure.

Frameshift inhibition impedes SARS-CoV-2 replication
The identification of a −1 PRF inhibitor allowed us to quantify the effect of frameshift inhibition
on viral replication. After infecting Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2, we treated cells with varying
concentrations of merafloxacin, and quantified viral yields with plaque formation assays. We

Sun et al., page 9
found that concomitantly with its inhibition on −1 PRF, merafloxacin inhibited SARS-CoV-2
replication starting from the lowest tested concentration (1.25 µM) (Figure 4A), with an EC50 of
2.6 μM and an EC90 of 12 μM (Figure 4B). At above 40 µM merafloxacin, viral titer dropped
below detection limit (Figure 4A). Importantly, correlating viral titer measurements with the
effect of merafloxacin on −1 PRF efficiency (Figure 2C) revealed a near-exponential decrease
in viral yield as −1 PRF was increasingly inhibited (Figure 4C), suggesting that −1 PRF
efficiency sets the limit of SARS-CoV-2 growth rate.

DISCUSSION
Coronaviruses have some of the most efficient FSEs. However, the extent to which SARS-CoV2 can tolerate changes in −1 PRF efficiency has been unclear. In one scenario, high −1 PRF
efficiency could allow coronaviruses to tolerate a small decrease in PRF efficiency while still
producing sufficient quantities of replicase components encoded by ORF1b. In this scenario, a
large reduction in −1 PRF would be required to inhibit viral growth, and drugs targeting −1 PRF
would be less effective for coronaviruses than for viruses with lower −1 PRF efficiency (e.g.,
HIV-1). The identification of a frameshift inhibitor allowed us to, for the first time, delineate the
relationship between frameshift efficiency and viral growth. Our results strongly argue against
this scenario. Instead, the near-exponential relationship between viral titer and −1 PRF
efficiency (Figure 4C) points to a simple model in which ORF1b translation sets the limit of
SARS-CoV-2 growth rate, thereby providing strong support for targeting −1 PRF as an effective
antiviral strategy for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other RNA viruses with high PRF efficiency.
Other non-exclusive models might also explain the high sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 replication to
−1 PRF inhibition. For instance, coronaviruses may require high PRF efficiency to achieve an
optimal stoichiometry between the replicase-transcriptase components, which may be disrupted

by even a small reduction in −1 PRF efficiency. In this case, increasing PRF efficiency would
also be detrimental to the virus, as has been shown for HIV-1 mutants (Garcia-Miranda et al.,
2016). Furthermore, multiple ORF1b-encoded replicase-transcriptase components may be ratelimiting for replication, in which case small reductions in each of them would multiply and
collectively cause a large effect.
The molecular mechanism by which merafloxacin inhibits −1 PRF is currently unclear. The
simplest model would involve the direct binding between merafloxacin and the FSE. Such an
interaction may either destabilize the pseudoknot conformation, thereby reducing ribosome
pausing and subsequent frameshifting or, on the contrary, further stabilize the pseudoknot
structure, thereby causing prolonged stalling, collisions, and/or queuing of the incoming
ribosomes. Contrasting ribosome occupancy profiles of either the −1 PRF reporter RNA or the
viral genomic RNA with and without merafloxacin treatment may distinguish between these
scenarios.
A second possibility is that merafloxacin might stabilize an alternative and unproductive (i.e.,
non-frameshift-stimulating) FSE conformation. At least one alternative structure with two nested
stems has been shown to form in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by a recent study using dimethyl
sulfate probing (Lan et al., 2020). Notably, our ΔStem1 mutant is fully compatible with this
alternative conformation, yet it lost all frameshift-stimulating activity (Figure 1C), consistent with
the notion that this stem-loop structure is an unproductive conformation. A separate study using
in-cell SHAPE probing did not detect this stem-loop structure, but instead observed
conformational flexibility of Stem 3 in the three-stem pseudoknot (Huston et al., 2020).
Therefore, merafloxacin could plausibly interact and stabilize one or more of these alternative
structures, thereby decreasing the fraction of RNAs adopting the productive FSE conformation.
Lastly, merafloxacin might target one or more host factors that mediate or modulate −1 PRF.
Although such factors have not been systematically identified, cellular RNA helicases would

presumably help unfold the pseudoknot after the ribosome has shifted to the −1 frame and
before it continues to translate ORF1b. Considering that the known targets of fluoroquinolones
are bacterial DNA topoisomerases (Hooper and Jacoby, 2016), it will be interesting to determine
whether their metazoan analogs, some of which have been shown to act on RNAs (Ahmad et
al., 2016), may be targeted by merafloxacin.

METHODS
Dual-luciferase PRF reporter assay
HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (ThermoFisher).
PRF reporter plasmid DNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. 24 hours after transfection, cells were washed
once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega) at room
temperature for 5 min. 1 µL of lysate was diluted with 39 µL PBS before being mixed with 40 µL
Dual-Glo FLuc substrate (Promega). After 10 min, FLuc activity was measured in a GloMax
20/20 luminometer (Promega). Subsequently, 40 µL Dual-Glo Stop & Glo reagent was added to
the mixture, incubated for 10 min, and measured for RLuc luminescence. The ratio between
RLuc and FLuc activities was calculated as frameshift efficiency.

High-throughput compound screen
HEK293T cells were plated in 384 well plates at the density of 5,000 cells/well. The next day,
screened compounds (20 nl of 10 mM stock in DMSO) were added to 20 µl cells using ECHO
acoustic dispenser (Labcyte), resulting in 10 M compound and 0.1% DMSO final
concentrations. Cells were treated with candidate compounds for 30 min before transfection of

15 ng mCherry-FSE-GFP(-1) plasmid DNA in each well. 24 hours after transfection, cell nuclei
are stained with Hoechst dye. Cell nuclei, mCherry, and GFP signals are imaged using an
automated fluorescent microscope (InCell 2200, GE) with a 20x objective, and the acquired
images are quantified using the CellProfiler image analysis package. Cell nuclei numbers were
quantified as the metric for cell viability. Mean RFP intensity values were first measured in all
cells to identify transfected (mCherry-positive) cells, and GFP/mCherry mean intensity ratio was
quantified in transfected cells as the metric for PRF efficiency. The no-PRF mCherry-GFP fusion
plasmid and the mCherry-FSE-GFP(0) plasmid were used as positive and negative controls for
elevated and reduced GFP expression levels, respectively. Screen actives were selected using
mean ± three standard deviations as cutoffs.
A total of 4,434 compounds were screened (Table S1), including 640 compounds from the FDAapproved library (ENZO), 1,600 compounds from Pharmakon collection (Microsource), and
1,872 compounds from the Tested-In-Humans collection (Yale Center for Molecular Discovery).

Western blotting
Transfected HEK293T cells were lysed in RIPA buffer on ice for 10 min. After 10 min
centrifugation at 4 °C, 20,000 × g, whole cell lysates were mixed with 4X LDS sample buffer
(Invitrogen) and denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were loaded on a 4–12% Bis-Tris SDSPAGE gel, run at 200 V for 45 min in MOPS buffer, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (Bio-Rad) in an XCell II Blot module (Invitrogen) (15 V, 45 min). After 1-hour blocking
with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit
anti-C19ORF66, Invitrogen # PA5-59815; mouse anti-β-Actin) diluted (1:2000) in 5% milk/PBST
at 4 °C with slow shaking overnight. After incubation, membranes were rinsed three times with
PBST, and incubated with IR680- or IR800-conjugated secondary antibodies (Li-Cor) diluted

(1:10,000) in 5% milk/PBST at room temperature for 1 hour. After three rinses with PBST,
membranes were imaged using an Odyssey CLx system (Li-Cor).

SARS-CoV-2 plaque formation assay
Vero E6 cells (ATCC) were seeded at 2 x 105 cells/well in 12-well plates. The following day,
cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 viral stock (MOI=5) for 1 hour and washed twice with
PBS. Merafloxacin diluted in DMSO was added to the media, mixed briefly, and incubated at
37 °C. After 2 days, media were collected, centrifuged, and supernatants were stored at -80 °C.
To quantify viral titers, the collected media were first serially diluted 10-folds with fresh media.
200 µl of each dilution was added to near-confluent Vero E6 cells in 6-well plates and incubated
at 37°C for 1 hour with gentle rocking. Subsequently, overlay media (DMEM, 2% FBS, 0.6%
Avicel RC-581) was added to each well. After 3 days, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde
for 30 min, stained with crystal violet for 30 min, and rinsed with deionized water to visualize
plaques.
