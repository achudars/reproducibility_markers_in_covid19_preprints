ABSTRACT
Viruses need to hijack the translational machinery of the host cell for a productive infection to
happen. However, given the dynamic landscape of tRNA pools among tissues, it is unclear
whether different viruses infecting different tissues have adapted their codon usage toward
their tropism. Here, we collect the coding sequences of over 500 human-infecting viruses and
determine that tropism explains changes in codon usage. Using an in silico model of
translational efficiency, we validate the correspondence of the viral codon usage with the
translational machinery of their tropism. In particular, we propose that the improved
translational adaptation to the upper respiratory airways of the pandemic agent SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus could enhance its transmissibility. Furthermore, this correspondence is
specifically defined in early viral proteins, as upon infection cells undergo reprogramming of
tRNA pools that favors the translation of late counterparts.

INTRODUCTION
Given the degeneracy of the genetic code, multiple 3-letter combinations of nucleotides can
code for the same amino acid. Such synonymous codons are nevertheless not uniformly
distributed along the genomes and can significantly deviate between organisms1. Evolutionary
forces that explain the existence of the so-called codon bias include (1) a mutation pressure
for a certain GC base composition depending on the species and chromosomal location, and
(2) the translational selection for codons corresponding to highly expressed tRNA
isoacceptors2–4.
Viruses strongly depend on the translational machinery of the host for the expression of their
own proteins and, ultimately, their replication. For instance, given the small size of most viral
genomes, no or very few tRNA genes are generally autonomously encoded5. In terms of codon
usage, it has indeed been shown that bacteriophages are specifically adapted to their
microbial hosts6,7. This information has been applied in the prediction of viral hosts from
metagenomics data8,9. The codon usage of human-infecting viruses is similarly adapted to the
host10,11, and actually the concept of codon deoptimization has been applied in the design of
attenuated vaccines12.
Although translational selection has long been under debate in human13, recent studies
indicate that different tissues and conditions showcase distinct tRNA expression profiles,

leading to changes in their respective translational efficiency2,14. In agreement with this
observation, the codon usage of papillomavirus capsid proteins is adapted to the tRNAs of
differentiated keratinocytes, where their translation becomes specifically efficient15,16. In
addition, upon HIV-1 infection, the host tRNA pool is reprogrammed to favor translation of late
viral genes17, a phenomenon that is indeed exploited by host antiviral mechanisms18.
Furthermore, some viruses with a specific tissue tropism resemble the codon bias of highly
expressed proteins of their respective infecting tissues19. Nevertheless, despite the few
aforementioned studies, a high-throughput analysis of the translational selection of viral
genomes to their tissue tropism has been heretofore hindered by the absence of tissue-wide
tRNA expression data.
Here, we systematically analyze the relative codon usage landscape of over 500 humaninfecting viruses together with the recently published tRNA expression profiles of human
tissues2. Among other viral annotated features, including phylogeny and Baltimore
classification, their tissue tropism explains more variance in codon usage than the other tested
features. In consequence, tropism corresponds with codon optimization patterns that can be
associated with tissue-specific profiles of tRNA-based translation efficiencies.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus constitutes the etiologic agent of the biggest pandemic of the
21st century, causing the COVID-19 pneumonia-like disease. Originated in Wuhan (China),
the virus has already caused 40,598 deaths as of 1st April 202020. In this context, recent
scientific efforts suggest that the novel coronavirus strain has evolved to preferentially infect
nasal goblet and ciliated cells as well as the type-2 alveolar epithelial cells21,22. However, some
non-respiratory-related symptoms such as loss of smell and taste hint as well to other tropism
potential outside the respiratory tract23,24. In terms of translational efficiency, we here discover
that the coronavirus proteome is especially adapted not only to upper respiratory airways and
alveoli, but also to the gastrointestinal tract and brain.
Further, by studying the tissue-adaptation among the viral proteome, we also determine that
early replication-related proteins are more translationally-adapted than the late structural
counterparts. Overall, we observe a tropism-specific adaptation of the viral proteome to the
tRNA profiles of their target tissues, which opens the door to the development of tissue-specific
codon-deoptimized vaccines and targeted antiviral therapies.

RESULTS
Tropism corresponds with differences in Relative Codon Usage of human-infecting
viruses
Publicly available genomic data comprised a total of 564 human-infecting viruses, distributed
among 33 families and covering all seven Baltimore categories (Sup. Table 1). Across this
diversity, six main viral tropisms were defined for 182 viruses based on the ViralZone curated
database25: neurons, immune cells, respiratory tract, hepatocytes, intestine, and epithelial
cells (Fig. 1A). Their corresponding coding sequences constituted a total of 4935 viral proteins
(Sup. Table 1), for which we determined the Relative Codon Usage (RCU, i.e. the contribution
of each synonymous codon to the amino acid it encodes, see Methods).
In order to understand the main factors driving differences between viral RCU, we used three
internal clustering indexes that assess how similar each virus is to a certain group compared
to other groups. Taking the average RCU over each of the 564 viral proteomes, we applied

this framework to assess the grouping performance of six different viral features: tropism, type
of genetic material, family, genus, Baltimore category, and a sequence-based classification
by Aiewsakun and Simmonds (2018). In such analysis, the tropism leads the best classification
of viral RCUs, followed by the viral genetic type (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, classical and
sequence-based phylogenetic classifications show poor clustering performances.
Given the impact of viral tropism on the RCU, we sought to determine the main codon
differences between the six defined target tissues. By using a linear discriminant analysis (see
Methods), the 182 tropism-defined viruses were classified in six clear clusters, regardless of
other factors such as the phylogenetic lineage (Fig. 1C). In consequence, we observe that
specific codon usage profiles are associated with the tissue tropism of human-infecting
viruses.
Viruses are adapted to the tRNA-based translational efficiencies of their target tissues
Based on the RCU differences between viruses with distinct tropism, we hypothesize that
distinct tissues impose selection towards a certain set of translationally-efficient codons.
However, a validation for this hypothesis requires the accurate quantification of tissue-specific
tRNA profiles, which has been hitherto missing. With the advent of such high-throughput
expression data27,28, here we retrieved the previously-published Supply-to-Demand
Adaptation (SDA) estimate for translational efficiency2, which computes the balance between
the supply (i.e., the anticodon tRNA abundances) and demand (i.e., the codons expressed in
mRNAs) of each codon (see Methods).
Using a total of 620 healthy samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset 2, we
first computed the SDA of all viral-protein-coding sequences based on the SDA weights of
their constituent codons. Therefore, taking the average of all healthy samples across each of
the 23 TCGA cancer types (Sup. Table 2), we determined the estimated translational
efficiencies of viral proteins in different human tissues (Sup. Table 3).
Next, from the perspective of the translational selection hypothesis, we would expect that viral
proteins are translationally adapted to their target tissues. In consequence, we tried to test our
hypothesis using a completely blind and unbiased random forest classifier, which applies
machine learning in order to predict the tropism of each viral protein based on the SDA to
different tissues (see Methods). The resulting performance of the models, based on the Area
Under the Curve (AUC) of their Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, ranges
between 0.74-0.91 (Fig. 2A), clearly higher than the no-skill model of 0.5. Similar results are
also obtained from complementary prediction performance metrics such as Precision-Recall
curves (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that our machine learning model is able to predict the
tropism of a viral protein based on its SDA to tissues with high accuracy. In concordance, a
linear discriminant analysis of the average SDA of each virus across tissues can similarly
separate different clusters of viral tropism based on their translational efficiencies (Extended
Data Fig. 1).
In an attempt to understand which tissues are the most predictive in identifying the viral tropism
of proteins, we analyzed the relative feature importance within each random forest classifier,
which measures the contribution of each tissue SDA in the decision trees (Fig. 2B). The main
observation is that no single tissue alone is able to discriminate against the specific tropism,
since all feature importances lie below 0.10. However, it is also clear that translational

adaptation to bile duct (CHOL, for healthy samples of cholangiocarcinoma) is a recurrent
discriminant feature, while other tissues are specifically important for just one or few tropisms,
such as rectum (READ, for healthy samples of rectum adenocarcinoma) in predicting intestinal
viruses. In any case, the directionality of these features cannot be established.
Overall, as tropism of proteins can be predicted from their translational adaptation to tissues,
these results indicate that viral proteomes are specifically adapted to certain tRNA-based
translational efficiencies. In consequence, and complementary to the observations of
mutational pressure driving viral codon bias11,29,30, we describe the basis for a potential tissuespecific translational selection of the viral codon usage.
SARS-CoV-2 is translationally adapted to upper respiratory airways and alveoli
As our systematic analysis suggests that the codon usage of viruses tend to be adapted to
the tissue they infect, we selected the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and other related
respiratory viruses to further explore their translational adaptation profile over tissues.
We initially reconstructed tRNA expression profiles along the respiratory tract making use of
the spatial information associated with healthy TCGA samples from head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD) (Sup. Table 4). We then computed the SDA of viral proteins from the three pandemic
coronaviruses of the last two decades SARS-CoV31, MERS-CoV32, and SARS-CoV-233, as
well as the common flu-causing influenza A virus (H1N1) along the respiratory tract. We find
that the new coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 is the most translationally adapted virus across
all tissues, especially in comparison with MERS-CoV and influenza A virus (Fig. 3A). Further,
the novel coronavirus is highly adapted throughout the whole respiratory tract, and specifically
the upper respiratory airways and the alveolar region in the lung periphery are the most
efficient tissues.
Moreover, given that the tropisms not only depend on the translational adaptation to the host,
but also on the expression of the required entry receptors, we measure the respective
receptors of each virus. Influenza A viruses bind to α(2,6)-linked and α(2,3)-linked sialic acids,
which are synthesized by the enzymes ST6GAL1 and ST3GAL4, respectively34. While their
expression is relatively uniform along the airways, the MERS-CoV uses the parenchymaspecific receptor DPP4 (Fig. 3B)35. In both cases, the expression of their entry receptor
coincides with an optimal translational adaptation in the lower respiratory tract. On the other
hand, both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains bind to the ACE2 protein and require the
proteolytic priming of the viral spike protein by TMPRSS236, although the receptor BSG/CD147
has also been proposed37. In all cases, their expression throughout the airways (Fig. 3B)
alongside their efficient translational adaptation defines the upper respiratory tract and the
alveoli as their particular optimal tropism (Fig. 3C). This is in agreement with recent single-cell
transcriptomic studies reporting the expression of ACE2 in the nasal goblet and ciliated cells
as well as the type-2 alveolar epithelial cells21,22.
Apart from the clear viral tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the respiratory tract, recent studies
propose that their tropism can expand to other tissues such as the digestive system or the
brain23,24. For this reason, we also extended our translational analysis to all the 23 tissues of
the TCGA dataset (Extended Data Fig. 2A), together with the expression of the corresponding
receptors (Sup. Table 4). In agreement with the clinical findings23,24, the gastrointestinal tract

emerges as the most translationally adapted tissue, followed by the other epithelial-like tissues
and the brain. Therefore, in terms of translational efficiency, the novel SARS-CoV-2 is widely
adapted across tissues.
In an attempt to elucidate the translational selection that could have benefitted the evolution
of the new coronavirus, we also compared the SDA adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to those of
close phylogenetic strains: the human-infecting SARS-CoV and the bat coronavirus RatG13,
with 79.6% and 96.2% of sequence identity, respectively33. We observe that all four main
proteins of the new strain have optimized their codon usage with regard to the previous 2003pandemic SARS-CoV (Extended Data Fig. 2B). On the other hand, even though the ratio of
synonymous versus nonsynonymous mutation rate of the bat coronavirus compared to SARSCoV-2 is exceptionally high38, their proteins are very similarly adapted to most human tissues.
In short, we report that the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has evolved to
significantly increase its translational adaptation to the human tissues. While it might not be
sufficient on its own, the coincidence of both translational efficiency and entry receptor
expression supports an optimal tropism of the alveoli but also the upper respiratory tract (Fig.
3C), which has recently been related to the higher transmissibility of the novel strain21.
Early viral proteins are better adapted and translationally deoptimized throughout the
process of infection
Given the tropism-specific adaptation of viral RCU towards the translational machinery of
tissues, we wondered whether certain genomic subsets were specifically adapted to the tissue
of infection. In particular, we speculated that early replication-related proteins would further
benefit from such adaptation than late structural proteins, since once the virus takes control of
the cell it could change its tRNA expression program17.
To estimate the adaptation of each protein to the tRNA-based codon efficiencies of each
tissue, we computed their SDA2 (Sup. Table 5). For that purpose, we matched each virus to
the tRNAs of their tissues of infection (Sup. Table 5). In concordance with our hypothesis,
based on current viral annotations (VOGdb, vogdb.org), we observed a small but highly
significant shift in SDA between structural and replication proteins in all but hepatocyteinfecting viruses (Fig. 4A). However, the proteomes of this latter group are poorly annotated
at the viral orthology database VOGdb, and separation between classes is often hindered by
the polyprotein structure of their genomes39. Similarly, we performed a Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis to identify which Virus Orthologous Groups (VOGs) were enriched in high-SDA or
low-SDA proteins (Fig. 4B). As determined by current annotations39, top-VOGs mostly
contained replication-related early proteins, whereas bottom-VOGs had structural late
functions.
Previous studies on the translational adaptation of the human immunodeficiency virus 1
suggested that the host tRNA pool is reprogramed upon viral infection in order to favor the
expression of late genes17. In this direction, we wanted to test whether this tRNA
reprogramming is a general adaptive mechanism among viral species. Using three previously
published small RNA-sequencing datasets of human cell lines upon viral infection40–42, we
quantified the tRNA of mock and productive infections at different time points (Sup. Table 6).
Therefore, for all datasets, we detected a general decrease in translational efficiency upon

viral infection, with late viral proteins being more favored than early ones specifically at longer
infection times (Fig. 4C).
Overall, we determine that the tropism-specific adaptation of viruses is specifically pronounced
among early proteins. However, later in infection, the tRNA pool of the host cells is
reprogrammed to favor the expression of late viral genes, reproducing previous findings of
HIV1 infection and extending the mechanism to dsDNA-based viruses such as human
cytomegaloviruses and human simplex viruses.

DISCUSSION
Tropism is determined by an ensemble of different factors, including the mechanism of viral
entry to the host, the immune responses to the infection, or the viral hijacking of the cellular
machinery in the interest of replication and propagation. In this article, we study the latter by
focusing on the translational adaptation of viral genomes to the host.
While previous studies on the base composition and codon usage of both DNA and RNA
viruses11,30 have attributed most of the codon usage variability to the mutational pressure of
viral genomes, our analysis proposes tropism as an important driving force. By systematically
interrogating all human-infecting viruses, we uncover that tissue tropism explains changes in
their codon usage more than other viral properties such as type or family. Therefore, as
mutational pressure would act more similarly within phylogenetically closer species, such
tropism-related differences in codon usage suggests that tissue-specific tRNA expression
could be driving a translational selection on viral genomes.
Although high-throughput sequencing of tRNAs has been only recently developed, cases of
natural selection of codon usage towards the host have been previously proposed. For
instance, codon usage of Parvovirus has been progressively adapted from dogs to cats after
the host jump43. Influenzaviruses show a similar adaptation over time of viral isolation,
deviating from the codon usage of avian hosts44,45. However, whether these progressive
changes in codon usage over time are directly driven by translational selection has remained
elusive. With the advent of tissue-wide datasets of tRNAs and their translational efficiencies2,
we can now compute the Supply-to-Demand Adaptation (SDA) of all viral proteomes in
different tissues. From there, we then created a random forest model that predicts with high
accuracy the viral tropism of proteins based on their profile of adaptation to human tissues. In
consequence, the tRNA-based adaptation profile of a protein is descriptive of their viral
tropism, indicating that translational selection could indeed drive tropism differences of codon
usage. It is important to remark that viruses could still have a good SDA to non-target tissues
with similar tRNA expression patterns that are not infected because they are not exposed to
the virus.
Specifically, we therefore focus our analysis on the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, causative
of the current COVID-19 pandemic. As has been recently suggested based on the expression
of their entry receptor21,22, SARS-CoV-2 is also translationally adapted to the upper respiratory
airways, as well as the lung parenchyma. This upper tract tropism has indeed been linked to
the higher transmissibility of the strain21. The novel coronavirus showcases the highest SDA
among all studied coronaviruses, including lung but also other tissues such as the digestive
system and brain. Interestingly, recent reports have shown that COVID-19 patients very
frequently have problems in the digestive tract24,46,47 as well as in neural tissue23,48,49.

One major open question in the field still persists: how much natural selection before or after
zoonosis shapes the current coronavirus50. On the one hand, viruses tend to gradually change
their codon usage after a zoonotic jump43,45. On the other hand, given the similarity of SARSCoV-2 SDA with the phylogenetically closest bat coronavirus, it seems that a translational
selection to increase SDA would have acted before the putative zoonosis from bats or other
intermediate hosts. Furthermore, in agreement with the highest translational potential of
SARS-CoV-2 in their target tissues, a recent model of viral tropism suggested that a tradeoff
exists between the efficiency of viral translation and the translational load on the host,
indicating that an improved codon usage can make the difference between symptomatic and
natural hosts51.
On the other hand, it is known that host tRNA pools undergo reprogramming upon viral
infection of HIV-1, vaccinia virus, and influenza A virus17,52. In this context, differences in codon
usage between early and late viral genes have been previously reported, but the directionality
of such changes remained unclear10,53. Based on our concept of tissue-specific adaptation,
we therefore validate that early replication-related proteins are better adapted to the tissue of
infection. Upon infection, we then unveil that changes in tRNA abundance switch the
adaptation towards the expression of late structural proteins, confirming a general trend that
had previously only been observed in HIV-117.
Overall, this is the first systematic analysis establishing a link between the codon usage of
human viruses and the translational efficiency of their tissue of infection. This correspondence
is particularly observed in early viral proteins, while late counterparts benefit from the tRNA
reprogramming that underlies the process of infection. We therefore envision the development
of ad hoc gene therapies specifically targeting the tissue of interest.

GCA_000001405.15), a total of 856 nuclear tRNAs and 21 mitochondrial tRNAs were
annotated with tRNAscan-SE [v2.0]57.
Trimmed FASTQ files were then mapped using a specific pipeline for tRNAs2,58. Summarizing,
an artificial genome is first generated by masking all annotated tRNA genes and adding pretRNAs (i.e. tRNA genes with 3' and 5' genomic flanking regions) as extra chromosomes. Upon
mapping to this artificial genome with Segemehl [v0.3.1]59, reads that map to the tRNAmasked chromosomes or to the tRNA flanking regions are filtered out in order to remove nontRNA reads and unmature-tRNA reads respectively.
After this first mapping step, a second library is generated by adding 3' CCA tails and removing
introns from tRNA genes. All 100% identical sequences of this so-called mature tRNAs are
clustered to avoid redundancy. Next, the subset of filtered reads from the first mapping is
aligned against the clustered mature tRNAs using Segemehl [v0.3.1]59. Mapped reads are

then realigned with GATK IndelRealigner [v3.8]60 to reduce the number of mismatching bases
across all reads.
For quantification, isoacceptors were quantified as reads per million (RPM). In order to
increase the coverage for anticodon-level quantification, we consider all reads that map
unambiguously to a certain isoacceptor, even though they ambiguously map to different
isodecoders (i.e. tRNA genes that differ in their sequence but share the same anticodon).
Ambiguous reads mapping to genes of different isoacceptors were discarded.
Relative Codon Usage (RCU)
The RCU is defined as the contribution of a certain codon to the amino acid it belongs to. The
RCU of all synonymous codons therefore sum up to 1.
𝑅𝐶𝑈 =

𝑥𝐶
∑𝑖∈𝐶𝑎𝑎

𝑥𝑖

where 𝑥𝐶 refers to the abundance of the codon 𝐶, and 𝐶𝑎𝑎 is the set of all synonymous codons.
Relative tRNA Adaptation Index (RtAI)
As described by dos Reis et al. (2003, 2004), the tAI weights every codon based on the
wobble-base codon-anticodon interaction rules. Let 𝑐 be a codon, then the decoding weight is
a weighted sum of the square-root-normalized tRNA abundances 𝑡𝑅𝑁𝐴𝑐𝑗 for all tRNA
isoacceptors 𝑗 that bind with affinity (1 − 𝑠𝑐𝑗 ) given the wobble-base pairing rules 𝑛𝑐 . However,
while dos Reis et al., (2004) assumes that highly expressed genes are codon-optimized, here
we use the non-optimized s-values to avoid a circularity in our reasoning:
𝑠 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5]
𝑛𝑐

𝑤𝑐 = ∑

(1 − 𝑠𝑐𝑗 )𝑡𝑅𝑁𝐴𝑐𝑗

𝑗=1

For better comparison with the SDA, an amino-acid-normalized tAI measure is defined by
dividing each tAI weight by the maximum weight among all codons within each amino acid
family.
𝑅𝑤𝑐 =

𝑤𝑐
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖∈𝑐𝑎𝑎 (𝑤𝑖 )

And therefore the RtAI of a certain protein is the product of weights 𝑅𝑤 of each codon 𝑖𝑘 at
the triplet position 𝑘 throughout the full gene length 𝑙𝑔 , and normalized by the length.
𝑙𝑔

𝑅𝑡𝐴𝐼 = (∏

𝑅𝑤𝑖𝑘 )1/𝑙𝑔

𝑘=1

Supply-to-Demand Adaptation (SDA)
The SDA aims to consider not only tRNA abundances, but also the codon usage demand. In
doing so, it constitutes a global measure of translation control, since the efficiency of a certain

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.027557; this version posted April 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

codon depends both on its complementary anticodon abundance as well as the demand for
such anticodon by other transcripts. This global control has been indeed established to play
an important role in defining optimal translation programs63.
The definition of the SDA is based on similar previously published metrics2,64,65, which consists
of a ratio between the anticodon supply and demand. On the one hand, the anticodon supply
is defined as the relative tAI weights 𝑅𝑤 (see previous section). On the other, the anticodon
demand is estimated from the codon usage at the transcriptome level. It is computed as the
frequency of each codon in a transcript weighted by the corresponding transcript expression,
and finally summing up over all transcripts. Let 𝑐 be a codon, then the codon usage is a
weighted sum of the counts of codon 𝑐𝑖 in gene 𝑗 weighted by the mRNA-seq abundance
𝑚𝑅𝑁𝐴𝑗 for all genes in the genome 𝑔:
𝑔

𝐶𝑈𝑐 = ∑

𝑐𝑖𝑗 𝑚𝑅𝑁𝐴𝑗

𝑗=1

Similarly to the supply, the anticodon demand is then normalized within each amino acid
family:
𝐷𝑐 =

𝐶𝑈𝑐
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖∈𝑐𝑎𝑎 (𝐶𝑈𝑖 )

Finally, the SDA weights (SDAw) are defined as the ratio between the codon supply 𝑆𝑐 and
demand 𝐷𝑐 :
𝑆𝐷𝐴𝑤𝑐 =

𝑆𝑐
𝐷𝑐

And therefore the SDA of a certain protein is the product of weights 𝑆𝐷𝐴𝑤 of each codon 𝑖𝑘 at
the triplet position 𝑘 throughout the full gene length 𝑙𝑔 , and normalized by the length.
𝑙𝑔

𝑆𝐷𝐴 = (∏

𝑆𝐷𝐴𝑤𝑖𝑘 )1/𝑙𝑔

𝑘=1

Internal clustering validity
Three indexes were used to determine the clustering performance of the RCUs based on
different viral features. These are "internal" metrics, since they evaluate the quality of a certain
grouping using measures of the dataset itself (homogeneity of clusters, distances within and
between clusters, etc.).
●

●
●

WB index is a ratio of the sum-of-squares (SS) within clusters and the SS between
clusters, normalized by the number of clusters66. Therefore, low values of the WB index
are indicative of good clustering.
Dunn index considers the inter-cluster distance and diameter of the cluster
hypersphere67. A higher Dunn index indicates better clustering.
Silhouette Coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, and measures how similar an object is to
its own cluster (intra-cluster distance) compared to other clusters (nearest-cluster
distance)68. A high value indicates a correct clustering.

Linear Discriminant Analysis of viral RCU
We applied a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to the viral RCUs, taking for each virus the
average RCU of its proteins. We assigned each virus to its corresponding tropism (Sup. Table
1) in order to find the linear combination of codon features that maximized differences between
viral target tissues. Given the collinear nature of RCUs by definition, the estimated coefficients
are impossible to interpret, although it does not hamper the classification performance.
Random Forest Classifier
To evaluate the adaptation of the viral proteins to the SDAw of human tissues, we computed
their average SDA to each of the 23 TCGA tissues (Sup. Table 3). Using the set of 182
tropism-defined viruses, we had a total of 2891 viral proteins. Taking the 23 tissue-specific
SDAs as features, we applied a Random Forest (RF) Classifier, populated with 100 decision
trees, using the scikit‐learn package69. Therefore, for each of the six viral tropisms, we
developed a model for predicting the tropism-positive versus tropism-negative proteins based
on the translational adaptation across tissues. Given that the size of the tropism-positive and
tropism-negative groups were often unbalanced, we iteratively sampled equal-sized groups,
for n=100 iterations. Furthermore, we validated the results with a stratified 5-fold crossvalidation.
In order to evaluate the performance of the RF models, we computed the Area Under the
Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) plots (Fig.
2A). We took the average and standard deviation across all iterations. Similarly, we computed
the relative feature weights corresponding to each of the 23 TCGA tissues (Fig. 2B).
Linear Discriminant Analysis of tissue-specific SDAs
Similar to the RF classifier, we also computed the average proteome SDA per virus in each of
the 23 tissues. We then applied a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to these averaged SDAs.
We assigned each virus to its corresponding tropism (Sup. Table 1) in order to find the linear
combination of tissue adaptation features that maximized differences between viral target
tissues (Extended Data Fig. 1, Sup. Table 3).
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
We analyzed the enrichment of gene sets of the Virus Orthologous Groups using the GSEA
algorithm70. The score used to generate the ranked list input is specified in the text.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All details of the statistical analyses can be found in the figure legends. For hypothesis testing,
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed. We used a significance value of 0.05.

EXTENDED DATA FIGURE LEGENDS
Extended Data Figure 1. Viruses are adapted to the tRNA-based translational
efficiencies of their target tissues, related to Fig. 2. Linear Discriminant Analysis of the
Supply-to-Demand Adaptation of the 182 tropism-defined viruses to each of the 23 TCGA
tissues, averaged among all the viral proteins and TCGA samples. The features describing
the LDA components are available in Sup. Table 3. In brackets, the percentage of variance
explained by each of the components.
Extended Data Figure 2. Translational adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses
among human tissues, related to Fig. 3. (A) Using the codon adaptation weights of all TCGA
samples, we compute the average SDA of proteins from coronaviruses and influenza A virus.
(B) Difference between the SDA of SARS-CoV-2 and the closest phylogenetically related
RaTG13 coronavirus (from bat) or the closest human coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For each
strain, the SDA of four of the proteins are shown. Refer to Sup. Table 2 for full TCGA cancer
type names.
