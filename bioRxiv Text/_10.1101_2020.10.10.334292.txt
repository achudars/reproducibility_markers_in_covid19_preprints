Abstract
The search for potential antibody-based diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for
pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has focused
almost exclusively on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Coronavirus
membrane (M), ORF3a, and ORF8 proteins are humoral immunogens in other
coronaviruses (CoVs) but remain largely uninvestigated for SARS-CoV-2. Here we use
ultradense peptide microarray mapping to show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces
robust antibody responses to epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome,
particularly in M, in which one epitope achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy. We map
79 B cell epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and demonstrate that
antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection bind homologous peptide
sequences in the six other known human CoVs. We also confirm reactivity against four
of our top-ranking epitopes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Illness
severity correlated with increased reactivity to nine SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in S, M, N,
and ORF3a in our population. Our results demonstrate previously unknown, highly
reactive B cell epitopes throughout the full proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV
proteins.

Introduction
Antibodies correlate with protection from coronaviruses (CoVs) including severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1–8], severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [8–12] and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8, 13–16]. All CoVs encode four main structural proteins,
spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as multiple nonstructural proteins and accessory proteins [17]. In SARS-CoV-2, anti-S and anti-N
antibodies have received the most attention to date [1–8], including in serology-based
diagnostic tests [1–5] and vaccine candidates [6–8]. The immunogenicity of S-based
vaccines is variable [18, 19], so better representation of the breadth of antibody
reactivity in vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics will be important as the pandemic
continues especially as new variants emerge. Prior reports observed that not all
individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 produce detectable antibodies against S or N [1–
5], indicating a need for expanded antibody-based options.
Much less is known about antibody responses to other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, though
data from other CoVs suggest they may be important. Antibodies against SARS-CoV M
can be more potent than antibodies against SARS-CoV S [20–22], and some
experimental SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines elicit responses to M, E, and ORF8
[8]. Additionally, previous work has demonstrated humoral cross-reactivity between
CoVs [7, 11, 23–26] and suggested it could be protective [26, 27], although fullproteome cross-reactivity has not been investigated.
We designed a peptide microarray tiling the proteomes of SARS-CoV-2 and eight other
human and animal CoVs in order to assess antibody epitope specificity and potential
cross-reactivity with other CoVs. We examined IgG antibody responses in 40 COVID-19
convalescent patients and 20 SARS-CoV-2-naïve controls. Independent ELISAs confirm
four of the highest-performing epitopes. We detected antibody responses to epitopes

throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, with several antibodies exhibiting apparent
cross-reactive binding to homologous epitopes in multiple other CoVs.

Results
SARS-CoV-2-naïve controls show consistent binding in “common cold” CoVs and
limited binding in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV
Greater than 90% of adult humans are seropositive for the human “common cold” CoVs
(CCCoVs: HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E) [28, 29], but the
effect of these pre-existing antibodies upon immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 or other
CoVs remains uncertain. We measured IgG reactivity in sera from 20 SARS-CoV-2naïve control subjects to CoV linear peptides, considering reactivity that was >3.00
standard deviations above the mean for the log2-quantile normalized array data to be
indicative of antibody binding [30]. All sera (SARS-CoV-2-naïve and COVID-19convalescent) exhibited binding in known epitopes of at least one of the control nonCoV strains (poliovirus vaccine and rhinovirus; Fig. 1, Extended data 1) and all were
collected in Wisconsin, USA, where exposure to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV was
extremely unlikely. We found that at least one epitope in structural or accessory proteins
showed binding in 100% of controls for HCoV-HKU1, 85% of controls for HCoV-OC43,
65% for HCoV-NL63, and 55% for HCoV-229E (Fig. 2, Extended data 1). The apparent
cross-reactive binding was observed in 45% of controls for MERS-CoV, 50% for SARSCoV, and 50% for SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 infection induces antibodies binding throughout the proteome
We aimed to map the full breadth of IgG binding induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and
to rank the identified epitopes in terms of likelihood of immunodominance. We defined
epitope recognition as antibody binding to contiguous peptides in which the average
log2-normalized intensity for patients was at least 2-fold greater than for controls with ttest statistics yielding adjusted p-values <0.1. We chose these criteria, rather than the
3.00 standard deviation cut-off (Extended data 2), in order to ensure that binding
detected would be greater than background binding seen in controls (2-fold greater) and
to remove regions of binding that were not at least weakly significantly different from
controls (adjusted p<0.1).
These criteria identified 79 B cell epitopes (Fig. 3, Table 1) in S, M, N, ORF1ab, ORF3a,
ORF6, and ORF8. We ranked these epitopes by minimum adjusted p-value for any 16mer in the epitope in order to determine the greatest likelihood of difference from
controls as a proxy for likelihood of immunodominance. The highest-ranking epitope
occurred in the N-terminus of M (1-M-24). Patient sera showed high-magnitude
reactivity (up to an average of 6.7 fluorescence intensity units) in other epitopes in S, M,
N, and ORF3a, with lower-magnitude reactivity (average of <3.3 fluorescence intensity
units) epitopes in other proteins. The epitopes with the greatest reactivity in S were
located in the S2 subunit of the protein (residues 686–1273) rather than the S1 subunit
(residues 14-685) [6] (Fig. 3). The greatest reactivity in S occurred in the fusion peptide
(residues 788-806) and at the base of the extracellular portion of the protein (between
the heptad repeat 1 and heptad repeat 2, roughly residues 984-1163) (Fig. 3, Fig. 4).
The highest magnitude antibody binding (red sites in Fig. 4) on S are below the flexible

head region that must be in the “up” position for ACE2 binding to occur. Notably less
reactivity occurred in the receptor-binding domain (residues 319-541) [6]. Four detected
epitopes (553-S-26, 624-S-23, 807-S-26, and 1140-S-25) have previously been shown
to be potently neutralizing [31–33], and all four of these were ranked within the top 10 of
our 79 epitopes. Forty-two of our detected epitopes (including 1-M-24, 553-S-26, 624-S23, 807-S-26, and 1140-S-25; Table 1) confirm bioinformatic predictions of antigenicity
based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [7, 8, 34–36], including each of the 12 topranking epitopes.
The highest specificity (100%) and sensitivity (98%), determined by linear discriminant
analysis leave-one-out cross-validation, for any individual peptide was observed for a
16-mer within the 1-M-24 epitope: ITVEELKKLLEQWNLV (Extended data 3). Fifteen
additional individual peptides in M, S, and N had 100% measured specificity and at least
80% sensitivity (Table 2). Combinations of 1-M-24 with one of five other epitopes (384N-33, 807-S-26, 6057-ORF1ab-17, 227-N-17, 4451-ORF1ab-16) yielded an area under
the curve receiver operating characteristic of 1.00 (Extended data 4) based on linear
discriminant analysis leave-one-out-cross-validation.
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may cross-reactively bind peptides in other CoVs
We determined epitopes bound by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in non-SARS-CoV-2
CoVs by the same criteria we used to determine epitopes in SARS-CoV-2. Epitopes in
these viruses were defined as binding by antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent sera to
peptides at an average log2-normalized intensity at least 2-fold greater than in controls
with t-test statistics yielding adjusted p-values <0.1. Some of these epitopes were
identical sequences with SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the RaTG13 bat betacoronavirus
(𝛽-CoV), the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 (96% nucleotide identity) [37, 38],
the pangolin CoV (85% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2) [39], and SARS-CoV
(78% identity) [37]. Cross-reactivity of an antibody is typically determined by evaluating
a pure preparation of specific antibodies or by competition assays. However, since our
Wisconsin subjects are almost certainly naïve to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and bat and
pangolin CoVs, we can make predictions about cross-reactivity (as opposed to binding
due to sequence identity).
Antibodies in COVID-19-convalescent sera appeared to be cross-reactive with identical
or homologous epitopes in S, M, N, ORF1ab, ORF3, ORF6, and ORF8 in other CoVs
(Fig. 5, Extended data 5, Extended data 6, Extended data 7). Overall, the greatest
number of epitopes in any non-SARS-CoV-2 CoV occurred in the RaTG13 bat
betacoronavirus (𝛽-CoV) at 75 epitopes (60 identical to SARS-CoV-2, 10 homologous
non-identical, five non-homologous non-identical). The second greatest number, 60
epitopes, occurred in the pangolin CoV (23 identical to SARS-CoV-2, 28 homologous
non-identical, nine non-homologous non-identical), and third SARS-CoV with 45
epitopes, (10 identical to SARS-CoV-2, 30 homologous non-identical, five nonhomologous non-identical) (Extended data 6, Extended data 7). One region,
corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 epitope 807-S-26, showed binding or potential crossreactivity across all CoVs, and one, corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 epitope 1140-S-25,
showed binding or potential cross-reactivity across all 𝛽-CoVs (Fig. 5). Epitope 807-S-

26 includes the CoV S fusion peptide, and 1140-S-25 is immediately adjacent to the
heptad repeat region 2, both of which are involved in membrane fusion [40].
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) confirm peptide microarray
findings
Having determined reactivity and apparent cross-reactivity by peptide array, we aimed
to independently confirm and validate these findings by ELISA. We selected four
peptides for ELISA evaluation (1253-S-16, 814-S-16, 8-M-16, and 390-N-16) from those
in our top 10 ranked epitopes, considering diversity among the proteins represented,
neutralizing capacity and potential cross-reactivity across multiple CoVs, and using the
16-mer in each epitope that most correctly discriminated between patients and controls.
All four SARS-CoV-2 peptides had higher IgG binding in COVID-19 convalescent sera
than in controls (Fig. 6). Peptide 8-M-16 showed the greatest discrimination between
COVID-19 convalescent and control sera with only three COVID-19 convalescent
samples having values similar to controls. Both peptides 1253-S-16 and 814-S-16
showed greater binding in controls than either 8-M-16 or 390-N-16, confirming our
findings of greater potential cross-reactivity among epitopes found in S.
Reactivity in some epitopes correlates with disease severity
Increased antibody titer and duration have been associated with increased severity of
illness due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 [41–45] and other CoVs [46], though data on
epitope-level differences by severity is lacking [47]. We compared reactivity in patients
within our cohort whose COVID-19 course required intubation and mechanical
ventilation (n=8) with reactivity in COVID-19 convalescent patients who never required
hospitalization (n=25) using multilinear regression accounting for age, sex,
immunocompromising conditions, and Charlson comorbidity index score [48] to
determine epitope-level resolution of differences in reactivity. Nine epitopes in S, M, N,
and ORF3a showed statistically significant (p<0.05) increases in reactivity for intubated
patients relative to never-hospitalized patients (Fig. 7a, Extended data 8).

Discussion
In our analysis of antibody binding to the full proteome of SARS-CoV-2, the highest
magnitude binding of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from human sera occurred for an
epitope in the N-terminus of M protein, with high specificity and sensitivity. Antibodies
produced after infection with SARS-CoV-2 reacted with epitopes throughout the
proteomes of other human and non-human CoVs, recognizing homologous regions
across all CoVs. Taken together, these results confirm that humans mount strong,
broad antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins in addition to S and N, and implicate
M epitopes as highly relevant to diagnostic and potentially to vaccine design.
M proteins are the most abundant proteins in CoV virions [17]. The N-terminus of M is
known in other CoVs to be a small, glycosylated ectodomain that protrudes outside the
virion and interacts with S, N, and E [17], while the rest of M resides within the viral
particle. Full-length SARS-CoV M has been shown to induce protective antibodies [20,
49], and patterns of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV M are similar to those we found in
SARS-CoV-2 [34]. SARS-CoV anti-M antibodies can synergize with anti-S and anti-N

antibodies for improved neutralization [20, 49], and M has been used in protective
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines [8]. However, the mechanism of protection of antiM antibodies remains unknown, and this protein remains largely understudied and
underutilized as an antigen. Other groups have not previously identified the high
magnitude binding we observed for M, though that may be due to using earlier sample
timepoints or different techniques, populations, or computational algorithms [50, 51].
Notably, some of the highest binding we observed in the S protein occurred at the base
of the extracellular portion of the protein, which would be the site of the putative
interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S and M. The ACE2 binding site and the S helix in
extended fusion are not as immunodominant as expected, suggesting that other, lessinvestigated epitopes may be playing a larger role in immunity to SARS-CoV-2 than is
currently appreciated. Our results, in concert with prior knowledge of anti-SARS-CoV
antibodies, strongly suggest that epitopes in M, particularly the 1-M-24 epitope as well
as other novel epitopes we identified, should be investigated further as potential targets
in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Interestingly, we found
antibodies bind three of the non-S mutations, in ORF8 and N, in the B.1.1.7 variant of
SARS-CoV-2 that has recently emerged in the United Kingdom and which is considered
to potentially be more transmissible than previous known variants [52].
We also found that antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection appear to
bind peptides representing homologous epitopes throughout the proteomes of other
human and non-human CoVs. Hundreds of CoVs have been discovered in bats and
other species [27, 37–39, 53, 54], making future spillovers inevitable. The potential
broad cross-reactivity we observed in some homologous peptide sequences may help
guide the development of pan-CoV vaccines [15], especially given that antibodies
binding to 807-S-26 and 1140-S-25, which showed potential cross-reactivity across all
CoVs and all 𝛽-CoVs, respectively, are known to be potently neutralizing [31, 32]. A
caveat is that our methods cannot discern whether the increased IgG binding to
CCCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera is due to newly developed cross-reactive
antibodies or due to the stimulation of a memory response against the original CCCoV
antigens. However, cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with SARS-CoV or
MERS-CoV is likely real, since our population was very unlikely to have been exposed
to those viruses. A more stringent assessment of cross-reactivity as well as functional
investigations into these cross-reactive antibodies will be vital in determining their
capacity for cross-protection. Further, our methods efficiently detect antibody binding to
linear epitopes [55], but their sensitivity for detecting parts of conformational epitopes is
unknown, and additional analyses will be required to determine whether epitopes
identified induce neutralizing or otherwise protective antibodies.
Finally, we demonstrated that more severely ill patients have significantly greater
reactivity to certain epitopes in S, M, N, and ORF3a. The nine epitopes with significantly
higher magnitude reactivity in intubated patients may play a role in the overaggressive
immune response known to characterize severe COVID-19 [7, 56], suggesting that they
may be targets for treatment in or prevention of severe disease. Alternatively, the
antibody response in general may be higher in very sick patients, expanding the
repertoire of antibody reactivity. Future studies should investigate whether these

differences can be detected early in the disease course to determine their potential
utility as predictive markers of disease severity. The correlation of reactivity to CCCoVs
with reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in all subjects including uninfected controls suggests preexisting antibodies to CCCoVs may be relevant to an individual’s capacity to effectively
produce anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, especially given that pre-existing anti-CoV
antibodies are more common in children and adolescents [57].
Many questions remain regarding the biology and immunology related to SARS-CoV-2.
Our extensive profiling of epitope-level resolution antibody reactivity in COVID-19
convalescent subjects, confirmed by independent assays, provides new epitopes that
could serve as important targets in the development of improved diagnostics, vaccines,
and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and dangerous human CoVs that may emerge in
the future.

Figure 4. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to S protein show the highest binding in
the fusion cleavage site. Binding reactivities for COVID-19 convalescent patients (A),
naïve controls (B), and the difference between patients and controls (C) were localized
on a coordinate file for a trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein using a dark blue (low,
0.00 fluorescence intensity) to red (high, 9.00 fluorescence intensity) color scale. The
highest reactivity occurred in the fusion peptide (aa 788-806) and at the base of the
extracellular portion of the molecule (aa 984-1163), with lower reactivity in the receptorbinding domain (aa 319-541).
Table 2. Sixteen peptides in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome had 100% specificity and
at least 80% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection in 40 COVID-19 convalescent
patients compared to 20 naïve controls

Figure 5. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may cross-react with other CoVs. Sera from
40 COVID-19 convalescent patients were assayed for IgG binding to 9 CoVs on a
peptide microarray; averages for all 40 are shown. Viral proteins are aligned to the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome; SARS-CoV-2 amino acid (aa) position is represented on the xaxis. Regions that may be cross-reactive across all 𝛽-CoVs (*) or cross-reactive for
SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (#) are indicated. Gray shading indicates gaps due to
alignment or lacking homologous proteins. Cross-reactive binding is defined as peptides
in which patients’ average log2-normalized intensity is 2-fold greater than controls’ and ttest statistics yield adjusted p-values < 0.1.

Figure 6. Higher IgG binding to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in COVID-19 convalescent
subjects compared to controls by ELISA. (A) IgG binding to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in
COVID-19 convalescent (n=40) and naïve control (n=20) sera was measured by ELISA.
Bars indicate mean absorbance (abs) +/- SEM and ****p<0.0001 by t-test. (B) AntiSARS-CoV-2 peptide IgG detected by ELISA was compared to array findings by
Spearman’s rank-order correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient, ρ) for COVID-19
convalescent (n=40, closed circles) and control (n=20, open circles) sera.

Figure 7. Disease severity correlates with increased antibody binding in specific
SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. IgG reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 epitopes identified by
peptide microarray in COVID-19 convalescent patients who were never hospitalized
versus intubated patients showed statistically significant increases in reactivity in
intubated patients for 11 epitopes.

Extended data
Extended data 1. Percentages of the 40 COVID-19 convalescent patients and 20 naïve
controls reacted to known epitopes in at least one control virus (rhinovirus and
poliovirus strains).
Extended data 2. Percentages and individual data for the 40 COVID-19 convalescent
patients and 20 naïve controls showing log2-normalized fluorescence intensity at least
3.00 standard deviations above the mean for the array for nine species of CoVs.
Extended data 3. Specificity and sensitivity for past SARS-CoV-2 infection in 40
COVID-19 convalescent patients compared to 20 naïve controls of individual 16-mer
peptides comprising epitopes throughout the full SARS-CoV-2 proteome.
Extended data 4. Epitopes paired with the 1-M-24 epitope obtained an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 1.0 for SARS-CoV-2 infection in
40 COVID-19 convalescent patients and 20 naïve controls using leave-one-out cross
validation with linear discriminant analysis.

Methods
Peptide microarray design and synthesis
Viral protein sequences were selected and submitted to Nimble Therapeutics (Madison,
WI, USA) for development into a peptide microarray [55]. Sequences represented
include proteomes of all seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, proteomes of
closely related coronaviruses found in bats and pangolins, and spike proteins from other
coronaviruses (accession numbers and replicates per peptide shown in Supplementary
Table 1). A number of proteins were included as controls, including poliovirus, seven
strains of human rhinovirus, and human cytomegalovirus 65kDa phosphoprotein. We
chose these controls given that we expect most human adults will have antibody
reactivity to at least one of these proteins and proteomes. Accession numbers used to
represent each viral protein are listed in the supplemental material (accession numbers
and replicates per peptide shown in Supplementary Table 1). All proteins were tiled as
16 amino acid peptides overlapping by 15 amino acids. All unique peptides were tiled in
a lawn of thousands of copies, with each unique peptide represented in at least 3 and
up to 5 replicates (Supplementary Table 1). The peptide sequences were synthesized
in situ with a Nimble Therapeutics Maskless Array Synthesizer (MAS) by light-directed
solid-phase peptide synthesis using an amino-functionalized support (Geiner Bio-One)
coupled with a 6-aminohexanoic acid linker and amino acid derivatives carrying a
photosensitive 2-(2-nitrophenyl) propyloxycarbonyl (NPPOC) protection group (Orgentis
Chemicals). Unique peptides were synthesized in random positions on the array to
minimize impact of positional bias. Each array consists of twelve subarrays, where each
subarray can process one sample and each subarray contains up to 389,000 unique
peptide sequences.

Human subjects
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Clinical data
and sera from subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the University of
Wisconsin (UW) COVID-19 Convalescent Biobank and from control subjects (sera
collected prior to 2019) from the UW Rheumatology Biobank [58]. All subjects were 18
years of age or older at the time of recruitment and provided informed consent. COVID19 convalescent subjects had a positive SARS-COV-2 PCR test at UW Health with sera
collected 5-6 weeks after self-reported COVID-19 symptom resolution except blood was

collected for one subject after 9 weeks. Age, sex, medications, and medical problems
were abstracted from UW Health’s electronic medical record (EMR). Race and ethnicity
were self-reported. Hospitalization and intubation for COVID-19 and smoking status at
the time of blood collection (controls) or COVID-19 were obtained by EMR abstraction
and self-report and were in complete agreement. Two thirds of COVID-19 convalescent
subjects and all controls had a primary care appointment at UW Health within 2 years of
the blood draw as an indicator of the completeness of the medical information. Subjects
were considered to have an immunocompromising condition if they met any of the
following criteria: immunosuppressing medications, systemic inflammatory or
autoimmune disease, cancer not in remission, uncontrolled diabetes (secondary
manifestations or hemoglobin A1c >7.0%), or congenital or acquired immunodeficiency.
Control and COVID-19 subjects were similar in regard to demographics and health
(Supplementary Table 2), and subjects who were not hospitalized, were hospitalized,
or were hospitalized and intubated also were compared (Supplementary Table 3). No
subjects were current smokers.

Peptide array sample binding
Samples were diluted 1:100 in binding buffer (0.01M Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% alkali-soluble
casein, 0.05% Tween-20) and bound to arrays overnight at 4°C. After sample binding,
the arrays were washed 3× in wash buffer (1× TBS, 0.05% Tween-20), 10 min per
wash. Primary sample binding was detected via Alexa Fluor® 647-conjugated goat antihuman IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The secondary antibody
was diluted 1:10,000 (final concentration 0.1 ng/µl) in secondary binding buffer (1x TBS,
1% alkali-soluble casein, 0.05% Tween-20). Arrays were incubated with secondary
antibody for 3 h at room temperature, then washed 3× in wash buffer (10 min per wash),
washed for 30 sec in reagent-grade water, and then dried by spinning in a
microcentrifuge equipped with an array holder. The fluorescent signal of the secondary
antibody was detected by scanning at 635 nm at 2 µm resolution using an Innopsys
910AL microarray scanner. Scanned array images were analyzed with proprietary
Nimble Therapeutics software to extract fluorescence intensity values for each peptide.
Peptide microarray findings validation
We included sequences on the array of viruses which we expected all adult humans to
be likely to have been exposed to as positive controls: one poliovirus strain (measuring
vaccine exposure), and seven rhinovirus strains. Any subject whose sera did not react
to at least one positive control would be considered a failed run and removed from the
analysis. All subjects in this analysis reacted to epitopes in at least one control strain
(Fig. 1, Extended data 1).
Peptide microarray data analysis and data availability
The raw fluorescence signal intensity values were log2 transformed. Clusters of
fluorescence intensity of statistically unlikely magnitude, indicating array defects, were
identified and removed. Local and large area spatial corrections were applied, and the
median transformed intensity of the peptide replicates was determined. The resulting
median data was cross-normalized using quantile normalization. All peptide microarray
datasets and code used in these analyses can be downloaded from
https://github.com/Ong-Research/Ong_UW_Adult_Covid-19.git.
Protein structures
The SARS-CoV-2 S-chimera.pdb used to make S protein structures was built by Robert
Kirchdoerfer using 6VYB.pdb, 5X4S.pdb and 6LZG coordinates and filling in internal
unresolved residues from known (presumably) analogous sites determined for SARS-

CoV S from 6CRV.pdb. Additional unmodeled regions were generated using Modeller
[59]. C-proximal HR2 regions were modeled as single helices (Phe1148-Leu1211) in
Coot [60].
The data2bfactor Python script written by Robert L. Campbell, Thomas Holder, and
Suguru Asai (downloaded from http://pldserver1.biochem.queensu.ca/~rlc/work/pymol/)
was used to substitute peptide array data onto this structure in place of the B factor in
PyMol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC) using a
dark blue (low) to red (high) color scale. Data used for these visualizations was the
average reactivity in the 40 COVID-19 convalescent patients, the average reactivity in
the 20 naïve controls, and the difference between averages for the patients and for the
controls.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
Costar 96-well high binding plates (Corning, Corning, USA) were incubated at 4°C
overnight with 5µg/ml streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) in PBS
(Corning). Plates were washed twice with PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1
hour with 0.5mM of the following peptides (Biomatik, Kitchener, Canada) in PBS: 814-S16 (KRSFIEDLLFNKVTLA-K-biotin), 1253-S-16 (CCKFDEDDSEPVLKGV-K-biotin),
390-N-16 (QTVTLLPAADLDDFSK-K-biotin), 8-M-16 (ITVEELKKLLEQWNLV-K-biotin).
Plates were washed thrice with wash buffer (0.2% Tween-20 in PBS), then incubated
for 1 hour in blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk in wash buffer) at room temperature,
incubated overnight at 4°C with sera at 1:200 in blocking solution, washed four times
with wash buffer, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with mouse anti-human IgG
conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, USA) diluted
1:5000 in blocking solution, washed four times with wash buffer, and incubated with
tetramethyl benzidine substrate solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 minutes
followed by 0.18M sulfuric acid. Absorbance was read on a FilterMax F3 Multi-mode
Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) at 450 and 562nm. Background
signal from 562nm absorbance and wells with no peptide and no serum were
subtracted. Plates were normalized using a pooled serum sample on every plate.
Absorbance values of zero were plotted as 0.0002 to allow a log scale for graphs.
Samples were run in duplicate.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in R (v 4.0.2) using in-house scripts. For each
peptide, a p-value from a two-sided t-test with unequal variance between sets of patient
and control responses were calculated and adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg
(BH) algorithm. To determine whether the peptide was in an epitope (in SARS-CoV-2
proteins) or cross-reactive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (in non-SARS-CoV-2
proteins), we used an adjusted p-value cutoff of <0.1 (based on multiple hypothesis
testing correction for all 119,487 unique sequences on the array) and a fold-change of
greater than or equal to 2 and grouped consecutive peptides as a represented epitope.
Linear discriminant analysis leave-one-out cross validation was used to determine
specificity and sensitivity on each peptide and from each epitope using the average
signal of the component peptides.

To identify cross-reactive epitopes, we used each SARS-CoV-2 epitope sequence as a
query, searched the database of proteins from the sequences in the peptide array using
blastp (-word-size 2, num-targets 4000) to find homologous sequences in the bat,
pangolin, and other human CoV strains, then determined whether the average log2normalized intensity for these sequences in patients was at least 2-fold greater than in
controls with t-test statistics yielding adjusted p-values <0.1. Each blast hit was then
mapped back to the corresponding probe ranges.
The clinical and demographic characteristics of convalescent subjects were compared
to those of the controls using 𝝌2 tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum
tests for non-normally distributed continuous measures.
Heatmaps were created using the gridtext [61] and complexheatmap [62] packages in
R. Alignments for heatmaps were created using MUSCLE [63].
