Abstract

23

Over the past two decades, there has been a continued research on the role of small non-coding

24

RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) in various diseases. Studies have shown that viruses

25

modulate the host cellular machinery and hijack its metabolic and immune signalling pathways

26

by miRNA mediated gene silencing. Given the immensity of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-

27

19) pandemic and the strong association of viral encoded miRNAs with their pathogenesis, it is

28

important to study Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) miRNAs.

29

To address this unexplored area, we identified 8 putative novel miRNAs from SARS-CoV-2

30

genome and explored their possible human gene targets. A significant proportion of these targets

31

populated key immune and metabolic pathways such as MAPK signalling pathway, maturity-

32

onset diabetes, Insulin signalling pathway, endocytosis, RNA transport, TGF-β signalling

33

pathway, to name a few. The data from this work is backed up by recently reported high-

34

throughput transcriptomics datasets obtains from SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. Analysis of

35

these datasets reveal that a significant proportion of the target human genes were down-regulated

36

upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current study brings to light probable host metabolic and

37

immune pathways susceptible to viral miRNA mediated silencing in a SARS-CoV-2 infection,

38

and discusses its effects on the host pathophysiology.

Background

43

SARS-CoV-2 is the genesis of 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2

44

belongs

45

the Coronaviridae family and order Nidovirales (1). SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with

46

single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The 29903 nucleotides long RNA genome

47

consists of

48

Sequence:

49

betacoronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle

50

East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have evolved and caused viral epidemics

51

in the past twenty years. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively have infected over 8000 and

52

857 individuals globally and are associated with high mortality rates (3). The SARS-CoV-2 has

53

infected over 40 million people worldwide and caused over 1.1 million deaths as of October

54

2020, resulting in a high fatality rate (4). The common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, sore

55

throat, dry cough, breathlessness, malaise, and fatigue. In rare cases, patients develop acute

56

respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis followed by respiratory and heart failure (5). One of the

57

challenges to control this virus is unavailability of effective therapeutics. The problem is further

58

compounded by the lack of our understanding regarding molecular mechanisms involved in the

59

pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 including the host-pathogen interactions.

60

MiRNAs are 18-22 nucleotides long noncoding RNAs that are found in animals, plants, and

61

some viruses. They regulate genetic network pathways by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs)

62

to translational repression or degradation. The biogenesis of miRNAs begins by RNA

63

polymerase II mediated transcription of genome into long primary-miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). The

nuclear Ribonuclease type III enzyme, Drosha cleaves pri-miRNA into small hairpin precursor-

65

miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) which are then exported to the cytoplasm by nuclear membrane protein,

66

Exportin5. In the cytoplasm, another Ribonuclease III enzyme- Dicer processes the pre-miRNA

67

to generate a miRNA duplex intermediate (miRNA: miRNA*). One strand of this intermediate,

68

mature miRNA binds to protein Argonaute-1 generating the miRNA inducing silencing complex

69

(RISC) which guides the binding of mature miRNA to target mRNAs (6). Besides eukaryotes,

70

viruses also encode miRNAs to target host genes involved in important biological processes like

71

cell growth, cell differentiation, and cellular defense mechanisms as well as to regulate viral gene

72

expressions to modulate the viral replication cycle (7). Therefore, viral miRNAs aid virus

73

particles in their continuous proliferation and evasion of the host immune system (8,9).

74

Various studies have demonstrated a strong association between viral miRNAs and infection

75

(8,9). However, there is no evidence to suggest the presence of miRNA sequences in SARS-

76

CoV-2 genome. To address this problem, we applied computational approaches to analyze the

77

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence for possible miRNAs. This was of high interest and therefore

78

the secondary goal of the study was to investigate the potential targets of these miRNAs along

79

with their associated Gene Ontologies (GO) and signalling pathways. Our data provides a list of

80

potential viral miRNAs from SARS-CoV-2 and predicts their roles in COVID-19

81

pathophysiology, thus facilitating further works on the potential biological roles of these

82

miRNAs.

Results

86

The putative miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 genome

87

As pre-miRNAs form hair-pin loop structures during their biogenesis, we first searched for such

88

arrangements in the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence using the VMir software (10). The analysis

89

demonstrated that the direct and reverse genomic strands consist of twenty-four and twenty-two

90

hair-pin loop sequences, respectively. The length of these sequences ranged between 70 and 148

91

nucleotides, and they had VMir score ≥115, hairpin size ≥ 70, and window count ≥ 35 (Figure

92

1A, Supplementary Material - Sheet 1).

93

Next, using MFold web server the Minimal Folding Free Energy (MFE) of each sequence was

94

calculated because MFE of the pre-miRNA folding is inversely proportional to the

95

thermodynamic stability of the molecule (11). The secondary structure of these sequences was

96

also predicted using MFold. In total, forty-two potential pre-miRNAs (direct strand-23; reverse

97

strand-18), with MFE ≤ -18 kcal/mol, were recognized to be thermodynamically stable

98

(Supplementary Material - Sheet 2).

99

The Minimal Folding Free Energy Index (MFEI) distinguishes miRNAs from other coding and

100

non-coding RNAs as pre-miRNAs display higher MFEI value than mRNAs (0.66), tRNAs (0.64)

101

and rRNAs (0.59) (12). Therefore, the MFEI for the forty-one potential pre-miRNAs was

102

calculated, and the values ranged from -0.60 to -0.93 (Supplementary Material- Sheet 3). The

103

pre-miRNAs MD50, MD62, and MD86 on the direct strand and MR5 on the reverse strand, with

104

MFEI ≤ -0.85 kcal/mol, were chosen as the best candidates for the prediction of mature miRNAs

105

via MatureBayes tool (Figure 1B) (13). The MatureBayes prediction revealed 22-nucleotide

106

long 8 mature miRNAs from the pre-miRNA sequences on their 5’ and 3’ stem locations (Table

107

1). As both the strands can serve as mature miRNA depending on the assembly of RISC

108

complex, mature miRNAs on both the arms of stem-loop were used for further analysis.

109

This work is the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 genome may encode miRNAs and therefore

110

careful validation of these findings was carried out against previously published data. A

111

systematic and comprehensive literature search for RNA sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2

112

infected samples extracted out a study from the Blanco-Melo et al. group. The study explored the

113

transcriptional response of SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cell lines, A549, and A549-ACE-2

114

cells (14). They reported that over 50% of the sequencing reads from each infected sample

115

aligned with viral sequences while the mock-treated cells showed no viral reads. An alignment

116

search using the mature miRNA sequences was executed against the sequencing reads provided

117

for these samples in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Dataset: GSE147507. The search

118

identified MR5-5p and MR5-3p together in 15 and 38758 reads from the infected A549 and

119

A549-ACE-2 cells, respectively. The lengths of these sequences varied between 48 to 151

120

nucleotides proposing the likelihood of the intermediate products of miRNA maturation process.

121

This further implies for the physiological presence of pre-miRNA like molecules in SARS-CoV-

122

2 infected tissues.

123

Predicting the target mRNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNAs in the human genome

124

The miRNAs exert their effects by targeting one or more mRNAs. Therefore, predicting the

125

targets of putative miRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 would help understand the pathogenesis of the

126

disease and shed light on the possible host-pathogen interactions. In silico prediction of targets

127

by miRDB (15) for all 8 mature miRNAs retrieved 1,121 unique targets in the human genome

128

with score ≥ 80 (Supplementary Material- Sheet 4). Interestingly, some of these targets have

129

already been associated with pulmonary diseases. For instance, the gene coding for IL-1α was

130

one of the predicted targets for SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNAs. Interleukin-1α/β (IL-1α/β) are

131

key pro-inflammatory cytokines that mediate acute pulmonary inflammation and enhances

132

survival during influenza virus infection by recruiting CD4+ T cells and aiding to the IgM

133

antibody response (16). Likewise, another predicted target, Bone morphogenetic protein receptor

134

2 maintains pulmonary arterial hypertension, a form of high blood pressure that affects the

135

arteries of the lungs and the heart (17). Of note, high blood pressure is a significant risk factor in

136

COVID-19 (18). Defects in CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, members of nicotinic acetylcholine

137

receptor family of proteins, are linked with various lung cancers and smoking-related lung

138

disorders (19). Studies showed increased susceptibility of smokers to contract COVID-19 (20)

139

and the genes coding for CHRNA3 and CHRNA5 were also reported amongst the SARS-CoV-2

140

encoded miRNAs targets in our study.

141

Blanco-Melo et al. reported 77 and 96 genes down-regulated in infected A549 and A549-ACE-2

142

cell lines, respectively. Of these, 6 and 4 genes respectively were found to be the targets of

143

SARS-Cov-2 miRNAs in current study (Figure 2Ai, 2Aii, and 2B, Supplementary Material-

144

Sheet 5). The group also reported 2408 genes down-regulated in the post mortem lung samples

145

from COVID-19 patients; of which 126 were predicted as the targets of SARS-Cov-2 miRNAs in

146

our study (Figure 2Aiii and 2B, Supplementary Material- Sheet 5) (14). Our literature mining

147

retrieved two additional studies on transcriptional response of COVID-19 patients. Xiong et al.

148

performed a transcriptomic analysis of both broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and

149

peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and compared with samples from healthy donors (21). Of

150

the 325 and 316 genes reported to be down-regulated in BALF and peripheral blood samples, we

151

found 15 and 7 genes respectively as putative targets of the SARS-Cov-2 miRNAs (Figure 2Aiv,
7

152

2Av, and 2B, Supplementary Material- Sheet 5). Zhou et al. reported a metatranscriptome

153

sequencing of BALF from COVID-19 patients and found 739 genes to be down-regulated. 56

154

genes reported as targets of SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs were also found to be down-regulated in

155

their analysis (Figure 2Avi and 2B, Supplementary Material- Sheet 5) (22). Examples of such

156

genes include ABCA1 and CDC42. ABCA1 regulates cholesterol efflux and in association with

157

CDC42 regulates the formation of lipid rafts (23)(24). Lipid rafts are key features of many

158

cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases such as diabetes, which have also been associated with

159

COVID-19 (25). Taken together, many of the targets that we predicted for the SARS-Cov-2

160

miRNAs have also been reported to be down-regulated during COVID-19 in other studies,

161

signifying a possible viral miRNA mediated repression of human genes.

162

The potential physiological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs on a host cell

163

The GO analysis of the 1121 potential targets of the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs was executed using

164

the Cytoscape plugin, ClueGo (26,27) and the results indicated that the major Cellular

165

Component terms populated were the nucleus, cytoplasm, cell junction, nucleoplasm, and

166

endosome (Figure 3A, Supplementary Material- Sheet 6). The Molecular Function enrichment

167

depicted functions such as protein binding, mRNA 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) binding, zinc

168

ion binding, transcription factor activity, and sequence-specific DNA binding (Figure 3B,

169

Supplementary Material- Sheet 6). The GO-Biological Processes analysis suggested that the

170

target gene products primarily populate the negative regulation of transcription from RNA

171

polymerase II promoter, positive regulation of transcription (DNA-templated), positive

172

regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, transcription (DNA-templated),

173

and mitotic cell cycle (Figure 3C, Supplementary Material- Sheet 6). The Kyoto Encyclopedia

174

of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the target genes were enriched in

MAPK signalling pathway, ErbB signalling pathway, maturity-onset diabetes of the young,

176

Insulin signalling pathway, Ras signalling pathway, endocytosis, RNA transport, TGF-β

177

signalling pathway, to name a few (Figure 3D, Figure 4A-D, Supplementary Material- Sheet

178

6). Interestingly, studies have demonstrated a strong and consistent link between syndromes

179

associated with disruption of few of these pathways and COVID-19. For instance, COVID-19

180

patients with no prior history of type- 2 diabetes have been reported to show hyperglycaemia,

181

lowered insulin levels, and pre-diabetic symptoms (28). The genes coding for PAX4 and PAX6,

182

key proteins involved in the development of pancreatic islets which are often found mutated

183

and/or dysregulated in type 2 diabetes, were found to be potential targets for SARS-CoV-2

184

miRNAs in our study (29,30).

185

In a cell, different proteins interact with each other to form a complex protein-protein interaction

186

(PPI) network that comprises of over thousands of interactions. Knowing the interactions

187

between the SARS-CoV-2 miRNA targets would provide an understanding of how the virus

188

controls various molecular and biological processes of its host thus aiding in its survival and

189

replication, while simultaneously evading the host responses. A PPI network of the 1121 targets

190

was constructed using the ReactomeFI plugin in Cytoscape (Figure 5A) (27). The network

191

included 308 proteins/nodes and 593 interactions/edges. To identify the significant interactions

192

within the PPI network, the Molecular COmplex DEtection (MCODE) plugin (31) in Cytoscape

193

was utilized, which predicted 16 significant interaction modules. The graphical representation of

194

the top modules with an interaction score greater than 4 is shown in Figure 5B. In total these

195

modules populated 85 genes, the majority of them are involved in MAPK signalling pathway,

196

RNA transport, and mRNA surveillance. Of note, the RNA transport pathway was connected to

197

the MAPK signalling pathway and the mRNA surveillance pathway through PPP2R3A and

UPF3A, respectively (Figure 6, Table 2). PPP2R3A is a key serine/threonine phosphatase that

199

negatively regulates cell growth, while UPF3A detects truncated mRNA and initiates nonsense-

200

mediated decay (32,33). Taken together, the SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host metabolism and

201

cellular processes for evading host-mediated RNA degradation and actively maintaining the cell

202

in a growth phase, thus successfully its viral cycle (34,35).

Discussion and Conclusions

205

The SARS-CoV-2 attaches to and enters the host cell by binding of its spike (S) protein to the

206

host cell membrane protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (36). After a SARS-

207

CoV-2 virion attaches to its target cell, the cell’s trans-membrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2)

208

cleaves the S protein to expose a fusion peptide (37). The virion then releases its RNA into the

209

cell, taking over the cellular translation machinery to generate multiple copies of the virus that

210

subsequently egress to infect more cells. The RNA genome of the virus harbours significant

211

UTRs both at the 5’ and 3’ ends of its open-reading frames that give rise to a range of RNA

212

secondary structures with unknown functions. A recent study has demonstrated the conservation

213

of these structures across many betacoronaviruses (38). RNA secondary structures are primarily

214

involved in enzymatic reactions and are also processed to generate miRNA that regulates host

215

gene silencing. Studies have shown that viruses exploit the cellular machinery to encode miRNA

216

and like eukaryotic miRNAs, the viral miRNAs are generated using the Drosha and/or Dicer

217

proteins of the host (39).

218

Primarily, DNA viruses such as Herpesviruses, Papillomavirus, and Polyomavirus encode

219

miRNAs (40–42). Epstein–Barr virus, a Herpesviridae family member, expresses 4 mature

220

miRNAs transcribed from its BART and BHRF1 regions as it switches from the latent to the

221

lytic phase of its infection cycle (43). Kaposi’s sarcoma virus, another herpesvirus, expresses

222

over 25 matured miRNAs transcribed from the region between the kaposin and ORF71 of its

223

genome (Cai et al., 2005). These miRNAs are associated with the latency phase of infection and

224

are reported to modulate various genes in the host immune system and cell cycle. Human

225

Cytomegalovirus genome encodes for over 25 miRNAs, which have been shown to interfere

226

with host immunity, thus increasing the virulence of the virus (45). HBV-miR-3, encoded by the

227

Hepatitis B virus down-regulates the expression of HbcAg, thus inhibiting its replication cycle

228

(46). Adenovirus encodes for the mature miRNA- mivaRNAII-138, which when expressed in

229

HeLa cells modulated core cellular functions such as growth, RNA metabolism, DNA repair, and

230

apoptosis (47). Another report shows that mivaRNAII-138 repressed the expression of CUL4,

231

thus positively modulating the JNK signalling (48). However, recent studies have demonstrated

232

RNA viruses, such as HIV-1, Influenza virus, and Ebola virus to encode viral miRNAs (49–51).

233

Also, the external incorporation of pre-miRNA sequence into the viral RNA has been reported to

234

generate functional miRNAs by cytoplasmic RNA viruses. For example, the incorporation of pri-

235

miR-124 the Sindbis virus genomes resulted in the production of pre-miR-124 and miR-124 in a

236

DGCR8-independent, exportin-5-independent, and Dicer-dependent manner (39). Also, the

237

flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus was reported to express an Epstein–Barr virus miRNA

238

through the integration of its miR-BART2 precursor in the 3′-UTR of its genome (52). These

239

examples of miRNA production from cytoplasmic RNA viruses demonstrate that pre-miRNA

240

stem-loops can be processed in the cytoplasm by Dicer-dependent and Drosha independent non-

241

canonical cytoplasmic mechanisms.

242

Recent studies on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on host metabolism and immunity have provided

243

interesting correlations to our study. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs target a

244

range of genes encoding for TGF-β signalling inhibitors such as DCN, INHBC, SMAD-7,

245

SMURF, and MAPK1. Notably, the serum level of TGF-β1 is elevated during the early phase of

246

SARS-CoVs infection (53). These result in rapid and massive edema and fibrosis of lungs that

247

remodels and ultimately blocks the airways leading to functional failure of the lungs and death of

248

the patients. The increased levels of TGF-β along with dysregulated signalling are possibly

249

achieved by targeting these aforementioned negative regulators through viral miRNAs. Also,

250

various evidence has shown that hyperglycaemia, regardless of the past medical history of

251

diabetes has emerged as an important risk factor for severe illness and death from COVID-19

252

(28). Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs target the gene encoding SLC2A4, a

253

glucose transporter responsible for the uptake of extracellular glucose into the cytoplasm. Also,

254

the gene for RHOQ, a molecule involved in insulin-mediated glucose is a predicted target for

255

SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs. Notably, the gene for KRAS, a positive regulator of another glucose

256

transporter GLUT4 is amongst the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs targets. The down-regulation of these

257

molecules is associated with hyperglycaemia and severe diabetes.

258

T-cell receptor zeta or CD247 plays an important role in coupling antigen recognition to several

259

intracellular signal-transduction pathways. Impaired expression of CD247 results in impaired

260

immune response and is associated with immunosuppression in T-cells (54). Our predictions list

261

the gene encoding CD247 as a target for SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs, and the transcriptomics

analysis by Xiong et al. demonstrated a down-regulated expression of CD247 in PBMCs of

263

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (21). TLR8, a key player of the anti-viral innate immunity, is an

264

endosome localized sensor of RNA degradation end products and actively recognizes viral and

265

bacterial pathogens. Further, it activates IRF5 and induces the production of IFNβ, IL-12p70,

266

and TNF (55). Of note, TLR8 is also reported to sense cytoplasmic microRNAs of both host and

267

pathogen origins (56). Rhinovirus, the causative agent of the common cold is known to repress

268

the expression of TLR8 mRNA (57).

269

This study presents a list of potential viral miRNAs from the SARS-CoV-2 genome and predicts

270

a list of putative gene targets from the human host. Moreover, the study draws a link between

271

genes involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated symptoms such as lung damage,

Precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) prediction

280

The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was downloaded from the NCBI with accession number

281

NC_045512.2. VMir software (10), which consists of two programs VMir analyser and VMir

282

viewer, was used with default settings (window size: 500 nucleotides, step size: 1 nucleotide,

283

conformation: linear, orientation: both, hairpin size: any, minimum VMir score: 115, minimum

284

hairpin size:70, minimum Window Count:35) to identify putative pre-miRNA hairpin structures

285

in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

286

Secondary structure validation

287

The VMir-derived pre-miRNA sequences were submitted to the MFold (11) web-server with

288

default parameters for secondary structure prediction and MFE (ΔG in kcal/mol) calculation. The

289

MFEI was also calculated as described in the equation:

290

MFEI= [(MFE/Length of the RNA sequence) X 100]/(G+C)%

291

The potential pre-miRNA secondary structures were assessed using the following criteria:

292

i) MFE ≤ −18 kcal/mol

293

ii) (G+C)% between 30–70 %;

294

iii) MFEI ≤ −0.85 kcal/mol

available under aCC-BY-NC 4.0 International license.

296

The MatureBayes tool was used at default parameters to predict mature miRNAs

297

MatureBayes incorporates the Naïve Bayes classifier for identifying the putative mature miRNA

298

molecules based on the sequence and structure of the miRNA precursors.

299

Potential Target genes prediction

300

miRDB (15), a web server was used for predicting the target genes in the human genome for the

301

mature miRNAs. The server uses the MirTarget algorithm, which is based on a 7-mer seeding

302

approach to predict miRNAs targets in the human gene’s 3’ UTRs. The algorithm scans the 3’

303

UTR of human genes for hybridization with miRNAs sequence. Target genes with miRDB score

304

≥ 80 were selected as a predicted target with a score ≥ 80 is most likely to exist in a

305

physiological scenario and not require any other supporting evidence.

306

Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses of the target mRNAs

307

Gene ontology is a bioinformatics tool used for investigating functional relationships between

308

gene products and predicting three key aspects: biological process, cellular component, and

309

molecular function. KEGG is a database used for analysing enriched pathways of the selected

310

genes to further understand gene functions. To conduct GO and KEGG pathway analysis for the

311

target mRNAs, the ClueGO (26), CluePedia (58), CytoKEGG, and KEGGParser (59) plugins on

312

Cytoscape (27) were used. GO terms and KEGG pathways with p-value < 0.05 were considered

313

statistically significant. Genes were mapped onto the KEGG pathways using the PaintOmics3

314

(60) using default parameters. Software packages R and R Studio were used to visualize the top

315

GO terms and KEGG pathways.

317

Using Cytoscape plugin, ReactomeFI (61), PPI network was constructed (P < 0.05, FWER

318

Correction). Another Cytoscape plug-in, MCODE (31) was used to identify the interconnected

319

clusters/ modules from the PPI network (degree cut-off = 2, max. depth = 100, k-core = 2, and

320

node score cut-off = 0.2). ClueGO was used to identify the significant GO Terms enriched with

321

the gene clusters retrieved in MCODE.
