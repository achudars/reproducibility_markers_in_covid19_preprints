Running Title: Virucidal activity of mouthwashes against a Human Coronavirus.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, Mouthwash, HCoV-SARS 229E, COVID-19, Cetylpyridinium Chloride.
Highlights
SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through contact with infective saliva.
Studies are needed to understand if mouthwash can lower SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.
0.07% Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC) mouthwash exhibited virucidal effects against HCoV-SARS
229E.
Further studies on potential of 0.07% CPC mouthwash against SARS-CoV-2 are warranted.
Abstract
Background: saliva is established to contain high counts SARS-CoV-2 virus and contact with saliva
droplets, contaminated surfaces or airborne particles are sources of viral transmission. The generation
of infective aerosols during clinical procedures is of particular concern. Therefore, a fuller
understanding of the potential of mouthwash to reduce viral counts and modulate the risk of
transmission in medical professional and public context is an important research topic.
Method: we determined the virucidal activity of four anti-bacterial mouthwashes against a surrogate
for SARS-CoV-2, Human CoV-SARS 229E, using a standard ASTM suspension test, with dilution
and contact times applicable to recommended mouthwash use.

Results: the mouthwash formulated with 0.07% Cetylpyridinium Chloride exhibited virucidal effects
providing a ≥3.0 log reduction HCoV-229E viral count. Mouthwashes containing 15.7% ethanol,
0.2% zinc sulphate heptahydrate and a mix of enzymes and proteins did not demonstrate substantive
virucidal activity in this test.
Conclusion: mouthwash containing 0.07% Cetylpyridinium Chloride warrants further laboratory and
clinical assessment to determine their potential benefit in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2.
Introduction
One of the main transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be through aerosols and droplets
of infective saliva, either directly via coughing, sneezing and exhalation or indirectly via fomites1.
SARS-CoV-2 saliva load has been reported to be up to 107 copies per ml, suggesting active viral
replication occurs in the mouth2. Salivary glands, oral mucosa and the tongue are reported to express
the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE-2, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter host cells3, 4.
This suggests that reducing infective SARS-CoV-2 load in saliva could play a key role in reducing the
risk of viral transmission. In addition to the general population, the risk of transmission from
infective saliva aerosols generated during clinical procedures is of particular concern, including
authors of a recent Cochrane review who urge researchers to conduct studies to understand the
potential of anti-bacterial mouthwashes and sprays to protect healthcare professionals during aerosolgenerating procedures5, 6. Therefore, an understanding of the potential of mouthwash use to reduce
SARS-CoV-2 viral load and modulate the risk of transmission in professional and public settings is a
pressing question to address.
Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are enveloped viruses possessing a host derived lipid bilayer.
This lipid bilayer can be disrupted by agents through lipid solubilisation, membrane disruption or
damage to the embedded glycoproteins7. A recent publication reported that several commercial antibacterial mouthwashes possessed virucidal effects against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, however, it is
possible that other established anti-bacterial agents may have potential to inactivate enveloped
viruses, including SARS-CoV-28. In this paper we report the virucidal effect of four mouthwashes
formulated with different anti-bacterial agents against a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate, Human Coronavirus
Strain 229E, using a standard ‘time to kill’ suspension test and contact times appropriate to
mouthwash use.
Methods
The virucidal activity of each mouthwash was determined following the ASTM International Standard
E1052-20 suspension protocol, Standard Practice to Assess the Activity of Microbicides Against
Viruses in Suspension. Human Coronavirus Strain HCoV-229E (#VR-740) was sourced from ATCC
(American Type Culture Collection) and high titer viral stocks were propagated and maintained by
BioScience Laboratories Inc (Bozeman, Montana, USA). On the day of testing, stock virus was
removed from a -70°C freezer and thawed prior to use with independent aliquots were prepared for
each replicate. The host cell line, MRC-5 was obtained from ATCC (#CRL-171) and was maintained
as monolayers in growth media containing 4% serum (FBS) at 35 +/- 2°C and 5% CO2 using
disposable cell culture labware. 24 hours prior to testing, cells were seeded into multi-well cell
culture plates. For viral infectivity testing, cell monolayers were used at 80-90% confluence and were
maintained under serum-free conditions. Prior to testing, neutralisation studies of each product were
conducted versus the test virus to ensure the virucidal properties of the test product were effectively
neutralised and the neutraliser solution was non-toxic to both the challenge virus and the host cell line.
For all test mouthwash products, Dey-Engley neutralising broth (D/E broth) was effective and used in
all testing. Test solutions were further detoxified by passing them through a Sephadex column.
Neutralisation and Cytotoxicity controls were performed in tandem with testing and were used as
controls in analysis of the results.

For the test treatment, a 0.5ml of viral aliquot was added to 4.5ml of undiluted mouthwash and
incubated for 30 and 60 seconds at ambient temperature. All test treatments were conducted in
triplicate and plating was performed with four replicates. The post exposure infectivity TCID50 (50%
tissue culture infectious dose) was determined using the Quantal test (Spearman -Kärber method) and
a mean log10 reduction was calculated as the difference in TCID50. Test mouthwashes were:
Mouthwash containing 0.07% Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC), sodium fluoride, and flavour oil
Mouthwash containing 15.7% ethanol, sodium fluoride, and flavour oil.
Mouthwash containing 0.2% zinc sulphate heptahydrate, sodium fluoride and flavour oil.
Mouthwash containing mix of Amyloglucosidase, Glucose Oxidase, Lysozyme, Colostrum,
Lactoferrin, Lactoperoxidase, sodium fluoride and flavour oil.
Results
Mouthwashes are water based formulations, containing humectants, emulsifiers, a fluoride source,
preservatives, and flavour oils to provide pleasant taste. To this similar formulation chassis, antibacterial agents are incorporated. In this study, we compared four anti-bacterial mouthwashes
containing actives hypothesised to act against enveloped viruses. CPC is a quaternary ammonium
compound which interacts with the viral envelope through cationic charge-based interaction leading
to gross distortion of the viral ultrastructure9. Similarly, alcohols including ethanol, perturb the lipid
membrane leading to leakage7. Zinc cations are reported to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV and
binding of SARS-CoV-2 to AC2-E receptors10, 11. The mouthwash with enzymes and proteins is
designed to generate hypothiocyanate from the Lactoperoxidase (LPO) system, with the LPO system
reported to possess virucidal activity against a number of enveloped viruses12. Additionally,
lysozyme and lactoferrin are components of innate viral defences, and as cationic proteins, can be
hypothesised to act on the viral lipid envelope13.
However, of these four anti-bacterial mouthwashes, only the mouthwash containing 0.07% CPC
exhibited viricidal activity against HCoV-229E, providing a mean 3.08 TCID50 log10 reduction in
viral count. This corresponds to ≥99.9% reduction in viral count and was achieved with contact times
relevant to mouthwash use. Contact with ethanol, zinc and enzyme and protein mouthwashes did not
provide substantial reduction in viral counts in this in vitro test. A summary of results for all
mouthwashes is provided in Table 1.
Discussion
Currently, there are few published studies reporting efficacy of anti-bacterial mouthwashes against
SARS-CoV-2 or surrogates. This is against a backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic with medical
professionals urging research into the potential benefits of mouthwash to reducing viral load and
lower risk of transmission5. In this study, we confirm that not all anti-microbial mouthwashes possess
virucidal benefits. Against a SARS COV2 surrogate HCoV-229E, at relevant in use contact times,
only the 0.07% CPC mouthwash proved to be effective in reducing viral count by greater than 99.9%.
Though preliminary, this result agrees with evidence of CPC activity against influenza virus and a
recently published clinical trial with COVID-19 patients, where a 0.075% CPC containing mouthwash
was reported to reduce saliva viral load for up to 6 hours after use9,14. Contact with the mouthwash
containing 15.7% ethanol did not lead to significant reduction in count, and given alcohol levels of
60% - 95% v/v are used in hand hygiene products, it seems likely that a mouthwash will require a
higher concentration of ethanol or combination of agents to bring about a reduction in viral load15.
Under the conditions of this test, mouthwashes with zinc and the enzyme and proteins mix did not
substantively impact viral count, however, these agents are reported to have viricidal action and merit
further study. In summary, based on our findings, we propose the need further in vitro and clinical
