The recent spillover of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population resulted in the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has already caused 4.9 million infections and
more than 326,000 fatalities. To initiate infection the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
glycoprotein promotes attachment to the host cell surface, determining host and
tissue tropism, and fusion of the viral and host membranes. Although SARS-CoV2 S is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of vaccine design,
its stability and conformational dynamics are limiting factors for developing
countermeasures against this virus. We report here the design of a prefusion
SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer construct covalently stabilized in the closed
conformation. Structural and antigenicity analysis showed we successfully shut S
in the closed state without otherwise altering its architecture. Finally, we show that
this engineering strategy is applicable to other b-coronavirus S glycoproteins and
might become an important tool for vaccine design, structural biology, serology
and immunology studies.

In the past two decades, three zoonotic coronaviruses crossed the species barrier
to cause severe pneumonia in humans: (i) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), that was associated with an epidemic in 2002-2003 and a few additional
cases in 20041,2, (ii) Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which
is currently circulating in the Arabian peninsula3, and (iii) SARS-CoV-2, the etiological
agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic4,5. SARS-CoV-2, was discovered in December
2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, was sequenced and isolated by January 20204,6
and has infected over 4.9 million people with more than 326,000 fatalities as of May 20th
2020. No vaccines or specific therapeutics are licensed to treat or prevent infections from
any of the seven human-infecting coronaviruses with the exception of Remdesivir7,8 which

was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use for
COVID-19 treatment.
Coronaviruses gain access to host cells using the homotrimeric transmembrane
spike (S) glycoprotein protruding from the viral surface9. S comprises two functional
subunits: S1 (encompassing the A, B, C and D domains) and S2. These subunits are
responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular
membranes, respectively10. For many coronaviruses, including the newly emerged
SARS-CoV-2, S is cleaved at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits which remain
non-covalently bound in the prefusion conformation10-18. The distal S1 subunit comprises
the receptor-binding domain(s), and contributes to stabilization of the prefusion state of
the membrane-anchored S2 subunit which contains the fusion machinery10,17,19-25. For all
coronaviruses, upon receptor binding S is further cleaved by host proteases at the S2’ site
located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide14,16,26. This cleavage has been
proposed to activate the protein for membrane fusion via extensive irreversible
conformational changes13-16,19,27,28. As a result, coronavirus entry into susceptible cells is
a complex process that requires the concerted action of receptor-binding and proteolytic
processing of the S protein to promote virus-cell fusion.
Viral fusion proteins, including coronavirus S glycoproteins, fold in a high-energy,
kinetically-trapped prefusion conformation found at the viral surface before host cell
invasion29. This metastable state is activated with exquisite spatial and temporal precision
upon encounter of a target host cell by one or multiple stimuli such as pH change30,31,
proteolytic activation13,15 or protein-protein interactions32. The ensuing irreversible and
large-scale structural changes of viral fusion proteins are coupled to fusion of the viral
and host membrane to initiate infection. As a result, the postfusion state of a viral fusion
protein is the lowest energy conformation (i.e. ground state) observed throughout the
reaction coordinates29. A notable exception to this general pathway is the vesicular
stomatitis virus fusion glycoprotein G that can reversibly fold from the postfusion to the
prefusion conformation31,33,34.
The intrinsic metastability of viral fusion proteins – which is oftentimes magnified
by working with ectodomain constructs lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic
segments – has posed challenges for studying the structure and function of these
glycoproteins and for vaccine design. As a result, a variety of approaches have been
implemented to stabilize these fragile glycoproteins. Proline substitutions preventing
refolding to an elongated a-helical structure observed in postfusion influenza virus
hemagglutinin were reported as a promising strategy to stabilize the prefusion state of
this widely studied viral glycoprotein35. Engineering approaches based on this concept
along with introduction of designed disulfide bonds and other mutations have

subsequently been utilized for stabilizing the prefusion conformation of other class I fusion
proteins, such as the SOSIP mutations in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein36-39. Structureguided prefusion stabilization via introduction of disulfide bonds and cavity-filling
mutations was successfully implemented for the respiratory syncytial virus fusion
glycoprotein40 (DS-Cav1) and parainfluenza virus 1-4 fusion glycoproteins41. Designed
disulfide bonds have also proven useful to enhance the prefusion stability of the Hendra
virus fusion glycoprotein42, mutations which were later applied to the Nipah virus fusion
protein43. Finally, the introduction of double proline substitutions, herein 2P, to prevent
fusogenic conformational changes of MERS-CoV S20 and SARS-CoV S44 was shown to
stabilize the prefusion states of these glycoproteins. These results provided proof-ofconcept of the broad applicability of this approach to coronavirus S glycoproteins, which
was subsequently confirmed by its successful use for SARS-CoV-2 S structural
studies18,45,46. In spite of these advances, the conformational dynamics and limited
stability of the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoproteins remain a
challenge that needs to be overcome to accelerate structural studies of the immune
response elicited by coronavirus infections and vaccine design. Recent reports of the
observation of postfusion trimers at the surface of purified authentic SARS-CoV-247 and
of spontaneous refolding of a fraction of S trimers upon detergent-solubilization48
showcase these limitations.
We report here the design of a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain
trimer construct engineered to remain in the closed conformation through introduction of
an intermolecular disulfide bond. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis of this
glycoprotein coupled with ELISA assays unambiguously demonstrated that our strategy
successfully shut S in the closed state without otherwise altering its architecture, as
evaluated by binding to a panel of human monoclonal neutralizing antibodies and a
COVID-19 convalescent plasma. We show that this covalent stabilization strategy is
applicable to other b-coronavirus S glycoproteins and envision it might become an
important tool for vaccine design, structural biology, serology and immunology studies.
Structure-based design of a SARS-CoV-2 S trimer stabilized in the closed
conformation
Structural fluctuations of the receptor-binding SB domain (also known as RBD),
from a closed to an open conformation, enables exposure of the receptor-binding motif
which mediates interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV26,18,49-54 and SARS-CoV55,56, or dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 for MERS-CoV57,58 (Fig 1 a-b).
Receptor-engagement or interaction with the Fab fragment of the S230 neutralizing
monoclonal antibody were previously shown to induce the SARS-CoV S cascade of
conformational changes leading to membrane fusion, which we proposed to proceed
through a molecular ratcheting mechanism22,59. Although SB opening and/or

displacement/shedding of the S1 subunit is expected to occur for all coronavirus S
glycoproteins, to free the S2 subunit during membrane fusion60, such changes have only
been observed for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoproteins20-23,44,59.
Since these three S trimers suffer from limited stability compared to S trimers that have
not been observed to open, such as HCoV-OC43 S24, we reasoned that arresting the first
step of SARS-CoV-2 S refolding toward the postfusion state might enhance the stability
of the prefusion state.
Based on these considerations, we set out to engineer SARS-CoV-2 S stalled in
the closed conformation of the three SB receptor-binding domains through introduction of
disulfide bonds within the ectodomain trimer construct we previously used to determine
structures of the closed and open conformations18,46. Specifically, our construct harbored
an abrogated furin S1/S2 cleavage site (R682S, R683G and R685G)10,24,59,61, two
consecutive proline stabilizing mutations (K986P and V987P)20,44 and a C-terminal foldon
trimerization domain62. We designed the following pairs of cysteine substitutions aimed
at introducing three inter-molecular disulfide bonds per trimer: S383C/D985C,
G413C/P987C, and T385C/T415C (Fig 1c). Out of the three pairs of substitutions tested,
only the S383C/D985C (termed SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S) could be recombinantly
expressed using HEK293 Freestyle cells and purified. SDS-PAGE analysis of SARSCoV-2 2P DS S in reducing and non-reducing conditions demonstrated that the
engineered disulfide bond was indeed correctly introduced (Fig 1d). Further
characterization of purified SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S using negative staining electron
microscopy indicated proper homotrimer folding and assembly (Fig 1e).

CryoEM structure of a prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S trimer stabilized in the closed
conformation
Since the DS substitutions connect regions of the S glycoprotein that are far apart
upon SB receptor-binding domain opening and transition to the postfusion S state60,63, we
expected this protein construct to be trapped in the closed S state via molecular stapling.
To validate our design strategy, we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy to
analyze the conformational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S (Table 1 and Fig S1).
3D classification of the cryoEM dataset demonstrated that all particle images clustered in
3D reconstructions of the closed S trimer (Fig S2). In contrast, about half of the particle

images selected from our previous SARS-CoV-2 2P S apo dataset corresponded to the
closed S trimer whereas the other half was accounted for by a partially open S trimer18.
These results therefore indicate we successfully engineered a shut closed S trimer.
We subsequently determined a 3D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S at 2.9
Å resolution (applying 3-fold symmetry) (Fig 2 a-b ). As the SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S
structure was obtained with much fewer particles (46,181 particles) than all other studies
to date18,45,46, we speculate that this engineered construct has enhanced stability relative
to the construct lacking the DS mutations. The cryoEM map shows a good agreement
with our previously determined structure of SARS-CoV-2 2P S in the closed
conformation18 with which it could be superimposed with a Ca root mean square deviation
of 1.36 Å over 959 aligned alpha-carbons (Fig 2 c). The cryoEM density also resolves the
disulfide bond between a SB receptor-binding domain residue facing towards the fusion
machinery (S383C) and the hairpin preceding the S2 subunit central helix (D985C) from
a neighboring protomer, the latter residue being located directly upstream the K986P and
V987P prefusion-stabilizing mutations (Fig 2 d). These findings not only validate the
structure-based design strategy but also show that it did not induce distortions of the S
trimer. We note that density at the C-terminal stem helix was not resolved in SARS-CoV2 2P DS S – accounting for 6 amino acid residues – whereas this region was visible in
previously reported apo S maps18,45 but not in the SARS-CoV-2 S/S309 neutralizing
antibody complex map46.

Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 2P DS antigenicity
The high structural similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S structure presented here
and our previously reported SARS-CoV-2 2P S structure (in the closed conformation)18,
led us to hypothesize that they would have similar antigenicity profiles – besides the lost
ability to interact with binders requiring opening of the SB receptor-binding domains (e.g.
the receptor-binding motif) for the former construct. To probe the influence of the
introduced disulfide bond on antigenicity, we evaluated binding of SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S
and SARS-CoV-2 2P S, side-by-side, to a panel of human neutralizing antibodies by
ELISA. Binding to S309 was indistinguishable between the two constructs (Fig. 3 a), in
agreement with the fact this antibody recognizes an epitope within the SB receptor-binding
domain that remains accessible in both the open and closed states46. Furthermore, we
observed a dose-dependent response for binding of the receptor-binding motif-targeted
S2H14 antibody to SARS-CoV-2 2P S which was dampened by several orders of
magnitude with SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S, as expected due to conformational masking of
the receptor-binding motif in the closed conformation18 (Fig. 3 b). Although the S304
antibody interacted with SARS-CoV-2 2P S in a concentration-dependent manner, it did
not bind to SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S (Fig. 3 c). Since we previously demonstrated that S304
recognizes an epitope distinct from both the receptor-binding motif and the S309 epitope,
it is expected that this antibody binds to a cryptic epitope that is only accessible upon SB
opening, as is the case for the CR3022 antibody64-67. Collectively, these findings validate
that SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S is in a native, closed conformation and illustrate the usefulness
of this protein construct to investigate epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies.
We subsequently assessed binding of a COVID-19 convalescent patient plasma
sample to SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S and SARS-CoV-2 2P S by ELISA. The sample was
obtained from a Washington State donor who was selected based on its unusually high
plasma antibody neutralization titer (mean half-maximal inhibition reciprocal dilution of
~1/800, Fig S3). Comparison of half-maximal binding titers showed that recognition of
SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S was ~40-fold weaker than that of SARS-CoV-2 2P S (Fig. 3 d).
This difference likely reflect the proportion of antibodies directed to the receptor-binding
motif or cryptic epitopes similar to the one recognized by S304 in this plasma sample. As

SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S only displays closed SB receptor-binding domains within the
context of a folded trimer, we suggest it will be a useful tool for serology studies aiming
at evaluating antibody responses in COVID-19 patients, and could complement tests
using ACE2 inhibition as a proxy for evaluating the presence of neutralizing antibody titers
in the human population.

Discussion
Viral glycoprotein engineering is an active field of research fueling vaccine design
strategies to elicit potent and/or broad protection against a range of emerging or endemic
pathogens. Stabilization of the respiratory syncytial virus fusion glycoprotein in its
prefusion conformation (DS-Cav1)40 and subsequent fusion to a computationally
designed trimeric protein (I53-50A)68 are recent breakthroughs illustrating the power of

structure-based vaccine design. Ds-Cav1 is currently evaluated in a phase I randomized,
open-label clinical trial to assess its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in healthy
adults (NCT03049488). Furthermore, multivalently-displayed Ds-Cav1 genetically fused
to the I53-50 nanoparticle has been shown to further improve elicitation of high titers of
neutralizing antibodies68. Similarly, the development of HIV-1 SOSIP constructs have
revolutionized the field of HIV-1 structural vaccinology and immunology36.
The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic, showcases the urgent need to explore strategies to expedite
coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics design initiatives as well as structural and serology
studies. Prefusion-stabilization of MERS-CoV S through the aforementioned introduction
of two proline substitutions was previously shown to elicit enhanced neutralizing antibody
titers against multiple MERS-CoV isolates in mice20. However, the limited stability and
conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 2P S, SARS-CoV 2P S and MERS-CoV 2P
S ectodomain trimers indicate that further improvements are needed to increase their
shelf life and/or to manipulate their conformational states.
We report here a strategy to produce prefusion-stabilized, closed coronavirus
ectodomain trimers and show it is broadly applicable to at least the b-genus which
accounts for 5 out of 7 human-infecting coronaviruses, including the most pathogenic
members (i.e. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). By symmetrizing and
stabilizing S proteins, we expect the DS mutation be a useful tool for the research
community, enabling high-resolution structural studies of antibody complexes, and for
characterizing the humoral immune response in infected or vaccinated individuals and
animals.
We hypothesize that the design strategy described here might improve the breadth
of neutralizing antibodies elicited via masking of the highly immunogenic receptor-binding
motif. The tradeoff, however, will be dampening of induction of antibodies targeting the
receptor-binding motif which is typically recognized by potent neutralizing antibodies but
with narrow breadth between coronaviruses due to poor conservation. For the same
reasons, we also envision that S glycoprotein constructs shut in the closed conformation
could assist in isolating broadly neutralizing antibodies effective against multiple viruses
belonging to distinct (sub)genera.
Finally, as demonstrated here, comparing the reactivity of DS constructs with
protein constructs exhibiting the full range of SB receptor-binding domain conformations
will allow to evaluate the fraction of antibodies recognizing the receptor-binding motif
and/or cryptic epitopes in serology studies to provide a detailed understanding of the
humoral immune response elicited upon infection or vaccination. Given that receptor-

binding motif targeting antibodies are typically neutralizing, this comparison may serve as
a proxy for estimating whether a patient has neutralizing antibodies or not.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design of disulfide mutants
Disulfide mutants were designed using the Disulfide by Design 2 software69 and synthetic
genes ordered from Genscript.
Recombinant S ectodomains production
All ectodomains were produced in 500mL cultures of HEK293F cells grown in suspension
using FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Life technologies) at 37°C in a humidified 8%
CO2 incubator rotating at 130 r.p.m., as previously reported18. The culture was
transfected using 293fectin (ThermoFisher Scientific) with cells grown to a density of 106
cells per mL and cultivated for three days. The supernatant was harvested and cells were
resuspended for another three days, yielding two harvests. Clarified supernatants were
purified using a 5 mL Cobalt or Nickel affinity column (Takara). Purified protein was
concentrated, and flash frozen in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl
prior to cryoEM analysis.

Antibody expression
Recombinant antibodies were expressed in ExpiCHO cells transiently co-transfected with
plasmids expressing the heavy and light chain, as previously described46.
Serum preparation
A de-identified COVID-19 patient plasma sample was collected and heat-inactivated at
56 °C for one hour.
ELISA
20µl of ectodomains (stabilized prefusion trimer) of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, or the
disulphide stabilized SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, were coated on 384 well ELISA plates
at 1 ng/µl for 16 hours at 4°C. Plates were washed with a 405 TS Microplate Washer
(BioTek Instruments) then blocked with 80 µl SuperBlock (PBS) Blocking Buffer (Thermo
Scientific) for 1 hour at 37°C. Plates were then washed and 30 µl antibodies were added
to the plates at concentrations between 4 X 10-8 and 10 ng/µl and incubated for 1 h at
37°C. Plates were washed and then incubated with 30 µl of 1/5000 diluted goat antihuman Fc IgG-HRP (invitrogen A18817). Plates were washed and then 30 µl Substrate
TMB microwell peroxidase (Seracare 5120-0083) was added for 5 min at room
temperature. The colorimetric reaction was stopped by addition of 30 µl of 1 N HCl. A450
was read on a Varioskan Lux plate reader (Thermo Scientific).
Pseudovirus neutralization assays
Murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped viruses were prepared
as previously described18. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a SARS-CoV-2 S
encoding-plasmid, an MLV Gag-Pol packaging construct and the MLV transfer vector
encoding a luciferase reporter using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated for 5
hours at 37°C with 8% CO2 with OPTIMEM transfection medium. DMEM containing 10%
FBS was added for 72 hours.
HEK293T cells stably expressing human ACE270 were cultured in DMEM containing 10%
FBS, 1% PenStrep and plated into 96 well plates for 16-24 hours. Concentrated
pseudovirus with or without serial dilution of COVID-19 convalescent plasma was
incubated for 1 hour and then added to the wells after washing 3X with DMEM. After 2-3
hours DMEM containing 20% FBS and 2% PenStrep was added to the cells for 48 hours.
Following 48 hours of infection, One-Glo-EX (Promega) was added to the cells and
incubated in the dark for 5-10 minutes prior to reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader
(ThermoFisher). Measurements were done in duplicate and relative luciferase units (RLU)
were converted to percent neutralization and plotted with a non-linear regression curve fit
in PRISM.

Negative-stain EM sample preparation
All constructs in this study were negatively stained at a final concentration of 0.06 mg/mL
using Gilder Grids overlaid with a thin layer of carbon and 2% uranyl formate. Data were
acquired using the Leginon software71 to control a Tecnai T12 transmission electron
microscope operated at 120 kV and equipped with a Gatan 4K Ultrascan CCD detector.
The dose rate was adjusted to 50 electrons / Å2 and each micrograph was acquired in 1
second. ~100 micrographs were collected in a single session with a defocus range
comprised between -1.0 and -2.5 μm. Data were subsequently processed using
cryoSPARC72.
CryoEM sample preparation and data collection.
3 µL of SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S at 0.5 mg/mL was applied onto a freshly glow discharged
2.0/2.0 UltraFoil grid (200 mesh). Plunge freezing used a vitrobot MarkIV (ThermoFisher
Scientific) using a blot force of 0 and 6.5 second blot time at 100% humidity and 23°C.
Data were acquired using the Leginon software71 to control a Glacios transmission
electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct
detector. The dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired
in 50 frames of 200 ms with a pixel size of 1.16 Å at the specimen level. ~600 micrographs
were collected in a single session with a defocus range comprised between -0.8 and -3.0
μm.
CryoEM data processing
Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function
parameters, particle picking and extraction (with a box size of 352 pixels2) were carried
out using Warp73. Reference-free 2D classification was performed using cryoSPARC72 to
select well-defined particle images. 3D classification with 50 iterations each (angular
sampling 7.5˚ for 25 iterations and 1.8˚ with local search for 25 iterations) were carried
out using Relion74 without imposing symmetry to separate distinct SARS-CoV-2 S
conformations. 3D refinements were carried out using non-uniform refinement along with
per-particle defocus refinement in cryoSPARC72. Particle images were subjected to
Bayesian polishing75 before performing another round of non-uniform refinement in
cryoSPARC72 followed by per-particle defocus refinement and again non-uniform
refinement. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation
(FSC) of 0.143 criterion and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects
of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution76.
CryoEM model building and analysis.
UCSF Chimera77 and Coot were used to fit an atomic model (PDB 6VXX) into the cryoEM
map. The model was then refined into the map using Rosetta78-80 and analyzed using
MolProbity81, EMringer82, and Phenix83. Figures were generated using UCSF ChimeraX84
and UCSF Chimera77.
