Abstract:
COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),
represents a global crisis. Key to SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development is unraveling the
mechanisms driving high infectivity, broad tissue tropism and severe pathology. Our cryo-EM
5

structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein reveals that the receptor binding domains
(RBDs) tightly and specifically bind the essential free fatty acid (FFA) linoleic acid (LA) in three
composite binding pockets. The pocket also appears to be present in the highly pathogenic
coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Lipid metabolome remodeling is a key feature of
coronavirus infection, with LA at its core. LA metabolic pathways are central to inflammation,

10

immune modulation and membrane fluidity. Our structure directly links LA and S, setting the
stage for interventions targeting LA binding and metabolic remodeling by SARS-CoV-2.

Main Text:
At present, there are seven coronaviruses that are known to infect humans. The four endemic
human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 cause mild upper respiratory tract
infections while pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, and earlier SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can
5

cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death
(1,2). In order to enable development of effective therapeutic interventions, a central goal of
ongoing research into the COVID-19 pandemic is to determine the features of SARS-CoV-2 that
provide it with a lethal combination of high infectivity and high pathogenicity.
SARS-CoV-2 has acquired novel functions that promote its harsh disease phenotype. While the

10

previous closely related SARS-CoV did not significantly spread past the lungs, a recent study
reported damage or severe inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 patients’ endothelial cells in the heart,
kidneys, liver and intestines, suggestive of a vascular infection rather than a respiratory disease
(3). The attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to a host cell is initiated by S binding to its cognate receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with higher affinity as compared to SARS-CoV (4-6).

15

A novel S1/S2 polybasic furin protease cleavage site stimulates entry into host cells and cell-cell
fusion (4,7,8). Inside the host cell, human coronaviruses remodel the lipid metabolism to
facilitate virus replication (9). Infection by SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unusually impaired and
dysregulated immune response (10) and a heightened inflammatory response (11) working in
synergy with interferon production in the vicinity of infected cells to drive a feed-forward loop to

20

upregulate ACE2 and further escalate infection (12).
In the search for additional novel functions that contribute to the observed extreme pathology of
infection, we determined the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein by cryo-EM (Fig.1).
We discovered in our structure that the S trimer tightly binds three LA molecules in specific
3

binding pockets, endowing a scavenger function on S, poised to impact lipid remodeling and fuel
SARS-CoV-2 pathologies.
We expressed SARS-CoV-2 S as a secreted trimer (13) in MultiBac (14) baculovirus-infected
Hi5 insect cells using ESF921 media which contains cod liver oil as a nutrient supplement
5

(Corey Jacklin, Expression Systems, personal communication). Cod liver oil comprises hundreds
of FFAs including LA (15) while uninfected Hi5 cells contain very little LA (16). We purified S
using immobilized metal-affinity purification and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (fig.
S1). Highly purified protein was used for cryo-EM data collection (fig. S2, table S1). After 3D
classification and refinement without applying symmetry (C1) we obtained a 3.0Å closed

10

conformation from 136,405 particles and a 3.5Å open conformation with one receptor-binding
domain (RBD) in the up position from 57,990 particles (figs. S2,S3). C3 symmetry was applied
to the closed conformation particle pool yielding a 2.85Å map (Fig.1A, figs. S2,S3).
The structure of S displays the characteristic overall shape observed for coronavirus S proteins in
the closed and open conformations (17-19) with the closed form predominating in our data set

15

(Fig.1A, figs. S2-S4). Model building of the closed form evidenced additional density in the
RBDs in our structure (Fig.1B). The tube-like shape of this density was consistent with a fatty
acid. Modeling conveyed LA based on size and shape similarity with LA bound to other proteins
(Fig.1B, fig. S5) (20, 21). Liquid chromatography coupled ESI-TOF mass spectrometry (LS-MS)
analysis confirmed the presence of a compound with the molecular weight of LA in our highly

20

purified sample (Fig.1C).
Hallmarks of FFA-binding pockets in proteins are an extended ‘greasy’ tube lined by
hydrophobic amino acids which accommodates the hydrocarbon tail, and a hydrophilic, often
positively charged anchor for the acidic headgroup of the FFA. In our structure, a hydrophobic

pocket is present which is mostly shaped by phenylalanines to form a bent tube into which the
LA fits excellently (Fig.1D,E). Importantly, the anchor for the headgroup carboxyl is provided
by an arginine (R408) and a glutamine (Q409) from the adjacent RBD in the trimer, giving rise
to a composite LA-binding site (Fig.1E). We confirmed presence of LA in all three binding
5

pockets in the S trimer in the unsymmetrized (C1) closed structure (fig. S6). Our S construct
contains alterations as compared to native SARS-CoV-2 S including a trimerization domain and
deletion of the polybasic cleavage site, neither of which alter S conformation noticeably (13,17)
(fig. S7). Moreover, glycosylation sites are located elsewhere and largely native in our structure
(6,17) (table S2). We conclude that neither mutations nor glycosylation impact on the LA-

10

binding pocket. We posit that our SARS-CoV-2 S accreted solely LA from among the many
FFAs present during expression, and held on to LA firmly during purification and cryo-EM grid
preparation involving massive dilutions, arguing for exquisite specificity and high affinity of the
interaction.
Closed and open S conformations are in a dynamic equilibrium with the open form mediating

15

binding to ACE2 for cell entry. We tested activity of our LA-bound S by competition enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SEC with highly purified proteins confirming ACE2
binding (Fig.2A,B). We modeled the receptor-bound structure (22) (Fig.2C) and found that the
LA-binding pocket and the receptor binding motif (Achilles Heel, AH) of the RBD are distal and
non-overlapping. The LA-bound S we produce is prolifically used in Bristol for testing patient

20

sera for antibodies in immunology assays, further confirming functionality.
Based on our findings, we propose that the previously determined SARS-CoV-2 S structures
represent an ‘apo’ form in absence of LA ligand. We hypothesize that during SARS-CoV-2
infection, S proteins of the replicating virus accrete LA giving rise to the ligand-bound form. We

superimposed our LA-bound structure and the SARS-CoV-2 S ‘apo’ form (6,17) and identified a
gating helix located directly at the entrance of the binding pocket. This gating helix, upon LA
binding, moved away by about 6Å, with two tyrosines (Tyr365 and Tyr369) and Phe374 that line
the gate swinging open (Fig.3A,B). In the ‘apo’ SARS-CoV-2 S trimer (6,17), a gap exists
5

between adjacent RBDs with the hydrophilic anchor residues which stabilize the LA headgroup
located ~10 Å away from the greasy tube entrance (Fig.3B). Upon LA binding, the gap closes,
the adjacent RBD in the trimer moves towards its neighbour with anchor residues Arg408 and
Gln409 locking down on the headgroup of LA (Fig.3B). Overall, this results in a marked
compaction of trimer architecture in the region formed by the three RBDs (Fig.3B).

10

Next, we compared the sequences and structures of human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four common circulating strains (Fig.3, table S3) and
investigated whether the LA-binding pocket is conserved. Sequence alignment shows that all
residues lining the hydrophobic pocket and the anchor residues (Arg408/Gln409) in SARS-CoV2 are fully conserved in SARS-CoV (Fig.3A). Structural alignment of LA-bound RBDs within

15

the trimer of SARS-CoV-2 and ‘apo’ SARS-CoV RBDs (19) reveals that the LA-binding pocket
is present and accessible in SARS-CoV. The greasy tube is flanked by a gating helix as in SARSCoV-2, with Arg395/Gln396 of SARS-CoV pre-positioned 10Å and 11Å from the entrance,
respectively, virtually identical to apo SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.3B,C). In MERS-CoV, the gating
helix and hydrophobic residues lining the pocket are also present. Tyr365, Tyr369 and Phe374

20

are substituted by likewise hydrophobic leucines and a valine, respectively (Fig.3A,D) (19). The
Arg408/Gln409 pair is not conserved, however, we identify Asn501/Lys502 and Gln466 as
potential anchor residues, located on a β-sheet and an α-helix within the adjacent RBD, up to
11Å away from the entrance (Fig.3D). Thus, the greasy tube and hydrophilic anchor for binding

LA appear to be present in MERS-CoV, suggesting convergent evolution. In HCoV OC43,
gating helix and hydrophobic residues lining the pocket are largely conserved, while Tyr365,
Tyr369 and Phe374 are replaced by methionines and alanine, respectively (Fig.3A) (18). Arg413
is located on the same helix as Arg408/Gln409 in SARS-CoV-2 and could serve as a hydrophilic
5

anchor (Fig.3E). No gap exists in this presumed ‘apo’ form structure between the RBDs which
appear already in the locked conformation with no LA bound, likely obstructing the pocket
entrance and constraining gating helix movement (Fig.3E, fig. S8) (18). In HCoV HKU1, the
hydrophobic residues are again largely conserved, but a charged residue (Glu375) is positioned
directly in front of the entrance, obstructing access for a putative LA ligand (Fig.3F) (23). The

10

RBDs of HCoVs 229E and NL63, in marked contrast, adopt a very different fold (fig. S9)
(24,25), and many of the LA-binding residues are not present (Fig.3A), indicating no obvious
binding site for LA.
In summary, we find four molecular features mediating LA binding to SARS-CoV-2, and
potentially also SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins: a conserved hydrophobic pocket, a

15

gating helix, amino acid residues pre-positioned to interact with the LA carboxy headgroup, and
loosely packed RBDs in the ‘apo’ form. On the other hand, in each of the four common
circulating HCoVs, it appears that one or more of these four architectural prerequisites are
lacking in the S protein structures (Fig. 3). LA-binding to SARS-CoV-2 S protein triggers a
locking down of the hydrophilic anchor and a compaction of the RBD trimer (Fig.3B). This

20

lockdown could contribute to the observed prevalence of closed conformation in our cryo-EM
data set. It could also help stabilize the S1 region comprising the N-terminal domain and the
RBD. Of note, the AH epitope, central to ACE2 binding, appears to be conformationally
preorganized in our closed conformation (Fig.2C) indicating a generally more rigid RBD

structure when LA is bound. While direct crosstalk in between the LA-binding pocket and the
AH epitope is not apparent from our structure (Fig.2C), the overall conformational changes in
the RBD trimer (Fig.3B) could conceivably impact ACE2 docking and infectivity. The S
protein's highly selective binding of LA originates from the very well-defined size and shape
5

complementarity afforded by the LA-binding pocket (Fig. 1B,D), which is supported by the
observation that we only detected LA in our analyses (Fig. 1C). The LA-binding pocket thus
presents a promising target for future development of small molecule inhibitors (e.g. LA
mimetics) that, for example, could irreversibly lock S in the closed conformation.
A recent proteomic and metabolomic study of COVID-19 patient sera evidenced continuous

10

decrease of FFAs including LA (26). Lipid metabolome remodeling is a common element of
viral infection (27,28), including by the baculovirus (29) used here to express S. For
coronaviruses, the LA to arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway was identified as the
epicentre of lipid remodeling (9). Interestingly, exogenous supplement of LA or AA suppressed
virus replication (9). It is remarkable in this context that the S trimer of SARS-CoV-2 binds LA

15

with astonishing specificity, and we consider it highly unlikely that this is mere coincidence.
Virus-induced lipid metabolome remodeling alters three separate processes in cells (9,27,28): (i)
energy homeostasis via changes in catabolic and anabolic precursor equilibria; (ii) fluidity and
elasticity of biological membranes, via changes in e.g. saturated/unsaturated fatty acid ratio in
phospholipids; and (iii) cell signaling, via changes in levels of lipid-based cell signaling

20

precursors. By SARS-CoV-2, significant changes in cell signaling are anticipated due to LA to
AA metabolome remodeling, since the LA biosynthetic pathway leads to eicosanoids, which are
prominent signaling molecules involved in inflammatory processes (30). LA itself is detected by
FFA receptor GPR40/FFAR1 (31). GPR40-mediated FFA signaling is a powerful mediator of

inflammation in human tissues and in animal models (32). Regarding the potential impact of LA
pathway remodeling on fluidity and elasticity of biological membranes, we note that the FFA
composition of phospholipid bilayers is a key element in maintaining surface tension in lungs,
and alteration of LA pathway lipid composition is observed in acute respiratory distress
5

syndrome and severe pneumonia (33), both of which are key symptoms of SARS-CoV-2
infection.
The present study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 comprises a FFA-binding pocket that specifically
accretes LA, and suggests that this could be a feature shared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The high affinity, high specificity LA scavenger function conveyed by our results could confer a

10

tissue-independent mechanism by which pathogenic coronavirus infection drives immune
dysregulation and inflammation. Our findings provide a direct structural link between LA,
COVID-19 pathology and the virus itself and suggest that both the LA-binding pocket within the
S protein and the multi-nodal LA signaling axis, represent excellent therapeutic intervention
points against SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly in patient groups with increased risk due to

15

metabolic preconditions.
