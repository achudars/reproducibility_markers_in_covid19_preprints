Abstract
Outbreaks of emerging coronaviruses in the past two decades and the current pandemic

54

of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China highlight the importance of this

55

viral family as a zoonotic public health threat. To gain a better understanding of coronavirus

56

presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet

57

Nam 2013-2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus

58

sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples

59

among field rats (34.0%, 239/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in

60

guano farms (74.8%, 234/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the

61

odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats

62

sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in

63

large markets (32.0%, 116/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%,

64

84/151). Coronaviruses were detected in the majority of wildlife farms (60.7%, 17/28) and in the

65

Malayan porcupines (6.0%, 20/331) and bamboo rats (6.3%, 6/96) that are farmed. We identified

66

six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three Coronaviridae genera, including

67

the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of

68

animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and

69

avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces in the trade. The mixing of multiple

70

coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants,

71

suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic

72

spillover to people.

Introduction
Human-wildlife contact with a bat or an intermediate host species in China likely

79

triggered a coronavirus spillover event that may have involved wildlife markets and led to the

80

pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 [1,2]. The pandemic risk of commercial trade in live wildlife

81

was first recognized during the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)

82

outbreak due to SARS-CoV [3]. This virus spread to more than 29 countries in Asia, Europe, and

83

the Americas with 8,096 people infected and 774 deaths, costing the global economy about $US

84

40 billion in response and control measures [4,5]. Unfortunately, the global impact of COVID-

85

19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has reached nearly every country and greatly surpassed

86

those numbers by many orders of magnitude [6]. While bats are thought to be the ancestral hosts

87

for all groups of coronaviruses, including those that were previously thought to be in the rodent

88

and avian clades [7], for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 wildlife trade supply chains are

89

suspected to have contributed the additional conditions necessary for the emergence, spillover,

90

and amplification of these viruses in humans [8,9]. To better understand the presence and

91

diversity of coronaviruses in wildlife we conducted coronavirus surveillance at high-risk

92

interfaces in Viet Nam from 2009 to 2014 [10]. We sampled in live field rat trade (Rattus sp. and

93

Bandicota sp.) and wildlife farm interfaces to assess risk from different wildlife supply chains

94

destined for human consumption, and sampled bat guano farms to assess the potential

95

occupational risk of this practice given that bat guano farm artificial roost structures are often

96

erected near human dwellings.

97

In the early 2000s, the Vietnamese field rat trade was estimated to process 3,300-3,600

98

tons of live rats annually for consumption, a market valued at US$2 million [11]. Although rats

99

are still commonly traded in wet markets and sold live for food consumption along the Mekong

100

Delta in southern Viet Nam, no recent published data on the scale and scope of the trade is

101

available [12]. This human-wildlife interface involves the capture of wild caught field rats,

102

subsequent trade, and consumption along a supply chain involving the entire Mekong Delta

103

region, particularly Cambodia and Viet Nam [13]. Driving this trade are consumers in Viet Nam

104

and Cambodia, who report eating rats at least once per week because of their good flavor, low

105

cost, and perception of rats as ‘healthy, nutritious, natural, or disease free’ [13]. Rodent parts

106

(heads, tails, and internal organs discarded at slaughter) are also often fed to domestic livestock

107

or herptiles raised in captivity including frogs, snakes, and crocodiles [12]. Records of this local

108

trade in field rats include official rat hunts, instituted by French administrators, that killed

109

upwards of 10,000 rats a day prior to the arrival of bubonic plague in Ha Noi in 1903 [14].

110

Over the past three decades, commercial wildlife farming has developed in many

111

countries in Southeast Asia, including Viet Nam. Although there are historic references to the

112

occurrence of wildlife farms in Viet Nam dating back to the late 1800s, the rapid expansion in

113

terms of farm numbers, species diversity, and scale of operations has occurred in recent decades

114

in response to growing domestic and international demand for wildlife [15]. A 2014 survey

115

across 12 provinces in southern Viet Nam identified 6,006 registered wildlife farms of which

116

4,099 had active operations. The surveyed farms were stocked with approximately one million

117

wild animals including, rodents, primates, civets, wild boar, Oriental rat-snakes, deer, crocodiles,

118

and softshell turtles. Ninety-five percent of the farms held 1-2 species of wildlife, and 70% of the

119

farms also raised domestic animals on the same premises [16]. A key component of the wildlife

120

farm industry in Viet Nam is the raising of wild species for meat for human consumption [16].

121

These farms sell to urban wild meat restaurants serving increasingly affluent populations

122

throughout the country and also supply international markets with wild meat [17]. Commercial

123

wildlife farming in Viet Nam is part of the expanded international trade of wildlife that has been

124

hypothesized to contribute to the cause of global epidemics, such as SARS [18] and now

125

COVID-19.

126

Emerging evidence suggests zoonotic virus spillover risk is a concern at bat-human

127

interfaces in Asia. Guano harvested from a cave in Thailand were positive for a group C

128

betacoronavirus, which includes MERS-CoV, and 2.7% of 218 people living in close proximity

129

to bats known to carry viruses related to SARS-CoV tested positive for SARS-related antibodies

130

in China [19,20]. The traditional practice of guano farming in parts of Cambodia and Viet Nam

131

involves the construction of artificial bat roosts in gardens or backyard farms, under which

132

domestic animals and crops are raised, and children often play [21,22]. Cambodian development

133

programs promoted the practice in 2004 to enhance soil fertility, reduce reliance on chemical

134

fertilizers, generate income ($US 0.50/kg), control insect pests, and protect the lesser Asiatic

135

yellow bats (Scotophilus kuhlii) that were being hunted [21–23]. No personal protection

136

measures are taken when harvesting the guano, which is used as fertilizer and is reported to

137

improve the growth rate in five economically important plant species [24].

138

In this study we investigated the presence and diversity of coronavirus sequences in the

139

field rat trade distribution chain, wildlife farms specializing in rodents for human consumption,

coronaviruses and the risk for these interfaces to facilitate spillover into humans.

Materials and Methods

144

Sampling Locations

145

Sampling was performed at multiple sites representing several high-risk interfaces for

146

contacts among people, rodents, and bats. Rodent sampling focused on the live rodent trade

147

supply chain and rodent farms. Along the supply chain, we targeted eight sites involved in the

148

private sale and processing of live rodents for consumption, defined as ‘traders’ for the purpose

149

of this study in Dong Thap and Soc Trang provinces, 14 large markets sites in Dong Thap and

150

Soc Trang provinces (>20 vendors), and two restaurant sites in Soc Trang province (Fig 1). The

151

28 rodent farm sites we targeted in Dong Nai province produced Malayan porcupines (Hystrix

152

brachyura) and bamboo rats (Rhizomys sp.) for human consumption (Fig 2). Other species

153

observed or raised at the wildlife farm sites included dogs, cattle, pigs, chickens, ducks, pigeons,

154

geese, common pheasant, monitor lizards, wild boar, fish, python, crocodiles, deer, civets, non-

155

human primates as pets or part of private collections, free-flying wild birds, and free-ranging

156

peri-domestic rodents.

Bat sampling occurred at bat guano “farms” and a natural bat roost located at a religious

165

site. Bat guano farms consisted of artificial roosts constructed with a concrete base and pillars

166

topped with fronds of coconut palm or Asian Palmyra Palm (Borassus flabellifer) (Fig 3).

167

Seventeen bat guano farms were sampled in the two provinces of Dong Thap and Soc Trang. The

168

natural bat roost was located at a religious site in Soc Trang province known as the “bat pagoda”,

169

where Pteropus sp. have historically roosted in trees protected from hunting, and light and noise

170

pollution [25].

173
174

All study sampling occurred from January 2013 to March 2014 at 41 sites in the wet

175

(south Viet Nam: May 1st - November 30th) and 30 in the dry (south Viet Nam: December 1st -

176

April 30th) seasons. Given the distances between sites, all sites were sampled once except the bat

177

pagoda natural roost in Soc Trang province, which was visited three times and sampled in both

178

seasons.

179

Animal sampling

180

Samples were humanely collected using standard and previously published protocols

181

[26]. Feces, swabs of the pen floors, and urine/urogenital swabs were collected from rodents at

182

wildlife farms. Samples were classified as ‘fecal sample’ when collected from animals housed

183

individually, and as ‘environmental sample’ when collected below cages housing multiple

184

individuals. Samples from rodents in the trade included primarily oral swabs in addition to

185

tissues (i.e. brain, kidney, lung, and small intestine), rectal swabs, and urine/urogenital swabs.

186

These samples were collected from individual carcasses after the rodents were slaughtered by a

187

market vendor, trader, or restaurant kitchen staff. However, the rodents were usually butchered at

188

a common site for each observed time period that was only cleaned intermittently following the

189

trader’s, vendor’s, or restaurant’s regular practices. Oral swabs were taken from the severed

190

heads, and additional tissue samples were collected from the internal organs and the

191

gastrointestinal tracts which were removed during the butchering process.

192

Fecal samples and a small number of urine samples from bats in guano farms and the

193

natural roost site were collected on clean plastic cover sheets within 1-2 hours after placement

194

under bat roosts, and thus each sample may represent one or multiple bats. Oral and rectal swabs

195

were also collected from live-captured bats at the natural pagoda roost site.

196

Animals were identified in the field to the lowest taxonomic level possible based on

197

morphological characteristics, and species was identified in a subset of animals through genetic

198

barcoding [15]. Due to difficulty of morphologic identification in the field, unless barcoded,

199

rodents (Rattus argentiventer, R. tanezumi, R. norvegicus, R. exulans, R. losea, and Bandicota

200

indica; [12,27]) were categorized as “field rats”. Bats were classified as “Microchiroptera”

201

following the traditional taxonomic classification (new classification of two new suborders

202

Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera, was only published near the end of the study, so for

203

consistency we used the historical classification [28]).

204

All samples were collected in cryotubes containing RNAlater (RNA stabilization reagent,

205

Qiagen), and stored in liquid nitrogen in the field before being transported to the laboratory for

206

storage at -80 ˚C. Samples were tested by the Regional Animal Health Office No. 6 (RAHO6)

207

laboratory in Ho Chi Minh City. The study was approved by the Department of Animal Health of

208

the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and protocols were reviewed by the

209

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California at Davis (protocol

210

number 16048).

211

Sample Testing

212

RNA was extracted (RNA MiniPrep Kit, Sigma-Aldrich) and cDNA transcribed

213

(SuperScript III First Strand cDNA Synthesis System, Invitrogen). Coronavirus RNA was

214

detected using two broadly reactive consensus nested-PCR assays targeting the RNA dependent

215

RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene [29,30]. The positive control was a synthetic plasmid containing

216

the primer-binding sites for both assays. Distilled water was used as a negative control and

217

included in each test batch. PCR products were visualized using 1.5% agarose gels, and bands of

218

the correct size were excised, cloned, and sequenced by Sanger dideoxy sequencing using the

219

same primers as for amplification.

220

Phylogenetic analysis

221

For sequence analysis and classification operating taxonomic units were defined with a

222

cut off of 90% identity, i.e. virus sequences that shared less than 90% identity to a known

223

sequence were labelled sequentially as PREDICT_CoV-1, -2, -3, etc. and groups sharing ≥ 90%

224

identity to a sequence already in GenBank were given the same name as the matching sequence

225

[7]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed for sequences amplified using the Watanabe protocol,

226

as this PCR protocol yielded longer sequences and more positive results than the Quan protocol.

227

Several representative sequences for each viral species found in our study were included for

228

analysis and are available in GenBank (Table S3). Alignments were performed using MUSCLE,

229

and trees were constructed using Maximum likelihood and the Tamura 3-parameter model in

230

MEGA7 [31]. The best-fit model of DNA substitution was selected in MEGA7 using BIC scores

231

(Bayesian Information Criterion) and Maximum Likelihood values (lnL). Bootstrap values were

232

calculated after 1000 replicates. In addition, a median-joining network was constructed using

233

Network 5.0.0.3 [32] to explore phylogenetic relationships among bat coronavirus 512/2005

234

sequences at the intraspecies level, as haplotype networks may better represent the relationships

235

among viral sequences with low sequence diversity compared with phylogenetic trees [33].

236

Statistical analyses

237

Visualization of sampling locations in provinces in Viet Nam, along with the distribution

238

by species and interface was constructed with the ggmap, ggplot2, and sp packages [34]. All

239

analyses were done using R version 3.5.0 or higher (R Development Core Team, Vienna,

240

Austria). Data (S1 Data) and code (S1 R Code) are available in the supplementary materials. The

241

effect of risk factors (season, sub-interface type) was examined and limited to interfaces for

242

which the distribution of samples across factors could support the analysis. These included

243

season for Pteropus bat samples collected in the bat pagoda natural roost and the effect of season

244

and sub-interface for samples collected in the rodent trade in southern Viet Nam. Given the low

245

sample size, the effect of season for Pteropus bats samples positive for coronaviruses was

246

assessed using a Fisher exact test. The effect of season (dry, wet, with dry season as reference

247

category) and sub-interface type (trader, large markets, restaurants, with trader as reference

248

category) in traded rodent samples positive for coronaviruses was assessed with a mixed effect

249

multivariable logistic regression, with sites as random effect (i.e. grouping variable) using the

250

lme4 R package [35]. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The

251

95% binomial confidence intervals for proportions were calculated using binom.test in R.

252
253

The comparison of the proportion of coronavirus positives in different sample types was
performed on positive individuals sampled in the rodent trade with multiple sample types

collected per individual. We then calculated the proportion of individuals positive for each

255

sample type, as a proxy for the probability of detection by each sample type.

Detection of coronavirus by animal taxa and interface

259

A total of 2,164 samples collected between January 2013 and March 2014 from rodents

260

and bats were tested for coronaviruses (Table 1, S1 Table). Assuming that non-invasive samples

261

from bats and farmed rodents represented unique distinct individuals, these samples came from

262

1,506 individuals, including 1,131 rodents and 375 bats from 70 sites sampled in Dong Thap,

263

Soc Trang, and Dong Nai provinces in the southern region near the Mekong River Delta (Fig 4).

and Rattus argentiventer were only sampled one time apiece from wildlife farms.

269
270

Out of 70 sites, coronavirus positives were detected at 58 including 100% (24/24) of live

271

rodent trade sites, 60.7% (17/28) of rodent wildlife farm sites, 94.1% (16/17) of bat guano farm

272

sites, and at the one natural pteropid bat roost. Wildlife farms were only sampled in Dong Nai

273

province and the live rodent trade and bat interfaces were sampled in Dong Thap and Soc Trang

274

provinces (Fig 4).

Coronaviruses were detected in the field rat trade (a mix of Rattus and Bandicota genera)

286

at all sites in Dong Thap (n=16) and Soc Trang (n=8) provinces, with 34.6% (95% CI 29.8 –

287

39.7%, 129/373) and 33.4% (95% CI 28.4 – 38.9%, 110/329) positives respectively. The overall

288

proportion of positives in field rats was 34.0% (95% CI 30.6 – 37.7%, 239/702), ranging from

289

3.2% to 74.4% across sites. Field rats sampled in the rodent trade had an increasing proportion of

290

positives along the distribution chain. Starting with traders, the proportion positive was 20.7%

291

(95% CI 15.3 – 27.4%, 39/188), 32.0% (95% CI 27.2 – 37.1%, 116/363) in large markets, and

292

55.6% (95% CI 47.3 – 63.6%, 84/151) at restaurants (Fig 5). The proportion of positives was

293

higher in the wet season (36.7%, 95% CI 32.8 – 40.8%, 210/572) than the dry season (22.3%,

294

95% CI 15.7 – 30.6%, 29/130). In a multivariate model with site as random effect, both season

295

and interface type were significantly associated with the risk of rodent infection, with higher risk

296

of infection in the wet season (OR=4.9, 95% CI 1.4 – 18.0), and increasing risk along the supply

297

chain from traders (baseline) to large markets (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.05 – 4.7), to restaurants

298

(OR=10.0, 95% CI 2.7 – 39.5) (S2 Table). It should be noted, however, that since sites were only

299

visited during one season, both independent variables were defined at the site level and

300

confounding effects with other site-level characteristics cannot be excluded.

At the rodent farm interface, 6.0% (95% CI 3.8 – 9.3%, 20/331) of Hystrix brachyura and

311

6.3% (95% CI 2.6 – 13.6%, 6/96) of Rhizomys sp. were positive. The overall proportion of

312

positives was 6.3% (95% CI 4.3 – 9.1%, 27/429) (Table 1 and Fig 4). There was no difference

313

among species or season and proportion positive in rodent farms, and low sample size and

314

unequal sampling limited analysis.

315

The proportion of coronavirus positives at the two bat interfaces differed by an order of

316

magnitude as 74.8% (95% CI 69.5 – 79.4%) of the non-invasive samples collected from

317

Microchiroptera bats at bat guano farms were positive, and 6.7% (95% CI 2.2 – 17.0%) of the

318

Pteropus genus samples at the natural roost in Soc Trang province (Fig 4) were positive (Table

319

1). Pteropid bats sampled at the natural roost had higher proportions of positives in the wet

320

season (27.3%, 95% CI 7.3 – 60.7%, 3/11) compared with the dry season (2.0%, 95% CI 0.1 –

321

12.2%, 1/50; Fisher exact test p=0.02, OR=16.6 [1.2 – 956.8]), although low sample size and

331

that among the six coronaviruses detected, PREDICT_CoV-35 and bat CoV 512/2005 clustered

332

within the Alphacoronaviruses, while PREDICT_CoV-17, Longquan aa CoV and murine CoV

333

clustered within the Betacoronaviruses. The virus identified within the Gammacoronavirus

334

genus was avian IBV.

335

PREDICT_CoV-17 and PREDICT_CoV-35 were first reported by Anthony et al. [17].

336

We found PREDICT_CoV-17 in Pteropus bats and in Microchiroptera (Table 1). The

337

PREDICT_CoV-17 sequences from Pteropus detected in this study clustered closely with

338

PREDICT_CoV-17 sequences from Pteropus giganteus bats in Nepal and Pteropus lylei bats in

339

Thailand [36] (Fig 6, S3 Table). PREDICT_CoV-35 was found in Microchiroptera in bat guano

340

farms and in a pteropid bat (Table 1). PREDICT_CoV-35 sequences from Viet Nam clustered

341

with other PREDICT_CoV-35 sequences found previously in samples from hunted Scotophilus

342

kuhlii bats in Cambodia (S3 Table; Dr. Lucy Keatts personal communication), and with

343

sequences found in bats from an earlier study in the Mekong Delta region in Viet Nam (Fig 6).

344

Bat coronavirus 512/2005 was detected in Microchiroptera bat guano; and in H.

345

brachyura (feces and environmental samples), R. pruinosus (feces barcoded), and R.

346

argentiventer (barcoded environmental sample) in wildlife farms (Table 1 and S1 Table). In

347

Microchiroptera, Bat coronavirus 512/2005 was frequently found in co-infection with

348

PREDICT_CoV-35 (Table 1, S1 Table). Network analysis showed the relationships among the

349

bat coronavirus 512/2005 sequences from the three provinces in south Viet Nam (Fig 7). We

350

observed two main clusters and a shallow geographic structure of genetic diversity, perhaps

351

illustrative of sampling effort but also of localized transmission and circulation of bat

352

coronavirus 512/2005 strains in these provinces. One cluster was exclusively detected in

353

Microchiroptera and mostly restricted to Dong Thap province and another cluster included

354

sequences shared among all hosts and distributed in the three provinces (Fig 7). Parts of the

355

network showed a star-like topology (Fig 7), typical of populations in expansion that have

356

recently increased size. There were three sequence types that were shared among

357

Microchiroptera and rodents.

358

Murine coronavirus and Longquan aa coronavirus were detected in 209 and 56 field rat

359

samples, respectively, and 26 were coinfected with both (Table 1). Two sequences of IBV were

360

detected in rodent feces collected on two wildlife farms, one in a bamboo rat and another in a

361

Malayan porcupine. The rodent interfaces where bat and avian coronaviruses were detected in

362

feces were not full containment facilities and possibly had bats and birds flying and roosting

363

overhead (Fig 2). The IBV positives were detected in fecal samples from wildlife farms that had

364

chickens, pigs, and dogs on site.

Discussion

383

High prevalence and amplification along the supply chain for

384

human consumption

385

Significant findings of this study are the high proportion of coronavirus positive animals

386

and the increasing proportion of positives found along the rodent trade supply chain from the

387

capture site to restaurants. The transit of multiple animal species through the supply chain offers

388

opportunities for inter- and intra-species mixing. Overcrowding and close confinement of live

389

animals in cages results in increased animal contact, likely leading to stress. While

390

methodologically similar to rodent surveys in Zhejiang province, China (2%), Dong Thap

391

province, Viet Nam (4.4%), and globally (0.32%), our overall proportion of coronavirus

392

positives was much higher among field rats (34.5%) and somewhat higher among farmed rodents

393

(6.3%) [7,27,37]. Stress and poor nutrition likely contributes to shedding by reducing animal

394

condition and altering immune functions [38]. Together, these factors may result in increased

395

shedding and amplification of coronaviruses along the supply chain for human consumption.

396

The amplification of coronavirus along the supply chain may be associated with season

397

as field rats were significantly more positive in the wet season. Rattus argentiventer generally

398

reproduce year-round in Viet Nam, but are particularly abundant in the wet season (May through

399

October) following the rice harvest when an abundance of food supports the population increase

400

[39]. If these seasonal population increases affect density dependent contact, there could be

401

increased coronavirus prevalence and shedding in wild field rats during certain times of the year,

402

which could then be further amplified along the trade.

403

Our survey was not a comprehensive multi-year evaluation of the field rat supply chain

404

and it was restricted to two provinces with this interface. These limitations mean we are not able

405

to make inferences about larger spatial patterns or the inter-annual variability of coronavirus

406

prevalence in wildlife populations found in this interface, which spans into neighboring

407

Cambodia.

408

However, from a mechanistic perspective as animals progress along the wildlife supply

409

chain, opportunity for human contact increases, including close direct contact with traders,

410

butchers, cooks, and consumers [40]. The combination of increased coronavirus prevalence in

411

traded wildlife and greater opportunity for human-wildlife contact as well as intra- and inter-

412

species contact in trade systems is likely to increase the risk of zoonotic transmission of

413

coronaviruses in wildlife markets, restaurants, and other trade interfaces.

414

Viral sharing or environmental mixing

415

We detected avian and bat coronaviruses in wildlife farm rodents, including Malayan

416

porcupines and bamboo rats, but we did not detect rodent-associated coronaviruses. The only

417

previously published coronavirus testing of Malayan porcupine samples carried out in China

418

were negative [41]. It is unclear if the Malayan porcupine samples from animals screened in this

419

study were infected with the avian or bat viruses or if environmental contamination or mixing

420

occurred with avian and bat guano. Chickens were present at the two sites where the IBV-

421

positive rodents were detected, and bats fly and potentially roost overhead at most farms.

422

‘Artificial market’ studies of influenza A viruses have found cage-stacking of species on top of

423

other species and shared water sources facilitate viral transmission [42,43]. Nevertheless, viral

424

sharing between species and environmental contamination or mixing (i.e. bat/bird guano landing

Page 20 of 29

425

on rat feces) are two equally likely explanations for the presence of bat and avian coronaviruses

426

detected in rodent fecal and environmental samples.

427

The field rats were co-infected with the Longquan aa coronavirus and the murine

428

coronaviruses, both of which are from the Lineage A (Embecovirus) Betacoronavirus genus. Co-

429

infections with multiple coronaviruses deserve particular attention as this co-occurrence may

430

facilitate viral recombination leading to the emergence of new viruses [44,45].

431

At the very least, we conclude that rodents in the field and farmed rodent supply chains

432

are being exposed to coronaviruses from rodents, bats, and birds and perhaps creating

433

opportunities for coronavirus recombination events, which may lead to viruses that could spill

434

over into humans [46]. Repeated and more direct individual sampling of these species at these

435

interfaces would be useful to determine if viral sharing was occurring versus environmental

436

contamination of samples.

437

Bat guano farms

438

The high proportion of positive bat feces at bat guano farms indicates the potential risk of

439

bat guano farmers, their families, and their animals being exposed to bat coronaviruses. The

440

overall proportion of positives (74.8%) was higher than previous studies using similar testing

441

methods targeting bats in Viet Nam (22%), Thailand (7.6%), Lao PDR (6.5%), and Cambodia

442

(4.85%) [27,47,48]. In this region of Viet Nam, artificial roosts are typically erected in backyard

443

family owned plots that incorporate a mosaic of duck, goat, or pig production and crops such as

444

guava tress or other fruit trees and large scale kitchen gardens.

445

Bats have been shown to be an important evolutionary hosts of coronaviruses, including

446

those infecting humans [7,49–52]. Both PREDICT_CoV-17 and PREDICT_CoV-35 have been

447

detected previously in the Pteropus and Microchiroptera bats in Viet Nam, Cambodia, and
Page 21 of 29

448

Nepal, which confirms that coronaviruses are capable of infecting distantly related hosts [7]. The

449

finding of the same virus in different bat species raises the question of whether they co-roost

450

and/or share viruses through contact during other activities. Utilizing shared resources such as

451

water or feeding on and around crops and fruit could lead to contact and facilitate a host jump.

452

The presence of the same virus in bat species in multiple neighboring countries supports the

453

suggestion by others that virus distribution coincides with their bat host distribution [7,53,54].

454

While there has been no testing of the pathogenicity of these bat coronaviruses in humans or

455

animals, they are found at close contact bat-human interfaces and further characterization is

456

needed to understand their host range and potential for spillover. Any general persecution of bats

457

because of zoonotic viruses they may carry can actually increase the number of susceptible bats

458

and increase transmission risk to people [56], and would interfere with the important ecosystem

459

services that bats provide, such as controlling insect pests of rice fields [55], plant pollination,

460

and seed dispersal.

461
462
463

Capacity building and outreach
Beyond the viral findings, this work represented an important opportunity for capacity

464

development in field, laboratory, and scientific disciplines, as well as opportunities for social

465

engagement and education of high-risk communities on zoonotic disease threats. The consensus

466

PCR approach for viral detection provides a cost-effective tool to detect emerging viruses in low-

467

resource settings. Our work adds to the growing body of research demonstrating the utility of this

468

approach to detect both known and novel viruses and co-infections in a variety of taxa, sample

469

types, and interfaces. In Viet Nam, the direct result is an enhanced One Health surveillance

470

capacity to detect important emerging or unknown viruses in humans, wildlife, and livestock. In

471

the communities with which we partnered, strong engagement enabled teams to sample a wide

472

diversity of wild animals at high-risk interfaces. Importantly, we have returned to these same

473

communities to share the viral findings and to educate participants with an outreach program on

474

how to live safely with bats [57].

475
476
477

Conclusions
Large percentages of coronaviruses were detected at high risk interfaces in bats and

478

rodents, which is of concern when assessing the potential for human exposure and spillover. The

479

observed viral amplification along the wildlife trade supply chain for human consumption likely

480

resulted from the mixing and close confinement of stressed live animals, such as field rats, and

481

sheds light on the potential for coronavirus shedding in other wildlife supply chains (e.g., civets,

482

pangolins) where similarly large numbers of animals are collected, transported, and confined.

483

Livestock and people living in close contact with rodents, bats, and birds shedding coronaviruses

484

provides opportunities for intra- and inter-species transmission and potential recombination of

485

coronaviruses.

486

Human behavior is facilitating the spillover of viruses, such as coronavirus, from animals

487

to people. The wildlife trade supply chain from the field to the restaurant provides multiple

488

opportunities for such spillover events to occur [1]. To minimize the public health risks of viral

489

disease emergence from wildlife and to safeguard livestock-based production systems, we

490

recommend precautionary measures that restrict the killing, commercial breeding, transport,

491

buying, selling, storage, processing and consuming of wild animals. The emergence of SARS-

492

CoV, MERS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2 highlight the importance of the coronavirus viral

family to affect global public health. The world must increase vigilance through building and

494

improving detection capacity; actively conducting surveillance to detect and characterize

495

coronaviruses in humans, wildlife, and livestock; and to inform human behaviors in order to

496

reduce zoonotic viral transmission to humans.
