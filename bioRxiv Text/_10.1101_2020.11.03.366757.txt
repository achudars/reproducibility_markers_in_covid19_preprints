ABSTRACT
The periodic emergence of novel coronaviruses (CoVs) represents an ongoing public health
concern with significant health and financial burden worldwide. The most recent occurrence
originated in the city of Wuhan, China where a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged causing
severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. The continual emergence of novel coronaviruses
underscores the importance of developing effective vaccines as well as novel therapeutic options
that target either viral functions or host factors recruited to support coronavirus replication. The
CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) has been shown to promote cellular mRNA degradation, block
host cell translation, and inhibit the innate immune response to virus infection. Interestingly,
deletion of the nsp1-coding region in infectious clones prevented the virus from productively
infecting cultured cells. Because of nsp1’s importance in the CoV lifecycle, it has been highlighted
as a viable target for both antiviral therapy and vaccine development. However, the fundamental
molecular and structural mechanisms that underlie nsp1 function remain poorly understood,
despite its critical role in the viral lifecycle. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of
the amino, globular portion of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 (residues 10 – 127) at 1.77Å resolution. A
comparison of our structure with the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 structure reveals how mutations alter the
conformation of flexible loops, inducing the formation of novel secondary structural elements and
new surface features. Paired with the recently published structure of the carboxyl end of nsp1
(residues 148 – 180), our results provide the groundwork for future studies focusing on SARSCoV-2 nsp1 structure and function during the viral lifecycle.
IMPORTANCE
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for
the COVID-19 pandemic. One protein known to play a critical role in the coronavirus lifecycle is

nonstructural protein1 (nsp1). As such, it has been highlighted in numerous studies as a target for
both the development of antivirals and for the design of live-attenuated vaccines. Here we report
the high-resolution crystal structure of nsp1 derived from SARS-CoV-2 at 1.77Å resolution. This
structure will facilitate future studies focusing on understanding the relationship between structure
and function for nsp1. In turn, understanding these structure-function relationships will allow nsp1
to be fully exploited as a target for both antiviral development and vaccine design.

INTRODUCTION
The periodic emergence of novel coronaviruses (CoVs) represents an ongoing public health
concern with significant health and financial burden worldwide. In the past two decades, three
highly pathogenic human CoVs have emerged from zoonotic events. In 2002, an outbreak of
atypical pneumonia termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) appeared in the
Guangdong Province of Southern China. The etiological agent for this disease was found to be a
novel coronavirus named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1-3). In 2012, a novel coronavirus
named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was isolated from a patient
who died in Saudi Arabia after presenting with acute respiratory distress and kidney injury.(4) The
most recent occurrence originated in the city of Wuhan, China where a novel coronavirus, Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged causing severe respiratory
illness and pneumonia (5, 6). The resulting disease was named Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) and a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in March of 2020.

CoVs are members of the Coronaviridae family of viruses that contain large positivesensed, single-stranded RNA genomes of approximately 30 kb in length. Approximately twothirds of the genome, located in the 5’-genomic region, contains open-reading frame 1a (ORF1a)
and open-reading frame 1b (ORF1b). To express both polyproteins, coronaviruses encode a
slippery sequence and an RNA pseudoknot that cause a -1 ribosomal frameshift (7, 8). ORF1a and
ORF1ab encode nsps 1 – 11 and 1 – 16, respectively, and are translated into large polyproteins
which are subsequently cleaved into individual nonstructural proteins (nsps) by virally encoded
proteases (9). Genes that encode the structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and
nucleocapsid) are located in the remaining third of the genome with a variable number of straindependent ORF accessory proteins present between the structural genes (10).
Nsp1 is the N-terminal cleavage product released from the replicase polyprotein by the
virally encoded papain-like proteinase (nsp3d; PLpro) (11). It has been shown to promote cellular
mRNA degradation, block host cell translation, and inhibit the innate immune response to virus
infection (12-20). Deletion of the nsp1-coding region in infectious clones prevented the virus from
productively infecting cultured cells (21). Also, mutations preventing the release of nsp1 from the
nascent ORF1a polyprotein substantially limited virus viability (22). While there have been
multiple studies on describing nsp1 function, there have been limited structure function studies
focusing on nsp1. These types of studies are needed to fully exploit nsp1 as a target for both the
development of antivirals and rational vaccine. The availability of high-resolution structures is a
critical first step in establishing structure-function relationships of proteins and is the focus of this
manuscript.
Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the globular portion of SARS-CoV2 nsp1 to a resolution of 1.77 Å. A comparison of our structure with the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1

structure reveals how mutations alter the conformation of flexible loops. These changes in
conformation induce the folding of novel secondary structural elements that, in turn, generate
surfaces that are distinct from SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 in both contour and feature. Comparison with
-CoV nsp1 structures shows that the nsp1globular domain has a shared structural homology,
while having low sequence similarity. Our results provide the groundwork for future studies
focusing on the structure-function mechanisms by which SARS-CoV- 2 nsp1 functions during the
viral lifecycle.
RESULTS
Expression of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1. To obtain the high-resolution structure of nsp1 from
SARS-CoV-2, we based our expression construct on the previously solved structure of nsp1 from
SARS-CoV-1 (23). In this study, it was determined that nsp1 of SARS-CoV-1 includes a globular
domain of residues 13 to 121 that is in between disordered regions consisting of resides 1 to 12
and 122 to 179. We generated an initial expression construct with N-terminal truncations
beginning at amino acid residue 13 and continuing to residue 127. Using nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, heteronuclear single quantum coherence triple resonance spectra analysis
indicated that the amino terminus of our construct beginning at amino acid residue 13 prematurely
eliminated a -strand (data to be reported elsewhere). We generated a second expression construct
with N-terminal truncations beginning at amino acid residue 10 continuing to residue 127. Both
nsp1 constructs were expressed and purified to homogeneity.
Crystal Structure of nsp110-127 from SARS-CoV-2. Crystallization trials were initiated
with nsp110-127 and nsp113-127. Crystals were obtained with each construct though the number of
crystallization conditions were greater and crystal quality better with the longer construct, nsp110127.

For this reason, structural studies were carried out with this construct. The structure of the

globular domain of nsp1 was determined by molecular replacement with the core of SARS-CoV1 nsp1 (PDB ID: 2HSX). Final data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The
final model contained residues 10-126 (Fig. 1). The tertiary fold of nsp1 is composed of regular
secondary structural elements arranged sequentially as 1234567
with and being 310 helices. A seven-stranded barrel is formed with a mixture of parallel
and antiparallel strands with contacts between 2, , 4, 5, and 6 strands as well as 1 and
7 strands. The strands consist of residues13-20 (1), 51-54 (2), 68-73 (3), 84-92 (4), 9597 (5), 103-109 (6), and 117-123 (7). The  (residues 23-25) and  (residues 61-63)helices
are positioned across one barrel opening while 1 (residues 34-49) is positioned alongside the
barrel making contact with the 4 strand.
Comparison with solution structure of nsp113-127 from SARS-CoV-1. The nsp1 portion
of ORF1ab is well conserved when comparing SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (84% identity,
(Fig. 2A). This relatively high conservation is also applicable to the subset of amino acids (10126) that comprise our structure (86%). This level of conservation between CoVs is remarkable
given the limited amino acid sequence homology among nsp1s from different -CoVs.(19) A
number of mutations (9 of 16) occur in the large loops in the structure (Fig. 2B). It is widely
understood that loops often play critical roles in protein-protein interactions, making these
mutations particularly interesting (24, 25).
We note that the structure is composed of approximately the same portions of nsp1
(residues 10-127) as the previously solved nsp1 structure from SARS-CoV-1 (residues 13-127).
The fold of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 is generally well conserved when compared to the previously
solved structure of nsp1 from SARS-CoV-1. (Fig. 2C). However, there are several notable
differences between the structures upon detailed analysis. One such difference is the presence of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.366757; this version posted November 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

an additional 310 helix ( in the SARS-CoV-2 structure (residues 23-25). We note that the
primary sequence composing this additional 310 helix is identical between SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, there are no apparent proximal mutations in SARS-CoV-2 that would
stabilize this 310 helix. The stabilization of this helix is due to a polar interaction between R24 in
1 and Q63 in 3 (Fig. 3A) present in only SARS-CoV-2 nsp1.
In addition to the formation of a new 310 helix in nsp1 from SARS-CoV2, there are also
mutations that result in extension of -strands within the interior of the protein when comparing
the two proteins. The  strand is extended by four amino acids and is now composed by amino
acids 84-92 in SARS-CoV-2 as opposed to amino acids 87-91 in SARS-CoV-1. This is due to the
K84V, V85M, and M92L mutations in positions adjacent to the  strand (Fig. 3B). This extension
facilitates the formation of a new -strand (5) not found in the original SARS-CoV-1 structure.
This strand is composed of amino acids 95-97 and is stabilized by main chain contacts with
residues 90-92 (Fig. 3C). The  strand is also extended by two amino acids so it is now composed
of amino acids 103-109 rather than amino acids 105-109. This extension is due to additional main
chain interactions. Finally, 1, , and 6 (5 in SARS-CoV-1) strands are also extended by a
single amino acid.
One striking difference between the structures is the alternative conformations of two
major loops located between  and 4 (loop 1) and between 4 and 6 (loop 2, 4 and 5 in
SARS-CoV-1) (Fig. 4). The residues that make up these loops in SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 form a much
more significant network of polar contacts with respect to those in the analogous loops in SARSCoV-1 nsp1. These changes in local stability and conformation facilitate the formation of a new
-strand (5) not found in SARS-CoV-1 nsp1. Analysis of loop 1 (residues 73-84) and loop 2
(residues 92-104) indicate an average C displacement of 16.6 Å and 27.6 Å, respectively. As

loops play critical roles in protein-protein interactions, relative variations in these loops between
the SARS-COV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are particularly interesting as they may alter host-pathogen
interactions involving nsp1 (24, 25).
Structural differences between the two proteins results in differences in the electrostatic
surface potential. These differences are the result of conformational differences and mutations
presented on the surface of the proteins. Fig 5 contrasts four of these regions. Both SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 share a large common patch of electronegative potential (Fig. 5A and 5E),
however in SARS-CoV-2 nsp1, the electronegative surface potential has an increased intensity and
clustering has increased. This patch in SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 is generated by D33, E36, E37, E41,
Q44, H45, D48, E65, Q66, and E93. These residues comprise three mutations from SARS-CoV-1
nsp1 and include E44Q, N48D, and D93E. In addition, a valley between the upper and lower
portion of the patch in SARS-CoV-1 residues, between residues D33 and E65, is closed in SARSCoV-2 by the reorientation of the main chain flanking Q66. This reorientation allows the sidechain
of Q66 to form a new hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of E93. A dominant electropositive
pocket and extended surface is also observed in both structures (Fig. 5B and 5F). In SARS-CoV2 nsp1, this region is composed of K11, R43, K47, R77, R124 and K125. The contiguous pit of
electronegativity observed in SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 is disrupted in the SARS-CoV-1 structure by
rearrangement of the C-terminus allowing G127 to protrude between R43 and K125. Two smaller
juxtaposed electropositive and electronegative patches are shown in Fig. 5C and 5G. There are
three mutations relative to SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 in this area: K84V, I102E, and N120K. In the
SARS-CoV-2 structure, two mutations contribute to the negative surface character of this region.
The mutated side chain of V84 occupies the space of K84 in SARS-CoV-1, while K120 buttresses
the bottom of the patch. In the adjacent electropositive patch, E102 sits in the positive pocket

surrounded by E55, E57, and E102. The conformation of the loop between 3 and 4, as well as
the restructured strand (5) and loop between 4 and 6 (4 and 5 in SARS-CoV-1), contribute
to vastly different surface contours (Fig. 5C and 5G). Finally, a new electronegative crevasse is
generated by the restructuring of strand 5 and the trailing loop leading to strand 6 and subsequent
reposition of the concluding residues of 7 thru the C-terminus (residues 122 to 126) in SARSCoV-2 (Fig. 5D and 5H). Two prominent residues in this new crevasse are D75 and E87. These
residues are identical in SARS-CoV-1, however the surrounding residues are positioned so that
they are more obscured from the surface. E87 (SARS-CoV-1) is sandwiched between K72 and
R124, appearing to salt bridge with K72.
Structural homology between SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and -CoV nsp1s. The structures of
SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 and SARS-CoV -2 nsp1 represent the known nsp1 structures of-CoVs. To
date, the structures of five additional nsp1 structures originating from viruses in the -coronavirus
genera have been published. The sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and these-CoV
is extremely low at 9-13%, with only marginally more sequence similarity at 21-27%. There is,
however, easily identifiable structural homology between nsp1s derived from - and -CoVs. The
structure of SARS-CoV-2 was structurally aligned with the structures of nsp1s from porcine
transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus strain Purdue (3ZBD)(26), porcine epidemic diarrhea
virus (5XBC)(27), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (6IVC)(28), swine acute diarrhea syndrome
coronavirus (6LPA)(29), and feline infectious peritonitis virus (6LP9)(29). Aligned structures are
illustrated in Fig. 6 with statistical analysis compiled in Table 2. All of the structures share a core
topological similarity. However, there are substitutions and insertions in the linear arrangement of
the secondary structure elements (Fig. 6C). The first 310 helix of SARS-CoV-2 structure is
swapped for strand 2 in the -CoV structures, though essentially occupying the same space.

Strand 4 represents an insertion in the -CoV structures. The strand forms a short parallel strand configuration with 2. As noted above, SARS-CoV-2 has new strand 5, not observed in
SARS-CoV-1. This strand is also a deviation from the topology of the -CoV nsp1 structures. The
rest of the secondary structural elements follow a common fold and alignment being
123467 for SARS-CoV-2 and 135678 for -CoVs
(Fig. 6H).
DISCUSSION
Here we report the high-resolution structure of nsp1 derived from SARS-CoV-2, the
etiological agent of COVID-19. The interior of the protein is composed of a seven stranded
barrel with an -helix positioned on the side of the barrel and two 310 helices across one end
of the barrel. Nsp1 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 in both structure and sequence.
However, there are a number of differences between the two proteins that may alter their function
in the context of their respective viral life cycles. One difference is the presence of secondary
structural elements, an additional -strand (5) and 310 helix, in SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 that are not in
SARS-CoV-1 nsp1. Several of the major loops in SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 are also in alternative
conformations due to the increased polar contacts between amino acids that compose them and the
globular domain. Finally, there are differences in the electrostatic surface potential resulting from
amino acid differences between the two proteins. Given the critical role that nsp1 plays in the CoV
lifecycle, these differences may underlie fundamental differences between the SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-2 such as virulence, pathogenicity, and infectivity.
Nsp1 is a virulence determinant of CoVs that plays critical roles during the viral lifecycle
such as suppressing host gene expression (14, 30, 31). This suppression of host gene expression is
necessary for viral replication and allows evasion of the cellular immune response. In a recent

study, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) was used to show that the carboxyl terminus (residues
148-180) of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 binds to 40S ribosomal subunit and inhibits translation (32, 33).
Specifically, the structures revealed that this fragment of nsp1 binds to the mRNA entry channel
of the 40S subunit which effectively blocks translation (32, 33). We modeled the structure of fulllength nsp1 using the iTasser platform with our structure as a template (34-36). As shown in Fig.
7, residues 1 – 9 and 131 – 162 contain no discernable secondary structure with the remaining
residues adopting two -helices. This is compatible with the cryo-EM structure that indicates that
the carboxyl terminus (residues 148 – 180) binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit (32, 33).
Additionally, there is a high degree of structural and sequence homology between nsp1
derived from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The rare conservation amongst different -CoVs
may provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 function from previous studies that focused on SARSCoV-1 nsp1 (19). For example, previous studies have shown that nsp1 from SARS-CoV-1 is
unique among CoVs and is hypothesized to contribute to the exceptional pathogenesis of SARSCoV-1 in humans (37, 38). In fact, nsp1 control of interferon expression may be crucial to SARSCoV-1 infection given that the virus is interferon-sensitive (15, 39, 40). Further studies will be
needed to determine which functions are common between the two proteins and if there are any
functional differences that alter their respective viral lifecycles.
There is an urgent need to develop both vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and
any potential novel CoVs that pose a threat to global health. Because of its critical role, nsp1 has
been identified as both a target for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals and rational live
attenuated vaccine design (19, 20, 41-47). This fact was underscored by a previous study that
focused on the function of nsp1 during the SARS-CoV-1 lifecycle which concluded the following:
“How SARS-CoV nsp1 functions remains to be answered. Removal of the nsp1 protein function

from the virus(48) will enable determination of its effects on replication and/or virulence in vivo;
however, these experiments will require careful design and analysis because indiscriminate
deletion of nsp1 sequence would remove cis-acting elements required for replication”(49). This
conclusion is even more relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings, combined with
the structures of the carboxyl end of nsp1, are the first step to a comprehensive understanding of
the structure-function relationship of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression and purification. The nsp1 segment of SARS-CoV-2 was subcloned
into 6X His-SMT3 fusion T7 expression vector (pE-SUMO; Life Sensors) using primers to
amplify residues 10-127 of ORF1a. Expression plasmids were transformed into DE3 Star BL21
Escherichia coli cells and grown in LB media containing 200 ug/mL of kanamycin. The nsp1
cultures were induced at OD600 of 0.7 with 1mM isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 48 h
at 18 °C. Cells were lysed via sonication in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 5
mM Imidazole, 5 mM DTT and 1.3 mg/ml lysozyme at pH 7.8. Clarified lysates were loaded onto
His-tag purification column (Roche) and the protein was eluted in a buffer containing 20 mM
HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, 2.5 mM DTT at pH 8. The 6X His-SMT3 tag was
removed from the N terminus with recombinant SUMO protease. The cleaved sample was then
reloaded onto the His-tag purification column to separate the 6X His-SMT3 tag from nsp1. Buffer
exchange was performed with size exclusion chromatography using a Hi-Prep 26/60 Sephacryl S100 HR (GE). The final buffer is composed of 20 mM NaPO4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50
mM Arginine, 50 mM Glutamic Acid, 0.02% Sodium azide at a pH of 6.8.
Crystallization, data collection, structure determination and refinement. Purified
SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 was concentrated to 7 mg/mL and screened for crystallization conditions

against commercially available kits using a Mosquito liquid handling robot (SPT Labtech).
Diffraction quality crystals were obtained in conditions from multiple kits. An initial X-ray
diffraction dataset was collected with the Pilatus 200K detector (Dectris) atop a MicroMax-007
HF rotating anode X-ray generator (Rigaku) from a crystal grown in 0.1 M MES monohydrate pH
6.5, 12% w/v polyethylene glycol 20,000, cryo-protected with a supplement of 20% glycerol. Raw
intensity data were processed with the HKL3000 package.(50) Initial phases were solved by
molecular replacement with PHASER(51) using the core structure of PDB ID: 2HSX. The
structure was initially traced and refined with the AUTOBUILD routine in PHENIX(52), followed
by manual editing in COOT(53) and refinement with phenix.refine. This nearly complete model
was used as the model for molecular replacement with a final high-resolution dataset collected
from a crystal grown in 0.2 M sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate trihydrate pH
6.5, 30% w/v polyethylene glycol 8,000, cryo-protected with a supplement of 20% glycerol. The
model was further traced manually and refined with phenix.refine. Data collection and refinement
statistics are displayed in Table 1. All ribbon and surface illustrations of protein structures were
prepared with PyMOL (Delano Scientific). Alignment statistics were determined with structure
alignment tools from the RCSB (54).
