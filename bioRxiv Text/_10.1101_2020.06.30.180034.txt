Abstract
We present an analysis of the coronavirus RNA genome via a study of its Fourier spectral density
based on a binary representation of the nucleotide sequence. We find that at low frequencies,
the power spectrum presents a small and distinct departure from the behavior expected from an
uncorrelated sequence. We provide a couple of simple models to characterize such deviations.
Away from a small low-frequency domain, the spectrum presents largely stochastic fluctuations
about fixed values which vary inversely with the genome size generally. It exhibits no other peaks
apart from those associated with triplet codon usage. We uncover an interesting, new scaling law for
the coronavirus genome: the complexity of the genome scales linearly with the power-law exponent
that characterizes the enveloping curve of the low-frequency domain of the spectral density.

Introduction

Motivated by our search for deeper organizational principles governing genetic information 1 , the
study of a DNA/RNA genome via its Fourier spectral density has given us several interesting
insights into the code of life. An example of a seminal paper in this subject is that of Voss in [2]
where the author found that the spectral density of the genome of many different species follows a
power law of the form 1/k β in the low-frequency domain, with the exponent β potentially related to
the organism’s evolutionary category. In [2], β was found to be close to 1, a phenomenon shared by a
wide variety of physical systems especially those that carry long-range correlations or characterized
by a myriad of length scales. It was also found that the power spectra may contain defining peaks
or resonances, for example at period 9 for primates, vertebrates and invertebrates, or period 10-11
for yeast, bacteria and archaea as shown in [3] where the peaks were remarkably related to aspects
of protein structuring and folding. Over the years, these methods and results have been extended
in various ways [4], such as wavelet-type analysis [5, 6, 7] of the sequences, using features of the
spectra to classify and cluster genomes with the aid of neural networks [8], prediction of coding
regions [9] and periodic structures [10], etc.
In this paper, we study the Fourier spectral density of the genome of coronaviruses — a positivesense single-stranded RNA genome with size ranging from roughly 26 to 32 kilobases, based on the
dataset of [11] which covers all four genera of coronaviruses. In addition, motivated by the recent
COVID-19 pandemic, we include the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, a bat coronavirus Bat-RaTG13 of
close genome identity, and the MERS coronavirus.
Across the 30 different genome sequences, we find that their Fourier spectra take on the same
form. There is a low frequency domain (k . 10 in units of inverse genome length) where a
sinc-squared-like oscillatory form is enveloped by a roughly 1/k 2 decay curve. This is followed
by stochastic white-noise type fluctuations about fixed mean values which tend to vary inversely
with the genome size. We find that a random, uncorrelated sequence — with the probability of

occurrence for each nucleotide being its frequency ratio in the sequence — yields similar behavior
in the low-frequency domain. We develop a few models to characterize the typical spectrum, and in
the process stumble upon a linear scaling law between a measure of the complexity of each genome
and the power-law exponent that describes the enveloping curve of the low-frequency domain. The
complexity measure that we use here is intimately related to the Shannon entropy of the sequence,
and thus this relation concretely realizes a way by which information-theoretic content is carried
within the genome’s spectral density.
Now, power-law decay of the form 1/k α have previously been discussed in literature for other
types of genomes (see for example [12, 13]). We would like to emphasize that here, we do not employ
either the Fast Fourier Transform or non-overlapping averaging procedures to smoothen the data
in the low-frequency domain. These are common techniques used for easing computations in past
related works, but may compromise the sensitivity by which we characterize the spectral curves.
We also perform the spectral density analysis at the level of the coding region (a few thousand
nucleotides) for the Spike protein, an essential protein that binds to the host cell’s receptor. We
find that interestingly, the general features of the spectrum persist at the protein level, but not the
scaling law mentioned above.
Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present some background theory for our
work, followed by Section 3 where we present the results and a few graphical plots for visualization,
before concluding in Section 4. The Appendix A collects a table listing all the GenBank accession
numbers [14] of the genomes, and another gathers several graphs useful for interpreting our various
results.

Theoretical preliminaries

In this Section, we present some essential mathematical concepts that form the basis for our study.
Our analysis of the RNA genomes can only begin after transformation of the genome sequence
consisting of the four nucleotides (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Uracil) into a numerical string.
The spectral density of interest here is the absolute square of the discrete Fourier transform of a
nucleotide indicator function φ(i) defined as follows
M M
2πik
1 XX
Sαβ (k) = 2
φα (l)φβ (j)e M (l−j) ,

(1)

l=1 j=1

where M denotes the length of the genome, and α, β denote particular choices of nucleotides. In
the continuum limit and after averaging overR some
distribution of genomes, this approaches the
∞ R∞
Fourier transform of the correlation function −∞ −∞ e2πik(x1 −x2 ) hφα (x1 )φα (x2 )idx1 dx2 .
Now, a basic premise lies in the choice of the indicator function φ(i). While various propositions
have been explored in the literature, in this paper, following [2], we use a simple binary-valued
model where for each nucleotide, φ(i) is equal to 1 if the nucleotide is found at position ‘i’ and
0 otherwise. For all our genome data, we find that (1) exhibits a clear specific oscillatory form
that resembles a sinc(-squared) function in the low-frequency domain (up to k ∼ 10). In the
following, we furnish a potential simple explanation of such low-frequency behavior. For simplicity
and definiteness, we will mainly focus on the spectral density sum

for the rest of the paper, but we have checked that the general features described above pertain to
the cross-spectra Sαβ (with β 6= α) as well as the individual autocorrelations Sαα for all the four
nucleotides.
Apart from computing various quantities at the level of the entire RNA genome, we also examine
the spectral density associated with the coding region for the Spike protein. For the coronaviruses,
apart from the Spike protein, the genome encodes several proteins each carrying unique functions,
such as the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, etc. In particular, the Spike protein plays an
essential role in host cell receptor binding during the process of viral infection, and is thus a common
target for developments of antibodies and vaccines (see for example, [11]). Now the coding region
associated with this protein is only of the order of 103 nucleotides, so a priori it is not clear if the
spectral density can be meaningfully analyzed. We find however that the general features of the
spectral density persist for the Spike protein’s coding region too.

2.1

A reference curve: the uncorrelated background

Consider the case of an uncorrelated numerical sequence, where the probablity of a nucleotide of
type α occurring at some position is a constant, independent of others and the position itself. Given
Nα such nucleotides in the sequence, we can estimate this constant to be NMα , with the expectation
value of the spectral density being

We would find that up to k ∼ 10, (3) models the spectral density rather well. For the local maxima
of (3), they approximately occur at half-integer values of k and thus the upper envelope of the
oscillation is manifest as a 1/k 2 decay function in this domain which follows from expanding (3)
about k = 0. The decaying behavior of the envelope curve typically stops at about k ∼ 30, and
thereafter the spectral density appears to be characterized by stochastic fluctuations about some
fixed mean.
Although (3) appears to model observed datasets well, the goodness of fit doesn’t extend beyond
the k ∼ 10 range, nor is it clear from the data whether deviations from (3) are unimportant random
fluctuations or otherwise within the low-frequency domain. To gain further insights, we present a
few simple models which characterize the observed deviations from (3). The models’ parameters
can potentially be used for clustering coronavirus genomes if future studies prove that these values
persist for a larger sets of data, or more interestingly, they could potentially demonstrate correlation with other features of the genome that would help us recognize the presence of long-range
correlations. From now on, we refer to (3) as the ‘uncorrelated background’.

2.2

Three simple models

In the following, we present three models for the observed spectral density that characterize deviations from the uncorrelated background. The first two concerns the description of the low-frequency
domain (k . 10) whereas the third involves a more global description.
(A) Power-law decay of the enveloping curve

Motivated by previous works on this subject, we consider fitting a power-law decay via leastsquare regression to the enveloping curve ( for k ∈ [1, 10] ) of the form
S(k) ∼

1
,
kδ

(4)

for some power exponent δ. The power-law description is convenient and has proven to be
a popularly studied model for spectral density of genomes in general (see for example [13]).
It is crucial to bear in mind that it is a coarse-grained description which doesn’t extend to
the origin, and valid only for the low-frequency domain. We would later find that this is the
parameter that remarkably scales linearly with a measure of the genome complexity. For all
our datasets,  = δ − 2 ∼ 10−2 . It is not a priori clear how large  has to be in order for
the deviation to be significant, and more sequences corresponding to each type of coronavirus
should be studied in order to determine the range of  and its statistical distribution. Although
we leave this for future work, we found evidence that the variation in the  correlates with a
measure of the complexity of the genome (which at the limit of infinite genome size approaches
the Shannon entropy) in a way that is distinctly different from a completely random sequence.
It is useful to compute the expected δ for the hypothetical uncorrelated background (3)
Pwhich
is parametrized by the genome size M and the sum of squares of nucleotide number α Nα2 .
For the general spectral density S(k), from least-square regression of the log-log relation, we
obtain  ≡ 2 − δ to be

h log(k) log(S(k)k 2 ) i − hlog(k)ihlog(S(k)k 2 )i
[S] =

(5)
[h(log(k))2 i − hlog(k)i2 ]
P
where h. . .i = 91 k (. . .) denotes averaging over the nine local maxima
P points in the domain
k ∈ [1, 10]. For the uncorrelated case of (3), we find that the factor α Nα2 cancels away in
(5) and numerically, δ ≈ 1.956 for all the datasets at the level of the genome and that of the
protein coding region. This defines a background value for the detection of a deviation away
from the completely random sequence.
(B) Linearized correlation function
In contrast to an empirical power-law fitting of only the enveloping curve, one could adopt
a bottom-up approach by postulating certain forms of the correlation function, and then
performing the discrete Fourier transform. Consider the case where the correlation function
is a linear function of the nucleotide separation, we can write

This function is invariant under the reflection k ↔ M − k, which is an exact discrete symmetry

all our datasets can be matched to a positive κ of the order 10−2 . We find that if the curvefitting is performed taking into account only the first ten local maxima as in the case for
δ-parameter, the local minima points at integral k-values are not well captured by the fitted
curve, so we also include them in the curve-fitting.
Beyond the specific linear form of the correlation function postulated in (6), it is also representative of a large class of correlation functions of the form

For example, if the correlation function turns out to be an exponentially decaying function of

the form e− M with B  1, then to a good approximation we can identify κ ∼ B.
(C) A Lorentzian function
The power-law decay in (A) parametrizes the decay of the envelope whereas the model in
(6) could account for non-vanishing local minima in the low-frequency domain. Beyond this
region, we seek an interpolating curve that extends throughout the spectrum including the
origin. For this purpose, we consider fitting a Lorentzian function of the following form to the
spectrum

stochastic fluctuations are observed.2 This is a simple coarse-grained model which averages
over the oscillations in the low-frequency domain and describes the overall decay of the spectrum via a smooth curve. Like the κ parameter in the model (6), the curve-fitting is performed
with the set of extremal points in the low-frequency domain, with the initial and final conditions taken into account by first fixing N, m with their observed values for each genome
sequence. As a useful reference, we also fit the Lorentzian function to the uncorrelated background (3) and finding b2 ≈ 0.0765 with m ∼ 10−10 at the genome level, and m ∼ 10−8 at the
protein coding region level.

2.3

A measure of complexity and Shannon entropy

Scaling laws manifest in the Fourier spectral density have often motivated the study of features
of the genome that reflect various properties of it being a complex system, such as the fractal
dimension (of a suitably defined matrix representation of the correlation function), etc. A measure
of the complexity of the genome considered in the past literature (see for example [15, 16, 17]) is
defined as follows .

We only consider half of the spectrum, since the other half naturally arises from the discrete symmetry S(k) =

where Nα is the number of the α-nucleotide. The logarithmic argument counts the number of
distinguishable permutations given a fixed number of each nucleotide. At large M , this admits a
natural interpretation of the Shannon entropy of the genome sequence. To see this, we can invoke
Stirling’s formula to express the large-M limit of Ω as

which is a function of only the fractional distribution of nucleotides. In this form (10), the measure
of complexity Ω is clearly the Shannon entropy which measures the information entropy associated
with a genome sequence where the probability of nucleotide-α occurring in any position is NMα . We
would find later that interestingly, the model parameter δ (but not κ) scales linearly with Ω across
the dataset of 30 types of coronavirus genomes. Also, when restricted to the Spike protein’s level,
the measure of complexity appears to scale linearly with the overall measure at the genome level.
But the model parameter δ that is computed at the level of the Spike protein does not correlate
with Ω at either the genome/protein level, and neither does κ.

Results and graphs

Our genome dataset3 consisting of 30 types of coronaviruses spread across four genera mainly follows
from reference [11] plus a few other additions : SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and Bat-RaTG13. BatRaTG13 is a bat coronavirus that was most recently found to have 96% genome identity with
SARS-CoV-2 and featured in papers discussing a possible bat origin of the latter [18]. We included
it here to see how the model parameters for this genome compare to that of SARS-CoV-2 relative
to the other coronaviruses. In the following, we outline the essential results, using the example of
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome for various graphical illustrations.
We find that the Fourier spectral density is characterized by the following features:
(a) In a small low-frequency regime (k . 10), the uncorrelated background (3) is a good approximation (see Fig. 1 ) for all genome sequences we examined. After curve-fitting to the datasets,
we find the following range of values for the model parameters:4
δw ∈ [1.935, 2.079], κw ∈ [−0.0056, 0.0583],
δs ∈ [1.744, 1.934], κs ∈ [0.0155, 0.0818].

(11)

From visual inspection of the relevant graphical plots, we find no obvious correlation among
these model parameters, nor between them and the genome/Spike protein sizes. But we find
that δw and Ωw appear to be related. Linear regression yields the following best-fit line (see
Fig. 2 )
Ωw ∼ α + βδw ,
(12)
with the line parameters being (with the 95% confidence intervals in brackets)
α ≈ 2.28(2.14, 2.41),

β ≈ −0.47(−0.53, −0.40),

We list their names and GenBank accession IDs of the genomes in the Appendix for reference.
Whenever appropriate, we use the subscripts to label the level (w = whole genome, s = Spike protein) at which
various quantities are computed.

Since we checked that for all the 30 coronaviruses, the assumption of a completely uncorrelated
background yields δ ≈ 1.956, this leads to a convenient definition of a reference complexity
value
Ωu ≈ 1.361,
which lies at the intersection between the uncorrelated vertical line and the observed one with
finite slope. The difference between the observed complexity measure and Ωu in turn enacts a
measure of the deviation from complete randomness of the sequence.
There is also a similar relation between δw and Ωs , consistent with the following linear relation
that we found:
Ωw = CΩs , C ≈ 1.004(1.003, 1.006).
It would be interesting to study this for other coding and non-coding regions as it is suggestive
of some level of self-similarity for this complexity measure.

maxima, while the red dashed line is equation (7) obtained by fitting to all maxima and minima,
with the best-fit value κ = 0.0362.
(b) After k ∼ 10, the genome displays much more scatter about the uncorrelated background, and
the models of deviation are no longer effective descriptions (see Fig. 3). Stochastic fluctuations
about a fixed mean appear to set in and there are no isolated peaks apart from two prominent
2M
ones at k ∼ M
3 , 3 which have been seen and interpreted in past literature [2, 19] to correspond
to the universal triplet codon usage. We applied an (overlapping) moving average (of window
size ∼ 100 nucleotides) to smooth out the data, and checked that there is no apparent regime
where some non-trivial scaling law holds (see Fig. 4 and 5).
At the level of both the genome and protein coding region, the fixed mean parameter m
appears to correlate with the genome size. It appears to generally decrease with the size of
the sequence,at both levels of the genome and the Spike protein (see Figures 6a and 6b ) in
Appendix B). At the genome level, it is of the order ∼ 10−5 which is about 105 larger than the
value expected for the uncorrelated background, whereas at the spike protein level, m ∼ 10−4
which is 104 times larger than the uncorrelated background. The Lorentzian function that is
fitted to the data with initial and final conditions fixed by R0 and m is parametrized by the

Discussion

We have presented a study of the Fourier spectral density of the coronavirus genome at the level of
the entire genome as well as the coding region for the Spike protein. The power spectrum profile
can be well-described by considering aspects of deviation from the hypothetical case of a random,
uncorrelated sequence (eqn. (3) ). We summarize the essential general features below:

(i) There is a low-frequency domain (k . 10) which exhibits a clear oscillatory form that is close
to (3). In this domain, we find that the enveloping curve connecting the local maxima is
well-described by a power decay law of the form 1/k δ . We noted that the power exponent δ
shows a correlation with a measure of complexity of the sequence (eqn. (9)) which in the limit
of large genome size is the sequence’s Shannon entropy. The deviation from the uncorrelated
background can be described by a linear relation between δ and Ω. This behavior does not
however persist at the level of the Spike protein’s coding region.
(ii) Beyond the low-frequency domain, the spectrum displays stochastic fluctuations about certain
2M
fixed values m, and we find no other resonances apart from the peaks at M
3 , 3 which are
associated with the universal triplet codon usage. Relative to the uncorrelated case, m is
about 105 higher at the genome level and about 104 higher at the Spike protein level. It also
generally decreases with the size of the genome or the protein coding region.
(iii) Upon fitting the Lorentzian function to the spectrum with initial and final conditions determined by R0 and m respectively, we find that its half-width parameter is correlated with
κ — the dimensionless constant that defines the linearized correlation function in the lowfrequency domain, and generally increases with it. This is observed at both the genome and
Spike protein’s levels.
Let us conclude by briefly pointing out several future directions and applications. Now, it has been
noted in literature for some time that DNA viruses and unicellular organisms tend to have mutation
rates which vary inversely with the genome size (‘Drake’s rule’ [20, 21, 22]). This correlation
has been studied for RNA viruses recently (see for example [23]) although we are unaware of
any evidence for the case of coronaviruses5 which is the only RNA virus family which has a 3’exonuclease proofreading mechanism that enhances replication fidelity. The parameter m that we
have introduced here appears to vary inversely with genome size, and thus it may be worthwhile
to explore its role in models that attempts to explain viral mutation rates. In [25], a negative
association between molecular evolution rate and genome size was established for RNA viruses. It
would be interesting to compute the parameter m for the viral sequences studied in [25, 26]. Another
potential application of our work which has immediate relevance is to study the distribution of m
for SARS-CoV-2 genomes specifically to explore if they could describe current evolution of the virus
(see for example [27]).
The Lorentzian function that we fit broadly to the spectrum as a whole is a coarse-grained
description that does not model the transition from the low-frequency spectrum to the other part
of the spectrum that appears to be dominated by stochastic fluctuations. It would be interesting
to develop theoretical models that could possibly account for such a transition and in the process,
construct a clearer understanding for the parameter m or why the information-theoretic measure
(9) is relevant for the low-frequency domain.
A complementary approach towards understanding correlation effects is to study directly the
correlation function itself (see for example [28] ), although this is more computationally intensive.
It would be interesting to study what forms of correlation functions could lead to the enveloping
curve being of the form 1/k δ . A few related models were proposed in [29, 30], and it may be
worthwhile to revisit them in light of the newfound relation with the measure of complexity.
Finally, it would be interesting to perform a more extensive study of the models here with a
larger set of viral genomes so that we have a fuller understanding of their statistical distribution

and whether they can be useful in clustering and classifying purposes.6 Motivated by the COVID19 pandemic, notwithstanding our limited dataset, in Table 1 below, we show the viral genome
that is the closest neighbor to SARS-CoV-2 for each of the four model parameters at both levels
of the genome and Spike protein coding region. From Table 1, we see that Bat-RTG13 features
most frequently and that apart from TGEV and HKU1 which infect pigs and humans respectively,
the others are bat coronaviruses. Collectively, they appear to be broadly compatible with the
plausibility of the bat origin of SARS-CoV-2, while to our knowledge, the association of SARSCoV-2 with TGEV and HKU1 has never been made in literature.

Some Graphs

In this Section, we collect several graphs useful for visualizing two particular trends observed: (i)
the parameter m tends to vary inversely with size of genome/Spike protein coding region, (ii) the
linearized correlation function parameter κ and the half-width parameter b appears to be correlated.
