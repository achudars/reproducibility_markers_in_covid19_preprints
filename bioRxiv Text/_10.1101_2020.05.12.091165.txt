Abstract: As of June 2020, the number of people infected with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) continues to skyrocket, with more than 6,5 million cases worldwide. Both the World
Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) has highlighted the need for better control of
SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, developing novel virus-specific vaccines, monoclonal antibodies
and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can be time-consuming and costly. Convalescent sera and
safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAAs) are readily available treatment options. Here we
developed a neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 strain and Vero-E6 cells. We identified most
potent sera from recovered patients for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. We also
screened 136 safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells
and identified nelfinavir, salinomycin, amodiaquine, obatoclax, emetine and homoharringtonine.
We found that combinations of virus-directed nelfinavir along with host-directed amodiaquine
exhibited the highest synergy. Finally, we developed a website to disseminate the knowledge on
available and emerging treatments of COVID-19.
Keywords: antivirals, broad-spectrum antivirals, antiviral drug combinations

1. Introduction
Every year, emerging and re-emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), influenza A
virus (FLUAV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) surface from natural reservoirs to infect people [1,
2]. As of June 2020, the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to rise, with more
than 6,5 million cases worldwide.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a broad family of viruses, which include species such as SARS-CoV-2,
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. CoV virions are
composed of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, a lipid envelope, and several proteins, including
the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43,
HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are usually associated with mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract
infections like the common cold. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infections can
lead to serious disease and death. Considering the current global pandemic, both the WHO and UN
has highlighted the need for better control of SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, developing novel
virus-specific vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can be
time-consuming and costly [3-10]. Convalescent plasma and safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals
(BSAAs) are readily available treatment options that can circumvent these difficulties.
Human convalescent plasma is collected from recently recovered individuals and is used to
transfer passive antibody immunity to those who have recently been infected or have yet to be
exposed to the virus. However, the reliability of diagnostic assays, as well as the quantity and
neutralizing capacity of antibodies in the plasma should be considered. Both the WHO and
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have recommended the evaluation of
convalescent plasma for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease in controlled trials
(WHO/HEO/R&D Blueprint (nCoV)/2020.1) [11]. Indeed, several trials have shown that convalescent
plasma reduced viral load and was safe for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 [12, 13].
Interestingly, the studies also revealed variability in specific antibody production that was related to
the degree of symptomatic disease. Typically, IgM and IgG antibodies develop between 6–15 days
after disease onset, with the seroprevalence increasing to near 100% within 3 weeks. Some recovered
patients did not have high titers of neutralizing antibodies, possibly suggesting that antibody levels
decline with time and/or that only a subset of patients produces high-titer responses. It is also
possible that non-neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses not connected to antibody
production are contributing to protection and recovery, as described for other viral diseases [14-16].
BSAAs are small molecules that inhibit human viruses belonging to 2 or more viral families,
and that have passed the first phase of clinical trials. We have recently reviewed and summarized
the

information

on

dozens

of

safe-in-man

BSAAs

in

the

freely

accessible

database

(https://drugvirus.info/)[17-19]. Forty-six of these agents inhibited SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV,
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and/or HCoV-HKU1. Additionally, clinical investigations
have started recently into the effectiveness of BSAAs such as lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir,
hydroxychloroquine and arbidol against COVID-19 (NCT04252664; NCT0425487; NCT04255017;
NCT04261517, NCT04260594). Such BSAAs represent a promising source of drug candidates for
SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and treatment.
Here, we report isolation of seven different SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in
Norway. We showed that UVC and high temperatures destroyed SARS-CoV-2, establishing a
rationale and methodology for safe work in the laboratory. We developed a neutralization assay
using SARS-CoV-2 virus and monkey Vero-E6 cells and identified most potent sera from recovered
patients for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. We also screened 136 safe-in-man
broad-spectrum antivirals and identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of salinomycin, nelfinavir,
amodiaquine, obatoclax, emetine and homoharringtonine in vitro. We further showed that
combinations of virus-directed drug nelfinavir and host-directed drugs, such as salinomycin,
amodiaquine, obatoclax, emetine and homoharringtonine act synergistically. Finally, we developed
a website summarizing scientific and clinical information regarding available and emerging
anti-SARS-CoV-2 options.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Patient samples
We selected subjects among healthy individuals, in- and outpatients, as well as patients
recovered from SARS-CoV-2 or endemic coronavirus infections. Hospitalization was determined by
whether a patient was able to manage symptoms effectively at home, according to local guidelines.
ICU admittance was evaluated consistently with the WHO interim guidance on “Clinical
management

of

severe

acute

respiratory

infection

when

COVID-19

is

suspected”

(WHO/2019-nCoV/clinical/2020.4). The patients gave their informed consent through the
koronastudien.no website. For ICU patients, consent for sample collection was received after
treatment or from relatives. For children, consent for sample collection was received from their
parents. Donors were recruited through information at the blood collection centres websites and
through national media. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and blood samples were collected. All
patients were treated in accordance with good clinical practice, following study protocols. The study
was approved by national ethical committee (clinical trial: NCT04320732; REK: 124170).
2.1. Cell cultures
Human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial RPE, lung
adenocarcinoma A427, non-small-cell lung cancer Calu-3 and epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma
Caco-2 cells were grown in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL streptomycin and
100 U/mL penicillin (Pen/Strep), 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 0.25% sodium bicarbonate
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). Human neural progenitor cells derived from iPS cells were
generated and maintained as described previously [74]. Human large-cell lung carcinoma
NCI-H460, colon cancer SW620, colorectal carcinoma SW480 and HT29 cells were grown in RPMI
medium supplied with 10% FBS and Pen-Strep. Human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial
A549, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells and kidney epithelial cells extracted from an African
green monkey (Vero-E6) were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
Pen-Strep. The cell lines were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2.
2.2. Virus isolation
The SARS-CoV-2 strains were isolated and propagated in a Biological Safety Level 3 (BSL-3)
facility. 200 l of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) in universal transport medium were diluted 5 times
in culture medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.6 μg/mL
penicillin, 60 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine and inoculated into Vero E6 cells. After 4
days of incubation, the media were collected, and the viruses were passaged once again in Vero E6
cells. After 3 days a clear cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected, and virus culture was harvested.
Virus concentration was determined by RT-qPCR and plaque assays.
2.3. Virus detection and quantification

Viral RNA was extracted using the NTNU_MAG_V2 protocol, a modified version of the
BOMB-protocol [75]. 2,5 or 5 µL of the eluate were analysed by RT-qPCR using CFX96 Real-Time
Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA) as described elsewhere [76] with some
modifications. One 20 µl reaction contained 10 µl of QScript XLT One-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix (2x)
(Quanta BioSciences, USA), 1 µl each of primer and probe with final respective concentrations of 0,6
µM and 0,25 µM, and 2 µl of molecular grade water. Thermal cycling was performed at 50 °C for 10
min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 °C for 1 min and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s, 60 °C for
30 s.
For testing the production of infectious virions, we titered the viruses as described in our
previous studies [77-79]. In summary, media from the viral culture were serially diluted from 10−2 to
10−7 in serum-free DMEM media containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The dilutions were applied
to a monolayer of Vero-E6 cells in 6 or 24-well plates. After one hour, cells were overlaid with virus
growth medium containing 1% carboxymethyl cellulose and incubated for 96 h. The cells were fixed
and stained with crystal violet dye, and the plaques were calculated in each well, expressed as
plaque-forming units per mL (pfu/mL).
2.4. Viral genome sequencing
Viral RNA was extracted using the NTNU_MAG_V2 protocol, a modified version of the
BOMB-protocol [2]. Libraries were prepared using NuGEN Trio RNA-seq kit. Sequencing was
performed on NextSeq500 instrument (NS500528; set up: PE 2 x 75 bp + single index (8 bp)) using
NextSeq MID150 sequencing kit, and NextSeq MID flowcell (NCS version: 2.2.0.4). Reads were
aligned using the Bowtie 2 software package version 2.3.4.1 to the reference viral genome
Wuhan-Hu-1/2019. Sequence alignments were converted to Binary alignments and sorted using
SAMtools version 1.5. The consensus FASTQ sequences were obtained with bcftools and vcfutils.pl
(from SAMtools) and converted to FASTA using seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Viral genomes
in FASTA formats were submitted to www.gisaid.org. The accession numbers of these genomes are:

EPI_ISL_450346 (hCoV-19/Norway/Trondheim-S4/2020). Transmission of the strains was visualized
using https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?f_author=Aleksandr%20Ianevski%20et%20al.
2.5. UVC- and thermostability assays
The virus (moi 0.1) was aliquoted in Eppendorf tubes and incubated at -80, -20, 4, 20, 37, and
50°C for 48 h or at 96°C for 10 min. Alternatively, the virus was aliquoted in wells of 96 well plate
without a lid. The virus was exposed to UVC (λ = 254 nm,

≥ 125 μW/cm2) for 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320

and 640 s using a germicidal lamp in a biosafety cabinet. The thermo- and UVC-stability of viral

RNA was analysed by RT-qPCR. Subsequently, Vero-E6 cells were infected with the virus for 72 h,
and cell viability was measured using a CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, Madison, USA).
Luminescence was read using a plate reader.
2.6. Neutralization assay
Approximately 4 × 104 Vero-E6 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. The cells were
grown for 24 h in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and Pen/Strep. Serum samples were
diluted 100 folds and protein concentrations were quantified using NanoDrop. Serum samples were
prepared in 3-fold dilutions at 7 different concentrations starting from 1 mg/mL in the virus growth

Virus

hCoV-19/Norway/Trondheim-E9/2020 was added to the samples to achieve an moi of 0.1 and
incubated for 1h at 37 °C. No plasma was added to the control wells. The Vero-E6 Cells were
incubated for 72 h with VGM. After the incubation period, the medium was removed and a
CellTiter-Glo assay was performed to measure viability.
2.7. Drug test
We have previously published a library of safe-in-man BSAAs [5]. Table S1 lists these and other
potential BSAAs, their suppliers and catalogue numbers. To obtain 10 mM stock solutions,
compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) or milli-Q
water. The solutions were stored at −80 °C until use.
Approximately 4 × 104 Vero-E6 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. The cells were grown for
24h in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and Pen/Strep. The medium was replaced with
VGM containing 0.2% BSA, and PenStrep in DMEM. The compounds were added to the cells in
3-fold dilutions at 7 or 8 different concentrations starting from 30 μM. No compounds were added to
the control wells. The cells were mock- or hCoV-19/Norway/Trondheim-E9/2020-infected at an moi
of 0.1. After 72 h of infection, the medium was removed from the cells and a CellTiter-Glo assay was
performed to measure viability.
2.8. Drug and serum sensitivity quantification
The half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for each compound was calculated based on
viability/death curves obtained on mock-infected cells after non-linear regression analysis with a
variable slope using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0a (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). The
half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were calculated based on the analysis of the viability of
infected cells by fitting drug dose–response curves using four-parameter (4PL) logistic function f(x):
,

(1)

where f(x) is a response value at dose x, Amin and Amax are the upper and lower asymptotes (minimal
and maximal drug effects), m is the dose that produces the half-maximal effect (EC50 or CC50), and λ
is the steepness (slope) of the curve. A relative effectiveness of the drug was defined as selectivity

index (SI = CC50/EC50). The threshold of SI used to differentiate between active and inactive
compounds was set to 3.
Area under dose-response curve AUC was quantified as:

using numerical integration implemented in MESS R package (Bell Laboratories, USA), where
and

are the maximal and minimal measured doses. Serum sensitivity score (SSS) was

quantified as a normalized version of standard AUC (with the baseline noise subtracted, and
normalization of maximal response at the highest concentration often corresponding to off-target
toxicity) as

,

(3)

where activity threshold t equals 10%.
2.9. Drug combination test and synergy calculations
Cells were treated with different concentrations of a combination of two BSAAs. After 72 h, cell
viability was measured using a CellTiter-Glo assay. To test whether the drug combinations act
synergistically, the observed responses were compared with expected combination responses. The
expected responses were calculated based on ZIP reference model using SynergyFinder
web-application, version 2 [80].
2.10. ELISA assays
We measured the IgG and IgM in human serum using Epitope Diagnostics enzyme linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) according to manufacturer specifications (Epitope Diagnostics, San
Diego, CA). Background-corrected OD values were divided by the cutoff to generate signal-to-cutoff
(s/co) ratios. Samples with s/co values greater than 1.0 were considered positive. The Pearson
correlation coefficients were calculated by means of stats R package, with the significance
determined using Student’s t test.
2.11. https://sars-coronavirus-2.info/ website
We reviewed the current landscape of available diagnostic tools, as well as emerging treatment
and prophylactic options for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and have summarized the information in a
database that can be freely accessed at https://sars-coronavirus-2.info. The information in the
database was obtained from PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, DrugBank, DrugCentral, Chinese Clinical
Trials Register (ChiCTR), and EU Clinical Trials Register databases [25-27] as well as other public
sources. The website was developed with PHP v7 technology using D3.js v5 (https://d3js.org/) for
visualization. The COVID-19 statistics is automatically exported from COVID-19 Data Repository by
the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

3. Results
3.1. Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients
We isolated 7 SARS-CoV-2 strains from 22 NPS samples of COVID-19 patients using Vero-E6
cells. The RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were 18-20 before and 13-15 after propagation of the
viruses in Vero-E6 cells (Fig. 1a,b). We sequenced 7 strains and found that the sequences differed
from reference hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 strain by a few missense mutations (Fig. 1c).
Phylogenetic analysis showed closed relationship between the strains (Fig. 1d). In cross-referencing
our sequence data with the pathogen tracking resource, NextStrain.org, we determined that the
SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in Trondheim had originated from China, Denmark, USA and Canada
(Fig. 1e).

SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs. (b) Viruses amplified in Vero-E6 cells were

Trondheim and other viral strains, which full-genome sequences were submitted to GISAID database. (e) The
origin of our 7 strains according to nextstrain.org.
In addition, we tested several cell lines and found that Vero-E6 was the most susceptible for
virus-mediated death and virus amplification (Fig. S1a-c). To establish the rationale for safe work,
we incubated the virus at different temperatures for 48 h or exposed to UVC radiation for different
time periods. The resulting virus preparations were analyzed by RT-qPCR and used to infect
Vero-E6 cells. Virus incubation at 37°C for 48 h or UVC exposure for 10 sec destabilized the virus
and rescued infected cells from virus-mediated death (Fig. S2).
3.2. Sera from patients recovered from COVID-19 contain antibodies which neutralize SARS-CoV-2
We evaluated neutralization capacity of 7 serum samples obtained from patients recovered
from COVID-19. We also used sera from patients recovered from endemic coronavirus infections

and from healthy blood donors as controls. Five samples from patients recovered from COVID-19
had serum sensitivity score (SSS) > 5 and rescued > 50% cells from virus-mediated death at 1 mg/mL
(Fig. 2a,b). Notably, that serum from recovered patient with SSS = 7,2 neutralized all 7 SARS-CoV-2
strains (Fig. S3).
Our neutralization test of 32 samples (Table S2) showed a moderate positive correlation with
IgG (r=0.59, p < 0.001) and IgM (r=0.43, p = 0.01) s/co values obtained using commercial ELISA kits
that recognize SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Fig. 2c,d). However, correlation between the IgG and IgM
ELISA results was only r=0.28, p=0.11. Furthermore, we found moderate negative correlation
between SSSs and time intervals between SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and serum collection for 66
samples (-0.5, p < 0.025; Fig. 2d). Altogether, these results suggest that patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 produce different immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and that neutralization
capacity of convalescent sera declines with time.
3.3. Repurposing safe-in-man BSAAs
Through literature review, we made a database to summarize safe-in-man BSAAs
(https://drugvirus.info/). Recently, we have expanded on the spectrum of activities for some of these
agents [18, 19, 28-30]. Some of these agents could be repositioned for treatment of SARS-CoV-2
infection.
We tested 136 agents against SARS-CoV-2 in VERO-E6 cells. Remdesivir was included as a
positive control [31], and nicotine as a negative control. Seven different concentrations of the
compounds were added to virus-infected cells. Cell viability was measured after 72 h to determine
compound efficiency. After the initial screening, we identified apilimod, emetine, amodiaquine,
obatoclax, homoharringtonine, salinomycin, arbidol, posaconazole and nelfinavir as compounds
that rescued virus-infected cells from death (AUC from 285 to 585; Table S1). The compounds we
identified possessed structure-activity relationship (Fig. 3a). AUC for remdesivir was 290.
Interestingly, 10 M nicotine rescued cells from virus-mediated death but altered cell morphology
(AUC = 239; Fig. S4).
We repeated the experiment with hit compounds monitoring their toxicity and efficacy. We
confirmed antiviral activity of emetine, amodiaquine, obatoclax, homoharringtonine, salinomycin,
and nelfinavir (Fig 3b,c). Importantly, amodiaquine had superior SI over its analogues, chloroquine,
hydroxychloroquine, quinacrine, and mefloquine (Fig. S5). Thus, we identified and validated
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities for six BSAAs in Vero-E6 cells.
3.4. BSAA combinations are effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection
To test for potential synergism among the validated hits, we treated cells with varying
concentrations of a two-drug combination and monitored cell viability (Fig. 4a). The observed drug
combination responses were compared with expected combination responses calculated by means of
the zero-interaction potency (ZIP) model [24, 32]. We quantified synergy scores, which represent the
average excess response due to drug interactions (i.e. 10% of cell survival beyond expected
additivity between single drugs has a synergy score of 10). We found that combinations of nelfinavir
with salinomycin, amodiaquine, homoharringtonine, and obatoclax, as well as combination of
amodiaquine and salinomycin were synergistic (most synergistic area scores >10; Fig. 4b). Moreover,
nelfinavir-amodiaquine treatment was effective against all 7 SARS-CoV-2 strains (Fig. 4c). Thus, we
identified synergistic combination of nelfinavir-amodiaquine against SARS-CoV-2 infections.

3.5. Sars-coronavirus-2.info website summarizes emerging antiviral options
To rapidly respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, we developed a freely accessible website
summarizing novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 developments, including the tracking of therapeutic/antiviral
drug development, development of vaccines, and currently approved diagnostic options around the
globe.
The ‘Treatment’ section of the website summarizes 542 in-progress and completed clinical trials
that test the efficacy of therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19 or complications that arise from
COVID-19. These trials include over 192 unique therapeutic agents, in varying combinations and
applications. Importantly, we list 71 clinical trials that are already completed or are projected to be
completed by the end of June 2020. Of note among these are trials of remdesivir, favipiravir,
lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, dipyridamole, and interferons alpha and beta, which are
all phase 3 or 4 clinical trials scheduled to be currently completed.

The ‘Prevention’ section summarizes 23 current vaccine trials taking place around the globe.
Although vaccine development lags considerably behind drug development, several repurposed
vaccine options have also emerged. This includes trials of the cross-reactivity of the MMR (Measles,
Mumps, Rubella) vaccine, as well as several trials of the BCG vaccine among high-risk populations,
such as health care workers.
Finally, the ‘Testing’ section of the website provides a summary of 377 currently available
laboratory-based and point-of-care diagnostic tests that are approved for clinical diagnosis in at least
one country.
The website also includes predictions of experimental and approved drugs effective against
SARS-CoV-2, as well as provides a summary of information about the coronavirus pandemic. The
website allows interactive exploration of the data with built-in feedback and is available in several
languages. The website is updated as soon as novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 options emerge, or the statuses
of existing ones are updated.
4. Discussion
Here, we reported the isolation of 7 SARS-CoV-2 strains from samples of patients suffering
from COVID-19. Full-genome sequencing revealed that the strains were highly similar (98,8%) to
one another and to the strains circulating in China, Denmark, USA and Canada. All 7 strains contain
D614G in S protein. Strains with this mutation began spreading in Europe in early February and
became the dominant in other regions (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054).
We screened 12 cell lines for their susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus replication.
Vero-E6 cells appeared to be the most susceptible cell line for virus-mediated cell death and virus
propagation. This cell line has been widely used on toxicology, virology and pharmacology research,
as well as, on the production of vaccines and diagnostic reagents. The cell line is interferon-deficient;
unlike normal mammalian cells, it does not secrete interferon alpha or beta when infected by viruses
[81]. Moreover, this cell line was used routinely in anti-SARS-CoV-2 research [82-85].
We also showed that >10 sec of UVC radiation or 48 h incubation at 37 °C neutralized
SARS-CoV-2, establishing a rationale and methodology for safe work in the laboratory. These results
are consistent with previous studies showing that physical factors destabilize SARS-CoV-2 and other
viruses [33-36].
Neutralization tests are crucial tools for the assessment of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure and
potential immunity [12, 13]. We have developed a test to assess the neutralization capacity of serum
samples from patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infections, patients with endemic coronavirus
infections and healthy blood donors. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients respond differently
to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, neutralization capacity of convalescence sera declined with
time. Thus, the neutralization test allowed us to identify the most potent sera from patients
recovered from COVID-19 for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
Moreover, results from our neutralization test positively correlated with those from commercial
ELISA assays. However, correlation between the IgG and IgM ELISAs results was only moderate.
The difference could be associated with time of sample collection, production of immunoglobulins,
or sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use (i.e., IgM is the first
immunoglobulin to be produced in response to an antigen and can be detected during early onset of
disease, whereas IgG is maintained in the body after initial exposure for long term response and can
be detected after the infection has passed).

Drug repurposing, also called drug repositioning, is a strategy for generating additional value
from an existing drug by targeting disease other than that for which it was originally intended [37,
38]. This has significant advantages over new drug discovery since chemical synthesis steps,
manufacturing processes, reliable safety, and pharmacokinetic properties in pre-clinical (animal
model) and early clinical developmental phases (phase 0, I and IIa) are already. Therefore, drug
repositioning for COVID-19 provides unique translational opportunities, including a substantially
higher probability of success to market as compared with developing new virus-specific drugs and
vaccines, as well as significantly reduced cost and timeline to clinical availability [30, 39, 40].
We tested 136 safe-in-man BSAAs against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. We identified
salinomycin, obatoclax, amodiaquine, nelfinavir, emetine, and homoharringtonine as having
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, which we put forward as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates.
Nelfinavir (Viracept) is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus
HIV-1 (750 mg PO q8hr). It targets HIV protease for the treatment of HIV infection [41]. Molecular
docking studies predict that nelfinavir binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease [42]. Nelfinavir could also
inhibit

cell

fusion

caused

by

the

SARS-CoV-2

S

glycoprotein

(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.026476) [43]. It also inhibits Chikungunya virus (CHIKV),
Dengue virus (DENV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and SARS-CoV
infections

(https://doi.org/10.1039/C5RA14469H)

[44-46].

These

studies

warrant

further

investigations of the potential of nelfinavir alone or in combination with other drugs to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Amodiaquine is a medication used to treat malaria. The recommended dose for a course of
amodiaquine is 30 mg amodiaquine base/kg body weight over 3 days, i.e., 10 mg/kg/day [86]. It also
shows broad-spectrum activity against ZIKV, DENV, HCV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2,
Ross River virus (RRV), sindbis virus (SINV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV),
EBOV, Lassa virus (LASV), rabies virus (RABV), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and HSV-1
viruses (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.008482) [51-56]. Importantly, amodiaquine showed more
potent antiviral activity than its analogues chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. A recent study
showed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have ‘no benefit’ for coronavirus patients and
could

even

increase

the

risk

of

heart

arrhythmias

and

mortality

(https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31180-6).
Obatoclax was originally developed as an anticancer agent. Several phase II clinical trials have
investigated the use of obatoclax in the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, myelofibrosis, and
mastocytosis. Continuous 24-hour infusion of obatoclax 25-60 mg/day for 3 days in 2-week cycles or
3-hour infusion in 3 d cycle have previously been evaluated in cancer patients [87]. In addition,
obatoclax showed antiviral activity against FLUAV, ZIKV, WNV, YFV, SINV, Junín Virus (JUNV),
LASV, herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), echovirus 1 (EV1), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), RVFV
and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in vitro [18, 57-60]. It was shown that obatoclax
inhibited viral endocytic uptake by targeting cellular Mcl-1 protein [60].
Emetine is an antiprotozoal drug. It is administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous
injection in a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (maximum, 60 mg/day) for 10 days [88]. Emetine is also used to
induce vomiting. In addition, it possesses antiviral effects against ZIKV, EBOV, RABV,
cytomegalovirus (CMV), HCoV-OC43, HSV-2, EV1, HMPV, RVFV, FLUAV, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2
[18, 61-66] [89] (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.008482). Emetine was proposed to inhibit viral
polymerases, though it could have some other targets [67].
Homoharringtonine is an anticancer drug which is indicated for treatment of chronic myeloid
leukaemia (2 mg/m2 IV daily × 7). It also possesses antiviral activities against hepatitis B virus (HBV),

MERS-CoV, HSV-1, EV1, VZV and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [18, 66, 68-71]. Homoharringtonine binds to
the 80S ribosome and inhibits viral protein synthesis by interfering with chain elongation [69].
Salinomycin is an orally bioavailable antibiotic, which is used against Gram-positive bacteria in
animal husbandry (0.2 mg/kg BW, PO). It also inhibits FLUAV, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
and CMV infections [47, 48]. Salinomycin was proposed to disrupt endosomal acidification and to
block entry of the viruses into cells [49][50].
Our results have uncovered several existing BSAAs that could be re-positioned to SARS-CoV-2
infections. Because PK/PD and toxicology studies have already been performed on these
compounds, in vivo efficacy studies could be initiated immediately, saving time and resources.
Combination therapies became a standard for the treatment of HIV and HCV infections. The
reasons for using combinations rather than single antiviral are better efficacy, decreased toxicity, and
prevention of resistance emergence. Here we found that combinations of nelfinavir with
salinomycin, amodiaquine, obatoclax, emetine or homoharringtonine were synergistic against
SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells. Thus, the synergy was achieved when virus-directed drug was
combined with host-directed ones. This observation agrees with other studies on such combinations
[18, 58, 72, 73] (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.039925).
According to the available pharmacological data for these drugs, the most potent combination
could be a combination of orally available nelfinavir and amodiaquine. This was also the
combination that exhibited the highest synergy of all the drug combinations we tested, with the
synergy score at the most synergistic area being 16.48. (i.e. 16.48% of cell survival beyond expected
additivity between single drugs). There are no guidelines of what is considered a good synergy, but
it is very common to consider synergy > 10 as true (significant) synergy. Thus, amodiaquine and
nelfinavir combination could result in better efficacy and decreased toxicity for the treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other viral infections.
Our future goal is to complete preclinical studies and translate our findings into trials in
patients. The most effective and tolerable BSAAs or their combinations will have a global impact,
improving protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral infections or
co-infections, and allowing the rapid management of drug-resistant strains. Our bigger ambition is
to assemble a toolbox of BSAAs for the treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections. This
toolbox can be offered to the WHO as a means for the fast identification of safe and effective antiviral
options.
We have summarized the information about the status of currently available and emerging
anti-SARS-CoV-2 options in the freely accessible website (https://sars-coronavirus-2.info). The
website is updated regularly and incorporates novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 options as they emerge, or the
changes the statuses of existing ones as updates occur.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, sera from recovered patients, BSAAs, and combinations of BSAAS as well as other
available and emerging treatments could have a pivotal role in the battle against COVID-19 and
other emerging and re-emerging viral diseases. Further development of these options could save
time and resources that are required for the development of alternatives - virus-specific drugs and
vaccines. This could have a global impact by decreasing morbidity and mortality, maximizing the
number of healthy life years, improving the quality of life of infected patients, and decreasing the
costs of patient care curtailing to the impact of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as well as future
viral outbreaks.
