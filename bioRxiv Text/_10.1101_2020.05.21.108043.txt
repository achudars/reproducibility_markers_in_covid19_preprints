Abstract
COVID-19 is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by a coronavirus known as SARSCoV-2. The common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as shortness of
breath, breathing difficulties, dry cough, fever, and in some patients, severe acute respiratory
syndrome, kidney failure, and death. 312,009 deaths from COVID-19 has been reported as of
today. While respiratory symptoms are commonly caused by the infection, the use of
mechanical ventilation is required for some patients. The following is intended to review the
development and testing of a 3D printed and open-source mechanical ventilation device that is
capable of adjusting breathing rate, volume, and pressure simultaneously and was designed
according to the latest clinical observations of the current pandemic. The intuitive design of this
device along with the use of primarily 3D printed or readily available components allow the
rapid manufacturing and transportation of this ventilation device to the impacted regions.

Background:
According to the World Health Organization, more than 4,628,903 cases of COVID-19
infections have been confirmed around the world1. However, many experts estimate the actual
number of patients to be significantly higher than the reported cases. Although many aspects of
the infection are currently unknown, health organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and
researchers are rapidly studying the infection2. The preliminary clinical data collected in China
by Dr. Wei-jie Guan and his colleagues indicate that 1.4% of the admitted patients died from
the infection. However, 41.3 % of the patients received oxygen therapy and mechanical
ventilation was administered to 6.1% of patients3.
These data are consistent with the clinical observations from Iran and Italy. While the number
of confirmed cases of the infection has been exponentially rising around the world, the shortage
of medical supplies and equipment is one of the main challenges in providing effective
treatment to the patients4–6.

Open-source medical technologies have been developed for testing or experimental use in the
past, but the global pandemic has elevated the importance of open-source technologies and
medical equipment to rapidly expand the capacity of the healthcare system7.
This open-source positive pressure ventilation device (OSPPVD) is a response to the shortages
in the hospitals’ ventilation capacity, which has been reported to be essential to many COVID19 patients throughout the world. OSPPVD has been designed according to health care
professionals’ descriptions and observations of COVID-19 infection instead of recreating
already existing technologies5,8,9. However, it is not intended to replace nor negate the
importance of medications as well as care provided by healthcare professionals. The opensource ventilation device is intended to assist in increasing the capacity of healthcare centers or
provide the healthcare providers the tools necessary to provide effective care to patients10.
Methods and Materials:
This device operates based on the changes in hydrostatic pressure within three partially empty
and interconnected containers. This is achieved through lowering and raising one of the
containers relative to the other two stationery containers. At equilibrium, the height of the water
column is equal in all three containers (Figure 1). The change in the height of the actuating
container results in a change in hydrostatic pressure and displacement of air and water (Figure
2-3).
The flow of water from one container to the other two containers results in the displacement of
air transferred to the patient through a series of tubes and one-way check valves. In this setup,
two of the containers were secured at a set height while the other container was attached to an
electric motor and was lowered or raised relative to the other containers. This setup is
particularly useful since it does not require traditional compression equipment such as pistons
or precision parts such as gearboxes while a low number of moving parts would allow relative
ease in sterilizing and reusing the equipment between patients.
Electric Motor
A geared DC motor (Amazon, Seattle, WA, USA) rated at 30 RPM at a 12V input was utilized
in this setup while the frequency of rotation translated to one cycle of inhalation and exhalation.
The input voltage to the motor was adjusted via a DC motor speed controller (Onyehn, Seattle,

WA, USA) in order to achieve the required respiration rate. A Neiko 20713A laser tachometer
(Amazon, Seattle, WA, USA) was used to measure and record the revolution rate. A 3D printed
motor housing was designed to retain the motor on a tripod stand mounted on the wall using
two screws as illustrated in figure 4.
Height Regulator
Importantly, the height regulator translates the rotational output of the electric motor, then
subsequently to linear motion to raise and lower the container. Since the relative height of the
containers is the variable factor of hydrostatic pressure in this setup, controlling the height
difference between the containers determines the set inhalation and exhalation pressure. Tidal
volume is determined by the volume of water displaced during each cycle as a function of the
height difference. The height regulator is 3D printed in two parts to make sure most printers with
a building surface of at least 22 cm in any dimension could also manufacture the parts. Finally, a
shut off valve was incorporated in the device to adjust tidal volume and to avoid overdistention
of normal alveoli and volume-induced trauma.

Pulley System
Although the inherent advantages of a rigid metal frame with linear rails were initially put into
consideration for this device, a 3D printed pulley system was eventually constructed instead, to
reduce the overall number of all the required parts, cost and to improve the ease of storage and
transport. A 3D printed pulley system was constructed using paracord, a 22 mm skateboard ball
bearing, and 3D printed parts. Around three meters of readily available paracord was used in
this setup.
Valves and Tubing
Different types of tubing were utilized in the construction of this project (Table 1). The tubing
is used to transfer water or air. Four 13mm OD check valves were used in this setup to carry
oxygenated air to the patient and carry the expired air away. The tubing that was used to

interconnect the containers has a wider inner diameter to allow equilibrium to be reached
rapidly between the containers.
3D Printing
All parts were printed on an Anycubic Mega (Amazon, Seattle, WA, USA) using OVERTURE
1.75mm Polylactic acid filament (Amazon, Seattle, WA, USA). A 0.6 mm nozzle was used for
printing the files instead of 0.4 mm nozzle to reduce the total printing time (Table 3). All the
Computer-Aided Design files (CAD) were made using Autodesk Inventor 2020 software and
all the parts were printed without any additional supports, or brim. The 3D printed parts (Figure
6) were color-coordinated with schematic diagrams (Figure 1-3).
Containers
The 3D printed containers were specifically designed to be watertight and the internal walls
were optimized for fused deposition manufacturing process to avoid water or air leakage. The
inlet and outlet joints were designed at a reasonable tolerance to be printable with almost all
consumer-grade 3D printers while eliminating the need for adhesives in order to further
minimize the chance of leakage while in operation and reduce assembly time.
Statistical Analysis
In this experiment, the OSPPVD was operated over a 24-hour period to evaluate the device
performance as well as measuring the output pressure. All the pressure measurements were
made using the Hti-Xintai dual-port handheld digital manometer (Amazon, Seattle, WA, USA).
All pressure measurements were recorded by a digital camera at 30 frames per second and the
pressure data from the recording were extracted through processing the video at a frame by
frame basis using Free Video to JPG Converter software.
Results
The systematic output is a direct result of precision and accuracy of the achieved height by the
actuating container. While the use of a pulley system instead of a solid frame was determined as
a cost reductive measure and significantly increased the mobility of the setup, the lack of a rigid
framework also increased the difference between the set and measured height (Table 2).

Despite the micro-gaps that occur during the additive manufacturing process, no considerable
leakage was observed during the experiment. Though other polymers such as High Impact
Polystyrene (HIPS) or Polyethylene terephthalate (PETG), are better suited for this application,
the ease of use and ubiquity of Polylactic Acid filament allowed rapid prototyping and iterating
of this device. Optimization of printing speed and quality show exact printing settings vary
between different makes and models (Table 3). While the steady increase in pressure observed
by a gradual pressurization is best represented by a sinusoidal wave, the handheld digital
manometer was not capable of providing a sufficient passage for the flow of large volume air
displaced to measure pressure changes through a cycle. However, the pressure achieved at each
height was measured and the expected pressure was calculated using the hydrostatic pressure
formula. Regular tap water at room temperature was used in this experiment.

While a maximum of ±0.5 𝑐𝑚𝐻2 𝑂 variance between the height set by the height regulator and
the pressure measured by the digital manometer was observed during this experiment, the height
regulator may also be used as an indicator for the peak pressure in 𝑐𝑚𝐻2 𝑂 assuming that the
density of the medium is known.

Discussion
The slight difference between the measured and expected pressure is within the range of
difference observed in expected and measured traveled distance. While paracord is a readily
available and cost-effective material for building the pulley system, especially due to its high
tensile strength. However, stretching in length under load was observed which results in a
deviation from the expected height and pressure. A sturdier material may be more suitable for
this application.
Clinical observations indicate that maintaining a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is
crucial in avoiding alveolar collapse among COVID-19 patients. Maintaining PEEP is easily

achieved through a secondary source of compressed air and a pressure-regulated shut-off valve.
However, this setup requires further studies and is currently under development9,11.
The steady increase and decrease in pressure are best fit to a sinusoidal graph that is similar to
the breathing pattern observed in human adults. The gradual decrease in pressure could be
beneficial in avoiding pressure related injury that may result in scar formation and fibrosis.
According to the initial reports published by healthcare providers, the loss of compliance due to
the onset of fibrosis in the lungs is observed in patients diagnosed with severe cases of COVID19 infection9. An advantage of OSPPVD presented here is its capability to perform
hyperventilation with high flow rates under relatively wide pressure range from 5 𝑐𝑚𝐻2 𝑂 that
would allow the delivery of oxygen without the over-expansion of the lungs while being able to
supply pressurized air as high as 40 or 50 𝑐𝑚𝐻2 𝑂 even though the current setup is designed to
only reach 30 𝑐𝑚𝐻2 𝑂.
The underlying functioning principle of this setup allows it to run through many cycles of
inhalation and exhalation with minimal cyclical system fatigue (wear and tear). To our
knowledge of the currently available systems, this is an advantage over other open-source
ventilators that rely on the compression of a flexible air chamber with limited compression
cycles before it has to be replaced from loss of compliance. Furthermore, the flexible air
chamber is best used when providing positive pressure necessary during the inhalation. This
method of ventilation might not be suitable for patients with COVID-19 as they mainly rely on
lungs’ compliance for exhalation. Fibrosis and the loss of lung compliance is a common
symptom among COVID-19 patients and may not allow the patient to exhale normally12.
A conscious effort was made to reduce the number of electronic components needed to
manufacture and control the device to reduce the production cost as well as minimizing the
chance of device malfunction and injury to the patient due to electronic or software malfunction.
However, another iteration of this setup is currently under development that is controlled by a
micro-controllers and sensors to adjust the breathing rate and the intake volume according to the
patients’ needs autonomously and in real-time.
Oxygen therapy is an essential treatment for many infected patients, and this setup was designed
to be capable of intaking concentrated oxygen and supplying the patient according to the
healthcare provider’s specified volume and pressure. This may be achieved through a regulated

cylinder and an oxygen tank connected to the intake port of the positive pressure container.
Moisturizing and warming up the intake air are another feature that was put into consideration
while designing this device. During this experiment, the intake tube was extended below the
waterline in the compression chamber which allowed the air to percolate through warm water
before being compressed out of the container. The container was 3D printed from Polyethylene
terephthalate (PETG), due to its thermal properties compared to PLA13. This method was used to
make the intake air warm and humid before being compressed and expelled. Although an
increase in the air temperature was noticed during this experiment, further analysis is required to
measure the moisture content and confirm these results. Furthermore, the exhaust air from the
negative pressure container may contain airborne water droplets that could be hazardous to the
medical professionals as well as other people in the vicinity of the patient. The traditional
methods of spreading airborne viruses such as fine filters may be used in this setup. A similar
method may also be utilized to remove contaminants before it is transported to the lungs14.
Although calculating the tidal volume using the provided equation is rather simple, it is still
necessary to include an inline pressure-regulated valves in order to avoid any injuries due to
over-expansion of the lung. Other safety valves and sensors may be added in order to protect
the patient against ventilator-induced injury.
