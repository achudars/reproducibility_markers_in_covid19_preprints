SARS-CoV-2 M Protein Antagonizes Type I and III IFN Responses

Abstract

2

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute

3

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has quickly spread

4

worldwide and has infected more than ten million individuals. One of the typical

5

features of COVID-19 is that both type I and III interferon (IFN)-mediated

6

antiviral immunity are suppressed. However, the molecular mechanism by

7

which SARS-CoV-2 evades this antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we

8

report that the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein inhibits the production of

9

type I and III IFNs induced by the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway of

10

RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS signaling. The SARS-CoV2 M protein also dampens type

11

I and III IFN induction stimulated by Sendai virus infection or poly (I:C)

12

transfection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with RIG-I,

13

MAVS, and TBK1 and prevents the formation of a multi-protein complex

14

containing

15

phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation. Consequently, the

16

ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV2 M protein facilitates the replication of

17

vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Taken together, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein

18

antagonizes type I and III IFN production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling,

19

which subsequently attenuates antiviral immunity and enhances viral

20

replication. This study provides insight into the interpretation of the

21

SARS-CoV-2-induced antiviral immune suppression and sheds light on the

22

pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.

Introduction

2

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute

3

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a large

4

number of infections and fatalities worldwide, representing an acute and

5

rapidly developing global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 show 79.5% identity with

6

SARS-CoV-1 and approximately 50% identity with MERS-CoV at the

7

whole-genome level.1-3 SARS-CoV-2, together with SARS-CoV-1 and Middle

8

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), belongs to the genus

betacoronavirus

in

the

Coronaviridae

family.

Coronaviruses

are

10

single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses carrying the largest genomes

11

(26-32 kb) among all RNA virus families, with a wide range of vertebrate

12

hosts.4 The coronavirus transcripts have a 5 -cap structure and a 3 poly(A) tail.

13

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a genome of

14

host cells, the viral genome is used as the template for replication,

15

transcription, and the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and

16

subgenomic RNAs. The gRNA is packaged by the structural proteins, namely,

17

the spike, membrane (M), and envelope proteins, to assemble progeny virions.

Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against viruses, initiated by the

single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and DNA,

12

which will trigger the production of type I interferon (IFN- / ) and type III IFN

13

(IFN- 1/2/3) in infected cells. 8,9 The Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) senses dsRNA

dsRNA is recognized by RIG-I/MDA-5, which will initiate an antiviral signaling

cascade by interacting with mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS, also called

IPS-1/VISA/Cardif). MAVS then activates I B kinase / (IKK) and TBK1/IKK ,

binding of the type I or III IFNs to their specific receptors, the type I IFN

into the nucleus and binds the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in

gene promoters, thus driving the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel emerging coronavirus that is a global threat. How this

2

virus is recognized by the innate immune system is currently unknown.

3

However, studies from other coronaviruses indicated that RIG-I/MDA5

4

participates in the sensing of coronaviruses.15 TLR3 has been shown to be

5

involved in the sensing of SARS-CoV-1 in a mouse model.8 SARS-CoV-2 has

6

similar replication intermediates containing dsRNAs that can serve as

7

RIG-I/MDA5 or TLR3 ligands. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is likely detected by

8

these dsRNA sensors, which would induce the production of IFNs and other

9

pro-inflammatory cytokines.8

10
11

Host antiviral immunity may provide the selective pressure on viruses, which

12

has thus resulted in distinct strategies in viruses, including coronaviruses, for

13

counteracting IFN responses. The viral-encoded IFN antagonists are common

14

strategies to evade host antiviral immunity.8 SARS-CoV-1-encoded proteins,

15

such as nonstructural protein 1, the papain-like protease domain in NSP3,

16

ORF3b, ORF6, M protein, and the nucleocapsid protein, have been attributed

17

with being the cause of the antagonism of the IFNs and ISGs.8 The common

18

respiratory virus, influenza A virus, also encodes the IFN antagonist

19

nonstructural protein 1, which blocks the initial detection by the PRR through

20

binding and masking aberrant RNA produced during infection.6 The generation

21

of IFN antagonists by viruses is a common strategy to evade host antiviral

22

immunity.8 One of the striking clinical features of COVID-19 is that antiviral

immunity is drastically impaired.6,16 SARS-CoV-2 infection induces low levels

2

of type I and III IFNs with a moderate ISG response.6 Type I and III IFNs have

3

been supplied or combined together with other drugs to treat patients with

4

COVID-19, which is shown to be effective in suppressing SARS-CoV-2

5

infection and may effectively prevent COVID-19.17-20 In Vero cells, the

replication of SARS-CoV-2 is dramatically reduced when pretreated with

9

SARS-CoV-1.19,21 Treatment with type I and III IFNs can dramatically inhibit

10

SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells with the

11

corresponding induction of ISGs.22 The role of type III IFNs in the suppression

12

of virus replication has been highlighted.23,24 Type III IFN shows a better

13

treatment option than type I IFN for influenza A virus-induced disease for its

14

induction of antiviral immunity without the pro-inflammatory responses.25,26

15

However, in some cases, the type I and III IFN treatment promote the

16

replication of SARS-CoV-2, and this phenotype was more pronounced in

17

certain SARS-CoV-2 isolates.27 Two recent studies showed that ACE2, the

18

cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, may act as a novel ISG upregulated by type I

19

IFNs to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2 is indeed upregulated by IFN

20

treatment and SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has been observed in COVID19

patients.28,29 Therefore, the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the host

2

Overall, in most conditions, the host type I and III IFNs play an important role in

3

restricting the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2. To combat this,

4

SARS-CoV-2 likely encodes multiple viral proteins to antagonize IFN

5

responses akin to other coronaviruses. Because of its recent emergence,

6

there is a paucity of information regarding the interaction between host antiviral

7

immunity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, dissection of the evasion

8

mechanism of type I and III IFN responses by SARS-CoV2 will contribute to

9

the understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and a corresponding

10

treatment. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein acts as an

11

antagonist of both types I and III IFNs by affecting the multi-protein complex

12

formation of RIG-I-MAVS-TRAF3-TBK1 signalosome. The SARS-CoV-2 M

13

protein inhibits type I and III IFN production by Sendai virus (SeV) infection,

14

poly (I:C) transfection, and the overexpression of the RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway

15

signaling molecules. The ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein

16

facilitates the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This study reveals

17

a previously undiscovered mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 in evading host

18

antiviral immunity, which may partially explain the clinical features of impaired

19

antiviral immunity in COVID-19 patients and provide insights into the viral

20

pathogenicity and treatment.

Results

The SARS-CoV-2 M protein inhibits type I and III IFN induction by SeV

3

and poly (I:C)

4

To explore whether the SARS-CoV-2 M protein affects type I and III IFN

5

production, HEK293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 M protein were

6

infected with SeV or transfected with a dsRNA mimic, poly (I:C). The

7

expression of IFN- , IFN- 1, and two ISG, ISG56 and CXCL10, were

8

determined by RT-qPCR. The results indicated that both SeV infection and

9

poly (I:C) transfection strongly stimulated the expression of IFN- , IFN- 1,

10

ISG56, and CXCL10 in the control HEK293T cells (Fig. 1). In HEK293T cells

11

expressing the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, the induction of IFN- , IFN- 1, ISG56,

12

and CXCL10 by SeV and poly (I:C) was significantly suppressed compared

13

with that in the HEK293T cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1). Therefore,

14

the SARS-CoV-2 M protein inhibits the SeV- and poly (I:C)-induced

15

upregulation of IFN- , IFN- 1, ISG56, and CXCL10, suggesting that it is

16

involved in antagonizing the IFN response.

type I and III IFN expression, we employed luciferase reporters of type I and III

2

IFNs and ISGs to determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 M protein also

3

interferes with the activation of the cytosolic RNA-sensing pathway induced by

4

the overexpression of the RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway components. The results from

5

IFN- luciferase reporter (IFN- -Luc) assays showed that overexpression of

6

the SARS-CoV-2 M protein significantly suppressed the activities of IFN- -Luc

7

induced by RIG-IN (an active form of RIG-I), MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK

8

but had no effect on IRF3-5D (an active form of IRF3)-, TRIF-, or

9

STING-induced IFN- -Luc activation (Fig. 2). Similarly, we observed that the

10

SARS-CoV-2 M protein decreased the activities of IFN- 1-Luc (IFN- 1

11

luciferase reporter) and ISRE-Luc (ISG luciferase reporter) induced by RIG-IN,

12

MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK instead of IRF3-5D, TRIF, or STING (Fig. 2).

13

Consistently, in HEK293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, the

14

induction of ISG56 by RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK rather than

15

IRF3-5D, TRIF, or STING was significantly restrained (Supplemental Fig. 1).

16

Taken together, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein can impair the activation of the

17

RIG-I/MDA-5-dependent cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway but does not affect

18

the TLR3-TRIF signaling-mediated endosome dsRNA-sensing pathway or the

19

cGAS-STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. Because TBK1 is

20

also downstream of TLR3-TRIF and cGAS-STING signaling, the SARS-CoV-2

21

M protein might thus inhibit the dsRNA-induced IFN production at the step

22

upstream of TBK1.

Subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein

3

The SARS-CoV-2 M protein is predicted to possess three transmembrane

4

motifs at the N terminus (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, it is of interest to

5

determine the subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein. To

6

address this issue, a Flag-tagged SARS-CoV-2 M protein was overexpressed

7

in HeLa cells, reacted with the Flag antibody and then stained with a

8

fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody. The subcellular localization of the

9

SARS-CoV-2 M protein was observed by confocal microscopy. The results

10

indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein showed almost no localization with

11

mitochondria markers but was primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum

12

(ER) and Golgi (Fig. 3a-c). The mitochondria, ER, and Golgi are important

13

platforms for the multi-protein complex formation and signaling transduction of

14

the RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway, and therefore we assessed the colocalization of the

15

SARS-CoV-2 M protein with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1. The

16

results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein showed a strong colocalization

17

signal with TBK1 but had a partial colocalization signal with RIG-I, MDA-5, and

MAVS (Fig. 3d-h).

the RIG-I-like receptor signaling molecules were performed. We observed the

colocalization of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, and

4

protein with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, and TBK1. In HEK293T cells, the

5

SARS-CoV-2 M protein was coexpressed with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1,

and IRF3 (Fig. 4), after which coimmunoprecipitation experiments were

performed. We found that RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, and TBK1 but not IRF3 could

8

be detected in the SARS-CoV-2 M protein immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4), and

9

thus the SARS-CoV-2 M protein can associate with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, and

10

TBK1 rather than IRF3. Consistent with the coimmunoprecipitation results, we

11

observed a strong colocalization between the SARS-CoV-2 M protein and

TBK1 and a partial colocalization between the SARS-CoV-2 M protein and

13

RIG-I, MDA-5, or MAVS (Fig. 3).

(Fig 5b, lanes 2 compared to lane 3), indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 M

on the interaction between MDA-5 and MAVS. When using the TBK1 antibody

to perform endogenous coimmunoprecipitation, MAVS was detected in the

SARS-CoV-2 M protein affects IRF3 phosphorylation in a real virus infection is

4

unknown, which may contribute to our understanding of the role of the

5

SARS-CoV-2 M protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of the lack of a

6

biosafety level 3 laboratory, we used another RNA virus, SeV, as a surrogate

7

for SARS-CoV-2 to perform the virus infection studies. To address the effect of

8

the SARS-CoV-2 M protein on virus-induced IRF3 phosphorylation, control

9

HeLa cells and HeLa cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 M protein were

infected with SeV. The immunoblotting results indicated that SeV infection

11

could induce the phosphorylation of IRF3 in HeLa cells, while the

12

phosphorylation of IRF3 was obviously decreased in HeLa cells expressing the

13

SARS-CoV-2 M protein (Fig. 6a). Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein can

inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation induced by SeV infection. In contrast, TBK1

Discussion

2

Our previous studies have shown that innate antiviral immunity may play an

3

important role in the SARS-CoV-2 clearance observed in COVID-19 patients.38

4

The dysregulation of innate antiviral immunity and inflammatory responses by

5

SARS-CoV-2 is strongly responsible for COVID-19-induced human death.6,39

6

Type I and III IFNs are typically suppressed in COVID-19 patients, but the

7

molecular mechanism of this phenomenon caused by SARS-CoV-2 still needs

8

to be elucidated.6,23 Here, we reported that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein can

9

target the cytosolic RNA-sensing pathway of RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling to block

10

the activation of type I and III IFN responses and thus inhibit host antiviral

11

immunity.

12
13

The M proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were reported to suppress

14

type I IFN production by interacting with TRAF3 to disrupt TRAF3-TBK1

15

association. 36,37,40 However, the IFN-antagonizing activities of the MERS-CoV

16

M protein seem to be extremely low. The SARS-CoV-1 M protein interacts with

17

TBK1, but the MERS-CoV M protein cannot be detected to associate with

18

TBK1, suggesting that these two highly pathogenic coronaviruses engage

19

distinctive mechanisms in IFN suppression. Moreover, the M protein of the

20

human coronavirus HKU1 does not impact type I IFN production, indicating

21

that the IFN antagonistic property of the M proteins is not evolutionarily

22

conserved in human coronaviruses.36,37,40 Importantly, one recent study found

that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein cannot inhibit type I IFN and ISG production.41

2

The differences between the M proteins of these coronaviruses in

3

antagonizing IFN signaling drive us to study the function and mechanism of the

4

SARS-CoV-2 M protein in evading innate antiviral immunity. We first examined

5

the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein on the activation of the cytosolic

6

dsRNA-sensing pathway of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS signaling and the endosome

7

dsRNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling. The results demonstrated

8

that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein can significantly inhibit the activation of type I

9

and III IFN production induced by the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling components,

10

including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK , but not by TRIF, the adaptor

11

protein of the TLR3-TRIF signaling, or by STING, the adaptor protein of the

12

cGAS-STING signaling (Fig. 2). These results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2

13

M protein specifically targets the RIG-I/MDA-5-dependent RNA-sensing

14

15

pathway or the cGAS-STING-dependent cytosolic dsDNA-sensing pathway.

16

Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 M

17

protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, and TBK1 but not with IRF3 (Fig.

18

4). The overexpression of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein could prevent the

19

complex formation of RIG-I-MAVS, MAVS-TBK1, and TRAF3-TBK1 (Fig. 5).

20

Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein exerts its inhibitory effect on IFN production

21

by impeding the formation of protein complex involving RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3,

22

and TBK1, which are essential for IRF3 activation and IFN production. We also

found that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein can inhibit the phosphorylation of IRF3

2

but not that of TBK1 (Fig. 6a), which may explain why the SARS-CoV-2 M

3

protein interacts with TBK1 but cannot suppress TRIF- or STING-induced IFN

4

production. This finding also suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein does

5

not directly target TBK1 but acts upstream of TBK1.

6
7

Although SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV M proteins were shown to inhibit IRF3

8

phosphorylation, whether they also affected the translocation of IRF3 into the

9

nucleus was unknown.

36,37,40

To extend the understanding of the biological

10

function of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, we observed that after SeV infection,

11

IRF3 was mainly retained in the cytosol in HeLa cells expressing the

12

SARS-CoV-2 M protein; in addition, in control HeLa cells that did not express

13

the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, IRF3 was dominantly translocated into the nucleus

14

upon SeV infection (Fig. 6b, c). Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein can

15

powerfully inhibit the nuclear localization of IRF3 induced by SeV. Consistently,

16

IRF3 phosphorylation in HeLa cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 M protein

17

was also attenuated compared with those cells expressing an empty vector

18

(Fig. 6a).

19
20

The SARS-CoV-2 M protein possesses three transmembrane motifs

21

(Supplementary Fig. 2). We showed that it could colocalize with markers of the

22

ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3a-c), which are important signaling platforms for

innate antiviral immunity.42,43 In addition, we observed that the SARS-CoV-2 M

2

protein showed colocalization with TBK1, and partial colocalization with RIG-I,

3

MDA-5, and MAVS but not with IRF3 (Fig. 3d-h; Fig. 6b), and these

4

observations were also consistent with our coimmunoprecipitation results that

5

the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacted with RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1 but not

6

with IRF3 (Fig. 4). Moreover, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein

7

impeded the formation of the multi-protein complex of RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1

8

(Fig. 5a-d). An interesting question is whether this inhibition results from

9

retention in a cellular compartment that blocks translocalization. A previous

10

study has suggested that the translocalization of TBK1 from the ER or

11

mitochondria to the Golgi fragments is pivotal for SeV-induced IFN activation.

12

43

13

its inhibitory effect is likely achieved through inhibiting TBK1 translocation from

14

the ER to the Golgi compartments and subsequently affecting the formation of

15

TBK1-containing Golgi fragments.

16

Golgi fragment formation is affected by the SARS-CoV-2 M protein warrants

17

further analysis, which may represent as a novel mechanism by which

18

virus-encoded proteins render IFN production inefficient.

Since the SARS-CoV-2 M protein is localized in both the ER and the Golgi,

Therefore, whether TBK1-containing

microscopy, plaque assays, and immunoblotting indicated that the replication

2

of VSV-eGFP was significantly enhanced in HEK293T cells expressing the

3

SARS-CoV-2 M protein (Fig. 7). Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein likely

4

promotes viral replication by suppressing the host IFN responses.

5
6

Compared with the previous studies on the function of coronavirus M proteins

7

in antagonizing IFNs, we provided several novel findings. First, we showed for

8

the first time that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein suppresses both type I IFN and III

9

IFN production, but the previous studies were restricted to the effect of

10

coronavirus M protein on type I IFN. This finding may explain the advantage of

11

type III IFNs in curing COVID-19.24 Second, the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV

12

M proteins have been reported to impede TRAF3-TBK1 complex formation. In

13

our study, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein not only prevented

14

TRAF3-TBK1 complex formation but also impaired the formation of the

15

multi-protein complex of RIG-I-MAVS-TBK1, which is essential for IRF3

16

phosphorylation, translocation, and IFN transcription. Third, we also observed

17

that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein specifically inhibited RIG-I/MDA-5-MASV

18

signaling rather than TLR3-TRIF or cGAS-STING signaling, which may provide

19

more precise targets for potential COVID-19 treatment. In addition, we

20

reported that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein inhibited IRF3 phosphorylation and

21

nuclear translocation activated by SeV infection. Last, although the

22

SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV M proteins were reported to suppress type I

IFNs, their roles in viral replication are still need to be addressed. In our study,

2

we demonstrated that the overexpression of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein could

3

prevent the replication of VSV-eGFP.

4
5

Although we provide ample results to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 M

6

protein inhibits type I and III IFN production, we are aware that the ectopic

7

expression of the viral protein is different from a real infection for the study of

8

its biological function. Since the M protein is a structural protein and

9

indispensable for virion assembly, constructing an M-null SARS-CoV-2 virus is

10

currently not possible. Identification of a mutant of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein

11

that loses IFN suppression activities but does not affect virion assembly merits

12

further investigations. In addition, such a mutant may provide guidelines for the

13

future production of an M-defective mutant virus of SARS-CoV-2, which will

14

help to contribute to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 M in antagonizing IFN

15

in a real viral infection context.

16
17

The administration of type I or III IFNs alone or together with other drugs has

18

resulted in a reduced virus titer, a limited inflammatory response, and mild

19

clinical disease in both animal models and patients infected by SARS-CoV-1 or

20

SARS-CoV-2.9,24 Multiple proteins encoded by coronaviruses were shown to

counteract the IFN response, although the mechanistic details of their actions

for most of these proteins have not been well documented.8,41 A better
