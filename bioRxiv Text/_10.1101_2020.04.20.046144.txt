Abstract
As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, researchers from all disciplines
are coming together and contributing their expertise. CORD-19, a dataset
of COVID-19 and coronavirus publications, has been made available alongside calls to help mine the information it contains and to create tools to
search it more effectively. We analyse the delineation of the publications
included in CORD-19 from a scientometric perspective. Based on a comparison to the Web of Science database, we find that CORD-19 provides
an almost complete coverage of research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses.
CORD-19 contains not only research that deals directly with COVID19 and coronaviruses, but also research on viruses in general. Publications from CORD-19 focus mostly on a few well-defined research areas, in
particular: coronaviruses (primarily SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARSCoV-2); public health and viral epidemics; molecular biology of viruses;
influenza and other families of viruses; immunology and antivirals; clinical
medicine. CORD-19 publications that appeared in 2020, especially editorials and letters, are disproportionately popular on social media. While
we fully endorse the CORD-19 initiative, it is important to be aware that
CORD-19 extends beyond research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is attracting the attention of the global scientific community. Biomedical research on the virus and on the management of the crisis
from an epidemiological and healthcare point of view has full priority. Furthermore, many research communities, funding agencies and third-parties are taking
action to support the fight against the pandemic with their own expertise and

resources. Multidisciplinary open collaboration will prove instrumental to fight
the current and future pandemics [6, 5].
Several initiatives have been taken to share COVID-19-related scientific
research as openly as possible, from public, private and non-profit organisations. It has been readily recognized that health crises are also information
crises [39, 11, 31, 20]. For example, the World Health Organization maintains a
list of relevant research updated daily [41], as well as a portal to provide information to the public [2], similar to the the European Commission [3]. Publishers
are opening access to relevant publications, and some open-access publishers
have lifted publishing fees for the same reason.
Another initiative is the release of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset
(CORD-19) [38]. CORD-19 is a growing, daily-updated dataset of COVID-19
publications, capturing new as well as past research on “COVID-19 and the
coronavirus family of viruses for use by the global research community.”1 The
reason to release this dataset is “to mobilize researchers to apply recent advances
in natural language processing to generate new insights in support of the fight
against this infectious disease.” The initiative has the backing of the US White
House [1] and is a partnership of several institutions including the Allen Institute
for Artificial Intelligence, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Microsoft Research, the
National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health, and Unpaywall. CORD-19 is released together with a set of challenges hosted by Kaggle,
mainly focused on automatically extracting structured and actionable information from such a large set of publications. The release of this dataset is a positive
call for action directed towards the natural language processing, machine learning and related research communities.2
In order to contribute to an informed use of the CORD-19 dataset, we present
a scientometric analysis of its contents. We first consider the subject delineation
of CORD-19. Field or subject delineation is a complex task, which usually
benefits from an interplay of information retrieval, or search-based approaches,
and bibliometric mapping [19, 42, 24]. Based on a comparison to the Web of
Science database, we find that CORD-19 provides an almost complete coverage
of research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses. We also show that CORD-19
covers other research topics beyond COVID-19 and coronaviruses.
We then provide a detailed analysis of the research covered by CORD-19,
enriching the dataset with data from Dimensions [18] and using both citation
analysis and text analysis. We show that CORD-19 broadly focuses on biomedical research on viruses and related health issues. The articles it covers are
quite heterogeneous. CORD-19 contains a core of research directly on COVID19 and coronaviruses, but in addition it contains many articles on related yet
distinct streams of virus research, such as on influenza, molecular biology and

call has been taken up: For example, the ACL conference has run an emergency NLP
COVID-19 workshop which mentioned the CORD-19 dataset on its call for papers (https://
www.nlpcovid19workshop.org) and a TREC-COVID challenge has been announced on CORD19 (https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit).

public health. Secondly, we identify three broad periods in the accumulation
of literature in CORD-19: a pre-SARS (2003) period, a post-SARS period and
the current pandemic (2020). We also present a brief analysis of Altmetric
data [30, 27] related to papers in CORD-19. We find that papers published in
2020 are disproportionately represented in social media and news by Altmetric
indicators, especially on Twitter. We also observe that non-research articles,
such as editorials and letters, are particularly popular on social media. We
conclude by emphasizing the importance of being aware of the broad coverage
of CORD-19, which extends beyond research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses.
We also propose some directions for future work.
To facilitate the analysis and use of the CORD-19 dataset, we release our
code (see Appendix). In combination with access to Dimensions, Altmetric,
Web of Science and Twitter, our results can be replicated. Finally, we underline
that we have no specific biomedical expertise. We invite experts to improve the
interpretation of our results.

The CORD-19 dataset
The CORD-19 dataset [38] is being updated on a daily basis. We use the
version of the dataset from July 1, 2020. This version of CORD-19 contains
169, 821 articles, of which 77, 777 are equipped with full text. The dataset
collects publications from the following sources:
• Medline and PubMed’s PMC open access corpus, via the query:
"COVID-19" OR Coronavirus OR "Corona virus"
OR "2019-nCoV" OR "SARS-CoV" OR "MERS-CoV"
OR "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome" OR
"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome".
• COVID-19 research articles from the WHO database [4].
• arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv pre-prints using the same query as in PMC.
A relatively small number of publications prior to the SARS 2003 outbreak is
followed by a steady increase in the number of publications up to 2020, when the
growth accelerated substantially (Figure 2). The top 20 sources (i.e., journals
and pre-print servers) by number of publications are given in Figure 1, highlighting how CORD-19 is composed of publications from varied sources. Pre-print
servers, the Journal of Virology and PLOS ONE stand out. The main contributors to the dataset are Medline, PMC and Elsevier (Figure A.1b), which have
made a large part of their relevant literature available. The availability of full
texts is relatively high, but not yet complete, and is proportionally stable over
time (Figure A.1a). This is because, even though most publishers and journals
have opened up their publications, some have not yet done so. In particular,

the Journal of Virology, Nature, Science, The Lancet and BMJ provided no or
only few articles in full text at the time of our analysis (July 2020).
Using Dimensions data, we study the number of citations to papers in
CORD-19 (Figure A.2). The literature in CORD-19 gained more attention from
the early 2000s, and some publications from 2020 are accumulating citations at
an extreme rate. The most cited articles from 2020 include: “Clinical features
of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China” by Huang et
al. (2020, The Lancet, also the most cited overall), “Clinical Characteristics of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China” by Guan et al. (2020, The New England
Journal of Medicine), “A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in
China, 2019” by Zhu et al. (2020, The New England Journal of Medicine) and
“Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China” by Wang et al. (2020, JAMA).
The Lancet is the most cited journal in the dataset in terms of the absolute
number of citations received from papers in CORD-19, based on Dimensions
data. It is followed by PLOS ONE and Nature. Lastly, we consider the Fields
of Research (FOR) categories provided by Dimensions, which cover all areas of
research from the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification
(ANZSRC).3 While about 30, 000 articles have no classification, we find that,
as expected, the Medical and Health Sciences cover most ground, followed by
Biological Sciences (Figure A.3). The second level FOR classification shows the
presence of several sub-areas of these two top level fields, Clinical Sciences being
the largest. More details and plots are provided in the accompanying repository.

Delineation of CORD-19
We now analyse how the literature on COVID-19 and coronaviruses is delineated
in CORD-19. We first examine whether the delineation might be too broad,
meaning that CORD-19 would include publications that are of limited relevance
for coronavirus research. We then examine whether the delineation might be too
narrow, meaning that relevant publications would not be included in CORD-19.
We focus on publications from the time period 1980–2019. We do not consider
publications from 2020, because most of these publications are not yet available
in the Web of Science (WoS) database used in our analysis.
Figure 3 shows the annual number of publications in CORD-19 as well as
the annual number of publications in a subset of CORD-19 that we refer to
as ‘CORD-19-strict’. CORD-19-strict consists of all publications in CORD-19
that we have identified by applying the CORD-19 search query to the titles
and abstracts of publications but not to their full texts. Hence, publications for
which the CORD-19 search query yields a match only in the full text and not in
the title and abstract are not included in CORD-19-strict. These publications
probably do not directly focus on COVID-19 and coronaviruses, even though
they may still be related to these topics in some way. If these publications
had been directly focused on COVID-19 and coronaviruses, it can be expected
that applying the CORD-19 search query to the title and abstract would have
resulted in a match.
As can be seen in Figure 3, the number of CORD-19 publications started
to increase around 2002 and 2003, which coincides with the 2002–2004 SARS
outbreak. Looking at CORD-19-strict, a second increase took place after 2012,
following the 2012 MERS outbreak. More significantly for our analysis, Figure 3
shows that CORD-19-strict includes only a relatively small subset of all publi-

cations in CORD-19. This suggests that CORD-19 includes many publications
that are not directly focused on COVID-19 and coronaviruses research. The
inclusion of these publications in CORD-19 does no harm and may be useful
for a broader perspective on coronoviruses research. However, it is important
for users of CORD-19 to be aware that the dataset includes a large number of
publications whose relevance for COVID-19 and coronaviruses research needs a
more careful assessment, and some of which may be of limited relevance.
We now take an opposite perspective, aiming to find out whether relevant
publications may be missing in CORD-19. To do so, we use the CWTS inhouse version of the WoS database [7].4 We consider the following WoS citation
indices: Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts
& Humanities Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index. We
use the CORD-19 search query to identify relevant publications in WoS. The
search query is applied to the titles, abstracts, and keywords of publications,
where we note that abstracts and keywords are available only for publications
from 1991 onward. We refer to the resulting set of publications as ‘WoS-strict’,
where ‘strict’ indicates that publications have been identified in a similar way
as in CORD-19-strict, so without searching in the full texts of publications.
Figure 4 shows the annual number of publications in WoS-strict. In addition,
the figure shows the annual number of publications in WoS-strict that are also
included in CORD-19, using DOIs and PubMed IDs to match publications in
the two datasets. We see that almost all publications in WoS-strict can also be
found in CORD-19. This indicates that CORD-19 provides an almost complete
coverage of publications that have a clear relevance for research on COVID-19
4 Elsewhere in this paper, we use data from Dimensions instead of WoS. Because we do not
have access to abstracts in Dimensions, we use WoS data in this section.

and coronaviruses, at least when compared to WoS. Importantly, in a comparison of CORD-19 and WoS that we performed a few months previous to the one
we report here (discussed in an earlier version of the present paper [12]), we
found substantial gaps in the coverage of the coronavirus literature by CORD19. In a span of a few months, it appears that most gaps in the coverage of
CORD-19 have been filled. This testifies to the efforts made by the CORD-19
team to expand the coverage of the dataset [21].

Analysis of CORD-19
We conducted the following analyses on the CORD-19 dataset: a term map
and a topic modelling analysis based on titles and abstracts of publications in
CORD-19; a citation network analysis using Dimensions citation data; an altmetrics analysis using Altmetric data. The purpose of the former two analyses is
to cluster CORD-19 publications and further clarify the contents of the dataset.
For our analyses, we focus on 140, 302 articles out of the 169, 821 available in
CORD-19, filtering out duplicates and articles without at least one identifier
among DOI, PubMed ID, PubMed Central ID or arXiv ID.

Term map
To get an accessible high-level overview of the contents of CORD-19, we used
VOSviewer [33] to create a so-called term map of the publications in this dataset.
Titles and abstracts of publications were concatenated into a single string and
were then provided as input to VOSviewer. Using the text mining algorithms

of VOSviewer, we identified the 2, 115 most relevant terms in the titles and
abstracts. A term is defined as a sequence of nouns and adjectives ending with
a noun. Only terms occurring in at least 130 publications were considered.
Plural terms were converted to singular. For each pair of terms, VOSviewer
counted the number of publications in which both terms occur in the title or
abstract. In this way, a co-occurrence network was obtained, indicating for each
pair of terms the number of publications in which they occur together.
Figure 5 presents a visualisation of this co-occurrence network. The visualisation, referred to as a term map, shows the 2, 115 terms included in the
network. The size of a term reflects the number of publications in which the
term occurs. The proximity of two terms in the map approximately indicates
the relatedness of the terms based on their number of co-occurrences. In general,
the closer two terms are located to each other, the stronger they are related.
This means that groups of terms located closely together in the map usually
can be interpreted as topics. The horizontal and vertical axes have no special meaning. Labels are shown only for a selection of the terms in the term
map. In order to avoid overlapping labels, for many of the less prominent terms
no label is shown. The term map can also be explored interactively online
(https://bit.do/term_map_cord19_20200701). The labels of the less prominent terms can then be made visible by zooming in on specific areas in the
map.
Colors can be used to present additional information in the term map. In
Figure 5, for instance, the color of a term reflects the average publication year

of the publications in which the term occurs. In this way, temporal trends are
made visible. The term map shows a clear divide between biologically focused
topics in the right area in the map and clinically focused topics and health
research in the left area (for similar findings, see [34]). As shown by the colors
of the terms, the topics in the left area in the map received a lot of attention in
more recent years, while the topics in the right area received attention mostly
in earlier years. Below, we use our term map to illustrate some of the analyses
we present.

Topic modelling
We conducted a topic modelling analysis, making use of the titles and abstracts
of CORD-19 publications by concatenating them into a single string, similarly to
what we did for the term map. Of the 140, 302 articles, 31, 055 have no abstract.
Topic modelling is a technique to learn ‘topics’ from a corpus of documents. A
topic is defined as a probability distribution over a vocabulary, where words with
a high probability for the same topic tend to co-occur frequently in the same
documents [8, 40, 23]. We applied a pre-processing pipeline using ScispaCy’s
en core sci md model [26] to convert each publication’s title and abstract into a
bag-of-words representation. This included the following steps: entity detection
and inclusion in the bag-of-words for entities consisting of at least two tokens;
lemmatisation; removal of (isolated) punctuation and stopwords; inclusion of
frequent bigrams.
We started by training a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [10], using gensim’s implementation [28] and 15 topics. From a topic coherence analysis [25], we found 15 to 25 to be a good value for the number of topics. We
decided to remain on the lower end to facilitate the interpretation of the results. We further filtered out words that appear in fewer than ten or in more
than half of the documents. Lastly, we verified our results using a Correlated
Topic Model [9],5 which reduces to a Structural Topic Model without covariates [29]. This model explicitly captures topic correlations. It confirmed the
topic structure we found with LDA, as well as the topics’ temporal unfolding.
More details are provided in the accompanying repository. We report results of
the LDA model in what follows.
The top 20 words per topic are given in the Appendix. In Figure A.4, we
show the yearly topic intensity, from 1980 to 2020. Three periods in the relative
focus of the literature seem to emerge. Pre-SARS research mainly focused on
molecular biology and immunology (topics 3, 8, 11 and 12). Subsequently, due
primarily to the SARS and MERS outbreaks (topic 5), the literature broadened
its focus to include topics such as epidemics (topics 9 and 10), public health
(topics 0, 4 and 13) and clinical medicine (topics 2, 6, 7 and 14). Lastly, in 2020
the literature is also heavily focused on the COVID-19 outbreak, its ongoing
management and consequences (topic 1). From this first analysis, we observe
how coronavirus research seems to be produced in bursts following outbreaks

instead of following a more steady progress.
In order to analyse the contents of CORD-19 at a higher level of granularity,
we grouped the identified topics into general topics. We used agglomerative
clustering based on the Jensen-Shannon distances among topic-word distributions to inform the grouping of topics (see the accompanying repository for more
details). To be sure, the resulting grouping is a simplification of the actual publication contents. It is also worth considering that topics overlap substantially.
The following general topics were identified:
• “Clinical medicine”: topics 2, 6, 7, 14;

publications focusing on molecular biology and immunology. Figure 6 shows the
relative (average per paper) and absolute (total over all papers) topic intensities
of the general topics. The temporal development of the contents of CORD-19
discussed above is largely confirmed. The 2003 SARS outbreak generated a
shift associated with a rise in publications on coronavirus epidemics, which
is happening again, at a much larger scale, in 2020 for COVID-19. Molecular
biology and immunology research, on the other hand, have lost ground in relative
terms.

Citation clusters
The previous two analyses were based on textual data. We now turn to a view
based on citations to characterise the CORD-19 dataset.
We constructed a citation network based on the references included in all
papers in CORD-19, as provided by Dimensions. We considered not only references to papers in CORD-19, but also all other references in CORD-19 papers.
These ‘external’ references provide additional information regarding the structure of CORD-19. For example, two papers may not be immediately connected
via papers in the CORD-19 dataset, but they may have common references
external to CORD-19. We considered only the giant weakly connected component, which amounted to 1, 844, 831 publications and 3, 974, 851 citation links,
of which 104, 508 publications belong to the CORD-19 dataset. This is the
citation network that we work with in the remainder of this section.
We clustered the citation network using the Leiden algorithm6 [32]. Each
citation link was weighted as 1/ki , where ki is the number of references of publication i. The inclusion of the ‘external’ references in the context of clustering is
also known as the extended direct citation approach [37]. In this approach, the
publications contained in CORD-19 are weighted with a so-called node weight
of 1, while the ‘external’ publications are weighted with a weight of 0 (see [37]
for more details). We clustered the citation network in a hierarchical fashion.
At the most detailed level, the citation network was clustered using a resolution of 2 · 10−5 . We aggregated the citation network based on this clustering,
and then clustered the resulting aggregated citation network at a resolution of
1 · 10−5 . We refer to the former clustering as the bottom level clustering, and
to the latter as the top level clustering. The ‘external’ publications help cluster
publications from CORD-19 more accurately. In what follows, we focus only on
the 104, 508 publications included in CORD-19.
The clustering at the bottom level has 11 clusters that include more than
2, 000 CORD-19 publications each (Figure A.5b). In total, these 11 clusters
cover 54% of the CORD-19 publications. There are 90 clusters that include
between 1, 000 and 2, 000, covering an additional 41% of the CORD-19 publications. The remaining 5% of the publications are scattered across 2, 429 small
clusters each including fewer than 1, 000 publications. Of these clusters, 2, 012
consist of only a single publication.

To better understand the substantive focus of the different clusters, we overlay the clusters on the term map that we constructed previously. For each term
in the term map, we selected all publications in which the term occurs and we
calculated the percentage of these publications that belong to a specific cluster.
This percentage determines the color of the term, with low percentages resulting
in a blue color and high percentages resulting in a yellow color. For different
clusters, different parts of the term map are highlighted in yellow, showing how
clusters differ in their focus (Figure 7).
The largest cluster, consisting of 16, 913 publications, mainly covers publications dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, including 15, 578 publications in
2020 and only about 100–200 in the preceding years. This focus is also clearly
visible in the term map (Figure 7a). The second largest cluster, consisting of
10, 169 publications, focuses on respiratory viruses more generally (Figure 7b),
showing a clear increase after the SARS epidemic in 2004, with again a clear
increase in 2020. The third largest cluster, consisting of 7, 345 publications,
has a clear biochemical focus, dealing with various proteins, transcriptions and
pathways (Figure 7c) and shows a sustained increase from the early 2000s until
2020. The fourth largest cluster, consisting of 4, 375 publications, deals with
both emerging infectious diseases and zoonosis (Figure 7d) and shows a similarly sustained increase from the early 2000s onward. The fifth largest cluster,
consisting of 3, 252 publications, focuses on surgical procedures (Figure 7e) and
shows an increase from 2007–2011 and then gently levels off towards 2020. Finally, the sixth largest cluster deals with viruses in animals (Figure 7f) and
shows a longer history, dating back to the 1908s, with a gradual growth over
the years and a steeper increase during the 2000s. The interpretation of these
clusters is largely substantiated by comparing the clustering results to the topic
model.
These relatively detailed clusters are hierarchically clustered at the top level.
The largest cluster at the top level contains 20, 300 publications. It consists
mainly of a combination of clusters focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, among
which the largest cluster at the bottom level (Figure 8a). The second largest
cluster at the top level contains 13, 774 publications. It includes the third largest
cluster and some smaller clusters at the bottom level, with a clear molecular
biology focus (Figure 8b). The third largest cluster at the top level consists
almost entirely of the second largest cluster at the bottom level, combined with
a few smaller clusters. It has a focus on respiratory viruses. The three largest
clusters at the top level cover 43% of all publications.
We conclude this section by connecting our citation-based clustering results
with our text-based topic modelling results. We use topic intensity to further
qualify the results of the citation network clustering. More specifically, we characterise clusters by the average topic intensity of the publications they contain.
We start with the top level clustering, and focus on the two largest clusters. The
average topic intensities (Figure A.6) confirm that the first cluster contains publications focused on coronavirus outbreaks (COVID-19 in particular), including
public health and clinical medicine research. The second cluster, on the other
hand, has a clear molecular biology and immunology focus. Next, we consider

the six largest clusters in the bottom level clustering (Figure A.7). While the
third and sixth clusters are focused on molecular biology and immunology, the
first, second and fourth are mainly concerned with coronavirus outbreaks, and
the fifth covers clinical medicine.
Our citation-based results substantiate our earlier findings based on textual
analyses. Both point to the existence of distinct research areas covered by
CORD-19: coronaviruses, molecular biology research on viruses, public health
and epidemics and other related topics (immunology, clinical medicine). These
areas of research are interrelated, yet also contain specialised information, and
they show different temporal trends.

Altmetrics
CORD-19 publications have also been explored using Altmetric data, with the
aim of describing their reception on social media, paying special attention to
the dissemination of the publications across various social media sources. As
can be seen in Table 1, a total of 88, 570 publications in the CORD-19 dataset
(63%) have received some mention in Altmetric. This is a rather high coverage
of publications compared to previous studies [17], which reported an overall coverage of 21.5% of 2012 publications on Twitter, and about 31% for publications
in the biomedical and health sciences. This high coverage is even higher when
the focus is on the most recent publications (i.e., those published in the early
months of 2020), of which over 68% have received some social media mention
covered by Altmetric.
Table 2 presents a more detailed description of the type of social media events

around CORD-19 publications. We selected some of the most relevant sources
covered by Altmetric, namely Twitter, blogs, recommendations in F1000Prime,
news media mentions, citations in policy documents and citations in Wikipedia
entries. Clearly, the most important source is Twitter, which by far accounts
for the largest share of all (social) media interactions analysed. The second
most important source are mentions in news media and blogs. The observation
that there are more mentions in news media than in blogs also contrasts with
previous studies [17]. This may signal the particular relevance of CORD-19
publications for mainstream news media. Another noteworthy characteristic is
the recency of the publications being mentioned, particularly on Twitter and
in news media. About 87% of all Twitter mentions relate to publications from
2020, and 75% of all mentions in mainstream news media also relate to 2020
publications.

Table 3 shows the main altmetrics per publication type. All CORD-19
publications with Altmetric data were matched with publications in the WoS
database. In this way, a publication type was obtained for 82, 083 publications.
The publication type classification of the WoS database was used because WoS
offers a more detailed classification than databases such as Dimensions and Microsoft Academic [35].
While most publications in CORD-19 are classified as article (70%) or review article (14%), it turns out that editorials, letters and news items receive
a disproportionate amount of attention on social and online media. As a reference, we also show the proportion of Wikipedia citations per publication type,
where most attention turns out to be given to review articles. These findings
are in line with previous work [17]. Since editorials, letters and news items usually present news, debates, and opinions, often using a less technical language
than regular articles, it is not surprising that they are more appealing for social
media. However, in CORD-19, these three publication types receive many more
tweets (44% of all tweets) than what was previously found (below 20%) [17].

Figure 9 presents term maps showing the altmetrics reception of CORD19 publications. We cover the most immediate social media sources (or ‘fast’
sources [14]), which provide the earliest signals of the reception of publications.
Twitter, blogs and news media all present a similar pattern, with a strong orientation towards the most recent COVID-19 publications, well captured by the
largest cluster in both the bottom level and the top level citation network clustering (see Figures 7a and 8a). In terms of topics, terms such as ‘pandemic’,
‘hospital’, ‘hospitalization’ are among the most common terms used in publications mentioned in these social media platforms. These results are in line with
those discussed in [15].
This preliminary altmetric analysis shows a strong present-day attention for
research covered by the CORD-19 dataset. The majority of the tweets, blogs
and news media mentions are focused on research produced during the current
COVID-19 pandemic. The publication types that, in relative terms, receive
most attention are editorials, letters and news items. This demonstrates the
important role of social media, especially Twitter, in discussing COVID-19 research [22]. During a global pandemic like COVID-19, research is subject to high
degrees of uncertainty [13, 36]. Rapidly increasing levels of social media activity
around topics on which there is little academic consensus may increase the risk
of scientific advise being misunderstood or misused by substantial segments of
society. Social media analysis can provide tools for identifying and characterising areas with high levels of social media activity that may be in dissonance
with the academic discourse. In future work, we plan to find and characterise
these areas of discrepancy in order to inform scientists, science communicators,
journalists and the public at large.

Conclusion
We performed an in-depth analysis of the CORD-19 dataset of publications
on COVID-19 and coronavirus research [38]. Our analysis of the delineation
of CORD-19 indicates that the dataset is broader than just COVID-19 and
coronavirus research. On the other hand, when compared to the Web of Science
database, it turns out that CORD-19 largely covers all literature directly focused
on COVID-19 and coronaviruses.
We carried out a deeper analyses of CORD-19 in various ways. We created
a map of relevant terms extracted from the titles and abstracts of COVID-19

publications. This map confirmed the broad content of the dataset. A topic
modelling analysis showed that CORD-19 publications are related to biomedical research on viruses in a broad sense, which includes research on COVID-19
and coronaviruses. Dominant topics in CORD-19 also include research on public health and epidemics; molecular biology; other coronaviruses; influenza and
other families of viruses; immunology and antivirals; methodology (testing, diagnosing, trials). Furthermore, the topic intensity over time is far from uniform.
Coronavirus research has followed known outbreaks (SARS, MERS, COVID-19)
and for years before 2020 this research represents only a small portion of CORD19.
We performed a citation network clustering analysis using data from Dimensions. Citation network clusters highlighted the relative cohesiveness of
CORD-19. In line with the textual analyses, the clusters confirmed the broad
coverage of the dataset. Overall, there seem to be two prominent citation clusters: one, more recent, that covers research on specific coronaviruses, with a
public health and epidemiological focus, and another one, with a longer time
span, focused on molecular biology. Molecular biology research on viruses is, in
general, a prominent component of CORD-19. It is likely that, as research on
COVID-19 rapidly expands, these themes will broaden as well.
Lastly, we considered Altmetric data, in order to gauge how much attention
CORD-19 research has attracted over time. The current COVID-19 outbreak
dominates attention on social media, in particular from Twitter, highlighting
the interest for scientific results during the COVID-19 pandemic. Editorials and
letters in CORD-19 get a disproportionate amount of attention on social media.
Our work acknowledges that research on viruses, and coronaviruses specifically, does not exist in a vacuum. Delimiting research on a certain subject
matter requires difficult choices that inevitably involve a certain degree of arbitrariness. We praise the breadth and relative coherence of CORD-19. This
dataset rightly merits attention and is useful to allow many researchers to engage with the topic. Nevertheless, we also suggest that critical awareness is
required when using CORD-19, as our results demonstrate that its contents
cover a broad set of topics. Different subsets of CORD-19 should be used for
specific purposes, for example for making historical analyses on funding of specific research topics or for automatically extracting structured information. We
exemplified some approaches to segment CORD-19 in various ways.
Clearly, there are many areas for future COVID-19 work by the scientometric community. We conclude by suggesting three areas in particular. Firstly,
there seems to be a need for a comprehensive and ongoing mapping of COVID19-related research. A multidisciplinary map of COVID-19-related research,
considering diverse disciplinary perspectives and information needs, will be useful to surface relevant research, also outside the biomedical domain. Secondly,
CORD-19 provides a virtuous example of open data sharing. The scientometric
community can contribute by creating and maintaining additional datasets on
COVID-19 research. Thirdly, as shown by our results, there is a lot of social
media attention for COVID-19 research. Indeed, the role of information, and
especially reliable scientific information, has been central to the unfolding of

the current pandemic [41]. Consequently, a relevant area for future work is to
better understand the mechanics of online scientific information diffusion, using
altmetrics and other data sources. This line of work has the potential to provide
valuable information to experts and governments during the current and future
pandemics.
