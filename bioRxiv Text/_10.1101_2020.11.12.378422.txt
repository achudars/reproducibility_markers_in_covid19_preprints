The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is creating tremendous health
problems and economical challenges for mankind. To date, no effective drug is available to

directly treat the disease and prevent virus spreading. In a search for a drug against COVID19, we have performed a massive X-ray crystallographic screen of two repurposing drug
libraries against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is essential for the virus
95

replication and, thus, a potent drug target. In contrast to commonly applied X-ray fragment
screening experiments with molecules of low complexity, our screen tested already approved
drugs and drugs in clinical trials. From the three-dimensional protein structures, we identified
37 compounds binding to Mpro. In subsequent cell-based viral reduction assays, one
peptidomimetic and five non-peptidic compounds showed antiviral activity at non-toxic

100

concentrations. We identified two allosteric binding sites representing attractive targets for
drug development against SARS-CoV-2.

Main Text:
Infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is critically governed by the complex interplay of
105

several molecular factors of both the host and the virus(1, 2). Coronaviruses are RNA-viruses
with a genome of approximately 30,000 nucleotides. The viral open-reading frames, essential
for replication of the virus, are expressed as two overlapping large polyproteins, which must
be separated into functional subunits for replication and transcription activity(1). This
proteolytic cleavage, which is vital for viral reproduction, is primarily accomplished by the

110

main protease (Mpro), also known as 3C-like protease 3CLpro or nsp5. Mpro cleaves the viral
polyprotein pp1ab at eleven distinct sites. The core cleavage motif is LeuGln↓(Ser/Ala/Gly)(1). Mpro possesses a chymotrypsin-like fold appended with a C-terminal
helical domain, and harbors a catalytic dyad comprised of Cys145 and His41(1). The active
site is located in a cleft between the two N-terminal domains of the three-domain structure of

115

the monomer, while the C-terminal helical domain is involved in regulation and dimerization
of the enzyme, with a dissociation constant of ~2.5 µM(1). Due to its central and vital

involvement in virus replication, Mpro is recognized as a prime target for antiviral drug
discovery and compound screening activities aiming to identify and optimize drugs which
can tackle coronavirus infections(3). Indeed, a number of recent publications confirm the
120

potential of targeting Mpro for inhibition of virus replication(1, 2).
A rational approach to the identification of new drugs is structure-based drug design(4, 5).
The first step is target selection followed by biochemical and biophysical characterization and
its structure determination. This knowledge forms the basis for subsequent in silico screening
of up to millions of potential drug molecules, leading to the identification of potentially

125

binding compounds. The most promising candidates are then subjected to screening in vitro
for biological activity. Lead structures are derived from common structural features of these
biologically active compounds. Further chemical modifications of lead structures can then
create a drug candidate that can be tested in animal models and, finally, clinical trials.
In order to speed up this process and find drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2, we

130

performed a massive X-ray crystallographic screen of the virus’ main protease against two
repurposing libraries containing in total 5953 unique compounds from the “Fraunhofer IME
Repurposing Collection”(6) and the “Safe-in-man” library from Dompé Farmaceutici S.p.A.
Analysis of the derived electron-density maps revealed 37 structures with bound compounds.
Further validation by native mass spectrometry and viral reduction assays led to the

135

identification of six of those compounds showing significant in vitro antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2, including inhibitors binding at allosteric sites.
In contrast to crystallographic fragment-screening experiments that use small molecules of
low molecular weight typically below 200 Da, the repurposing libraries are chemically more
complex and contain compounds twice the molecular weight (Fig. 1A) and thus likely to bind

140

more specifically and with higher affinity(7). Due to the higher molecular weights, we

performed co-crystallization experiments instead of compound soaking into native
crystals(8). Crystals were grown at a physiological pH-value of 7.5.
X-ray data collection was performed at beamlines P11, P13 and P14 at the PETRA III storage
ring at DESY. In total, datasets from 6288 crystals were collected over a period of four
145

weeks. From the 5953 unique compounds in our screen, we obtained 3089 high-quality
diffraction datasets to a resolution better than 2.5 Å. Datasets from 1152 compounds were
suitable for subsequent automated structure refinement followed by cluster analysis(9) and
pan dataset density analysis (PanDDA)(10). In total, 43 compounds were found that bound to
Mpro. Seven of these compounds had maleate as a counterion and in these structures maleate

150

was found in the active site but not the compounds themselves, resulting in 37 unique
binders. A summary of these, together with additional experimental information, is provided
in tables S1 and S2. The binding mode could be unambiguously determined for 29 molecules.
The majority of hits were found in the active site of the enzyme. Six of 16 active-site binders
covalently bind as thioethers to Cys145, one compound binds covalently as a thiohemiacetal

155

to Cys145, one is coordinated through a zinc ion and eight bind non-covalently. The
remaining 13 compounds bind outside the active site at various locations (Fig. 1B).
Out of the 43 hits from our X-ray screen, 39 compounds were tested for their antiviral
activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell assays. Ten compounds reduced viral RNA replication
by at least two orders of magnitude in Vero E6 cells (Fig. S1). Further evaluation to

160

determine the effective concentrations that reduced not only vRNA but also SARS-CoV-2
infectious particles by 50% (EC50) (Fig. 2) showed that six compounds exhibit either
selectivity indexes (SI = CC50 / EC50) greater than five or hundredfold viral reduction with no
cytotoxicity in the tested concentration range (table S3).

In the following we focus on a more detailed description of the most relevant compounds.
165

The compounds are grouped according to their different binding sites. All other compounds
are described in more detail in the supplementary text.
Tolperisone, HEAT and isofloxythepin bind covalently to the active site. Tolperisone is
antivirally active (EC50 = 19.17 µM) and shows no cytotoxicity at 100 µM (Fig. 2), whereas
HEAT and isofloxythepin show activity but unfavorable cytotoxicity. For all three

170

compounds only breakdown products are observed in the active site. Tolperisone and HEAT
are β-ketoamines, but we only observe the part of the drug containing the activating ketone,
while the remaining part with the amine group is missing in the electron-density maps. The
breakdown product of the parent drug is observed to bind as Michael-acceptor to the thiol of
Cys145. Similarly, the aromatic ring system of both tolperisone (Fig. 3A) and HEAT (Fig.

175

3B) protrudes into the S1 pocket and forms van der Waals contacts with the backbone of
Phe140 and Leu141 and the side chain of Glu166. In addition, the keto group accepts a
hydrogen bond from the imidazole side chain of His163. Tolperisone and HEAT bind
exclusively in the (S)-configuration. Interestingly, for HEAT, this binding mode was
confirmed independently by mass spectrometry (Fig. S2 and table S3). A similar observation

180

has been reported for binding of β-ketoamines to type-1 methionine aminopeptidases, where
the parent compound decomposes into an amine and an α,β-unsaturated ketone which
subsequently binds to the thiol of the catalytic cysteine(11). This is a typical situation for a
pro-drug(12). Tolperisone is in use as a skeletal muscle relaxant(13). Isofloxythepin binds
similarly as a fragment to Cys145 (Fig. 3C).

185

Triglycidyl isocyanurate shows antiviral activity and adopts a covalent and non-covalent
binding mode to the Mpro active site. In both modes, the compound’s central ring sits on top
of the catalytic dyad (His41, Cys145) and its three epoxypropyl substituents reach into
subsites S1’, S1 and S2. The non-covalent binding mode is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to

the main chain of Gly143 and Gly166, and to the side chain of His163. In the covalently
190

bound form, one oxirane ring is opened by nucleophilic attack of Cys145 forming a thioether
(Fig. 3D). The use of epoxides as warheads for inhibition of Mpro offers another avenue for
covalent inhibitors, whereas epoxysuccinyl warheads have been extensively used in
biochemistry, cell biology and later in clinical studies(14). Triglycidyl isocyanurate
(teroxirone, Henkel’s agent) has been tested as antitumor agent(15).

195

Calpeptin shows the highest antiviral activity in the screen, with an EC50 value in the lower
µM range. It binds covalently via its aldehyde group to Cys145, forming a thiohemiacetal.
This peptidomimetic inhibitor occupies substrate pockets S1 to S3, highly similar to inhibitor
GC-376(16, 17), calpain inhibitors(18) and other peptidomimetic inhibitors such as N3(2)
and the α-ketoamide 13b(1). The peptidomimetic backbone forms hydrogen bonds to the

200

main chain of His164 and Glu166, whereas the norleucine side chain is in van der Waals
contacts with the backbone of Phe140, Leu141 and Asn142 (Fig. 3E). Calpeptin has known
activity against SARS-CoV-2(16). The structure is highly similar to leupeptin, which served
as positive control in our screen (Fig. S3B). In silico docking experiments verified the
peptidomimetic compound Calpeptin as a likely Mpro binding molecule (table S4).

205

MUT056399 is an active-site binding compound without a covalent bond to Cys145 and
reduced viral replication. The diphenyl ether core of MUT056399 blocks access to the
catalytic site consisting of Cys145 and His41. The terminal carboxamide group occupies
pocket S1 and forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain of His163 and the backbone of Phe140
(Fig. 3F). The other part of the molecule reaches deep into pocket S2, which is enlarged by a

210

shift of the side chain of Met49 out of the substrate binding pocket. MUT056399 was
developed as an antibacterial agent against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
strains(19).

In general, the enzymatic activity of Mpro relies on the architecture of the active site, which
critically depends on the dimerization of the enzyme and the correct orientation of the
215

subdomains to each other. In addition to the active site, as the most obvious target for drug
development, we discovered two allosteric binding sites of Mpro which have previously not
been reported.
Five compounds of our X-ray screen bind in a hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal
dimerization domain (Fig. 4A-C), located close to the oxyanion hole in pocket S1 of the

220

substrate-binding site. Two of these show antiviral activity in combination with low
cytotoxicity (Fig. 2). Another compound with slightly lower antiviral activity binds in
between the catalytic and dimerization domains of Mpro.
Central to the first allosteric binding site is a hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile213, Leu253,
Gln256, Val297 and Cys300 within the C-terminal dimerization domain (Fig. 4B). Pelitinib,

225

ifenprodil, RS-102895, PD-168568 and tofogliflozin all employ this site by inserting an
aromatic moiety into this pocket.
Pelitinib shows the second highest antiviral activity in our screen, with an EC50 value of 1.25
µM. Its halogenated benzene ring binds to the hydrophobic groove (Fig. 4B). The central 3cyanoquinoline moiety interacts with the end of the C-terminal helix (Ser301). The ethyl

230

ether substituent pushes against Tyr118 and Asn142 (from loop 141-144 of the S1 pocket) of
the opposing protomer within the native dimer. Previous work on Mpro of SARS-CoV
demonstrated that the integrity of this pocket is crucial for enzyme activity(20). Pelitinib is
known as an amine-catalyzed Michael acceptor(21), developed to bind to a cysteine in the
active site of a tyrosine kinase. But from its observed binding position it is impossible for it to

235

reach into the active site and no evidence for covalent binding to Cys145 is found in the
electron-density maps. Pelitinib is an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor
and developed as an anticancer agent(22).

Ifenprodil, RS-102895 and PD-168568 all exhibit an elongated structure, consisting of two
aromatic ring systems separated by a linker containing a piperidine or piperazine ring (Fig
240

4C). All three compounds have a distance of at least 12 Å between the terminal aromatic
rings. Thus, this binding mode is unlikely to be identified through fragment screening. The
hydrophobic pocket in the helical domain is covered by the side chain of Gln256. In our
complex structures, this side chain adopts a different conformation. One of the terminal
aromatic ring systems is inserted into the hydrophobic groove in the dimerization domain.

245

The linker moiety stretches across the native dimer interface and the second aromatic ring is
positioned close to Asn142, adjacent to the active site loop where residues 141-144 contribute
to the pocket S1. In particular, in the case of RS-102895, two hydrogen bonds are formed to
the side and main chains of Asn142. In contrast to ifenprodil, RS-102895 and PD-168568 do
not exhibit selective antiviral activity (SI<5). All three compounds are GPCR antagonists.

250

Ifenprodil antagonizes N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors(23), RS-102895 inhibits C-C
chemokine receptor 2(24), and PD-168568 dopamine-receptors(25). Of note, ifenprodil is
currently in phase IIb/III clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the
observation that it reduces mortality of lethal infection of H5N1 influenza in mice, likely
through reduced inflammatory cytokine expression(26). Our crystal structure and antiviral

255

tests suggest an additional mode of action beyond this anti-inflammatory effect.
The second allosteric site is formed by the deep groove between the catalytic domains and the
dimerization domain (Fig. 4A and D). AT7519 is the only compound in our screen that we
identified bound to this site. The chlorinated benzene ring is engaged in various van der
Waals interactions to loop 107-110, Val202, and Pro293 (Fig. 4E). The central pyrazole has

260

van der Waals contacts to Ile249, Phe294 and its adjacent carbonyl group forms a hydrogen
bond to the side chain of Gln110. The terminal piperidine forms hydrogen bonds to the
carboxylate of Asp153. This results in a displacement of loop 153-155, slightly narrowing the

binding groove. The Cα-atom of Tyr154 moves by 2.8 Å, accompanied by a conformational
change of Asp153. This allows hydrogen bonding to the compound and the formation of a
265

salt-bridge to Arg298. In turn, Arg298 is crucial for dimerization(27). The mutation
Arg298Ala causes a reorientation of the dimerization domain relative to catalytic domain,
leading to changes in the oxyanion hole and destabilization of the S1 pocket by the Nterminus. AT7519 was evaluated for treatment of human cancers(28) and shows weak
antiviral activity but a poor selectivity index against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2).

270

Our X-ray screen revealed six compounds with previously unreported antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV-2. Two of them, calpeptin and pelitinib, show strong antiviral activity
combined with low cytotoxicity and are suitable for preclinical evaluation. The remaining
compounds are valuable lead structures for further drug development. A general advantage of
275

using drug-repurposing libraries for such a screening is the proven bioactivity of the
compounds and key properties such as cell-permeability are usually known(29).
The most active compound, calpeptin binds in the active site in the same way as other
members of the large class of peptide-based inhibitors that bind as thiohemi-acetals or -ketals
to Mpro (30). However, in addition to this peptidomimetic inhibitor, we discovered several

280

non-peptidic inhibitors. Those compounds binding to the active site of Mpro contained new
Michael acceptors based on β-ketoamines (tolperisone and HEAT). These lead to the
formation of thioethers and have not previously been described as prodrugs for viral
proteases. We also identified a non-covalent binder, MUT056399, blocking the active site.
Besides this common orthosteric inhibition, we discovered compounds that inhibit the

285

enzyme through binding at two previously unreported allosteric sites of Mpro.

The first allosteric site (dimerization domain) is in direct vicinity of the S1 pocket of the
adjacent monomer within the native dimer. The potential for antiviral inhibition through this
site is demonstrated by ifenprodil and pelitinib. A comparison of coronavirus Mpro sequences
shows that the compound binding residues of this allosteric site are conserved (Fig. S4).
290

Consequently, potential drugs targeting this allosteric binding site can be assumed to be
robust against mutational variations and might also be effective against other coronaviruses.
The potential of the second allosteric site, connecting the dimerization and catalytic domain,
as a druggable target is demonstrated by the observed weak antiviral activity of AT7519.
Recently, the potential of allosteric inhibition of Mpro through modulation of its dimerization

295

has been demonstrated by mass spectrometry(31).

Materials and Methods

Protein production and purification
The protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified for subsequent crystallization
according to previously published protocols and plasmid constructs(1). Lysis was carried out
in 20 mM HEPES buffer supplemented with 150 mM NaCl using ultrasound for cell
disruption. After separation of the cell fragments and the dissolved protein, a subsequent

305

nickel NTA column was used to extract the Mpro-histidine-tag fusion. The cleavage of the
histidine tag was achieved by a 3C protease during an overnight dialysis step. The histidine
tag and the 3C protease were removed using a nickel NTA column, and as a final step a gel
filtration was performed with an S200 Superdex column.

Co-crystallization with the compounds was achieved mixing 0.23 μL of protein solution (6.25

mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl with 0.22 μL of reservoir solution consisting of 100 mM
MIB, pH 7.5, containing 25% w/w PEG 1500 and 5% (v/v) DMSO, and 0.05 μL of a microseed crystal suspension using an Oryx4 pipetting robot (Douglas Instruments). This growth

315

solution was equilibrated by sitting drop vapor diffusion against 40 μL reservoir solution.
Prior to crystallization 125 nL droplets of 10 mM compound solutions from the two libraries
in DMSO were applied to the wells of SwissCI 96-well plates (2-well or 3-well low profile,
respectively) and subsequently dried in vacuum. Taking the crystallization drop volume into
account this resulted in a final compound concentration of 2.5 mM and a molar ratio of ~13.6

320

of compound to protein. To obtain well-diffracting crystals in a reproducible way microseeding was applied for crystal growth(32). Crystals appeared within a few hours and reached
their final size (~200×100×10 µm3) after 2 - 3 days. Crystals were manually harvested and
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent X-ray diffraction data collection. We aimed at
harvesting two crystals per crystallization condition as a compromise between through-put

325

and increasing the probability to collect data from well diffracting crystals.
Data collection
Data collection was performed at beamlines P11, P13 and P14 at the PETRA III storage ring
at DESY in Hamburg within a period of four weeks. Exclusive use of DESY beamline P11
was generously granted by the DESY directorate for the project.

Data processing and structure refinement
An automatic data processing and structure refinement pipeline “xia2pipe” as written
specifically to support this project. Raw diffraction images from the PETRA III beamlines
were processed using three crystallographic integration software packages: XDS(33),
autoPROC(34) followed by staraniso(35), and DIALS via xia2(36, 37). Diffraction data

quality indicators for all datasets and the 43 hits are summarized in Fig. S5. In total, 7857
unique crystals were harvested and frozen, of which 7258 were studied by X-ray diffraction
at PETRA-III. Of these, 5934 produced diffraction data consistent with a protein lattice and
were labeled as “successful” experiments. In some cases, multiple datasets were collected on
a single crystal, so in total 8304 diffraction experiments were conducted with 6831 successful

340

protein diffraction datasets obtained. As processed by DIALS, these 6831 datasets had an
average resolution of 2.12 Å (criterion: CC1/2 > 0.5), CC1/2 of 0.97, and Wilson B of 27.8
Å2 (Fig. S5). Crystallographic data of all structures submitted to the PDB are summarized in
table S2.
For clustering and hit identification, all datasets were integrated and merged to a resolution of

345

1.7 Å. In order to reduce the influence of noise for lower resolution datasets, the following
processing was applied to standardize the Wilson plot for each dataset: the datasets were split
into equally sized bins, each covering 1000 reflections, and a linear fit was applied to the
logarithm of the average intensities in each shell. The residual between the data and the
Wilson fit was calculated, considering sequentially one additional bin from low to high

350

resolution until the residual exceeded 10%, if applicable. The intensities in all higher
resolution bins beyond this point were scaled to fit the calculated Wilson B factor.
The results of each dataset were then automatically refined using Phenix(38). Refinement
began by choosing one of two manually refined starting models (differing in their unit cell,
table S2), selecting the starting model with the closest unit cell parameters, then proceeding

355

in four steps: (a) rigid body and ADP refinement, (b) simulated annealing, ADP, and
reciprocal space refinement, (c) real-space refinement, and (d) a final round of reciprocal
space refinement as well as TLS refinement, with each residue pre-set as a TLS group. This
procedure was hand-tuned on 5 test datasets; the procedure and parameters were manually
adjusted to minimize Rfree until deemed satisfactory for the continuation of the project. All

360

processing and refinement results were logged in a database, which enabled comparison
between methods and improvement over time. All code and parameters needed to reproduce
this pipeline are available online(39).
Hitfinding: cluster4x and PanDDA Analysis
The resulting model structure Cα positions were then ingested into cluster4x(40), which

365

briefly (a) computes a correlation coefficient between each structure over the position of all
Cα atoms, (b) performs PCA the resulting correlation matrix, (c) presents 3 chosen principal
components to a human, who then manually annotates clusters. Clusters were ordered
chronologically and separated into groups of 1500 and subsequently clustered into groups of
approximately 60-120 datasets based on a combination of reciprocal and Cα-atom differences

370

using cluster4x. In an earlier version of the software, structure factor amplitudes were used
for clustering instead of refined Cα positions, and both methods were applied for hitfinding.
The resulting clusters were then analyzed via PanDDA(10) using default parameters. The
resulting PanDDA analyses were manually inspected for hits which were recorded.
Manual structure refinement

375

Identified hits were further refined by alternating rounds of refinement using refmac(41),
phenix.refine(38) or MAIN(42), interspersed with manual model building in COOT(43).
In sillico screening of compound libraries
To enable a preselection of potentially promising compounds to support the experimental Xray screening effort and to get an idea about the most promising compounds, we pursued a

380

virtual screening workflow consisting of the selection of a representative ensemble of binding
site conformations, non-covalent molecular docking and rescoring. We performed this study
with 5,575 compounds of the Fraunhofer IME Repurposing Collection. UNICON(44) was
applied to prepare the library compounds. To consider binding site flexibility, we used
multiple receptor structures. We applied SIENA(45) to extract five representative binding site

385

conformations for the active site of Mpro. We chose the structures with the PDB IDs 5RFH,
5RFO, 6W63, 6Y2G and 6YB7 The SIENA-derived aligned structures were used and the
proteins were preprocessed using Protoss(46) to determine protonation states, tautomeric
forms, and hydrogen orientations. The binding site was defined based on the active site ligand
of the structure with the PDB ID 6Y2G (ligand ID O6K). A 12.5 Å radius of all ligand atoms

390

was chosen as binding site definition. The new docking and scoring method JAMDA was
applied with default settings for the five selected binding sites(47). Subsequently, HYDE(48)
was used for a rescoring of all predicted poses of the library compounds. The 200 highest
ranked compounds of all 5,575 compounds according to the HYDE score were extracted. For
70 of these compounds, well-diffracting crystals were obtained in the X-ray screening.

395

Intriguingly, only calpeptin, a known cysteine protease inhibitor, could be co-crystallized and
was found on rank 3 (table S5).
Mass Spectrometry
Mpro was prepared for native MS measurements by buffer-exchange into ESI compatible
solutions (250 μM, 300 mM NH4OAc, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) by five cycles of centrifugal

400

filtration (Vivaspin 500 columns, 30,000 MWCO, Sartorius). Inhibitors were dissolved to 1
mM in DMSO. Then Inhibitors and Mpro were mixed to final concentrations of 50 µM and 10
µM, respectively, and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. For putative covalent ligands, compounds
were incubated at 1 mM with 100 µM Mpro in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH
7.8, for 16 h prior to buffer exchange. Buffer exchange was carried out as described above

405

and samples were diluted tenfold prior to native MS measurements. All samples were
prepared in triplicate. Nano ESI capillaries were pulled in-house from borosilicate capillaries
(1.2 mm outer diameter, 0.68 mm inner diameter, filament, World Precision Instruments)
with a micropipette puller (P-1000, Sutter instruments) using a squared box filament (2.5 ×
2.5 mm2, Sutter Instruments) in a two-step program. Subsequently capillaries were gold-

coated using a sputter coater (CCU-010, safematic) with 5.0 × 10-2 mbar, 30.0 mA, 100 s, 3
runs to vacuum limit 3.0 × 10-2 mbar argon. Native MS was performed using an electrospray
quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) instrument (Q-TOF2, Micromass/Waters, MS
Vision) modified for higher masses(49). Samples were ionized in positive ion mode with
voltages of 1300 V applied at the capillary and of 130 V at the cone. The pressure in the

415

source region was kept at 10 mbar throughout all native MS experiments. For desolvation and
dissociation, the pressure in the collision cell was adjusted to 1.5 × 10-2 mbar argon. Nativelike spectra were obtained at an accelerating voltage of 30 V. To calibrate raw data, CsI (25
mg/ml) spectra were acquired. Calibration and data analysis were carried out with MassLynx
4.1 (Waters) software. In order to determine each inhibitor binding to Mpro, peak intensities of

420

zero, one or two bound ligands were analyzed from three independently recorded mass
spectra at 30 V acceleration voltage. Results are shown in table S4.
Antiviral assays

and fresh media containing the compounds (final DMSO concentration 0.5% (v/v)) was
added to the cells. Cell culture supernatant was harvest 42 hpi and stored at -80°C. Viral
RNA was purified from the cell culture supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(QIAGEN #52906) in accordance with the manufacturer´s instructions. Quantification of
vRNA was carried out by the interpolation of RT-qPCR (RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

Kit, Altona Diagnostics #821005) results onto a standard curve generated with serial dilutions
of a template of known concentration. Titers of infectious virus particles were measured via
immunofocus assay. Briefly, Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) seeded at 3.5 × 104 cells/well
in 96-well plates were inoculated with 50 µl of serial tenfold dilutions of cell culture
supernatant from treated cells. The inoculum was removed after 1 h and replaced by a 1.5%

445

methylcellulose-DMEM-5% FBS overlay. Following incubation for 24 h, cells were
inactivated and fixed with 4.5% formaldehyde. Infected cells were detected using an antibody
against SARS-CoV-2 NP (ThermoFischer, PA5-81794). Foci were counted using an AID
ELISpot reader from Mabtech. The cytotoxic concentrations that reduced cell growth by 50%
(CC50) and the effective concentrations that reduced infectious particles or vRNA by 50%

(EC50) were calculated by fitting the data to the sigmoidal function using GraphPad Prism
version 8.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.com).

Supplementary Text

In the following, we discuss those compounds that did not show significant antiviral activity
but for which we could determine the binding pose based on the crystal structures.

Active site, covalent

Isofloxythepin binds as breakdown product (Fig. 3C). Here, the piperazine group is not
460

found in the crystal structure but the dibenzothiepine moiety is observed in the active site,
bound as a thioether to Cys145. The tricyclic system stretches from the S1 across to the S1’
pocket. According to the electron-density maps, two orientations of the molecule are
possible, with either the fluorine or the isopropyl group placed inside the S1 pocket.
Degradation of the drug with piperazine as the leaving group has been previously

465

reported(50) and was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. S2). Isofloxythepin is an
antagonist of dopamine receptors D1 and D222 and has been tested as a neuroleptic in phase
II clinical trials.
Leupeptin is a well-known cysteine protease inhibitor and was therefore included in our
screening effort as a positive control(51). Structurally, it is highly similar to calpeptin. Indeed

470

this peptidomimetic inhibitor also forms a thiohemiacetal and occupies the substrate pocket,
much like calpeptin (Fig. S3B and 3E). The binding mode is identical to the recently released
room-temperature structure of Mpro with leupeptin (PDB-ID 6XCH).
Maleate was observed covalently bound in seven structures during hit finding. In all cases
maleate served as the counter ion of the applied compound. In these crystal structures the

475

maleate, rather than the applied compound, forms a thioether with the thiol of Cys145,
modifying it to succinyl-cysteine. The thiol of Cys145 undergoes a Michael-type nucleophilic
attack on the C2 of maleate. A similar adduct has been described for maleate isomerase(52)
as an intermediate structure in the isomerization reaction. The covalent adduct is further
stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the backbone amide of Gly143 and Cys145 to the

480

carboxylate group (C1) of succinate. The terminal carboxylate (C4) is positioned by
hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Asn142 and a water-bridged hydrogen bond to the side
chain of His163 (Fig. S3A).

TH-302 (Evofosfamide) is covalently linked to Cys145 through nucleophilic substitution of
the bromine, leading to thioether formation (Fig. S3C). The other bromine-alkane chain
485

occupies the S1 pocket while the nitro-imidazole stretches into pocket S2. The substitution of
chlorine or hydroxyl for bromines in TH-302 has been demonstrated in cell culture(53). Our
mass spectrometry analysis suggested the loss of a bromine atom (Fig. S2C).
Triglycidyl isocyanurate shows antiviral activity and adopts a covalent and non-covalent
two binding modes to the Mpro active site, one covalent and one non-covalent. In both modes,

490

the compound’s central ring sits on top of the catalytic dyad (His41, Cys145) and its three
epoxypropyl substituents reach into subsites S1’, S1 and S2. The non-covalent binding mode
is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the main chain of Gly143 and Gly166, and to the side
chain of His163. In the covalently bound form, one oxirane ring is opened by nucleophilic
attack of Cys145 forming a thioether (Fig. 3D). The use of epoxides as warheads for

495

inhibition of Mpro offers another avenue for covalent inhibitors, whereas epoxysuccinyl
warheads have been extensively used in biochemistry, cell biology and later in clinical
studies23. Triglycidyl isocyanurate (teroxirone, Henkel’s agent) has been tested as antitumor
agent24.
Zinc pyrithione was already demonstrated to have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-1

500

Mpro (54).The pyrithione chelates the Zn2+ ion which coordinates the thiolate and imidazole of
the catalytic dyad residues Cys145 and His41 (Fig. S3D). The remaining part of the
ionophore protrudes out of the active site. This tetrahedral binding mode of zinc has
previously been described for other zinc-coordinating compounds in complex with HCoV229E Mpro(55). Interestingly, antiviral effects against a range of corona- and non-

505

coronaviruses have already been ascribed to zinc pyrithione, although its effect had been
attributed to inhibition of RNA-dependent polymerase(56). Zinc pyrithione exhibits both
antifungal and antimicrobial properties and is known in treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

Active site, non-covalent
510

Adrafinil mainly binds mainly through van der Waals interactions to Mpro. In particular, its
two phenyl rings are inserted into pockets S1’ and S2 (Fig. S3E). A hydrogen bond is formed
between the backbone amide of Cys145 and the hydroxylamine group. The side chain of
Met49 is wedged between the two phenyl rings.
Fusidic acid interacts with Mpro mainly through hydrophobic interactions, especially through

515

the alkene chain within pocket S2 and the tetracyclic moiety packing against Ser46 (Fig.
S3F). Moreover, the carboxylate group forms indirect hydrogen bonds, mediated via two
water molecules, to the main chain of Thr26, Gly143 and Cys145. In addition, the same
carboxylate group forms a hydrogen bond to an imidazole molecule from the crystallization
conditions. This imidazole occupies pocket S1’ and mediates hydrogen bonds to the

520

backbone of His41 and Cys44. These indirect interactions offer opportunities for optimization
of compounds binding to Mpro. Fusidic acid is a well-known bacteriostatic compound, with a
steroid core structure.
LSN-2463359 binds mainly to Mpro by interaction of the pyridine ring with the S1 pocket
(Fig. S3G). Besides van der Waals interactions with the β-turn Phe140-Ser144, contributing

525

to the pocket, it also forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of His163.
SEN1269 binds only to the active site of one protomer in the native dimer. This causes a
break in the crystallographic symmetry, leading to a different crystallographic space group
(table S2). The central pyrazine ring forms a hydrogen bond to Gln189 (Fig. S3H). The
terminal dimethylaniline moiety sits deep in pocket S2 which is enlarged by an outwards

530

movement of the short α-helix Ser46-Leu50 by 1.7 Å (Ser46 Cα-atom) compared to the
native structure. This includes a complete reorientation of the side chain of Met49 which now
points outside of the S2 pocket. Additionally, the C-terminus of a crystallographic

neighboring Mpro protomer is trapped between SEN1269 and part of the S1 pocket, including
a hydrogen bond between Asn142 and the backbone amide of Phe305 and Gln306 of the C535

terminus.
Tretazicar binds at the active site entrance at pocket S3/S4 (Fig. S3I). The amide group
forms hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of Glu166, the adjacent nitro group forms
hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Gln192 and the backbone amide of Thr190.
UNC2327 binds to active site of Mpro by stacking its benzothiadiazole ring against the loop

540

Glu166-Pro168 that forms the shallow pocket S3 (Fig. S3J). This is stabilized by a hydrogen
bond between the benzothiadiazole and the main chain carbonyl of Glu166. The piperine ring
and adjacent carbonyl are inserted into pocket S1' and interact with Thr25 and His41.

Covalent binder to Cys156
545

Aurothioglucose
In the crystal structure of the aurothioglucose complex, the strong nucleophile Cys145
becomes oxidized to a sulfinic acid. The initial reaction is the disproportionation of
Aurothioglucose into Au(0) and a disulfide dimer of thioglucose. This is followed by a
cascade of redox reactions of thioglucose, its disulfide and sulfenic acid. A disulfide linkage

550

to thioglucose is only observed at Cys156 on the surface of Mpro (Fig. S3K). Here the
thioglucose moiety is located between Lys100 and Lys102.
Glutathione isopropyl ester binds to the surface-exposed Cys156 via a disulfide linkage
(Fig. S3L). Additionally, the ester forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Tyr101,
while the amine of the other arm of the molecule is interacting with the side chain amine of

555

Lys102.

Surface pockets

AR-42 binds with its phenyl ring to a small hydrophobic pocket in the dimerization domain
formed by residues Gly275, Met276, Leu286 and Leu287 (Fig. S3M). Additionally, the
560

central amide forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Leu272.
AZD6482 binds to a pocket on the back of the catalytic domain, away from the native dimer
interface (Fig. S3N). The nitrobenzene ring is inserted in a pocket formed by His80, Lys88,
Leu89 and Lys90. The central aromatic system and morpholine ring lie flat on the surface of
Mpro. Furthermore, Asn63 forms a hydrogen bond to the keto-group in the pyrimidine ring.

565

Climbazole binds in a shallow surface pocket, wedged between two crystallographic
symmetry-related molecules (Fig. S3O). Only van der Waals interactions are observed. One
monomer contributes with residues Phe103, Val104, Arg105 and Glu178 to this binding site,
while the other monomer contributes Asn228, Asn231, Leu232, Met235 and Pro241.
Clonidine also sits in between two crystallographic, symmetry-related molecules and binds

570

through van der Waals interactions (Fig. S3P). Here one protomer mainly forms the binding
site, by contributing Asp33, Aps34 and Ala94. The other protomer contributes Lys236,
Tyr237 and Asn238. The amine ring of clonidine forms a loose ring stacking interaction to
Tyr237, while a hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of Lys236 and the ring
connecting amine of clonidine is formed. The side chain of Lys236 is flipped to the side to

575

make room for the chlorine containing ring system.
Ipidacrine is in contact with two different Mpro protomers (Fig. S3Q). The tricylic ring
system is packed against a surface loop, including residues Pro96 and Lys97 as well as
Lys12. It also interacts with the end of an α-helix including residues Gln273, Asn274 and
Gly275.

580

Tegafur binds to a in a shallow surface pocket generated by residues Asp33, Pro99, Lys100
and Tyr101. The main interaction is through π-stacking of the aromatic ring of Tyr223. The
side chain of Lys100 flips away and generates space for the compound (Fig. S3R).

Allosteric site I
585

Tofogliflozin binds to the same hydrophobic pocket as pelitinib, ifenprodil, RS-102895, and
PD-168568 but no antiviral activity was observed at 100 µM, the highest concentration
tested. In contrast to the previous four compounds, it does not reach across to the opposing
protomer in the native dimer. Its main interaction with Mpro is via its isobenzofuran moiety
that occupies the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. S3S).
