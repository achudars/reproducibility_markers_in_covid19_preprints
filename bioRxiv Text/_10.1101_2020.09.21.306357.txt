Abstract

17

Less than a year after its emergence, the severe acute respiratory syndrome

18

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 22 million people worldwide with a

19

death toll approaching 1 million. Vaccination remains the best hope to ultimately put

20

this pandemic to an end. Here, using Trimer-Tag technology, we produced both wild-

21

type (WT) and furin site mutant (MT) S-Trimers for COVID-19 vaccine studies. Cryo-

22

EM structures of the WT and MT S-Trimers, determined at 3.2 Å and 2.6 Å

23

respectively, revealed that both antigens adopt a tightly closed conformation and

24

their structures are essentially identical to that of the previously solved full-length WT

25

S protein in detergent. These results validate Trimer-Tag as a platform technology in

26

production of metastable WT S-Trimer as a candidate for COVID-19 subunit vaccine.

29

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has led to a global pandemic and has

30

disrupted lives and global economies on a scale unseen in recent human history.

31

This is not the first time when a new coronavirus has posted as a major threat to

32

public health; both SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)

33

caused human infections within past 17 years (1). The fact that no licensed vaccines

34

have ever been approved for these highly similar viruses is a reminder for the great

35

challenges we face when hundreds of companies and institutions worldwide rush to

36

develop COVID-19 vaccines with multiple strategies (2).

37

A successful vaccine that could truly impact the course of this ongoing COVID-19

38

pandemic has to have four key characteristics: safety, efficacy, scalability (to billions

39

of doses to meet global demand), and speed. Although protein subunit vaccines have

40

excellent track records for the first three requirements, exemplified by the highly

41

successful vaccine Gardasil used to prevent HPV infections (3) and Shingrix vaccine

42

for containing herpes zoster virus infections (4), subunit vaccine development can

43

take years to decades to complete. Many of the difficulties reside in the

44

manufacturing processes that have to ensure a fully native-like antigen structure is

45

retained, starting from subunit vaccine designs. Similar to other enveloped RNA

46

viruses such as HIV, RSV and influenza, coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 also

47

use a ubiquitous trimeric viral surface antigen (Spike protein) to gain entry into host

48

cells. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this occurs via binding to ACE2 receptor

49

expressed in target cells (5). Approaches for using a non-covalent trimer-foldon from

50

bacterial phage GCN4 protein to stabilize the trimer conformation while

51

simultaneously introducing mutations in viral antigens to abolish furin cleavage and

52

stabilize the antigen in pre-fusion forms (6, 7) are common strategies inherited from

53

decades of HIV and RSV vaccine studies, but these have yet to yield a successful

54

vaccine.

55
56

Using Trimer-Tag technology (8), we produced both soluble wild-type (WT) and a

57

furin site mutant (MT) (R685A) forms of S-Trimer from CHO cells in serum-free fed-

58

batch processes in bioreactors with protein yield ranging from 0.5 -1 g/L (fig. S1A).

59

These antigen titers are three orders of magnitude higher than that reported

60

previously for foldon derived S proteins with two Pro mutations (S-2P) (6,7), laying a

61

solid foundation for scalability requirement of a successful COVID-19 vaccine. Both

62

S-Trimers consist of the ectodomain (amino acid residues 1-1211) of SARS-CoV-2

63

Spike protein fused in-frame to the C-terminal region of human type I () collagen,

64

which spontaneously form a disulfide-bond linked homo-trimer, thereby stabilizing the

65

antigens in trimeric forms (Fig.1A-B). Using a tailored affinity purification scheme that

66

employs a collagen receptor Endo180-Fc fusion protein that binds to the Trimer-Tag

67

with high affinity, the secreted S-Trimers were purified to near homogeneity in a

68

single step (see accompanying paper). Reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified

69

S-Trimers revealed that the WT S-Trimer was metastable and partially cleaved

70

precisely at S1/S2 boundary by furin, while a single point mutation (R685A) in MT S-

71

Trimer fully abolished the protease cleavage (Fig.1C). WT spike proteins from live

72

SARS-CoV-2 (9) or recombinant full-length S (10) were all previously shown to be

73

partially cleaved apparently at S1/S2 boundary by furin proteases. In contrast, an S-

74

Trimer derived from wild-type SARS-CoV-1 S-protein produced in the same manner

75

was essentially uncleaved by furin protease, like the MT S-Trimer from SARS-CoV-2

76

(Fig.1C). Receptor binding studies using ForteBio BioLayer interferometry showed

77

that all three S-Trimers had similar high affinity to ACE2-Fc with 1.2 nM (fig. S1B),

78

similar to previous reports using purified S-2P protein (5). Furthermore, our finding of

79

SARS-CoV-1 S-Trimer having a similar, if not higher affinity to ACE2-Fc than that of

80

SARS-CoV-2, seems to be contradictory to the hypothesis that the difference in

81

virulence between the two viral strains stems from difference in their receptor binding

82

affinities (5). Instead, our finding supports that the much higher infectivity of SARS-

83

CoV-2 is more likely attributed to furin cleavage of the spike protein that is largely

84

absent in that of SARS-CoV-1 and other earlier stains of coronaviruses (11).

85
86

Negative staining electron microscopy (EM) analysis of the MT S-Trimer revealed

87

homogeneous particles consistent with trimeric spike proteins connected to the

88

Trimer-Tag (Fig. 1D). Particles with similar structural features have also been

89

observed by negative-stain EM for WT S-Trimer (see accompanying paper).

90
91

To further investigate structural details of these vaccine candidates, we first sought to

92

determine the cryo-EM structure of the MT S-Trimer which is more tractable for

93

structural determination. While the particles showed preferred top-view orientation

94

when embedded in ice, they preferentially adopted side view orientation on graphene

95

oxide-coated grids (fig. S2). Combination of the two datasets enabled us to obtain a

96

structure at 2.6 Å resolution (Fig. 2A and fig. S3). Due to the high resolution, the EM

97

density for side chains was clear and water molecules could be observed in the

98

structure (fig. S3D-3H and Table S1). In addition to all the glycosylation sites and

99

disulfide bonds previously observed in the S-2P structure (PDBID: 6VXX), the

100

disulfide bond between Cys15 and Cys136 and the N-linked glycan at Asn17, both in

101

the NTD domains, were well resolved in our structure (fig. S4 and Table S2). The

102

Trimer-Tag was invisible in our structure due to highly flexible nature of the linker

103

between the soluble S and the C-prodomain of collagen.

104

without imposing three-fold symmetry (C3), we found that all three RBD domains in

105

our map adopt a closed conformation (RBD down) without any open conformation

106

(RBD up) that was previously observed in the S-2P structure (6). Moreover, when the

107

S2 domains were aligned, three S1 domains shift toward the three-fold axis

108

compared to that in the S-2P structure, forming a tightly closed trimer (fig. S5).

109

Surprisingly, we observed unaccounted for EM density in both the NTD and RBD

110

region of the S1 domain. The presence of polysorbate 80 (PS80) during the

111

purification process suggested that the bulky EM density in the NTD region could be

112

accounted for by PS80 (fig. S3E). The EM density in the RBD region is elongated

113

and in close proximity to R408, we speculate it may be oleic acid or linoleic acid

114

which is present in the culture medium (fig. S3F). Indeed, PS80 and oleic acid could

115

be well fitted into the density of the NTD domain and the RBD domain, respectively,

116

owing to the excellent quality of EM map (Fig. 2A and fig. S3D-3F). Mass

117

spectrometry analysis further confirmed their identities (fig. S6). Interestingly, instead

After 3D classification

118

of oleic acid seen in our structure, linoleic acid as well as PS80 were also observed

119

in the recently published structure of a full-length mutant S protein (3Q-2P-FL)

120

produced from insect cells (7). PS80 is buried deeply in the hydrophobic pocket

121

residues with a few hydrophilic residues including N99, N121, R190 and H207

122

making hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of the PS80 (Fig. 2B). Notably, PS80

123

engages hydrophobic interactions with F175 and M177 which are invisible in the S-

124

2P structure (Fig. 2C). Since no small molecule was shown to bind to the S-2P

125

structure, PS80 likely stabilizes the disordered loops of the NTD domain, making

126

them more ordered (Fig. 2B and 2C). The oleic acid located in the hydrophobic

127

pocket of the RBD domain engaged a salt bridge interaction with R408 at the

128

adjacent protomer through its carboxylic acid group, bringing the RBD domain in

129

close proximity and resulting in the tightly closed conformation (Fig. 2D).

130
131

Recent studies have shown that low pH can stabilize the S-Trimer (12). Indeed,

132

negative staining EM analysis of WT S-Trimer at pH 5.5 revealed more homogenous

133

trimer than that at physiological pH (See accompanying paper). In light of this finding,

134

we were able to determine the cryo-EM structure of the WT S-Trimer at 3.2 Å

135

resolution at pH 5.5 (Fig. S7 and Table S1). The structure of the WT S-Trimer

136

resembled that of the MT form with a root mean square deviation of 0.5 Å over 2773

137

Cα atoms (Fig. 3A). Oleic acid was well resolved in the WT structure but the density

138

for the PS80 was weak, likely due to the low resolution or low occupancy. As a result,

139

the NTD domain of the WT S-Trimer was less well resolved than that of MT (Fig. 3A).

140

It has been shown that a pH-dependent switch domain (residue 824-848, pH switch

141

1) undergoes dramatic conformational change at different pH values (12). However,

142

this region was nearly identical between our two structures (Fig. 3B). Instead, a

143

fragment (residue 617-639) we named pH switch 2 at the CTD1 region of the S1

144

domain before the furin cleavage site displays significant structural arrangement.

145

Whereas this region appeared disordered in the MT structure at physiological pH

146

conditions, it was well ordered and formed a helix-turn-helix structural motif in the WT

147

structure at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3C). From structural perspective, lower pH likely contributes

148

to this structural arrangement. At physiological pH, R319 forms salt bridge

149

interactions with D737 and D745 (Fig. 3D). At lower pH, the protonation of D737 and

150

D745 weakens these interactions. As a result, R319 flips to the other side and makes

151

hydrophobic interactions with W633 and L629 through its aliphatic chain, leading to

152

the ordered helix-turn-helix motif (Fig. 3E). The newly-formed structural motif makes

153

direct contact with the previously identified pH switch 1 of the adjacent protomer,

154

accounting for the enhanced stability of the WT S-Trimer at lower pH (Fig. 3A). The

155

structural arrangement of pH switch 2 in different pH was also observed in previous

156

studies (12), further supporting the conformational change between the MT and WT

157

S-Trimer structures was due to the different pH but not to the mutation in the furin

158

site.

159
160

In contrast to the structural differences described above for S-2P protein, both of our

161

WT and MT S-Trimer were nearly identical to the recently published structures of full-

162

length wild-type S (10) and 3Q-2P-FL (7) purified in detergent from HEK293 and sf9

163

insect cell membranes, respectively. When revisiting the electron density map for full-

164

length wild-type S protein (EMDB: 22292), we spotted unassigned density at the

165

same position as oleic acid which was absent in the S-2P map (EMDB: 21452) (fig.

166

S8). Therefore, fatty acid binding at the RBD domain may stabilize the tightly closed

167

conformation, accounting for the conformational difference from S-2P. Based on the

168

structural similarity among all published structures of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we can

169

classify them into three distinct states: a tightly closed state, a loosely closed state

170

and an open state (Fig. 4A). A conformational switch (residue 835-858) previously

171

known as the pH switch or the fusion-peptide proximal region (FPPR) is critical for

172

conformational transition from the tightly closed state to the open state (Fig. 4B). In

173

the tightly closed state which is less accessible to the receptor, three RBDs are down

174

and in closer proximity to one another. The conformational switch region is well

175

ordered and stabilizes this tightly closed state. Recently, D614G mutation has

176

become predominant over the ancestral form worldwide and has been shown to

177

increase viral infections (13, 14). In the tightly closed state, D614 makes a salt bridge

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.21.306357; this version posted September 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

178

interaction with K854 at the conformational switch region (Fig. 4C). From the tightly to

179

the loosely closed state, the conformational switch undergoes a large conformational

180

arrangement and becomes disordered (Fig. 4D). K854 flips to the opposite side and

181

interacts with D568 and D574 of the CTD1, causing the S1 to move downwards

182

relative to the S2 (Fig. 4A). Finally, the CTD1 domain further moves downwards and

183

causes the RBD to adopt an open conformation for receptor binding (Movie S1).

184

Therefore, D614G mutation abolishes the salt bridge interaction with K854 which in

185

turn engages the CTD1 domain, thus favoring the open state.

186
187

To our knowledge, this is the first cryo-EM structure of the wild-type S protein in

188

soluble and cleavable form without the transmembrane domain, confirming structural

189

integrity of this metastable wild-type form of COVID-19 subunit vaccine candidate.

190

While most vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials incorportated furin site and

191

double proline mutations, our wild-type S-Trimer offers a more native-like antigen for

192

potentially more effective and broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

193

Thus, Trimer-Tag technology that has been proven here to be able to rapidly produce

194

large quantities of native-like S-Trimer antigen, may offer a platform technology for

195

subunit vaccine development for enveloped RNA viruses that use ubiquitous trimeric

196

antigens to invade host cells.

197
198
199

Like the previously reported structure of full-length WT S protein purified in detergent

200

micelles, it is unclear whether the furin cleavage site in our resolved WT S-Trimer

201

structure is cleaved. Moreover, we could not exclude the possibility that other

202

conformational states exist in the WT sample that were not captured in our cryo-EM

203

study since partial cleavage of the furin site may lead to some S1 dissociation from

204

S-Trimer. Nevertheless, we are certain that the highly purified WT S-Trimer

205

predominately adopts a pre-fusion state, unlike the full-length wild-type spike protein

206

which forms both pre- and post-fusion states in the presence of detergent (10).

208

Consistent with structural studies reported here showing that WT S-Trimer is native-

209

like, preclinical studies showed that this COVID-19 vaccine candidate resulted in

210

rapid and high-level induction of both neutralizing antibodies and Th1-biased cellular

211

immune responses in mice, rats and nonhuman primates. Non-human primates

212

immunized with WT S-Trimer were fully protected from SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge

213

(See accompanying paper). Currently, an S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate is

214

under clinical investigation.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification
Endo180-Fc expression vector was generated by subcloning a PCR amplified cDNA encoding soluble
human Endo180 (amino acid residue 1-1394) (Thomas et al) into the HindIII site of pGH-hFc expression
vector (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) to allow in-frame fusion to human IgG Fc. The expression vector was
transfected into GH-CHO (dhfr-/-) cell line (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) using FUGENE 6 (Roche) and
grown in IMDM medium with 10% FBS. After stepwise gene amplification with increasing
concentrations (0.0–10 nM) of MTX (Sigma), a high titer clone was then adapted to SFM-4CHO serumfree medium (GE BioSciences). The secreted End0180-Fc fusion protein was then produced in a 15 L
bioreactor (Applikon) under a fed-batch process with Cell Boost 2 supplement (GE Hyclone) as instructed
by the manufacturer. Endo180-Fc was purified to homogeneity by protein A affinity chromatography
using MabSelect PrismA (GE Healthcare) followed by Capto QXP resins (GE BioSceinces) in a flowthrough mode to remove any host cell DNA and residual host cell proteins (HCP).
To produce S-Trimer fusion proteins, cDNA encoding the ectodomain of either wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S
protein (amino acid residues 1 to 1211) (GenBank: MN908947.3) or a SARS-CoV (amino acid residues 1
to 1193) (GenBank: AAS00003.1) were synthesized using -optimized codons for Cricetulus griseus
(CHO Cell) by GenScript. The cDNAs were subcloned into pTRIMER expression vector (GenHunter,
Nashville, TN) at Hind III and Bgl II sites to allow in-frame fusion of the soluble S protein to Trimer-Tag
as described previously (1). Furin cleavage site mutant S-Trimer (R685A) was generated by site-directed
mutagenesis using mutagenesis primer pair (5’-gcccaaggagggctgcgtctgtggctagcc-3’ and 5’ggctagccacagacgcagccctccttgggc-3’) and WT S-Trimer expression vector as a template following the
protocol of QuikChange kit (Strategene). The expression vectors were transfected into GH-CHO (dhfr-/-)
cell line (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) using FUGENE 6 (Roche) and grown in IMDM medium with 10%
FBS. After stepwise gene amplification with increasing concentrations (0.0–10 nM) of MTX (Sigma),
clones producing the highest S-Trimer titer were adapted to SFM-4CHO serum-free medium (GE
BioSciences). The secreted S-Trimer fusion proteins were produced in a 15 L bioreactor (Applikon)
under a fed-batch process with Cell Boost 2 supplement (GE Hyclone) as instructed by the manufacturer.
Cell culture medium was clarified by depth filtration (Millipore) to remove cell and debris. S-Trimers
were purified to homogeneity by consecutive chromatographic steps including Protein A affinity column
using MabSelect PrismA (GE Healthcare) which was preloaded with Endo180-Fc at (3 mg/mL) to capture
S-Trimer, based on the high affinity binding between Endo180 and Trimer-Tag (2). After washing off any

unbound contaminating proteins, S-Trimers were purified to near homogeneity in a single step using 0.5
M NaCl in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For S MT and SARS-CoV S-Trimer, the proteins were
dialyzed against PBS plus 0.02% Polysorbate 80 before analysis. After one hour of low pH (pH 3.5) viral
inactivation (VI) step using acetic acid, the pH was adjusted to neutral range, WT S-Trimer was further
purified on a Capto QXP resins (GE BioSceinces) in a flow-through mode to remove any host cell DNA
and residual host cell proteins (HCP). A final preventative viral removal (VR) step was performed using
a nano-filtration cartridge (AsahiKASEI) before final buffer exchange to PBS plus 0.02% Polysorbate 80
by UF/DF (Millipore).
ACE2-Fc expression vector was generated by subcloning a gene-synthesized cDNA template (GenScript)
encoding soluble human ACE2 (amino acid residue 1-738，accession number: NM_001371415.1) into
Hind III and Bgl II sites of pGH-hFc expression vector (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) to allow in-frame
fusion to human IgG Fc. The expression vector was then stably transfected into GH-CHO (dhfr -/-) cell
line and high expression clones were selected and adapted to SFM-4-CHO (Hyclone) serum free medium
and ACE2-Fc was produced in a 15 L bioreactor as essentially as described for S-Trimer above. ACE2-Fc
was purified to homogeneity from the conditioned medium using PoRos XQ column (Thermo Fisher)
following manufacturer’s instructions.
Receptor binding studies of S-Trimers to human ACE2-Fc
The avidity of different S-Trimer binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 were assessed by BioLayer Interferometry measurements on ForteBio Octet QKe (Pall, New York). ACE2-Fc (10 µg/mL) was
immobilized on Protein A (ProA) biosensors (Pall). Real-time receptor binding curves were obtained by
applying the sensor in a two-fold serial dilutions of S-Trimer from 22.5-36 µg/mL in PBS. Kinetic
parameters (Kon and Koff) and affinities (KD) were analyzed using Octet software, version 12.0.
Dissociation constants (KD) were determined using steady state analysis, assuming a 1:1 binding model
for a S-Trimer to ACE2-Fc.
Negative staining
Negative staining was performed as previously described (3). In brief, 3 μl of purified S-trimer at a
concentration of about 0.01 mg/ml was deposited on a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid for 30
s before being blotted with filter paper. Grids were quickly washed with two drops of water and one drop
of 2% (w/v) uranium acetate. Grids were kept touching to the last drop of 2% (w/v) uranium acetate for
90 s, and blotted with filter paper. Data collection was performed on a Tecnai T12 electron microscope

operated at 120 Kev equipped with a FEI Ceta 4K detector. Images were collected at a magnification of
57,000 x and a defocus of 1.5 μm.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection
Purified MT S-trimer protein diluted to 0.2 and 0.5 mg/ml in PBS buffer were applied to glow-discharged
gold holey carbon 1.2/1.3 300-mesh grids with and without graphene oxide, respectively. Grids were
blotted for 2-4 seconds at a blotting force of 4 and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a MarkIV
Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The chamber was maintained at 8 ºC and 100% humidity during
freezing. 0.3 mg/ml of WT S-trimer sample in low pH buffer (100 mM sodium citrate pH 5.5 and 100
mM NaCl) was deposited on glow-discharged gold holey carbon 1.2/1.3 300-mesh grids with graphene
oxide. Grids were blotted and vitrified using the same condition.
All movies were collected using a Titan Krios microscope (Thermo fisher Scientific) equipped with a
BioQuantum GIF/K3 direct electron detector (Gatan). The detector is operated in superresolution mode.
A complete description of cryo-EM data collection parameters are summarized in Table S1.
Cryo-EM Image processing
For MT S-Trimer protein, motion correction for cryo-EM images and contrast transfer function (CTF)
estimation were performed using motioncorr2 (4) and CTFFIND4 (5) respectively. 574,832 particles were
automatically picked from 534 images collected on grid without graphene oxide (GO) using Laplacian-ofGaussian in Relion 3.0.7 (6), and 1,029,938 particles was automatically picked from 1584 images
collected on grid with GO. Extract particles from two datasets were downsized by two-fold and subjected
to 2D classification separately, resulting in 438,205 and 560,545 good particles. Particles from GO grids
were recentered using scripts written by Kai Zhang (http://www.mrclmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/useful_tools/scripts/) before 3D classification. Good particles from both datasets
were combined and subjected to 3D classification using the initial model generated from the model of S
protein with C1 symmetry (PDB ID: 6vxx). Two major classes accounting for 26.7% and 25.8% particles
show clear and complete structural features. These particles were auto-refined followed by local 3D
classification with C1 symmetry to generate two classes with similar structure. The better class was
subjected to 3D refinement with C3 symmetry and post-processed using mask on the entire molecule to
yield a 2.9 Å map. CTF refinement was performed to further increase the resolution to 2.6 Å.
For image processing of WT S-Trimer, MT S-Trimer map was low-pass-filtered to 20 Å resolution and
used as the 3D reference template for auto-picking. 752,204 articles were picked from 1199 images

collected on GO-coated grid and used for two rounds of 2D classification. 541,528 particles were selected
from good 2D classes and used for 3D classification with C1 symmetry. One class accounting for 32.2%
showing a well-defined structure was refined with C3 symmetry and post-processed using mask on the
entire molecule to give a map at 3.4 Å resolution. CTF refinement followed by another round of 3D
refinement improved the resolution to 3.2 Å. Reported resolutions were calculated based on the goldstandard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) at the 0.143 criterion.
Model building
The soluble ectodomain structure S-2P (PDB: 6VXX) was used as a template for model building. The
missing region in the S-2P structure can be de novo modeled in the MT S-Trimer map, owing to its high
resolution. The model was manually built in COOT (7) and real space refinement was performed in
Phenix (8) using rotomer, Ramachandran and secondary structure restraints. The model for WT S-trimer
was built in COOT based on the MT structure and refined in Phenix using the same strategy. Refinement
statistics are summarized in Tabel S1.
Small molecules extraction from protein samples
20 µL of WT and MT S-Trimer samples at 1.21 mg/ml and 1.02 mg/ml respectively were transferred to
Eppendorf tubes and placed in a heater block at 100 ℃ for 5 min. Samples were then extracted with 100
µL methanol. The tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 ℃ for 10 min. The supernatant
was collected, transferred to glass vials, and 1 µL was injected for the LC-MS analysis. For oleic acid and
linoleic acid reference samples, 10 mM stock solution of compounds were prepared in DMSO and diluted
to 1 μM by methanol, and 1 µL was injected for the LC-MS analysis.
LC-MS Analysis
LC-MS analysis of PS 80 and MT S-Trimer sample were performed by an Agilent 1290 UHPLC coupled
to an Agilent quadrupole-time of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer via an electrospray ionization source
(ESI) with JetStream technology. The separation was performed by flow injection using isocratic flow of
a solvent composed of 0.1% formic acid in 60% acetonitrile and 40% water. The flow rate was set at 0.2
mL/min for 0.5 min. Mass spectra were recorded in the positive ionization mode over a mass range
from m/z 100 to 1500. The scan parameters were capillary voltage 4.0 kV and fragmentor 135V. The
nitrogen pressure and flow rate on the nebulizer were 40 psi and 5 L/min, respectively. Other ion source
parameters included drying gas temperature of 325 °C, sheath gas temperature of 350 °C and sheath gas
flow rate of 10 L/min.

The relative quantitation for oleic acid and linoleic acid was performed by a Thermo Vanquish UHPLC
coupled to a Thermo Q Exactive HF-X hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The
chromatographic separation was performed using a Waters CSH C18 column (2.1x100 mm, 1.7 μm) and
maintained at 40°C. The separation was performed using isocratic flow of a solvent composed of 90%
acetonitrile, 10% water, and 2 mM ammonium acetate. The flow rate was set at 0.2 mL/min for 10 min.
Full-scan-ddMS2 mass spectra were acquired in the range of 100-1500 m/z with the following ESI source
settings: spray voltage 2.5 kV, aux gas heater temperature 380 °C, capillary temperature 320 °C, sheath
gas flow rate 30 unit, aux gas flow gas 10 unit in the negative mode. MS1 scan parameters included
resolution 60000, AGC target 3e6, and maximum injection time 200 ms while dd-MS2 parameters
included resolution 30000, ACG target 2e5, maximum injection time 100 ms, isolation window 4.0 m/z,
NCE 30.
