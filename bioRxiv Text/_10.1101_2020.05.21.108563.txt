SARS-CoV-2 mutations and where to find them: An in silico

2

perspective of structural changes and antigenicity of the Spike protein

3

The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a severe

4

global health threat characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome (Covid-

5

19). At the moment, there is no specific treatment for this disease, and vaccines

6

are still under development. The structural protein Spike is essential for virus

7

infection and has been used as the main target for vaccine and serological

8

diagnosis test development. We analysed 2363 sequences of the Spike protein

9

from SARS-CoV-2 isolates and identified variability in 44 amino acid residues

10

and their worldwide distribution in all continents. We used the three-dimensional

11

structure of the homo-trimer model to predict conformational epitopes of B-cell,

12

and sequence of Spike protein Wuhan-Hu-1 to predict linear epitopes of T-

13

Cytotoxic and T-Helper cells. We identified 45 epitopes with amino acid

14

variations. Finally, we showed the distribution of mutations within the epitopes.

15

Our findings can help researches to identify more efficient strategies for the

16

development of vaccines, therapies, and serological diagnostic tests based on the

17

Spike protein of Sars-Cov-2.

Introduction

2

The SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, is highly transmissible, leading to high

3

infection rates and human mortality around the world, turning the disease caused by this

4

virus (COVID-2019) a huge public health concern (Li et al., 2020). Up to now, SARS-

5

CoV-2 has been spreading in several continents and causing more than 4,629,000

6

confirmed cases, with mortality rates of 6,74% (World Health Organization, 2020 –

7

access at 18/05/2020).

8

Coronaviruses have the largest genome among RNA viruses (26 to 32 kilobases in

9

length) with 14 ORFs encoding 27 proteins. At 5’ end of the genome, there are the 1ab

10

and 1a ORFs, which encode 16 mature non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16). These

11

proteins play crucial functions during viral RNA replication and transcription1. At 3’

12

end of the genome, there are genes encoding four structural proteins: Spike (S),

13

Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleoprotein (N) as well as genes for 8 accessory

14

proteins named 3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 8b, 9b, and orf142.

15

Although recent findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has stronger transmissibility when

16

compared to SARS-CoV, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this difference

17

remain unclear3. However, among the structural proteins, the Spike glycoprotein that is

18

present as a homo-trimer on the coronaviruses surface, has been pointed as the most

19

important factor responsible for this stronger transmissibility since this protein is able to

20

bind cell receptors. The S protein has two subunits named S1 and S2. The S1 subunit is

21

responsible for binding to the host cell receptor. It has a signal peptide, an N-terminal

22

domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD). The S2 subunit is responsible for

23

fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and consists of a conserved fusion peptide

24

(FP), two hepta-repeats (HR1 and HR2), a transmembrane (TM) and a cytoplasmic (CP)

25

domains4. Structural analysis of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2

1

Spike protein and the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

2

revealed that the RBD can induce the spillover to other animals as well as human-to-

3

human transmissions5,6. This protein has been shown as a key factor for coronaviruses

4

entry into cells, as well as a target for neutralizing antibodies, due to its role in binding

5

to cellular receptors and fusion of viral and cellular membranes 4,7,8.

6

The RBD of SARS-CoV S1 domain undergoes conformational changes that hide or

7

expose the determinants of receptor binding6,9,10. Then, upon RBD binding to cellular

8

receptors, the Spike protein is cleaved by proteases and the signal peptide is released.

9

This cleavage triggers conformational changes in the S1 and S2 subunits, leading to the

10

exposure of the fusion loop and its interaction into target cell membrane. This fact turns

11

this domain a target to virus neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. Thus,

12

conformational changes of the Spike protein are a necessary step to viral membrane

13

fusion, and it allows the entry of viral nucleocapsids into the host cell to initiate

14

replication7,9,11,12. Additionally, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a furin-like

15

cleavage site at the S1/S2subunits, which highlights the essential differences in Spike

16

protein between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this mechanism is proving to be a

17

potential target for vaccines, therapeutic approaches, and diagnosis for

18

coronaviruses13,14.

19

Since the Spike protein has a crucial role in the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication,

20

research studies have been focusing on its structure, function, and antigenicity to gain a

21

better understanding ofthe Spike protein14,15. A bioinformatics analysis has shown that

22

the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those

23

of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV8.

24

In addition, the tri-dimensional model of Spike protein structure has recently been

published, showing that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has more affinity for binding

2

ACE2 than the SARS-CoV Spike protein16.

3

However, some studies have shown that cellular receptors used to viral attachment and

4

entry can vary among host species of different coronaviruses 9,14,17,18. A recent study

5

reported that SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to the bat SARS-CoV RaTG13 that

6

forms a distinct lineage of SARS-CoVs, and their Spike glycoproteins share 98% amino

7

acid sequence identity19. Despite the amino acid level appears to be similar, there are

8

important differences in Spike protein between these viruses that might explain some

9

viral differences regarding the pathogenicity 14. Therefore, more studies are needed to

10

understand how those differences can change SARS-CoV-2 functionality.

11

Data about the genomic variability of the SARS-CoV-2, especially on the region

12

encoding the Spike protein, could provide important support for the accuracy of

13

structural predictions. In this present study, we analysed 2363 sequences of the Spike

14

protein in order to study the frequency of mutations on the protein domains and motifs

15

and to identify potential epitopes on this protein. Additionally, we also determined the

16

epitope variability of the Spike protein circulating in all continents. This work can be

17

used to support long-term studies to identify Spike protein mutations emergence and

18

understand how it can affect vaccine trials and serological diagnosis.

Materials and methods

2

Sequence retrieval and Structural analysis

3

Only complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were collected in the GISAID

4

(https://www.gisaid.org/). Complete sequences of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were

5

obtained from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ViPR

6

(https://www.viprbrc.org). All sequences are aligned using MEGA-X20 software with

7

MUSCLE algorithm21.

8

The homo-trimer model was obtained through the Robetta server22

9

(http://robetta.bakerlab.org/) referenced by the partial crystal of the “closed-state” of

10

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein6VXX23, representing about 77% of the actual structure

11

(https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6VXX). Subsequently, the structure of model was

12

subjected to geometry optimization steps by the Discovery Studios software24, where

13

was considered eleven outlier residues from the favorable/acceptable regions in the

14

Ramachandran plot: 59PHEA,B,C, 62VALA,B,C, 365TYRA,B,C, 544ASNB and 744GLYB.

15

So that all residues with a radius distance of 4A from each of the outliers was also

16

considered in the optimization steps.

17

T and B cell epitope prediction

18

All obtained sequences were used to predict T and B cell epitopes. The Wuhan-Hu-1

19

Spike protein of reference sequence NC_045512.225

20

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/1796318598) was used as reference for the

21

epitope prediction. The NetCTL1.226 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetCTL/) was

22

used to predict MHC-I binding epitopes. The MHC class I was considered for the

23

prediction of epitopes for cytotoxic T cells through artificial neural networks, using the

24

standard set of Weight on C terminal cleavage score (0.15), Weight on TAP

25

(Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing) efficiency matrix (0.05) and

Threshold for epitope identification (0.75). NetMHCpan 4.027

2

(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan/),was also used to predict MHC class I

3

epitopes for cytotoxic T cells. Peptides with mers of 8-11 was pointed through artificial

4

neural networks, with the threshold of <2% better in the binding score rank. The

5

NetMHCII 2.327 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII/), was used to prediction

6

epitopes for T Helper cells with 15 mers. The lociHLA-DR was used, with standard

7

threshold (<2% better in the binding rank affinity) to identify the peptides that best

8

bound to MHCII.

9

Linear epitopes for B cells of different sizes were predicted using BepiPred-2.0

10

(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/)28. The standard threshold of 0.5 was used to

11

ensure the better Specificity/Sensitivity ratio of the epitope. Finally, the conformational

12

epitopes for B cells were predicted using the validated model of the three-dimensional

13

structure of the spike protein homo-trimer through two web servers (DiscoTope and

14

hroughElliPro). DiscoTope (http://tools.iedb.org/discotope/)29 was used with the

15

threshold for specify epitope identification (-3.7). The prediction of conformational

16

epitopes using ThroughElliPro30(http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) was made with the

17

maximum score threshold of 0.5 and the maximum distance for ligation of 6 angstroms.

18

Only those epitopes located in the "extracellular" region of the protein (13-1213) were

19

considered. The identified epitopes were visualized on Spike protein tri-dimensional

20

model using the software Visual Molecular Dynamics31 (figures 1 to 3) or Discovery

21

Studios (supplementary figure 2) 32. The image processing for figures 1 and 3 was done

22

using the software Visual Molecular Dynamics31. The flowchart of the three main stages

23

of the study is on figure 1.

Results

Structural modeling

3

The monomeric Spike protein model was represented according to their respective

4

domains, disulfide bridges, and glycosylation points indicated by Expasy's P0DTC2

5

annotations reports (https://viralzone.expasy.org/resources/Coronav/P0DTC2.txt)

6

(figure 2 and video 1 in supplemental material). The FP region, reported from Expasy's,

7

has a little difference than that is reported for Sars-Cov. The three-dimensional Spike

8

homo-trimer model showed a clash score of 1.13 and a molprobity

9

(http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/) score of 1.05 corresponding to the 99th and

10

100th percentiles, respectively, when compared to high-resolution 3D structures. The

11

model revealed 99.9% of its residues in acceptable/favorable regions on the

12

Ramachandram Plot (http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/), where only 59PHE residues

13

from chains A, B and C continue as an outlier (supplementary figure 1). After ensuring

14

the model quality, the homo-trimer 3D structure was used to the structural/antigenic

15

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variability mapping.

16

Variations of protein Spike

17

After Spike protein sequences retrieval and comparison, 856 amino acid variations were

18

identified in 32.8% of sequences. Europe and South America showed the highest

19

variation rates among worldwide sequences, showing variation on 47.4% and 44.1% of

20

sequences, respectively. (data not showed). Sequence comparison analysis identified 42

21

amino acid residues with variation that occurred at least twice on SARS-Cov-2

22

sequences. Twenty three variations was mapped in the S1 and 19 in S2 domain (table

23

1). Some of these variations (28) are represented by residues with non-homologous

24

physical-chemical characteristics in their respective continents of occurrence (figure 3).

Epitopes prediction of protein Spike

2

In the present analysis, it was predicted 282 epitopes: 95 for T-cytotoxic cells, 135 for

3

T-Helper cells and 52 for B cells (30 linear and 22 conformational epitopes). All

4

epitopes are shown in supplementary table 1. Only those variations whose showed

5

amino acid changes to residues with non-homologous physical-chemical characteristics

6

was considered and represented in table 2. As a result, there are 11 predicted epitopes

7

for T-Cytotoxic cells, 16 for T-Helper cells, 18 for B cells (10 linear and 8 structural

8

epitopes). Forty-five epitopes with mapped variations were represented in the 3D model

9

of the SARS-CoV-2 protein Spike structure (figure 4). The S1 domain gathers the

10

majority counts (33) while the NTD region showed 20 epitopes, of which 7 were

11

predicted for B cells (table 2).

12

Discussion

13

Amino acids variations

14

Our findings suggest that the majority of residue variations arose punctually on their

15

respective continents, with the exception of position 614, which occurs in all continents.

16

The 614-residue variation has the most expressive frequency and has been reported by

17

recent published/preprinted studies 33–35. The H49Y variation has been identified in

18

Asia, Europe, and North America. In contrast, L5F, V367F, R765L, and S940F

19

variations, with the exception the last, were observed in at least two continents with

20

<1% frequency. (table 1).

21

Overall, the largest number of variants was found in S1 protein subunit, with 10 variant

22

positions found in Asia, 9 in Europe, 9 in North America, and 2 in Oceania (table 1).

23

South America and Africa did not show any other variation in the S1 domain besides

24

that identified in residue 614, probably due to the few numbers of analyzed genomes

25

from these regions. The sequences from Europe showed a higher number of variant

residues in the S2 domain (12) in comparison to the average from the other continents

2

(1.8). However, the S1 domain is the region more propense to appear new variations

3

due its most prominent variability between coronaviruses species36.

4

Due to the short period since its dissemination, it is difficult to find a specific variation

5

pattern in Spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 on the continents. But even so, the variant

6

position D1259H in S2 domain was seen in North America sequences but not in Asia

7

and Europe (table 1). Future works with a higher number of high-quality sequences are

8

needed to better understand the possible heterogeneous distribution of South/Central

9

Americas, Africa and Oceania amino acid variations on these regions.

10

Mapping of variations

11

S1 DOMAIN

12

Our analysis showed that the NTD domain has many variations (figure 3), where

13

changes on teen residues were identified. However, only two residues variations showed

14

frequency above 1% (S50L and S247R). The S50L residue variation was found in

15

2.37% of sequences from Asia and is internally located in the homo-trimer structure. A

16

recent study demonstrated that the L50 residue found in SARS-Cov / SARS-like CoV's

17

was replaced by S50 in SARS-CoV-2 2. However, some SARS-Cov-2 sequences remain

18

with the L50 residue. Another particular residue variation (S247) showed 5.26%

19

frequency on Oceania. This residue is located at the peripheral end of the NTD portion

20

and was reported in a recent preprint study that five variations of Spike protein may be

21

related to variation of replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells37.

22

In the RBD region, four residues variations were identified (table 1).A recent in silico

23

preprint study shows the variation V367F as a probable factor to the high increase of

24

binding affinity with the ACE2 receptor40. The V483A variation, found only in North

American sequences, are co-located in the binding region of the main residues involved

2

in the interaction of the SARS-Cov Spike protein with the ACE2 receptor 38,39.The

3

R408I variation was identified only in the Asian continent and it was reported in a

4

recent in silico preprint study as a probable factor of decreased binding affinity with the

5

ACE2 receptor40 (figure 3-front & table 1). Additionally, the arginine at position 408 in

6

RBD core region has already been cited as an important point of interaction with N-

7

glycan, for both SARS and SARS-CoV-241,42. Thus, future investigations should be

8

done in order to evaluate if these changes on Spike protein residues could be correlated

9

to functional changes.

10

A second G476S variation observed in the North American genomic sequences was

11

found in peripheral and accessible region of the structure (figure1-front) and is also co-

12

located with the region of the main interaction residues between the SARS-CoV-2

13

protein Spike and the ACE2 receptor 43. This was also observed inSARS-CoV39. As

14

mentioned before, the highest frequency mutation rate was identified at position 614 in

15

almost all continents (except Central America). This variation could be used to group

16

the continents into either D or G predominantly variations. The group D includes Asia,

17

North America, and Oceania while group G includes Europe, South America, and

18

Africa (table 1). However, although residue D614 in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 reference

19

sequences indicates a positive selection of G614 mutation in those continents, there is

20

no evidence of how this mutation frequency could impact virus functionality.

21

Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 sequencing analysis from diverse continents demonstrates

22

that the genes encoding the Spike proteins undergo diverse and frequent mutations44.

23

First, it was identified a mutation (241C>T), which was developed gradually, and

24

reported with three other co-mutations (3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G)33. These

25

mutations culminated on amino acid variations in Spike protein, nsp3, and RNA

primase, which are responsible for RNA replication33. Moreover, all associated-

2

mutations observed were prevalent in Europe isolates, giving insights for SARS-CoV-2

3

severity in this region. Therefore, the SNP mutation (23403A>G/D614G) in Spike

4

protein D614G, was pointed out by Yin, C.33. This residue is near to this furin

5

recognition site (S1/S2 region) of SARS and could affect enzyme activity. However, the

6

distance between alpha carbons of residues 614 and 685 turns the cleavage site for

7

SARS-CoV-2 (S1/S2) greater than 35Å (supplementary figure 1), which makes it

8

difficult to infer that this mutation might have a direct action on cleavage process on

9

S1/S2 domains. Furthermore, a recent study showed possible changes in pathogenicity

10

derived from mutations37. However, the D614G variation was not observed in the

11

sequences analyzed by this study.

12

S2 DOMAIN

13

Five amino acid variations (T791I, D839Y, V1176F, C1254F, and P1263L) were found

14

in the S2 domain with frequency >1%. These variations do not happen more than one

15

continent. Located on the HR1 region periphery (figure 3 - side in), S940F is present in

16

Europe (0.69% of sequences) and Oceania (3.51% of sequences). T791I that have

17

1,09% of frequency is occurs on FP region and it is present only in Asian sequences.

18

The V1176 variation has been found in South America with considerable frequency

19

(6.98% of sequences). Furthermore, C1254F and P1263L variations in the IC region at

20

the cytoplasmic end structure (figure 3 - side in) appear in Oceania (3.51% of

21

sequences) and Europe (1.97% of sequences), respectively. These latter verified

variations in IC region are residues with non-homologous physical-chemical

characteristics and they might carry changes on intra-cellular portion interaction with

24

the cellular components as well as lipid bilayer. Thus, further studies must be performed

25

to verify the influence of these changes on SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Epitope Variations Mapping

2

Our antigenic predictions show that the ELIPRO server identify the entire NTD domain

3

as an antigen (table 2 and figure 4). In this domain, seven variations of amino acid

4

residues were identified with non-homologous physical-chemical characteristics. The

5

remaining 19 epitopes in the NTD had one or two variations (table 2). In contrast, the

6

RBD domain showed only five epitopes (table 2). Recently the cryo-electron

7

microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 protein Spike trimer was determined8,16,

8

showing that RBD can undergo movements between its “up” or “down” conformations.

9

This suggest that the target epitope of the neutralizing antibody (CR3022) is accessible

10

when the RBD is in the “up” conformation. Additionally, the ACE2 host can interact

11

with the RBD when protein Spike is in the “up” conformation45. Consequently, the

12

RBD domain has been identified as the most promising target for vaccine prototypes

13

development14. However, up to now, little information about the natural variability of

14

SARS-CoV-2 residues involved in ACE2 binding has been elucidated in the literature.

15

Finally, the S2 domain presented 14 epitopes (three are shared with the S1 domain), two

16

of these S2’s epitopes where found on the fusion peptide (FP) region, and another two

17

where located on the transmembrane (TM) region.

18

T cell epitopes

19

Among all epitopes identified, only S610-620 and S612-620 epitopes have amino acid

20

variation at high frequencies and worldwide prevalence (residue 614 in table1). These

21

two epitopes have been identified by two prediction methods used in this study for T-

22

cytotoxic cells. However, future studies are needed to find out if there is the importance

23

of this variation in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

24

Three more predicted epitopes for T-cytotoxic cells with variations (>1% frequency)

25

were identified in our analyzes, two at NTD (S50-58 in Asia and S240-249 in Oceania) and a

third epitope S786-794 in S2 domain on Asia (Highlighted in Tab 2). The prediction for T-

2

Helper cells epitopes identified seven epitopes with variations that haven >1%frequency

3

(Highlighted in Tab 2). The first T-Helper epitope S50-64 is found in Asia. The last six

4

epitopes are co-located among S233-253 region in Oceania sequences (figure 4). This

5

analysis identified the overlapping of antigenic regions for T cells in the NTD domain,

6

but not in the RBD domain (figure 4).

7

Conversely, most of epitope predictions with variations >1% frequency was observed

8

on a single continent. This suggests the existence of a random Spike protein

9

diversification on these regions. However, the limited available literature of serological

10

responses diversity to SARS-CoV-2 does not allow to better clarify this context at this

11

time.

12

B cell epitopes

13

The total of six epitopes predicted for B cells was identified with variations at

14

frequencies> 1%. Three linear and three conformational (highlighted in table 2). Of

15

these, four epitopes are present in the RBD domain (only in North America), one linear

16

(S455-478), and three conformational (S434-511, S434-580, and S434-584). The RBD polypeptide

17

chain is classically recognized for its potential to generate neutralizing antibodies to

18

SARS 39,46and recently observed also being the target of a neutralizing response for

19

SARS-CoV-2 38,47. A recent in silico study highlighted the region 524-598, which is

20

partially present in the RBD, as one of the dominant epitopes for SARS and SARS-

21

CoV-2 sharing an 80% identity15. Finally, the last two linear epitopes identified by our

22

analysis are in domain S2 (S786-800, S828-843) with variations in Asia and Europe,

23

respectively. Furthermore, the fusion peptide structure has been shown as a target for

24

neutralizing immune response to SARS and SARS-CoV-2 16. Variations in the S786-

25

800

epitope of FP region described in this study may also cause changes in its

1

antigenicity, but, as already mentioned, new studies should be done to verify this

2

hypothesis.

3

The potential variations in physicochemical characteristics brought by a amino acid

4

residue exchange can generate an eventual condition for the viral particle escaping from

5

the immune system via a non-neutralizing cross-reactive response from previous

6

infections. As example, previous mutational assays with the polypeptide chain of the

7

SARS-Cov Spike protein have shown that changes in the physical-chemical

8

characteristics of various residues have resulted in impaired functions5,7,48.

9

Thus, there is a clear need to monitor the antigenic variation by the newly emerged

10

coronavirus, as variations in the RBD domain may change over time, due to selective

11

pressure on the virus through future therapies given to host populations. Although we

12

did not identify variations in potential epitopes capable of inducing humoral response

13

against SARS-CoV-2 with high frequencies and/or wide distribution on the continents,

14

these slight variations covered by four months of SARS-CoV-2 spread just strengths the

15

necessity to understand the potential of antigenic variation that the Spike protein might

16

present. However, given the small variation in the epitopes pointed out in this work, we

17

can suggest that vaccine approaches using the spike protein structure are unlikely to be

18

impaired by the variability presented by theSARS-CoV-2. Still, it would be interesting

19

to formulate therapies that focus on the S2 domain since it presented the lower number

20

of variants. Moreover, among the S1 domain, RBD is the less affected by the variants,

21

and therefore, more promising than NTD.

22

The great global engagement in tackling this pandemic has generated hundreds of

23

vaccine prototypes and potential drugs in the short/medium term. However, prototype

24

generation needs to rely on and be developed based on antigenic and structural

25

variability studies, especially protein S, which is essential for virus/host interactions..

Ideally, drug and vaccine developments should take into account the virus entire

2

diversity of its population.. Thus, efforts should focus on a continuous study of the

3

genomic variations and their implications for the change in antigens, to guide the

4

production of next-generation vaccines and drugs effective against all strains of SARS-

5

CoV-2.

Figure 2. Structural mapping of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein: On the left side, the homo-

5

trimer is showed as a newcartoon. The B and C chains are represented in gray and the A

6

chain in blue. On the right side, the monomer is also showed as a newcartoon with the

7

representation of domains, subdomains, motifs, N-Glycan’s, and disulfide bonds. The

8

blue and gray shadows above structure represent the portions of S1 and S2 domains,

9

respectively.

Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant amino acid residues: The homo-trimer

12

structure is represented in newcartoon. The positions with the mutations among residues

13

of non-homologous physico-chemical characteristics are represented on the surface in

14

the A chain (light blue) only. In the “SIDE IN” perspective, the B and C chains are

15

represented in transparent newcartoon. The colors of each residue are represented by the

16

continent where the variations were identified.

Figure 4. Mapping of epitopes with variants on SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein: The homo-

19

trimer structure was represented in newcartoon. Epitopes are represented by their

20

surfaces in the A chain, in colors that represent the type of prediction as highlighted at

21

the top of the figure. The histogram below the structures represents the Spike protein

22

polypeptide chain with its domains, subdomains, motifs and epitopes proportionally

23

represented in relation to the primary sequence of the proteins.
