23

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and

24

impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-

25

CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination.

26

After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020

27

revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous

28

sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution

29

previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-

30

2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike

31

receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably

32

due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically

33

circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early

34

outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical

35

steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3

36

protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020

37

and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on

38

1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on

39

infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was

40

two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis,

41

haplotypes collected from Wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections,

42

both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated

43

from China.

SUMMARY
In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief

47

sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a

SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being

INTRODUCTION

58

A newly emerging coronavirus was detected in patients during an outbreak of

59

respiratory illnesses starting in mid-December of 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei

60

Province, China [1 , 2, 3]. Due to the similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the

61

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and genome organization similarity, the causal

62

virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [4].

63

As of 3/16/2020, 167,515 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in 114

64

countries, causing 6,606 fatalities. As a result, WHO declared the first pandemic caused by a

65

coronavirus on 3/11/2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-

66

2019/situation-reports). As the virus continues to spread, numerous strains have been isolated

67

and sequenced. On 3/18/2020, more than 500 complete or nearly complete genomes have

68

been sequenced and made publicly available.

69

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus found to infect humans. Among the other six,

70

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can cause severe respiratory illness, whereas 229E, HKU1,

71

NL63, and OC43 produce mild symptoms [5]. Current evidence strongly suggests that all

72

human associated coronaviruses originated from other animals, such as bats and rodents [5,

73

6]. While SARS-CoV-2 shares similar genomic structure with other coronaviruses [7-10], its

74

sequence differs substantially from some of the betacoronaviruses that infect humans, such as

75

SARS-CoV (approximately 76% identity), MERS-CoV (43% identity), and HKU-1 (33%

76

identity), but exhibits 96% similarity to a coronavirus collected in Yunnan Province, China

77

from a bat, Rhinolophus affinis. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated from bats [2,

78

11].

79
80

Several issues concerning the origin, time of virus introduction to humans,
evolutionary patterns, and the underlying driving force of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remain

81

to be clarified [12, 13]. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 and its related

82

coronaviruses. We discuss how mutational bias influences genetic diversity of the virus and

83

attempt to infer forces that shape SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

84

RESULTS

85

Molecular evolution of SARS-COV-2 and related coronaviruses

86

The resulting phylogeny reveals that RaTG13 is the closest relative of SARS-COV-2,

87

followed by pangolin_2019 and pangolin_2017, then CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21, and other

88

SARS-related sequences as outgroups (S1 Fig). According to general time reversible model,

89

transition occurred more frequent than transversion with C-T and A-G changes account for

90

45% and 28%, respectively, of all six types of nucleotide changes. We next estimated the

91

strength of selection for each coding region using the dN and dS. While purifying selection

92

tends to remove amino acid-altering mutations, thus reducing dN and dN/dS, positive

93

selection has the opposite effect, increasing dN and dN/dS [14]. Between SARS-CoV-2 and

94

RaTG13, orf8 gene exhibits the highest dN (0.032) followed by spike (0.013) and orf7

95

(0.011), all above the genome average of 0.007 (Table 1). dS varies greatly among CDSs

96

with the highest of 0.313 in spike and the lowest of 0.018 in envelope (genome average

97

0.168). Finally, dN/dS is the highest in orf8 (0.105) followed by orf7 (0.061) and orf3 (0.060),

98

with the genome average of 0.042. Since spike shows both high dS and dN, its protein

99

evolution rate (dN/dS) is only 0.040. Thus, while the coronavirus evolved very rapidly, it has

100
101

actually been under tremendous selective constraint [13].
Spike protein similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin_2019 led to the idea that

102

the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein originated from

103

pangolin_2019 via recombination [15-18]. If that were the case, we would expect the

104

divergence at synonymous sites (dS) to also be reduced in the RBD region. However, while

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038554; this version posted April 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

105

dN in the RBD region is 0.023, approximately one third of the estimate for the rest of the

106

spike gene (0.068), dS in the RBD (0.710) is actually slightly higher than in the rest of the

107

spike sequence (0.651). This argues against the recombination scenario. We noticed that the

108

dS of the whole spike and the RBD, are 2- and 3-fold, respectively, higher than the genome

109

average. Since synonymous sites are typically less influenced by selection, the increased

110

divergence in dS may reflect an underlying elevated mutation rate.

111

Genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2

112

We downloaded 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available from GISAID as of 2/23/2019.

113

The coding regions were aligned and 223 mutations were identified with 68 synonymous and

114

115 nonsynonymous changes. The directionality of changes was inferred based on the

115

RaTG13 sequence. Frequency spectra of both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes are

116

skewed. While the former shows excess of both high and low frequency mutations, the latter

117

mainly exhibits an excess of low frequency changes (Fig. 1a). The excess of low frequency

118

mutations is consistent with the recent origin of SARS-CoV-2 [19]. Both population

119

reduction and positive selection can increase high frequency mutations [20, 21]. However,

120

the first scenario is contradicted by the recent origin of the virus. If positive selection has

121

been operating, we would expect an excess of high frequency non-synonymous as well as

122

synonymous changes. Furthermore, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes is

123

2.46 (138/56) among singleton variants, but only 1.42 (17/12) among non-singletons. Both of

124

these observations suggest that the majority of amino acid-altering mutations are selected

125

against, with no positive selection in evidence.

126

The skew of synonymous variants toward high frequency deserves further discussion,

127

as it relates to the underlying force driving the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The puzzle is

128

probably rooted in how high and low frequency mutations are inferred. The results shown in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038554; this version posted April 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

129

the Fig. 1a are based on an outgroup comparison. The divergence at synonymous sites

130

between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is 17%, approximately 3-fold greater than between

131

humans and rhesus macaques [22]. With such high level of divergence, the possibility of

132

multiple substitutions cannot be ignored, especially since substitution in the coronavirus

133

genome is strongly biased toward transitions (see above). Indeed, among all non-singleton

134

mutations listed in Table 2, 62% of the changes are C-T transitions.

135

To get around the potential problem caused by multiple substitutions, we cross-

136

referenced the course of changes using the SARS-CoV-2 haplotype network (Fig. 2) and

137

phylogeny (S2 Fig). The two analyses yield very different pictures. For example, the highest

138

frequency derived mutation in Table 2 is a C-T synonymous change at 10138 (marked γ in

139

Fig 2 and Table 2). All three sequences from Singapore share the T nucleotide also found in

140

the RaTG13 outgroup. Using the outgroup comparison, the C found in the rest of the human

141

SARS-CoV-2 sequences is a derived mutation. However, the T at this position is restricted to

142

genomes collected from Singapore on 2/4 and 2/6/2020 and not found in earlier samples. It is

143

thus more sensible to infer that this T is a back mutation derived from C rather than an

144

ancestral nucleotide. Another synonymous change at position 24034 occurred twice

145

(C24034T) on different genomic backgrounds (marked κ in Fig 2). Although the outgroup

146

sequence at this position is T, it is more likely that the C at this position is the ancestral

147

nucleotide. We observed a number of such back or repeated mutations. An A-T

148

nonsynonymous change at 29019 (D249H in nucleocapsid protein, marked O in Fig. 2) also

149

occurred twice.

150

Repeated mutations may be caused by intergenomic recombination. Indeed, the result

151

of four haplotype test suggested that at least two recombination events may have occurred

152

between positions 8782 and 11083 and between 11083 and 28854. We noticed that a

153

sequence isolated on 1/21/2020 from a patient in the United States (EPI_ISL_404253)

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038554; this version posted April 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

154

exhibited Y (C or T) at both positions 8,782 and 28,144. Although, the possibility that two

155

novel mutations might be occurred within this patient cannot be 100% ruled out, the

156

alternative explanation that this patient may have been co-infected by two viral strains seems

157

more plausible.

158

After cross-referencing with the haplotype network and the phylogeny, all mutations

159

listed as high frequency in Table 2 and Fig. 1a were re-assigned to the other side of the

160

frequency spectra. We only see an excess of singleton mutations, consistent with a recent

161

origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1b) and suggesting that the virus has mainly evolved under

162

constraint.

163

Perhaps the most controversial case is the T-C change at position 28814 which alters

164

Leucine (L) to Serine (S) in orf8 protein (L84S). Since both pangolin and RaTG13 have a C

165

at this position (Table 2), Tang et al suggested that 84L is derived from 84S in the human

166

virus [13]. The 84S was not discovered until 1/5/2020, by which time 23 SARS-CoV-2

167

genomes have been sampled. After the first appearance, its frequency gradually increased,

168

reaching approximately 30% by 1/23/2020, suggesting that 84S may exhibit some advantage

169

over 84L. If genomes carrying 84S were ancestral, it would be a challenge to explain its

170

absence in early samplings. In addition, as mentioned above, C-T transitions are dominant in

171

coronavirus evolution and multiple hits were observed in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2). It is

172

therefore possible that 28814C mutated to T after ancestral SARS-CoV-2 diverged from the

173

common ancestor with RaTG13 and recently changed back to C. Finally, if 84L is indeed a

174

derived haplotype and has rapidly increased in its frequency by positive selection, we would

175

expect haplotypes carrying 84L to have accumulated more derived mutations than haplotypes

176

with 84S. However, after correcting for mutational direction, the two haplotypes exhibited

177

similar mutation frequency spectra (S3 Fig). The alternative hypothesis that 84S is a back

178

mutation from 84L is more plausible.

179
180

Selection pressure on SARS-CoV-2
In addition to L84S, a G-T transversion at 26114 which caused an amino acid change

181

in orf3 protein (G251V) is also at intermediate frequency (Table 2). 251V was first seen on

182

1/22/2020 and gradually increased its frequency to 13% by our sampling date (Fig. 3). We

183

note that the emergence of 84S in orf8 and 251V in orf3 are consistent with the lockdown of

184

Wuhan on 1/23/2020. The former first appeared in early January, gradually increased its

185

frequency, and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020. The latter showed up on 1/22/2020 and

186

rapidly increased its frequency within two weeks.

187

Based on Fig. 3, we divided the sampling course into two epidemic episodes, from the

188

first sampled sequence (12/24/2019) to before the lockdown of Wuhan (1/21/2020) and from

189

1/22/2020 to the date of the last sequence sampling (2/23/2020). The dN/dS of coding regions

190

within the two episodes were estimated. As roughly 87% of mutations were singletons. Many

191

of these are probably sequencing errors, affecting synonymous and nonsynonymous sites

192

equally and inflating our dN/dS estimates. In addition, since dN/dS is already extremely

193

small in SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1), such inflation would have a large effect on dN/dS estimates.

194

We therefore excluded singletons from dN and dS estimation.

195

The dN/dS of orf8 gene in episode I and II and orf3 gene in episode II show strong

196

signatures of positive selection, consistent with increase of 84S and 251V frequency during

197

these periods, and may suggest a role of adaptation (Table 3). The overall dN/dS within each

198

episode was 5-10 times higher than dN/dS between coronavirus genomes derived from

199

different species (Table 1). The elevated dN/dS of SARS-CoV-2 is either due to its

200

adaptation to human hosts or relaxation of selection. For a recently emerged virus, it is

201

reasonable to expect operation of positive selection at the early stage. In that case, the dN/dS

202

during episode I should be greater than during episode II [23, 24].

203

However, dN/dS was smaller in episode I than in episode II across the majority of the

204

genome, suggesting that elevation of dN/dS is probably mostly due to the relaxation of

205

selection. We further divided episode I into Ia and Ib, according to the appearance of 84S in

206

orf8 protein on 1/6/2020. The genome-wide dN/dS values were 0.27 and 0.23 for episode 1a

207

and 1b, respectively (S1 Table). Therefore, as shown in the frequency spectra, the signature

208

of positive selection is weak at the early stage of the epidemic.

209

The origin of SARS-CoV-2

210

The estimated mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.4x10-3/site/year with 95% highest

211

posterior density (HPD) of 1.5-3.3x10-3/site/year. The mutation rate at the third codon

212

position is 2.9x10-3/site/year (95% HPD 1.8−4.0x10-3/site/year), which is in a good

213

agreement with synonymous mutation rate of SARS-CoV, 1.67−4.67 x 10-3 /site/year [24].

214

SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have originated on 12/11/2019 (95% HPD

215

11/13/2019−12/23/2019). We have to point out that the TMRCA estimation is strongly

216

influenced by the genome sampling scheme. Since the earliest available genome was sampled

217

on 12/24/2019 almost one month after the outbreak, the real origin of the current outbreak

218

may actually be earlier than our estimation.

219

We estimated genetic variation, including the number of segregating sites,

220

Watterson’s estimator of θ, and nucleotide diversity (π) of the SARS-CoV-2. Since both π

221

and θ are estimators of 4Nu (N and u are the effective population size and mutation rate,

222

respectively), they should be close to each other at the mutation-drift equilibrium [25].

223

Because θ is strongly influenced by rare mutations which are common during recent

224

population expansion [14], it is a better estimator of genetic diversity for SARS-CoV-2. For

225

example, when all samples are considered, θ (13.92 x 10-4) is approximately eight times

226

higher than π (1.81 x 10-4, Table 4). Among samples collected from different locations,

227

sequences from China exhibited higher genetic variation in terms of the number of

228

segregating sites, θ and π, than the rest of the world combined, consistent with the

229

observation that the outbreak originated in China, as the source populations are expected to

230

exhibit higher genetic variation than derived populations [25].

231

The haplotype network also supports this notion (Fig. 2). Usually, ancestral

232

haplotypes have a greater probability of being in the interior, have more mutational

233

connections, and are geographically more widely distributed. The H1 haplotype is at the

234

center of the network and is found in four countries and many places in China. In addition, a

235

large portion of haplotypes is directly connected to H1. Therefore, it is likely that H1 is the

236

ancestral haplotype. As 45% of H1 are found in Wuhan, this location is the most plausible

237

origin of the ongoing pandemic.

238

DISCUSSION

239

A close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin_2019 at the amino acid

240

level in the RBD region of the spike protein might be due to recent recombination [15, 16],

241

data contamination, or convergent evolution. Since recent recombination and DNA

242

contamination should affect synonymous and nonsynonymous sites equally, they can be

243

convincingly rejected as great divergence at synonymous sites was observed in spite of

244

similar amino acid sequences between the two genomes. While genotypic convergence may

245

be observed in viruses repeatedly evolving under particular conditions, such as drug

246

resistance and immune escape [26-29], it is otherwise rare. For adaptations that do not

247

involve highly specialized conditions, divergent molecular pathways may develop and

248

genotypic convergence would not be expected [30]. For example, SARS-CoV and SARS-

249

CoV-2 both use the spike protein to bind human ACE2 [2], but five out of six critical amino

250

acids within the RBD are different between these two viruses [17]. Since the SARS-CoV-2

and pangolin_2019 have diverged at about 47% of synonymous sites and infect different

252

hosts, the idea that they share five out of six critical amino acids within RBD through

253

convergent evolution seems far-fetched.

254

We therefore hypothesize that, instead of convergent evolution, the similarity of RBD

255

between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin_2019 was caused by an ancient inter-genomic

256

recombination. Assuming a synonymous substitution rate of 2.9x10-3/site/year, the

257

recombination was estimated to have occurred approximately 40 years ago (95% HPD : 31-

258

69 years; divergence time (t) = divergence (dS)/(substitution rate x 2 x 3), considering dS in

259

RBD is 3-fold of genome average). The amino acids in the RBD region of the two genomes

260

have been maintained by natural selection ever since, while synonymous substitutions have

261

been accumulated. If this is true, SARS-CoV-2 may have circulated cryptically among

262

humans for years before being recently noticed.

263

The ancient origin of SARS-CoV-2 is supported by its lack of a signature of adaptive

264

evolution as shown by frequency spectra and dN/dS in samples from the recent epidemic. For

265

a recently acquired virus, rapid evolution and a strong signature of positive selection are

266

expected. For example, during its short epidemic in 2002-2003, several rounds of adaptive

267

changes have been documented in SARS-CoV genomes [23, 24]. After adapting to its host,

268

the virus may evolve under purifying or relaxed selection, exactly as we see in SARS-CoV-2.

269

Therefore, it is important to sequence samples from the early outbreak and to examine

270

hospital archives for the trace of SARS-CoV-2 ancestors. This information not only can help

271

us to understand the evolutionary path of this virus but also unravel the critical steps for it to

272

achieve effective spreading in humans.

273
274

In addition to the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein also contains a small insertion
of a polybasic cleavage site which was thought to be unique within the B lineage of

275

betacoronaviruses [17]. However, a recent analysis of bats collected from Yunnan, China,

276

identified a similar insertion in a sequence, RmYN02, closely related to SARS-CoV-2,

277

providing strong evidence that such seemingly sorcerous site insertions can occur in nature

278

[11]. Both the polybasic cleavage site in RmYN02 and RBD in pangolin_2019 suggest that,

279

like with SARS-CoV [6], all genetic elements required to form SARS-CoV-2 may have

280

existed in the environment. More importantly, they can be brought together by frequent

281

intergenomic recombination (see Result). Nature never runs out of material to create new

282

pathogens. It is not whether but when and where the next epidemic will occur.

283

There is a heated debate about the evolutionary forces influencing the trajectory of the

284

L84S mutation in orf8 protein (http://virological.org/t/response-to-on-the-origin-and-

285

continuing-evolution-of-sars-cov-2/418). While Tang et al. considered Serine is the ancestral

286

amino acid [13], we present evidence that it is a back mutation. The majority of sequences in

287

Wuhan were sampled before early January 2020 and most genomes carrying 84S were found

288

outside Wuhan after middle to late January 2020. The discrepancy in time and space impedes

289

the effort to resolve the debate. It would require more sequences from the early stage of the

290

epidemic to settle this issue. Regardless of its ancestral or derived status, we hypothesize that

291

84S may confer some selective advantage. Unless the sampling scheme is deliberately

292

skewed, it is difficult to explain such dramatic frequency gain of 84S, from 0 to ~30% in two

293

weeks. Oddly, its frequency ceased to increase after 1/23/2020, when Wuhan was locked

294

down. This coincidence prompts us to consider the effect of social distancing on virus

295

transmission. Another line of evidence comes from the frequency increase of 215V in orf3

296

protein. The 215V first appeared on 1/22/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency within two

297

weeks.

298

Several studies suggested that the orf8 protein may function in viral replication,

299

modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting interferon

300

responses in host cells (41-45 [31 , 32-35]. During the SARS spread, frequency of several

301

orf8 mutations fluctuated in accordance with different phases of the outbreak, suggesting that

302

orf8 underwent adaptation during the SARS epidemic [24]. It is suggested that 84S may

303

induce structural disorder in the C‐terminus of the protein and may generate a novel

304

phosphorylation target for Serine/Threonine kinases of the mammalian hosts [36].

305

SARS-CoV orf3 protein has been shown to activate NF-κB and the NLRP3

306

inflammasome and causes necrotic cell death, lysosomal damage, and caspase-1 activation.

307

In addition, orf3 is required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence. All of the

308

above likely contributes to the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV infection [37-39].

309

Therefore, these two mutations may have some functional consequences and be worth

310

investigating further. By the time we prepared this manuscript, the 215V frequency ceased to

311

increase. However, a parallel mutation has occurred in a different genomic background,

312

further supporting the idea that this mutation may require further study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

314

Data collection

315

137 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from the Global Initiative on

316

Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID, https://www.gisaid.org/). Related coronavirus

317

sequences, including those from five related bat sequences (RaTG13, HUK3-1, ZC45, ZXC-

318

21, and GX2013), two pangolins (each from Guangdong (pangolin_2019) and Guangxi

319

(pangolin_2017)), were downloaded from GenBank

320

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/). Nucleotide positions and coding sequences

321

(CDSs) of SARS-CoV-2 were anchored to the reference genome NC_045512. CDS

322

annotations of other coronaviruses were downloaded from GenBank.

Sequence analyses and phylogeny construction
CDSs were aligned based on translated amino acid sequences using MUSCLE v3.8.31

325

[40], and back-translated to their corresponding DNA sequences using TRANALIGN

326

software from the EMBOSS package (http://emboss.open-bio.org/) [41]. Nucleotide diversity,

327

including number of segregating sites, Watterson’s estimator of θ [42], and nucleotide

328

diversity (π)[43], was estimated using MEGA-X [44]. MEGA-X was also used for

329

phylogenetic construction. Phylogenetic relationships were constructed using the neighbor-

330

joining method based on Kimura’s two-parameter model. Number of nonsynonymous

331

changes per nonsynonymous site (dN) and synonymous changes per synonymous site (dS)

332

among genomes were estimated based Li-Wu-Luo’s method [45] implemented in MEGA-X

333

and PAML 4 [46].The RDP file for the haplotype network analyses was generated using

334

DnaSP 6.0 [47] and input into Network 10 (https://www.fluxus-engineering.com/) to

335

construct the haplotype network using the median joining algorithm. Four haplotype test

336

implemented in DnaSp was applied to test for possible recombination event.

337

The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 and the time to the most recent common ancestor

338

(TMRCA) of virus isolates were estimated by an established Bayesian MCMC approach

339

implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 [48]. The sampling dates were incorporated into

340

TMRCA estimation. The analysis was performed using the HKY model of nucleotide

341

substitution assuming an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock [49]. We linked

342

substitution rates for the first and second codon positions and allowed independent rates in

343

the third codon position. We performed two independent runs with 3×108 MCMC steps and

344

the results were combined. Log files were checked using Tracer

345

(http://beast.bgio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer). Effective sample sizes were >300 for all parameters.

Mutation types and numbers are given along the branch. Mutations that are involved in different
evolutionary pathways or occurred more than once are enclosed. Also see Table 2 for comparison.
Six genomes, EPI_ISL_ 408511, 408512, 410480, 408483, 407079, 407079, were excluded from
this analysis because they contain too many ‘N’ in the sequences.
