Abstract
Introduction: A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was
recently identified as the pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. SARS-CoV-2
triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in
severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV
virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for
entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in
cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS
system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced
reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe
acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of
ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome.
Methods: Here, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome
organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the
ACE2 gene.
Results: We identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR,
CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory
responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum,
respectively.
Conclusion: Our study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory
interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral
silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular
environment suitable for viral replication.
Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, ARDS, ACE2

Introduction

47

Within months of the first reports [1], the COVID-19 outbreak has become a pandemic

48

infecting and killing thousands of people worldwide [2]. COVID-19 is an infectious disease

49

associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a

50

Betacoronavirus that is 80% identical to the SARS-CoV virus [3]. Betacoronaviruses,

51

including SARS-CoV, Murine Hepatic Virus (MHV), and SARS-CoV-2, utilize the ACE2

52

protein for cell entry [4,5]. The Spike protein on SARS-CoV-2 has a 10 to 20 fold higher

53

affinity for the ACE2 protein than its SARS-CoV homologue [3,6].

54

The ACE2 protein is highly expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial

55

cells [3,7,8], where ACE2 is a primary modulator of the renin–angiotensin (RAS) system that

56

regulates blood flow, pressure and fluid homeostasis [9]. The ACE2 protein and the products

57

of the reactions it catalyzes have also been implicated in immune responses and anti-

58

inflammatory pathways [10–12].

59

SARS-CoV infection reduces ACE2 gene expression and this is thought to contribute to severe

60

acute respiratory failure [4] by triggering an imbalance in the RAS system that causes a loss of

61

fluid homeostasis, induces inflammatory responses [10,13,14], and results in severe acute

62

injury in heart and lung [3,15,16]. As mentioned above, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

63

utilize the ACE2 protein for cell entry. Poor prognoses in elderly SARS-CoV-2 patients (≥65

64

years old) are frequently associated with a pre-existing reduction in ACE2 expression and

65

imbalance in ACE2-related host derived pathways [17,18]. ACE2 is an X-linked gene whose

66

expression is regulated by chromatin structure. Brg1, a chromatin remodeler, and the FoxM1

67

transcription factor recognize the ACE2 promoter and reduce expression through a mechanism

68

involving structural chromatin changes [19]. This control is complex, as illustrated by the
2

69

finding that ACE2 gene escapes X chromosome-inactivation and shows a heterogeneous sex

70

bias that is tissue dependent [20].

71

Chromatin structure in the nucleus involves non-random folding of DNA on different scales

72

[21]. This folding and the resulting contacts that form are dynamic, and can be disrupted (e.g.

73

by genetic variation) leading to altered enhancer-promoter interactions that result in changes

74

in gene expression [22]. Changing chromatin structure rewires interactions between regulatory

75

elements and the genes they control. Theoretically and practically, each component of this

76

change contributes to the observed pathogenesis [23,24], and can lead to developmental

77

disorders[25] and cancer [26–28].

78

Virus-induced chromatin changes at the ACE2 locus could induce expression changes in

79

additional genes regulated by elements located within this locus and thus may alter/modulate

80

host factors important for SARS-CoV-2 replication. How can you identify the elements within

81

a gene regulatory network like this? One approach to identify the networks that form between

82

regulatory elements and the genes they control is to use information on the physical interactions

83

that are captured occurring between the elements. Physical interactions between two sites can

84

be captured and identified using Hi-C [29,30]. We have used this insight to develop a

85

discovery-based pipeline (CoDeS3D; S1 Fig) [23]. Our approach uses genetic variation (e.g.

86

single nucleotide polymorphisms) to identify changes in gene expression and thus determine if

87

a region that physically contacts a gene contains a regulatory element. This enables the rapid

88

identification of the regulatory networks that form in cells and tissues (e.g. [23,31]).

89

We hypothesized that ACE2 and its flanking region contained regulatory elements that

90

coordinate the expression of other genes, and that virus induced chromatin changes at ACE2

91

inadvertently modulate host factors that promote viral replication. Here we undertook an in3

92

depth characterization of the regulatory control regions within ACE2 and their activity in lung

93

tissue. Regulatory elements located within ACE2 affect the expression levels of the PIR and

94

CA5B genes. PIR and CA5B are involved in NF-kB regulation and pyrimidine synthesis,

95

respectively. VPS13C, encoding a factor required for late stage endosome maturation, is also

96

controlled by a putative enhancer located in intron 11 of BMX, adjacent to ACE2. We propose

97

that ACE2 repression by SARS-CoV-2 trips a chromatin-based switch that coordinates the

98

activity of these regulatory elements and thus the genes they control. Collectively, these

99

changes inadvertently lead to the development of a pro-viral replication environment.

Methods

104

Identification of SNPs in the ACE locus

105

We selected all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from dbSNP (build153)

106

with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 1% that were located within chrX:15,519,996-

107

15,643,106, which included the ACE2 gene and its flanking region (hereafter ACE2 locus).

108

SNP positions are as reported for the human genome build hg38 release 75 (GRCh38).

109

Identification of tissue-specific SNP-gene spatial relationships in the ACE locus

110

We used the CoDeS3D algorithm [23] to identify putative spatial regulatory interactions for all

111

SNPs at the ACE2 locus (S1 Fig). CoDeS3D integrates data on physical chromatin interactions

112

within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data

113

to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To get lung-specific spatial

114

connections, we identified SNP-gene pairs across lung-specific Hi-C libraries using published

115

data for IMR90, A549, and NCI-H460 cell lines and lung tissue (GEO accession numbers

116

GSE35156, GSE43070, GSE63525, GSE105600, GSE105725, GSE92819, GSE87112, S1

Table). We then queried GTEx for eQTL associations with lung tissue (dbGaP Accession

118

phs000424.v8.p2, https://gtexportal.org/home/). The age of the GTEx lung sample donors

119

peaks between 50-60 years (S2 Fig). SNPs were assigned to the appropriate Hi-C restriction

120

fragments by digital digestion of the hg38 reference genome (matching the restriction enzyme

121

from the Hi-C libraries: MboI or HindIII). All SNP-fragments were queried against the Hi-C

122

databases to identify the distal DNA fragments with which they physically interact. For each

123

distal fragment, which overlapped a gene coding region, a SNP-gene spatial connection was

124

confirmed. There was no binning or padding around restriction fragments to obtain gene

125

overlap. Spatial tissue-specific SNP-gene pairs with significant eQTLs (both cis-acting [<1Mb

Results

146

The ACE2 locus harbors regulatory variants that control SARS-CoV-2 relevant cellular

147

functions:

148

We tested 367 common SNPs located across the ACE2 locus (chrX: 15,519,996-15,643,106)

149

for their potential to act as spatial eQTLs. None of the common SNPs we tested affected ACE2

150

expression levels in lung tissue (S2 Table).

151

The wider ACE2 locus (chrX: 15,519,996-15,643,106; GRCh38/hg38) sits within a

152

topologically associating domain (TAD) that is conserved across some tissues, e.g. IMR90 (Fig

153

1A). Therefore, it was not surprising that we identified control elements within this ACE2 locus

154

(Fig 1A). The distribution of targets for the putative control elements we identified is consistent

155

with previous studies that show that while the majority of significant eQTLs fall within 100 kb

156

of the transcription start site of a gene, only 60% of all eQTLs are upstream of the gene they

157

regulate[32]. Notable amongst the elements we identified are long distance trans-regulatory

158

interactions involving: 1) rs1399200:VPS13C (chr15:61,852,389-62,060,473; encodes

159

vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13C); and 2) rs6632680:PHKA2 (chrX:18,892,300-

160

18,984,598; encodes phosphorylase kinase regulatory subunit alpha 2) (S2 Table).

161

We identified eighty genetic variants within the ACE2 locus as cis-acting spatial eQTLs that

162

physically modulate the expression of genes PIR (encodes Pirin), CA5BP1 (a pseudogene of

163

CA5B), and CA5B (encodes mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase) in lung tissues (S2 Table).

164

Fifty-eight SNPs located across the region are associated with increased expression of PIR

165

(log2[aFC, allelic fold change] 0.462 ± 0.07) consistent with the elements they mark repressing

166

PIR transcription. Eighteen SNPs located across the region are associated with decreased

167

expression of CA5B (log2[aFC] -0.257 ± 0.005) consistent with the elements they mark

168

enhancing CA5B transcription. These variants occurred in two clusters: 1) within the ACE2

169

gene; and 2) within the CLTRN (TMEM27) gene – a known homologue of ACE2. Expression

170

of CA5BP1, a pseudogene of CA5B, was also repressed (log2[aFC] -0.21 ± 0.01) by 6 SNPs

171

within the ACE2 locus. Within ACE2 itself there were only control regions for the PIR and

172

CA5B genes (Fig 1B).

173

The common variants that we tested show an unusual ancestry associated pattern of minor

174

allele frequencies (Fig 1B). Specifically, the East Asian population (1K Genomes project)

175

displays little variation across the bulk of the variants we analyzed. This observation is

176

supported by measures of genetic diversity (FST) between the Indian, Chinese and Malay

177

populations within the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort

178

(S3 Table). However, this pattern breaks down at several positions across the ACE2 gene

179

(including rs4646142, rs2285666, and rs2106809, which show significant selection towards

180

the reference allele) in all of the tested populations, indicating potential selective pressure at

181

these loci (Fig 1B). Notably, two of these variants alter potential transcription factor binding

182

sites (i.e. rs2285666 alters HNF1, and Ncx motifs, rs2106809 alters a CEBPB motif; S4 Table).

183

All three variants (rs4646142, rs2285666, and rs2106809) have previously been associated

184

with allele, sex and ethnicity specific impacts on hypertension, blood pressure, hypertrophic

185

cardiomyopathy, type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction (reviewed in[33]). Moreover, the

186

CEBPB motif is recognized by the CCAAT enhancer binding protein-β which has been

187

implicated in inflammatory responses in lung carcinoma cells [34].

190

We identified transcription regulatory elements for CA5B and PIR that are active in lung tissue

191

and are located within the ACE2 gene. We also identified a transcription regulatory element

192

(located in the BMX gene, adjacent to ACE2) for the PIR and VPS13C genes. It is sterically

193

impossible for a single DNA sequence to simultaneously be transcribed and regulate another

194

gene through a physical connection. Therefore, we propose that SARS-CoV-2-induced

195

chromatin-dependent repression of ACE2 expression in lung enables the regulatory sites,

196

repressing PIR and activating CA5B, to exhibit increased functionality in infected cells (Fig 2).

197

We hypothesize that this regulatory change extends to coordinate changes in the expression of

198

VPS13C and PHKA2 in ways that promote viral proliferation. This host regulatory network has

199

not evolved to benefit the virus but rather, these regulatory changes inadvertently produce an

200

environment advantageous for the virus.

201

The CA5B gene encodes a mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase that catalyzes the reversible

202

hydration of CO2 in the lung. This reaction is important in mitochondria as it supplies HCO3-

203

ions required by pyruvate carboxylase for gluconeogenesis, and by carbamoyl phosphate

204

synthase 1 (CSP1) for pyrimidine biosynthesis (Fig 2B) [38–40]. Pyrimidines are important

205

host factors critical for viral genomic replication, mRNA synthesis for protein translation, and

206

phospholipid synthesis [41]. Inhibiting de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis impacts on SARS-

207

CoV-2 replication [18]. CSP1 additionally produces a precursor for the biosynthesis of

208

polyamines, small aliphatic molecules that play important roles in virus replication. Inhibition

209

of polyamine biosynthesis significantly impaired replication of the Middle East Respiratory

210

Syndrome [MERS] coronavirus [42]. Targeted inhibition of CA5B encoded carbonic

211

anhydrase might therefore decrease levels of critical host factors pyrimidines and polyamines

212

- critical host factors needed for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Intriguingly, similarities in the

213

pathologies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) have led to

214

the suggestion that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors could be used to treat or prevent Covid-19

215

infection [43].

216

Interleukin expression is responsible for irreversible, pathological changes associated with

217

SARS-CoV infection in the lung (e.g. [44]). Human coronavirus has been shown to fine-tune

218

NF-κB signaling [45]. PIR encodes a non-heme iron binding protein that is a redox switch that

219

modulates the binding of p65 (RelA) to NF-κB responsive promoters [46]. NF-κB regulates

220

multiple immune function aspects, including the production of pro-inflammatory

221

cytokines[47]. Therefore, it is notable that repressor regulatory sequences for PIR sit within

222

the ACE2 gene (Fig 2A). We postulate that the chromatin modifications that silence ACE2

223

expression upon early stage infection activate the PIR repressor (Fig 2B). This reduces

224

responsiveness of NF-κB, and thereby delays the expected and needed anti-viral response.

225

Reduction in PIR expression would also reduce the impact of any changes to intra-cellular

226

redox state caused by that SARS-CoV-2 infection, however little is known and future

227

experiments are required to clarify this.

228

The enveloped Betacoronaviruses (MHV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) gain entry to the cell

229

through the endo/lysosomal pathway and require late endosomal maturation for fusion [48].

230

Therefore, it is interesting to speculate on the impact of coordinated changes to VPS13C

231

expression. The VPS13 family are endoplasmic reticulum associated lipid transporters.

232

VPS13C is proposed to act as a lipid transporter at organelle contact sites between (i) the

233

endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endolysosomes, and (ii) the ER and lipid droplets, where it

234

transfers lipids, potentially bulk lipid transfer, between organelles to maintain lipid

235

homeostasis and organelle functionality [49]. Increased VPS13C expression is predicted to

236

increase the extent of contact and lipid transfer between these organelles. This in turn could

237

enhance the virus’s replication capacity and pathogenesis, as the ER plays both a physical and

238

functional central role in the virus’s capacity to replicate and form new viral progeny.

239

Moreover, SARS-CoV extensively reorganizes the host cell’s membranes infrastructure to

240

produce a reticulo-vesicular network of modified ER to coordinate its replication cycle [50].

241

Alterations to ER-lipid droplet contacts mediated by VPS13C could support the virus’s

242

required expansion and re-organization of ER membranes by altering lipid flow through the

243

ER [51]. Notably, cells infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a positive-strand RNA virus

244

like SARS-CoV-2, contain ER-derived membranous structures that contain significantly high

245

levels of cholesterol, despite the ER of uninfected cells possessing relatively low cholesterol

246

levels [52]. Increased VPS13C-mediated ER-endolysosomal contact sites could increase the

247

capacity of endocytosed dietary cholesterol to be delivered to the ER and enhance the virus’s

248

ability to replicate. Pharmacological impairment of endolysosomal cholesterol efflux reduced

249

HCV replication, [52] suggesting another possible therapeutic approach for investigation to

250

slow SARS-CoV-2 replication. ER stress, impacted by changes to VPS13C expression, may

251

also contribute to late infection stage NF-κB activation (reviewed in [53]).

252

The significance of the putative enhancer for PHKA2, which encodes the phosphorylase kinase

253

regulatory subunit alpha 2, is unclear. Mutations in this gene have been linked to glycogen

254

storage disorders and glucose metabolism. Thus, linkages can be drawn to the increased

255

expression of CA5B, which impacts on gluconeogenesis. Notably, PHKA2 was downregulated

256

in plasma from individuals with hepatocellular-carcinoma caused by HCV infections [54].

257

Theoretically, chromatin remodeling in response to SARS-COV-2 infection could down-

258

regulate PHKA2 expression. However, there is a paucity of information linking this gene to

259

viral infections or the lung and this conclusion requires additional experimental support.

260

SARS-CoV is known to repress ACE2 expression [4]. ACE2 regulation involves chromatin

261

remodeling and structural chromatin changes [19]. Several of the regions that we identified

262

overlapped or were adjacent to CTCF biding sites (e.g. rs1399200, which regulates PIR and

263

VPS13C; rs6629111, which regulates CA5B; and sites [rs714205, rs1514280, rs4240157 and

264

rs4646131] within ACE2[33]). We also note that the regulatory sites we identified included

265

transcription factor binding sites for Ap-1, RXRA (a DNA-binding receptor involved in host-

266

virus interactions) [55], GR or NR3C1 (a regulator of inflammation in asthma and COPD) [56],

267

Pou2f2 (trans-activator of NR3C1)[57], and P300 (a chromatin modifier; S4 Table) [58].

268

Expression data within the search-based exploration of expression compendium (SEEK)

269

supports a strong co-expression relationship between ACE2 and PIR (lung cancer, ovarian

270

tumor) and a weaker association with CA5B (ovarian cancer) (http://seek.princeton.edu/ [59]).

271

However, the possible mechanism(s) that link ACE2 silencing to alterations associated with

272

these regulatory regions remains unknown until empirically determined in lung cells in the

273

presence/absence of real or simulated viral infection.

274

Whilst this study is novel and uses empirically derived data in the analyses, the observations

275

are limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is only putative until

276

proven by targeted experiments. Ideally, the Hi-C datasets should be derived from matched

277

tissues prior and post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, the GTEx database has recognized

278

limitations, including the ethnic diversity of the samples. These limitations will form the basis

279

of future studies.

282

We identified putative regulatory regions in and surrounding ACE2 that regulate the expression

283

of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. We contend that viral induced chromatin-dependent

284

repression of the ACE2 gene increases the activity of these regulatory sites and promotes an

285

intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication. The altered gene products represent

286

new targets for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

Fig 1. Elements located within and surrounding the ACE2 locus regulate the lung-specific
expression of PIR, CA5B, CA5BP1, VPS13C, and PHKA2. (A) Common genetic variants
(SNPs) located within the ACE2 locus form spatial cis-acting regulatory interactions with PIR,
CA5BP1, and CA5B across sub-TAD boundaries on chrX:15,300,000-15,600,000. Inter-TAD
trans-acting interactions regulate PHKA2 (3.2 Mb away) and VPS13C (located on chromosome
15). Visualization of TAD and chromatin interactions was performed using the 3D genome
browser
(http://yuelab.org/)[35]
and
UCSC
browser’s
interact
tool
(http://genome.ucsc.edu)[36], respectively. (B) Within ACE2, MAFs for the SNPs that tag the
regulatory sites showed significant bias in four different populations (i.e. African [AFR], Ad
Mixed American [AMR], East Asian [ASN] and European [EUR]) at one PIR (rs714205) and
three CA5B regulatory sites (rs4646142, rs2285666, and rs2106809), consistent with selection
acting
on
these
loci.

Fig 2. Hypothesis: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an ACE2 dependent switch
that alters expression of proteins that promote an environment for viral proliferation in
the lung. (A) In middle-aged non-infected individuals, control regions within ACE2 are
capable of downregulating the expression of PIR, which is involved in the NF-κB pathway.
Enhancer elements within ACE2 are poised to upregulate CA5B expression, which encodes an
enzyme important for pyrimidine synthesis. In addition to this, an enhancer region within the
BMX gene (still within the same TAD) contributes to VPS13C regulation. (B) We hypothesize
that upon viral infection, SARS-COV-2 represses ACE2 expression, which increases the
activity of the PIR repressor and CA5B enhancer. This results in a reduction in the production
of PIR - the redox switch necessary for NF-κB activation, while also increasing pyrimidine
synthesis, which is necessary for viral replication.

specific Hi-C libraries were interrogated to identify genes in fragments that spatially interact
(in cis- and trans-) with SNP-containing fragments. The identified spatial SNP-gene pairs were
further used to query GTEx lung tissue (dbGaP Accession phs000424.v8.p2,
UBERON:0008952). The Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control algorithm was applied to adjust
the p values of the resulting eQTL associations to identify only significant (FDR < 0.05) lungspecific SNP-gene spatial relationships in the ACE locus.

S2 Figure. The eQTL data used in this study was obtained from lung samples taken from
middle-aged individuals. To assess the correlation of genetic variation with the changes in
gene expression, the GTEx project (https://gtexportal.org/home/) collected and analysed lung
samples from donors who were densely genotyped. The age-distribution graph illustrates that
approximately 70% of the lung samples that were obtained were from donors aged between 50
and 60.
