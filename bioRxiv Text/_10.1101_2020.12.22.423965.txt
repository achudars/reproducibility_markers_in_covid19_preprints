SUMMARY
Timely development of vaccines and antiviral drugs are critical to control the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic 1-6. Current methods for validation of vaccine
efficacy involve the use of pseudoviruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)
pseudotyped lentivirus or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), to quantify neutralizing antibodies for
blocking viral infection 7-14. The process of pseudovirus infection and quantification is time
consuming and can take days to complete. In addition, pseudoviruses contain structural proteins
not native to SARS-CoV-2, which may alter particle properties in receptor binding and responses
to antibody neutralization 15. Here we describe the development of a new hybrid alphavirusSARS-CoV-2 particle (Ha-CoV-2) for rapid screening and quantification of neutralization
antibodies and antiviral drugs. Ha-CoV-2 is a non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle,
composed of only SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and a RNA genome derived
from a fast expressing alphavirus vector 16. We demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can rapidly and
robustly express reporter genes in target cells within 3-5 hours following viral entry. We further
validate the Ha-CoV-2 system for rapid quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral
drugs. In addition, we assembled a Ha-CoV-2 particle bearing the D614G mutant spike protein,
and found that the mutation led to an approximately 200% increase in virion infectivity. These
results demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can also be applied for rapid monitoring and quantification of
viral mutations for effects on neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly spreading, novel
beta-coronavirus that is causing the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) 17-21. SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 76 million infections and 1.7 million deaths
globally as of December 2020. Antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibodies are expected to be
effective to combat the pandemic. In particular, neutralizing antibodies, induced by vaccines or
by the virus, can play a critical role in controlling and preventing infection. Currently, only one
FDA-approved drug, remdesivir, is available to reduce hospital stay 1; no effective drug is
available to lower mortality. Several vaccine candidates have recently shown significant results
in phase III clinical trials 2-6, and have been approved or in the approval process for emergency
use. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of vaccines needs to be continuously monitored for the
induction of neutralizing antibodies against evolving viral mutants in circulation.
Current antiviral drug screening and quantification of neutralizing antibodies rely on the use
of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses 7-14. The use of live virus requires biosafety level (BSL) 3 facility
and practice, which limits the use of wild-type virus in common laboratories. Both lentivirus and
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, are used in cellbased neutralization assays and in antiviral drug screening 8-11. SARS-CoV-2 contains four
structural proteins: the spike protein (S), the membrane protein (M), the envelope protein (E),
and the nucleocapsid protein (N) 22,23. S is the major viral protein responsible for virus
attachment and entry to the target cells 24-26, and thus, is commonly used to pseudotype viruses.
The process of pseudotyping involves the use of a reporter genome and the capsid proteins of
lentivirus or VSV. In practice, lenti-based pseudoviruses are produced by co-transfection of
vectors encoding the lentiviral gag-pol structure proteins, a reporter genome, and the S protein 10.

The VSV-based pseudovirus is generated by transfection of a producer cell line with a SARSCoV-2 S expression vector, and then followed by infection of the cell with a VSV reporter virus
that lacks the VSV major spike glycoprotein (G). The VSV-based pseudovirus can generate a
higher signal-to-noise ratio and the neutralization assay takes about 24 hours, whereas the
lentivirus-based pseudovirus produces less robust signal and takes 48-72 hours 7-11. However, a
major issue for the VSV-based pseudovirus is the likely presence of residual VSV virus, which
may result in high rates of false‐positive results 27. In addition, both VSV- and lentiviral-based
pseudoviral particles contain structural components not native to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2,
which may alter particle properties in receptor binding and responses to antibody neutralization
15

.
To overcome the shortcomings of pseudoviruses, here we describe the development and

validation of a new hybrid alphavirus-CoV-2 particle (Ha-CoV-2) for rapid quantification of
neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. Ha-CoV-2 is a non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 viruslike particle, composed of authentic virus structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) from SARS-CoV-2
but not of structural proteins from any other virus. Ha-CoV-2 also contains a genome derived
from an alphavirus-based vector 16,28; the alphavirus-based genome of Ha-CoV-2 can rapidly and
robustly express reporter genes within hours after viral entry 28. In this study, we further
demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can be used as a platform for rapid quantification of neutralization
antibodies, antiviral drugs, and viral structural protein mutations.

RESULTS
To establish a rapid cell-based SARS-CoV-2 infection system for screening and evaluation of
neutralizing antibodies and antiviral drugs, we developed a new hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2

viral particle, in which an alphavirus-based RNA genome is enclosed for rapid expression of
reporter genes in target cells (Fig. 1A). The genomic RNA consists of the 5’ untranslated region
and open-reading frames coding for the nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1-4 from Semliki Forest
virus (SFV) 16,29; the inclusion of nsp1-4 allows for self-amplification of the RNA genome in
cells. The RNA genome also contains viral subgenomic RNA promoters for the expression of
reporter genes (such as luciferase). The 3’ end of the genome contains the 3’ untranslated region
of SFV and a poly(A) tail that are used to stabilize RNA. In addition, a putative SARS-CoV-2
packaging signal was inserted downstream of the reporter gene to facilitate RNA packaging by
the SARS-CoV-2 structural protein N.
To assemble viral particles, we used a DNA vector, Ha-CoV-2, to express the genomic RNA.
Ha-CoV-2 was cotransfected with vectors expressing the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (S,
M, E, and N) into HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A). Virion particles were harvested at 48 hours post
cotransfection, and tested for virion infectivity and the ability to express reporter genes in target
cells. First, to confirm the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in Ha-CoV-2
particles, we performed western blots of purified particles, using antibodies against the S protein
of SARS-CoV-2. We were able to detect the presence of S in Ha-CoV-2 particles (Fig. 1B). To
further determine the presence of the other structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we also
assembled Ha-CoV-2 particles using FLAG-tagged M and N proteins, and performed western
blots using anti-FLAG antibodies. We were able to confirm the presence of both M and N in HaCoV-2 particles (Fig. 1C and 1D). Furthermore, to determine whether these structural proteins
are present in the same virion particles, we used anti-S antibody-conjugated magnetic beads to
pull down Ha-CoV-2 particles. The magnetically separated particles were further probed with
western blot using the anti-FLAG antibody for the presence of FLAG-tagged M protein. As

shown in Fig. 1E, we detected the presence of M in the anti-S antibody pull-down particles,
confirming that cotransfection of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins with Ha-CoV-2 vector led
to the production of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs).
To further demonstrate the ability of Ha-CoV-2 particles to infect and express reporter genes
in target cells, we assembled an Ha-CoV-2(GFP) reporter virus, and used it to infect
HEK293T(ACE/TEMPRSS2) cells that overexpressed both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We observed
GFP expression in cells following infection (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the alphavirus-based
RNA genome can be packaged by the budding SARS-CoV-2 VLPs, and is capable of expressing
the GFP reporter gene in target cells. To determine whether the infection of target cells by HaCoV-2 is dependent on the interaction of S with the ACE2 receptor 18,30, we assembled an HaCoV-2(Luc) reporter virus and used it to simultaneously infect HEK293T(ACE/TEMPRSS2)
cells and the parent HEK293T cell that does not express ACE2. As shown in Fig. 2B, Ha-CoV2(Luc) expressed Luc only in the HEK293T(ACE/TEMPRSS2) cells but not in HEK293T,
demonstrating the requirement of ACE2 for Ha-CoV-2 infection. We further confirmed the
requirement for S-ACE2 interaction for Ha-CoV-2 infection by generating particles without the
S protein. As shown in Fig. 2C, in the absence of S, Luc expression was highly diminished,
demonstrating the requirement of S for Ha-CoV-2 infection. We also tested the requirement for
the other structural proteins, M, N, and E, for Ha-CoV-2 infection. Although these proteins were
found to be nonessential, removal of M, N, and E led to a reduction in Ha-CoV-2 infectivity
(Fig. 2C). We further investigated the individual contributions of M, N, and E for Ha-CoV-2
infection. It appeared that in general, particles generated with two or three of these structural
proteins had a greater infectivity than those with only one protein. However, the presence of S
plus E appears to be sufficient for the full infectivity of Ha-CoV-2 (Fig. 2D).

Lenti-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses have been commonly used for antiviral drug
screening and neutralization antibody assays 10,14. We performed a comparison of Ha-CoV-2
with lenti-pseudovirus for the infection of both ACE2 overexpression cells and cells expressing
native levels of ACE2. Lenti-pseudovirus and Ha-CoV-2 particles were assembled in similar cell
culture conditions, and an equal volume of the particles produced was used for infection. Both
lenti-pseudovirus and Ha-CoV-2 can infect the ACE2-overexpressing
HEK293T(ACE2/TMPRESS2) cells (Fig. 3A). However, infection of Calu-3, a human lung
cancer cells expressing native levels of ACE2, was minimal with the lenti-pseudovirus 31,
whereas Ha-CoV-2 particles produced a more robust signal for the infection of Calu-3 cells (Fig.
3B). Infection of primary human ACE2-null monkey kidney cells with Ha-CoV-2 did not
generate signals above uninfected cell background (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that HaCoV-2 is likely more sensitive for infecting low ACE2 expression cells.
A major advantage of utilizing alphavirus-based RNA genome for Ha-CoV-2 is the
extremely fast speed and high-level gene expression of alphaviruses; gene expression from the
subgenomic RNA promoters occur within hours of infection, and levels of viral plus-RNAs can
reach 200,000 copies in a single cell 16,28. We followed the time course of Ha-CoV-2(Luc)
infection, and observed that the Luc reporter expression increased rapidly within 6 hours from
the addition of particles to cells (Fig. 4). This rapid reporter expression kinetics permitted us to
utilize Ha-CoV-2 for fast screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies and anti-viral
drugs.
To validate the Ha-CoV-2 system for rapid screening and quantification of neutralizing
antibodies, we tested an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum (1F), which was serially diluted and preincubated with Ha-CoV-2(Luc). The antibody-virus complex was used to infect cells for 5 hours

for Luc expression. As shown in Fig. 5A, we observed 1F concentration-dependent inhibition of
Ha-CoV-2(Luc), and the IC50 was determined to be at 1:433 dilution (Fig. 5A). Given that
SARS-CoV-2 lenti-pseudoviruses have been widely used in neutralization assays 4,8,14, we also
performed a similar assay using 1F and a lenti-pseudovirus, Lenti-SARS-CoV-2(Luc) 15.
Infected cells were analyzed at 72 hours post infection. We observed similar 1F concentrationdependent inhibition of the lenti-pseudovirus, and the IC50 was found to be at 1:186 dilution
(Fig. 5B). These results demonstrated that Ha-CoV-2 is as effective as lenti-pseudoviruses for
quantifying neutralizing antibodies, but with a much faster speed (5 hours versus 48-72 hours).
Based on the 1F antiserum results described above, we performed additional Ha-CoV-2
antibody neutralizing assays using anti-sera from COVID-19 patients. We observed antibody
concentration-dependent inhibition of Ha-CoV-2 infection in all these serum samples. The
inhibition curves and IC50s of each serum are presented in Fig. 5C. Among these samples, the
20M anti-serum has the most potent neutralizing activity with an IC50 at 1:1470 dilution. For
comparison, an independent study was conducted using infectious SARS-CoV-2 to validate these
anti-sera. We confirmed neutralizing activities from all of them, and the 20M anti-serum was
also found to be the most potent one (Fig. 5D). In addition, there is a direct correlation in the
IC50s obtained from the Ha-CoV-2 system and those obtained from infectious SARS-CoV-2
(Fig. 5D). These results demonstrated that Ha-CoV-2 can be used for rapid quantification of the
neutralizing activities of anti-sera.
Pseudoviruses have been commonly used for high throughput screening of SARS-CoV-2
entry inhibitors 7,10. We tested a broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitor, Arbidol (Umifenovir) 32,
for its ability to block Ha-CoV-2(Luc) infection. As shown in Fig. 5E, we observed dosagedependent inhibition of Ha-CoV-2(Luc) in 5 hours, and the IC50 was determined to be 16 µM.

These results demonstrated that Ha-CoV-2 can be used for rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2
entry inhibitors.
Finally, we tested whether the Ha-CoV-2 system can be used for rapid evaluation of the
relative infectivity of viral mutants. The D614G spike mutation emerged early in the COVID-19
pandemic, and has recently been reported to confer greater infectivity that has led to the global
dominance of the D614G mutant in circulation 33,34. To determine whether the increase in virus
infectivity can be recapitulated and quantified by the Ha-CoV-2 system, we assembled Ha-CoV2 particles using the G614 mutant S protein (614G) or the parental D614 S protein. We found
that D614G mutation did not increase virion release or the level of S protein virion incorporation
(Fig. 5G and 5H). However, Ha-VoV-2 particles bearing the G614 spike were found to be nearly
3 times more infectious than those bearing the D614 spike (Fig. 5I). These results demonstrated
that the Ha-CoV-2 system can provide a convenient tool for rapid monitoring and quantification
of viral mutations for potential impacts on neutralizing antibodies and vaccine effectiveness.

DISCUSSION
The study of SARS-CoV-2 requires high-level containment that limits the use of wild-type virus
in common clinical and research laboratories. Pseudoviruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) have
been widely used for SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery and vaccine development. Pseudoviruses,
such as those derived from lentivirus and vesicular stomatitis virus, can mimic the entry process
of SARS-CoV-2. However, structurally, they are not identical to SARA-CoV-2 and lack
structural components provided by M, E, and N of SARS-CoV-2. VLPs closely resemble SARSCoV-2 particles, but VLPs contain no genome for reporter expression in target cells 35. In this
article, we described the development and validation of a novel hybrid system, the Ha-CoV-2

particle, which is structurally a VLP, but possesses the ability of a pseudovirus to enter and
express reporter genes in target cells. The genome of Ha-CoV-2 is derived from alphavirus,
which allows for rapid and robust quantification of reporter expression within hours of viral
entry. We further demonstrated that Ha-CoV-2 can be used for rapid screening and quantification
of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs.
We also performed a direct comparison between Ha-CoV-2 and a lenti-pseudovirus in
antibody neutralization assays. While both systems are effective in quantifying neutralizing
antibodies, the sensitivity of the two systems may differ. Pseudoviruses contain only the S
protein of SARS-CoV-2, whereas Ha-CoV-2 contains all four structural proteins (S, M, E, and
N) of SARS-CoV-2, and has no structural proteins from other viruses (e.g. gag and pol of
lentivirus). Although S is the primary requirement for viral entry, the presence of other structural
proteins of SARS-CoV-2 may also affect virion infectivity and particle interaction with cell
membrane and antibodies. In our system, the lack of M and E on virion particles does appear to
lower virion infectivity (Fig. 2D).
In addition to viral structural proteins, virion particles also incorporate multiple cellular
proteins during virion budding and release. Many of these cellular factors such as PSGL-1 can
impact virion infectivity 15,36-38 and antibody binding to plasma membrane 39. SARS-CoV-2
budding occurs mainly at the membranes of ER-Golgi intermediate compartment 40, whereas
pseudoviruses such as lenti-pseudoviruses bud from the plasma membrane 41. Because of the
differences, it is possible that different sets of cellular proteins may be incorporated into
pseudoviruses and SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, the close resemblance of Ha-CoV-2 particle to
SARS-CoV-2 may provide a unique tool for studying effects of virion host proteins in SARSCoV-2 infection and pathogenesis 15.

As SARA-CoV-2 continue to circulate and evolve, it may pose a particular challenge for the
control of the COVID-19 pandemic, as documented in the recent emergence of the B.1.1.7
lineage in UK 42. Viral mutation may lead to increases in viral transmission and fitness, and thus
there is an urgent need for rapid identification and characterization of emerging mutants for
changes in infectivity and evasion of neutralizing antibodies. The Ha-CoV-2 system can be
readily optimized for such purposes.

Materials and Methods
Virus and viral particle assembly
The SARS-CoV-2 S, S(D614G), M, E, or N expression vectors were purchased from
Sinobiological. The Ha-CoV-2(Luc) and Ha-CoV-2(GFP) vectors were synthesized by Twist
Bioscience. Ha-CoV-2 particles were assembled by cotransfection of HEK293T cells in 10 cm
dish with 2.5 µg of each of the SARS-CoV-2 structural protein expression vectors (S, N, E, M)
and 10 µg of Ha-CoV-2(Luc) or Ha-CoV-2(GFP). Particles were harvested at 48 hours post
cotransfection, filtered through a 0.45 µm filter, and then concentrated by gradient
centrifugation. Lenti-pseudovirus was assembled by cotransfection of HEK293T cells with
SARS-CoV-2 S expression vector (0.5 µg), pCMVΔR8.2 (7.5 µg), and pLTR-Tat-IRES-Luc (10
µg) as previously described 15.
Detection of Ha-CoV-2 virion incorporation of structural proteins
The SARS-CoV-2 M-FLAG and N-FLAG vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Pei-Hui Wang 43.
HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 10 µg Ha-CoV-2(Luc), 2.5 µg of the SARS-CoV-2 S
expression vector, and 2.5 µg each of the M-FLAG, N-FLAG, and E-FLAG vectors. Particles
were harvested, filtered through a 0.45 µm filter, and then purified by gradient centrifugation.
Virion lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot using Spike Protein S2
Monoclonal Antibody (1A9) (Invitrogen) (1:1000 dilution) or DYKDDDDK Tag Monoclonal
Antibody (FG4R) (Invitrogen) (1: 1000 dilution). Membranes were then incubated with Antimouse IgG, HRP-linked Antibody (Cell signaling) (1: 2000 dilution) for 60 min at room
temperature. Chemiluminescence signal was detected by using West Pico or West Femto
chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were captured with a CCD
camera (FluorChem 9900 Imaging Systems) (Alpha Innotech). Particles were also captured with

magnetic beads for analyses. Briefly, magnetic Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG (Invitrogen) (2x107
beads/50 µl) were conjugated with Spike Protein S2 Monoclonal Antibody (1A9) (Invitrogen) (2
µl antibody) for 30 minutes at room temperature. After conjugation, virions were incubated with
the anti-S2-beads for 30 minutes at 4°C, and pulled down with a magnet. After washing with
cold PBS for 5 times, virions were lysed in LDS lysis buffer (Invitrogen). Lysates were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE and western blot using DYKDDDDK Tag Monoclonal Antibody (FG4R)
(Invitrogen) (1: 1000 dilution) to detect FLAG-Tagged SARS-CoV-2 M proteins.
Viral infectivity assay
Ha-CoV-2 particles were used to infect HEK293T(ACE2/TMPRSS2) cells (a gift from Virongy
LLC, Manassas, VA), Calu-3 cells (ATCC), HEK293T cells (ATCC) and primary monkey
kidney cells provided by Dr. Xuefeng Liu. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (2x105
cells) per well. Cells were infected for 1-2 hours at 37°C, washed, cultured in fresh medium for
3-48 hours, and then lysed in Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer (Promega) for luciferase activity
using GloMax Discover Microplate Reader (Promega). Lenti-pseudovirus particles were used to
infect HEK293T(ACE2/TMPRSS2) cells and Calu-3 cells (ATCC). Cells were infected for 2
hours, cultured for 3 days, and then lysed in Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer (Promega) for
luciferase assays using GloMax Discover Microplate Reader (Promega).
Neutralizing Antibody Assay
Ha-CoV-2 particles were pre-incubated with serially diluted sera from COVID19 patients for 1
hour, and then added to HEK293T(ACE2/TMPRSS2) cells for 2 hours. Cells were then washed,
and cultured in fresh medium for additional 3 hours. Cells were lysed in Luciferase Assay Lysis
Buffer (Promega) for luciferase assays using GloMax Discover Microplate Reader (Promega).
For neutralization assays using wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus, anti-serum was serially diluted (a

twelve-point, two-fold dilution series starting at 1:10 dilution), and pre-incubated with 100 pfu of
SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37 °C. After incubation, viral plaque assay was conducted to quantify
viral titers. Briefly, Vero cells (ATCC) in 12-well plates (2x105 cells per well) were infected with
virus for 1 hour at 37 °C. After infection, a 1:1 overlay, consisting of 0.6% agarose and 2X
EMEM without phenol red (Quality Biological), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Gibco), was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Cells were
fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature, and then the agarose overlay was
removed. Cells were stained with crystal violet (1% CV w/v in a 20% ethanol solution). Viral
titer of SARS-CoV-2 was determined by counting the number of plaques.
Antiviral Drug Assay
Arbidol-hydrochloride (Sigma) was resuspended in Dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma).
HEK293T(ACE2/TMPRSS2) cells were pretreated for 1 hour with serially diluted Arbidol. HaCoV-2 particles were added cells, followed by the addition of Abidol to maintain the drug
concentration. Cells were infected in the presence of Arbidol for 2 hours, washed, and then
cultured in fresh medium for a total of 5 hours. Cells were lysed in Luciferase Assay Lysis
Buffer (Promega) for luciferase assays using GloMax Discover Microplate Reader (Promega).

Fig. 1. Design and assembly of Ha-Cov-2 particles. (A) Illustration of the design of Ha-CoV-2
vector. The vector contains a RSV promoter that transcribes the full-length viral RNA genome to
be packaged into Ha-CoV-2 particles. Shown are the 5’ untranslated region followed by openreading frames coding for nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1-4 from Semliki Forest virus (SFV), viral
subgenomic promoters for Luc and GFP reporter expression, the 3’ untranslated region and a
poly(A) tail that is self-cleaved by the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (RZ). The SARS-CoV-2
packaging signal is inserted in front of the 3’ untranslated region. To assemble viral particles,
HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Ha-CoV-2 and the vectors expressing the 4 structural
proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (S, M, E, and N). HA-CoV2 particles in the supernatant was harvested
at 48 hours, purified, lysed, and then analyzed by western blot using antibodies for the SARSCoV-2 S protein (B). Control is supernatants from cells transfected with the Ha-CoV-2 vector
alone. (C and D) Particles were also assembled using FALG-tagged M and N. Particles were
analyzed with western blot using an antibody against FLAG. (E) Particles in the supernatant
were also captured with magnetic beads conjugated with the anti-S antibody, and then analyzed
with western blot using the antibody again FLAG for FLAG-tagged M protein in the particles.
