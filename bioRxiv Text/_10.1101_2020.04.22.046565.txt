Abstract

25

The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory

26

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major global health threat. Epidemiological studies

27

suggest that bats are the natural zoonotic reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. However, the host range of

28

SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown.

29

The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and

30

cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the

31

receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. It has been shown that human, palm

32

civet, pig and bat ACE2 can support virus entry, while the murine ortholog cannot. In this study,

33

we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. We found that

34

ACE2 is expressed in a wide range of species, with especially high conservation in mammals. By

35

analyzing amino acid residues of ACE2 critical for virus entry, based on structure of SARS-CoV

36

spike protein interaction with human, bat, palm civet, pig and ferret ACE2, we identified

37

approximately eighty ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2

38

entry. We chose 48 representative ACE2 orthologs among eighty orthologs for functional analysis

39

and it showed that 44 of these mammalian ACE2 orthologs, including those of domestic animals,

40

pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria, could bind SARS-CoV-2 spike

41

protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind

42

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant

43

of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses. In

44

summary, our study demonstrates that ACE2 from a remarkably broad range of species can

45

facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry. These findings highlight a potentially broad host tropism of

46

SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be distributed much more widely than

47

previously recognized, underscoring the necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future

48

outbreaks.

Introduction

53

Coronaviruses are a group of positive-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses that circulate broadly

54

among humans, other mammals, and birds, causing respiratory, enteric, or hepatic diseases1. In the

55

last two decades, coronaviruses have caused three major outbreaks: severe acute respiratory

56

syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the recent Coronavirus Disease

57

2019 (COVID-19)2,3. As of April 24, 2020, COVID-19 has already caused 2.7 million infections,

58

leading to 192,000 deaths globally. The pathogen responsible is a novel coronavirus-severe acute

59

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 4,5. Phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses

60

suggest that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 likely originated from bats, with

61

SARS-CoV spreading from bats to palm civets to humans, and MERS-CoV spreading from bats to

62

camel to humans6. However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, fueling spillover to humans,

63

remains unknown.

64

The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes a spike (S) protein, the receptor-binding domain (RBD)

65

of which binds the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate viral

66

entry5,7. Following binding of ACE2, the S protein is subsequently cleaved by the host

67

transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) to release the spike fusion peptide, promoting virus

68

entry into target cells7,8. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the interaction of a virus with (a)

69

species-specific receptor(s) is a primary determinant of host tropism and therefore constitutes a

70

major interspecies barrier at the level of viral entry9. For example, murine ACE2 does not

71

efficiently bind the SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S protein, hindering viral entry into murine cells;

72

consequently, a human ACE2 transgenic mouse was developed as an in vivo model to study the

73

infection and pathogenesis of these two viruses10,11.

74

ACE2 is expressed in a diverse range of species throughout the subphylum Vertebrata.

75

Several recent studies demonstrated that ferrets, cats, dogs and some non-human primates are

76

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 12-16. However, the exact host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 remains

77

unknown and it is urgent to identify the putative zoonotic reservoirs to prevent future outbreak. To

78

address this question, we systematically analyzed ACE2 orthologs from a broad range of species

79

for their ability to support SARS-CoV-2 entry. Our data demonstrate that an evolutionarily diverse

80

set of ACE2 species variants can mediate SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein-dependent entry, suggesting

81

that SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host range at the level of virus entry that may contribute to

82

cross-species transmission and viral evolution.

RESULTS

85

Evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses of ACE2 orthologs from a diversity of species

86

ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, is expressed in a diverse

87

range of vertebrate animals. We analyzed the protein sequences of 294 ACE2 orthologs in the

88

NCBI database, from birds (75 species), alligators (4 species), turtles (4 species), lizards (9

89

species), mammals (129 species), amphibians (4 species), coelacanths (1 species), bone fish (67

90

species) and cartilaginous fish (1 species) (Fig. S1). These ACE2 orthologs range from 344 to 861

91

amino acid residues in length and are characterized by an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR)

92

domain and a C-terminal low-complexity acidic region (LCAR). Structures of SARS-CoV S

93

protein complexed with human ACE2 or other susceptible orthologs have been solved, and five

94

critical, highly conserved amino acid residues of ACE2 have been identified that are indispensable

95

for interaction with S protein and viral entry8,17-19. Based on this structural information and

96

conservation of these 5 critical residues, we carried out primary sequence alignment across the

97

294 ACE2 proteins (Fig. S1). Our analysis revealed that ACE2 orthologs from 80 species that

98

could potentially function as SARS-CoV-2 receptors (Fig. S1, and Fig. 1). All of the 80 ACE2

99

orthologs were derived from mammals, including wild animals, domestic animals, pets, livestock

100

and even animals in the zoo or aquaria, with protein size ranging from 790 to 811 amino acids

101

(Table S1). Other ACE2 orthologs from mammals (49/129 species) that were predicted as

102

non-functional receptors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are summarized in Table S2 and were

103

not included in the experiments described in the present study. Interestingly, species in Table S2,

104

such as Chinese tree shrew and guinea pigs were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as

105

demonstrated by other studies 20,21.

106

We performed phylogenetic analysis of these 80 ACE2 orthologs to explore their potential

107

function in mediating virus infection and to gain insights into the evolution of the ACE2 protein

108

(Fig.1, left panel). Additionally, we aligned the twenty residues of ACE2 located at the interface

109

with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein22-24 (Fig. 1, right panel). The ACE2 protein sequences were

110

highly conserved across the species we analyzed. Of note, the twenty residues at the ACE2-S

111

protein interface were identical across the Catarrhini, which includes great apes and Old World

112

monkeys. However, these residues in the ACE2 orthologs of New World monkeys were less

113

conserved. For example, Y41 and Q42 in human ACE2 are responsible for the formation of

114

hydrogen bonds with S protein and are highly conserved across all other species but are

115

substituted by H and E, respectively in New World monkeys. In non-primate mammals, an

116

increasing number of substitutions are evident, even in residues such as Q24, D30, D38, and Y83

117

that form hydrogen bonds or salt-bridges with S protein (Fig. 1).

118

Collectively, our analysis suggests that ACE2 orthologs are highly conserved across a wide

119

range of mammals, and many of these ACE2 orthologs might function as an entry receptor for

120

SARS-CoV-2.

121

Interaction of ACE2 proteins with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

122

Based on our evolutionary analysis, we chose 48 representative ACE2 orthologs (Table S1

123

and Fig. 1) from Primates, Rodentia, Cetartiodactyla, Chiroptera, Diprotodontia, Perissodactyla,

124

Carnivora and Pholidota for further analysis. We assessed whether they support SARS-CoV-2

125

entry by ectopically expressing each ortholog in HeLa cells, which have limited endogenous

126

ACE2 expression5. These 48 species include wild animals, animals in the zoo and aquaria, pets

127

and livestock frequently in close contact with humans, model animals used in biomedical research,

128

and endangered species (Fig. 1).

129

Binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 is a prerequisite for viral entry. To examine this,

130

we employed a cell-based assay that used flow cytometry to assess the binding of S protein to

131

different ACE2 orthologs. We cloned the cDNA of 49 ACE2 orthologs (murine ACE2 was

132

included as a negative control), each with a C-terminal FLAG tag, into a bicistronic lentiviral

133

vector (pLVX-IRES-zsGreen1) that expresses the fluorescent protein zsGreen1 via an IRES

134

element and can be used to monitor transduction efficiency. Next, a purified fusion protein

135

consisting of the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and an Fc domain of human lgG (S1-Fc)

136

was incubated with HeLa cells transduced with the ACE2 orthologs. Binding of S1-Fc to ACE2

137

was then quantified by flow cytometry as the percent of cells positive for S1-Fc among the ACE2

138

expressing cells (zsGreen1 + cells). As expected, the binding of S1-Fc to HeLa cells expressing

139

mouse ACE2 was very low and comparable to that of the empty vector control, whereas S1-Fc

140

protein efficiently bound to HeLa cells expressing human ACE2, which is consistent with previous

141

reports5,8. Surprisingly, we found that ACE2 from 44/49 species could bind the S1-Fc protein,

142

albeit slightly less efficiently than human ACE2 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ACE2 from Callithrix

143

jacchus (marmoset, #11), Sapajus apella (tufted capuchin, #12), and Saimiri boliviensis

144

boliviensis (squirrel monkey, #13)⎯ all New World monkeys⎯ failed to bind S1-Fc; ACE2 from

145

Phascolarctos cinereus (koala, #34) and Mustela ermine (stoat, #44) bound only poorly to the

146

S1-Fc fusion (Fig. 2).

147

In summary, these results demonstrate that ACE2 proteins from a broad range of diverse

148

species can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting that these species may indeed be

149

capable of mediating viral uptake.

150
151

Functional assessment of ACE2 orthologs in SARS-CoV-2 entry

152

It has been shown that HeLa cells lacking expression of endogenous ACE2 were not

153

permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection5. To test directly whether different ACE2 orthologs can

154

indeed mediate viral entry, we performed genetic complementation experiments in HeLa cells.

155

HeLa cells ectopically expressing individual ACE2 orthologs were infected with

156

SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=1). At 48 h post-infection, the complemented HeLa cells were fixed and

157

underwent immunofluorescent staining for intracellular viral nucleocapsid protein, an indicator of

158

virus replication. As expected, HeLa cells expressing mouse ACE2 were not permissive to

159

SARS-CoV-2 infection while those expressing human ACE2 were permissive (Fig.3, #17 and #1,

160

respectively). Consistent with our binding data, HeLa cells expressing ACE2 orthologs from

161

marmoset (#11), tufted capuchin (#12), squirrel monkey (#13) or koala (#34) were non-permissive

162

to SARS-CoV-2 infection. HeLa cells expressing ACE2 from stoat (#44) were permissive, albeit

163

with low efficiency; the remaining 44 ACE2 orthologs supported SARS-CoV-2 infection, as

164

evidenced by readily detectable viral nucleocapsid protein within ACE2-expressing (zsGreen1+)

165

cells (Fig. 3).

166

Collectively, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can utilize ACE2 from evolutionarily

167

diverse species of mammals as a cellular receptor for viral entry, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2

168

may have a broad host range.

169
170

The genetic determinants of ACE2 from New World monkeys that restrict SARS-CoV-2

171

entry

172

Although the overall protein sequences of ACE2 were largely conserved across all tested

173

species (71%–100% identity compared with human ACE2) (Fig.S2), our data showed that high

174

sequence identity does not necessarily correlate with its function to support virus entry. For

175

example, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, ACE2 orthologs from the New World monkeys marmoset

176

(#11), tufted capuchin (#12), and squirrel monkey (#13) had limited or undetectable ability to

177

mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry despite sharing 92-93% identity with human ACE2. In contrast, the

178

ACE2 proteins from Bos taurus (cattle, #28) or Sus scrofa (pig, #20) efficiently facilitated virus

179

entry, even with 78% or 81% identity, respectively, to human ACE2 (Fig. S2). Thus, we

180

hypothesized that changes in critical residues in ACE2 proteins from New World monkeys may

181

restrict viral entry.

182

New World monkeys are widely used in biomedical research. Our results showed that their

183

ACE2 proteins do not bind SARS-CoV-2 S protein and do not promote virus entry, which is in

184

line with a recent finding that marmosets are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection13. To identify the

185

genetic determinants within ACE2 orthologs from New World monkeys that restrict viral entry, we

186

first analyzed the ACE2 protein residues that contact the S protein, especially those that form

187

hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with S protein, such as Q24, D30, E35, E37, D38, Y41, Q42, Y83,

188

K353 and R39322-24. When comparing with orthologs that support SARS-CoV-2 entry, we found

189

that residues at the ACE2-S interface in New World monkeys only differed at H41 and E42 (Fig.1

190

and Fig. 4A). The hydroxyl group of the Tyr (Y) at human ACE2 position 41 forms hydrogen

191

bonds with the side chain oxygen atom of T500 and side chain nitrogen atom of N501 in the

192

SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The side chain nitrogen atom of Q42 of human ACE2 forms hydrogen

193

bonds with the main chain oxygen atom of G446 and side chain hydroxyl group of Y449 of the

194

SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Changes at these two consecutive residues, 41 and 42, may disrupt critical

195

hydrogen-bonding interactions and thus impair the binding of New World monkey ACE2 with

196

SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 4A, right panel).

197

To directly uncover the molecular basis for the inability of New World monkey ACE2 to

198

function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, we humanized marmoset and tufted capuchin ACE2 by

199

mutating the ACE2 orthologs at position 41 and 42 into Y and Q, respectively (Fig.4A). These

200

humanized orthologs were then transduced into HeLa cells to assess binding with the

201

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Remarkably, both the humanized marmoset and tufted capuchin

202

ACE2 orthologs were now able to bind the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with efficiency comparable to

203

that of human ACE2 (Fig. 4B and C). To confirm whether this gain-of-function phenotype was

204

functional in the context of infection, HeLa cells ectopically expressing WT or these humanized

205

ACE2 orthologs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=1). At 48 h post-infection, the

206

complemented HeLa cells were subjected to immunofluorescent staining for intracellular viral

207

nucleocapsid protein. As we observed before and consistent with our binding data, HeLa cells

208

expressing ACE2 orthologs from marmoset (#11) or tufted capuchin (#12) were non-permissive to

209

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4D). However, the humanized ACE2 orthologs from marmoset

210

(#11-YQ) or tufted capuchin (#12-YQ) rendered the HeLa cells permissiveness to infection (Fig.

211

4D), demonstrating that altering the residues at position 41 and 42 into human counterparts

212

confers the ability of ACE2 orthologs from New World monkeys of binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike

213

protein and mediating viral entry, thereby determining the ability of these ACE2 proteins to be

214

used as viral receptors.

215

Thus, our analysis identifies the genetic determinants of ACE2 in New World monkeys

216

necessary for the protein’s function as the SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor and provides greater

217

insight into the species-specific restriction of viral entry, which can inform the development of

218

animal models.

Discussion

221

To prevent the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans, the identification of animal

222

reservoirs or intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 is of great importance. Recently, a coronavirus

223

was identified in pangolins with 90% sequence identity compared to SARS-CoV-225,26. However,

224

the result of such phylogenetic analysis does not necessarily support the notion that pangolins are

225

indeed an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. The host range and animal reservoirs of

226

SARS-CoV-2 remain to be explored.

227

For the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from intermediate hosts to humans, the

228

virus needs to overcome at least two main host genetic barriers: the specificity of the viral S

229

protein-ACE2 receptor interactions and the ability to escape the host’s antiviral immune response.

230

The interaction of a virus with its host cell receptor is the first step to initiate virus infection and is

231

a critical determinant of host species range and tissue tropism. SARS-CoV-2 uses the cellular

232

receptor ACE2 in a species-specific manner: human, palm civet, bat and pig ACE2 can support

233

virus entry whereas mouse ACE2 cannot5. To explore possible SARS-CoV-2 animal reservoirs and

234

intermediate hosts, we analyzed ACE2 genes from 294 vertebrates, particularly mammals. Our

235

results suggest that ACE2 orthologs are largely conserved across vertebrate species, indicating the

236

importance of its physiological function. Notably, we also found that ACE2 orthologs from a wide

237

range of mammals could act as a functional receptor to mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection when

238

ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may have a diverse range of

239

hosts and intermediate hosts.

240

It is of note that our findings are based on a functional study of ACE2 proteins during

241

authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection instead of using pseudotyped virus. Our results are consistent

242

with recent in vivo findings that ferrets, cats, dogs, and Old World monkeys are susceptible to

243

SARS-CoV-2 infection but not marmosets, which are New World monkeys13-15. The host range or

244

specificity of a virus is often limited due to several reasons, such as the lack of host factors the

245

virus depends on or the incompatibility of these factors’ orthologs in different species.

246

Alternatively, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, the ability to evade the antiviral immune

247

response of a given host can also shape the species tropism of viruses9,27.

248

Development of prophylactic vaccines or effective antivirals are urgently needed to combat

249

SARS-CoV-2 infection28. Establishment of better animal models to evaluate the efficacy of

250

vaccine candidates and antiviral strategies in vivo is thus of utmost importance. Additionally, there

251

is a need for suitable, experimentally tractable animal models to dissect mechanistically viral

252

transmission and pathogenesis. Human ACE2 transgenic mice have been used to study

253

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vivo10,11. However, the unphysiologically high expression level

254

of ACE2 driven by the ubiquitous K14 promoter may not recapitulate the human disease caused

255

by SARS-CoV-2. Recently, a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection was established that mimics

256

transmission and recapitulates aspects of human disease12. Our study found that ACE2 from

257

multiple species of laboratory animals, including but not limited to ferrets, crab-eating macaques,

258

and Chinese hamsters, could be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral infection. Our data

259

provide a rationale to assess the susceptibility of such species whose ACE2 ortholog serves as a

260

functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Our results further demonstrate that ACE2 orthologs from

261

three New World monkey species (marmoset (#11), tufted capuchin (#12), and squirrel monkey

262

(#13)) do not support SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identified specific residues⎯H41 and E42⎯within

263

ACE2 that restrict SARS-CoV-2 in these species. Substituting these critical amino acids with

264

those found in human ACE2 rendered these ACE2 orthologs able to support SARS-CoV-2 entry.

265

Our unexpected finding that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 from diverse species highlights the

266

importance of surveilling animals in close contact with humans as potential zoonotic reservoirs.

267

We found that pets such as cats and dogs, livestock such as pigs, cattle, rabbits, sheep, horses, and

268

goats, and even some animals kept frequently in zoos or aquaria may serve as intermediate hosts

269

for virus transmission. Our study also identified a broad range of wild animals as potential

270

susceptible hosts of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the importance of banning illegal wildlife trade

271

and consumption.

272

In summary, ours is the first study to systematically assess the functionality of ACE2

273

orthologs from nearly 50 mammalian hosts using the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, which

274

provides new insight into the potential host range and cross-species transmission of this virus. It

275

also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might be much more widely distributed than previously thought,

276

underscoring the necessity of monitoring susceptible hosts, especially their potential for causing

277

zoonosis to prevent future outbreaks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

294

Cell cultures and SARS-CoV-2 virus. HEK293T cells (American Tissue Culture Collection,

295

ATCC, Manassas, VA, CRL-3216), Vero E6 (Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,

296

Shanghai, China) and HeLa (ATCC #CCL-2) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle

297

medium (DMEM) (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS),

298

10mM HEPES, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1×non-essential amino acids, and 50 IU/ml

299

penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator at 37°C. Cells were tested

300

routinely and found to be free of mycoplasma contamination. The SARS-CoV-2 strain

301

nCoV-SH01 (GenBank accession no. MT121215) was isolated from a COVID-19 patient and

302

propagated in Vero E6 cells for use. All experiments involving virus infections were performed in

303

the biosafety level 3 facility of Fudan University following the regulations.

304

Plasmids. The cDNAs encoding ACE2 orthologs (Table S1) were synthesized by GenScript and

305

cloned into pLVX-IRES-zsGreen1 vectors (Catalog No. 632187, Clontech Laboratories, Inc) with

306

a C-terminal FLAG tag. ACE2 mutants were generated by Quikchange (Stratagene) site-directed

307

mutagenesis. All of the constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing.

308

Lentivirus production. Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviruses

309

expressing ACE2 orthologs tagged with FLAG at the C-terminus were produced by transient

310

co-transfection of the third-generation packaging plasmids pMD2G (Addgene #12259) and

311

psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) and the transfer vector with VigoFect DNA transfection reagent

312

(Vigorous) into HEK293T cells. The medium was changed 12 h post transfection. Supernatants

313

were collected at 24 and 48h after transfection, pooled, passed through a 0.45-µm filter, and frozen

314

at -80°C.

315

Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment. The amino acid sequences of ACE2 orthologs

316

for jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata) were exported from the NCBI nucleotide database.

317

Numbers in each sequence correspond to the GenBank accession number. 81 sequences were

318

collected for the presence of five critical viral spike-contacting residues of ACE2 corresponding to

319

amino acids Lys31, Glu35, Asp38, Met82 and Lys353 in human ACE2 (NM_001371415.1). The

320

protein sequences of different species were then passed into MEGA-X (Version 10.05) software

321

for further analysis. The alignment was conducted using the MUSCLE algorithm

322

alignment file was used to construct the phylogenetic tree (Neighbor Joining option of the

323

MEGA-X with default parameter).

324

Western blotting. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)

325

immunoblotting was performed as follows: After trypsinization and cell pelleting at 2,000 × g for

326

10 min, whole-cell lysates were harvested in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0],

327

150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with

328

protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were electrophoresed in 12% polyacrylamide gels and
11

29

. Then the

transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked at room temperature for 0.5 h

330

using 5% nonfat milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The

331

blots were exposed to primary antibodies anti-β-Tubulin (CW0098, CWBIO), or anti-FLAG

332

(F7425, Sigma) in 5% nonfat milk in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. The blots were

333

then washed in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After 1h exposure to HRP-conjugated

334

secondary antibodies, subsequent washes were performed and membranes were visualized using

335

the Luminescent image analyzer (GE).

336

Surface ACE2 binding assay. HeLa cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing the ACE2

337

from different species for 48 h. The cells were collected with TrypLE (Thermo #12605010) and

338

washed twice with cold PBS. Live cells were incubated with the recombinant protein, S1 domain

339

of SARS-CoV-2 spike C-terminally fused with Fc (Sino Biological #40591-V02H, 1μg/ml) at

340

4 °C for 30 min. After washing, cells were stained with goat anti-human IgG (H + L) conjugated

341

with Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo #A21445, 2 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed

342

twice and subjected to flow cytometry analysis (Thermo, Attune™ NxT).

343

Immunofluorescence staining of viral nucleocapsids. HeLa cells were transduced with

344

lentiviruses expressing the ACE2 from different species for 48 h. Cells were then infected with

345

nCoV-SH01 at an MOI of 1 for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in 2% FBS

346

culture medium for 48 h for viral antigen staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in

347

PBS, permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal antibody

348

against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland, 200-401-A50, 1μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight.

349

After three washes, cells were incubated with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated

350

with Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo #A11034, 2 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by

351

staining with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were collected using an EVOS™

352

Microscope M5000 Imaging System (Thermo #AMF5000). Images were processed using the

353

ImageJ program (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ).

354

Statistics analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s honestly significant

355

difference (HSD) test was used to test for statistical significance of the differences between the

356

different group parameters. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
