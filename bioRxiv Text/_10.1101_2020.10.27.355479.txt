Abstract

12

Disinfection strategies are commonly applied to inactivate pathogenic viruses in water, food, air,

13

and on surfaces to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Determining how quickly viruses are

14

inactivated to mitigate health risks is not always feasible due to biosafety restrictions or difficulties

15

with virus culturability. Therefore, methods that would rapidly predict kinetics of virus

16

inactivation by UV254 would be valuable, particularly for emerging and difficult-to-culture viruses.

17

We conducted a rapid systematic literature review to collect high-quality inactivation rate

18

constants for a wide range of viruses. Using these data and basic virus information (e.g., genome

19

sequence attributes), we developed and evaluated four different model classes, including linear

20

and non-linear approaches, to find the top performing prediction model. For both the (+) ssRNA

21

and dsDNA virus types, multiple linear regressions were the top performing model classes. In both

22

cases, the cross-validated root mean squared relative prediction errors were similar to those

23

associated with experimental rate constants. We tested the models by predicting and measuring

24

inactivation rate constants for two viruses that were not identified in our systematic review,

25

including a (+) ssRNA mouse coronavirus and a dsDNA marine bacteriophage; the predicted rate

26

constants were within 7% and 71% of the experimental rate constants, respectively. Finally, we

27

applied our models to predict the UV254 rate constants of several viruses for which high-quality

28

UV254 inactivation data are not available. Our models will be valuable for predicting inactivation

29

kinetics of emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses.

Introduction

31

Viruses can cause diverse and costly illnesses in humans and other animals (1). A variety

32

of approaches have therefore been developed to decontaminate food, water, air, and surfaces that

33

may contain infective viruses (2–7). UV254 treatment, in particular, is gaining popularity as an

34

alternative to more traditional chemical disinfection strategies (8–10). Viruses can have highly

35

variable UV254 susceptibilities (11, 12). For example, two dsDNA viruses, adenovirus type 40 and

36

bacteriophage T6, are inactivated by UV254 at the widely varying rates of ~ 0.06 cm2 mJ-1 (13–18)

37

and ~ 5.4 cm2 mJ-1 (19), respectively.

38

Viruses have diverse genome types, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-

39

stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).

40

UV254 inactivates by primarily targeting viral genetic material, and the different biochemical

41

structures associated with these viral genome types result in distinct sensitivities to UV254 (20).

42

Nucleic acid primary structure, or nucleotide base sequence, also affects UV254 genome reactivity

43

– pyrimidine bases, for instance, are about an order of magnitude more reactive with UV254 than

44

purine bases (21, 22). Different replication modes among viruses can also impact susceptibility to

45

UV254. For example, the reverse transcriptase enzymes involved in generation of retrovirus mRNA

46

may have different fidelities to photochemical modifications in nucleic acid compared to the RNA

47

dependent RNA polymerase enzymes used by other RNA viruses to synthesize mRNA (23).

48

Additional differences in viral infection cycles impact virus sensitivity to UV254 (24). dsDNA virus

49

genomes, for example, can undergo nucleic acid repair once inside host cells (24–26). This means

50

that a virus may be inactivated by UV254 treatment through base modification, only to be repaired

51

and thus rendered infectious again when such repair mechanisms are available. We note these

52

differences in virus genome type and mode of mRNA generation are utilized in the Baltimore virus

53

classification system (e.g., Group 1: dsDNA viruses, Group IV: (+) ssRNA viruses) (1, 27).

54

Virus disinfection methods are evaluated by enumerating infective viruses before and after

55

treatment, typically with virus culture systems. Relying on culture-based approaches to evaluate

56

inactivation kinetics is often problematic. Most notably, many human viruses that are spread

57

through the environment are not readily culturable. For highly pathogenic viruses that are

58

culturable, disinfection experiments are complicated by biosafety restrictions. Disinfection

59

experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and

60

SARS-CoV-2), for example, are limited to biosafety level 3 laboratories and work with

61

ebolaviruses require biosafety level 4 facilities. Alternative approaches for determining virus

62

inactivation kinetics would be valuable, especially for difficult-to-culture and emerging viruses.

63

Earlier studies have worked towards a predictive manner of evaluating UV254 virus inactivation

64

based on virus attributes (28, 29). Recently developed modeling strategies, an improved

65

understanding of virus UV254 inactivation mechanisms, and additional high-quality inactivation

66

data published in recent years provide the necessary tools and information to expand upon these

67

initial predictive approaches.

68

In this study, we develop models to predict rate constants for virus inactivation with UV254

69

treatment in aqueous suspension using variables that are expected to play a role in inactivation,

70

such as genome sequence composition and genome repair information. We conducted a rapid

71

systematic review to gather high quality virus inactivation data from the literature and used the

72

resulting data set to train and validate the predictive performance of four different models (i.e.,

73

multiple linear regression, elastic net regularization, boosted trees, and random forests). The

74

models developed in this research will facilitate rapid evaluation of UV254 inactivation rate

Results

79

Numerous UV254 rate constants are available, but only for a limited subset of viruses.

80

We conducted a rapid systematic review to collect UV254 inactivation rate constants and used them

81

for the training and validation of models developed to predict virus inactivation kinetics. Of 2,416

82

initial studies, 531 underwent full text review, and 103 studies were included in the final data set

83

(SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Only data from studies passing a set of experimental criteria (SI Appendix,

84

Supplementary Text) were included to ensure collection of high-quality rate constants. These

85

studies produced 224 experimental inactivation rate constants for 59 viruses (Figure 1; SI

86

Appendix, Table S1). Viruses of different strains and types were considered unique.

87

More than 350 studies from the full text review that reported conducting UV virus

88

inactivation in aqueous suspension were not included in the final data set. Data were excluded

89

most commonly because the article did not address UV254 attenuation in the experimental solution

90

and it could not be ruled out based on details in the materials and methods. Nearly 50% of the

91

extracted rate constants represented only five different viruses. For example, there were 62

92

different experimental inactivation rates for bacteriophage MS2; in contrast, several viruses,

93

including hepatitis E virus, only had one reported inactivation rate constant, and there were many

94

human viruses with no data that met the review criteria (e.g., influenza viruses, ebolaviruses,

95

coronaviruses, herpesviruses). Ultimately 13, 84, 111, 4, and 12 experimental inactivation rate

96

constants were extracted for ssDNA, dsDNA, (+) ssRNA, (-) ssRNA, and dsRNA viruses,

97

respectively, representing 3, 26, 22, 2, and 5 unique viruses (Figure 1). No rate constants met the

99

inactivation rate constants spanned ~2.5 orders of magnitude (Figure 1) and ranged from 0.021 to

100

7.6 cm2 mJ-1. The (-) ssRNA viruses had the largest rate constants on average (k = 3.6 cm2 mJ-1),

101

while dsRNA viruses had the lowest average rate constants (k = 0.15 cm2 mJ-1). dsDNA virus

102

constants exhibited the widest range of rate constants, spanning from 0.021 to 5.4 cm2 mJ-1 with a

Rate constants predicted using common modeling approaches. We used the data collected

in the rapid systematic literature review to develop linear regression, elastic net regularization,

several predictors (SI Appendix, Table S2). These model classes were selected to cover a range of

field (30).

126

(RMSrPEs) for the four optimized models varied from 0.22 to 0.95 (Figure 2 and SI Appendix,

127

Table S3), with the top performing multiple linear regression resulting in the lowest RMSrPE out

128

of the four optimized model classes. Various subsets of genomic variables were included in

129

multiple linear regression development. Because these genomic variables are highly collinear, we

130

used principal components that incorporated various genomic variable subsets as predictors in the

131

regression models. Ultimately, the multiple linear regression model with one principal component

132

that incorporated the numbers of cytosines (Cs), uracils (Us), uracil doublets (UUs), and uracil

133

triplets (UUUs) resulted in the lowest RMSrPE (0.22 ± 0.23; RMSrPE ± standard error; SI

RMSrPEs than the top performing multiple linear regression model (RMSrPEelastic net = 0.28 ± 0.26,

RMSrPEboosted trees = 0.32 ± 0.28; SI Appendix, Table S3), and the random forests model had the

largest RMSrPE of the (+) ssRNA virus models (RMSrPErandom forests = 0.95 ± 0.48; SI Appendix,

169

be mediated by the host cell or by viral genes (24), and the varied efficacy of host-mediated dsDNA

170

repair (34–37) impacts virus UV254 sensitivity. We included categorical predictors for genome

171

repair mode (i.e., host cell mediated, virus-gene controlled using one repair system, or virus-gene

172

controlled using multiple repair systems) and host cell type (i.e., prokaryotic host, eukaryotic host

173

with wild type repair, or eukaryotic host with reduced repair) in the dsDNA virus inactivation rate

174

constant models. Genome repair mode and host cell type were assigned based on available

175

information and are described in the SI Appendix.

176

The RMSrPE of the four optimized dsDNA model classes ranged from 0.31 to 1.6 (SI

177

Appendix, Table S3), and the optimized multiple linear regression model outperformed the three

178

other optimized model classes (RMSrPE = 0.31 ± 0.28; Figure 2 and SI Appendix, Table S3). The

179

optimized elastic net and boosted trees RMSrPEs were slightly higher (RMSrPEelastic net = 0.79 ±

180

0.46, RMSrPEboosted trees = 0.70 ± 0.43), though the difference in model performance was not

181

significant (SI Appendix, Table S5), and the random forests model performed significantly worse

182

(RMSrPErandom forests = 1.6 ± 0.66). The top linear regression model included the genome repair

183

mode and host cell type predictors, as well as one principal component comprising the three

184

genomic variables numbers of thymine doublets (TT), thymine quintuplets (TTTTT), and Cs. As

185

with the top-performing (+) ssRNA model, many of the regressions tested with different genomic

186

variable subsets had similar prediction performance, making it difficult to identify which genomic

187

variables were critical for predicting dsDNA virus rate constants (SI Appendix, Table S4). A point

189

= 0.46), genome repair mode (bgenome repair mode = 2.7), and host cell type (bhost cell type = -0.37)

190

predictors indicates that the genome repair mode predictor is approximately 5.9 times more

191

important than the principal component predictor (bgenome repair mode/bPC1 = 2.7/0.46). Host cell type

192

was comparable in importance to the genomic variable contribution, collectively represented by

193

the principal component. Prediction performance dropped significantly without genome repair

194

mode as a predictor (RMSrPEopt = 0.31 ± 0.28, RMSrPEno repair = 1.0 ± 0.52; SI Appendix, Table

195

S5), further highlighting the importance of genome repair in UV254 inactivation.

196

The multiple linear regression model accurately predicted inactivation rate constants across

197

the wide range of dsDNA virus susceptibilities to UV254 (Figure 3b). As with the top performing

198

(+) ssRNA model, the predicted error for the top performing dsDNA model was lower than the

199

estimated inter-experimental error for viruses with more than one experimental rate constant

200

(RMSrPE = 0.31 ± 0.28; inter-experimental error of kvirus = 0.45). Predictions were poorest for

201

T7M, B40-8, and lambda predicted (percent error = 62%, 63%, and 62%, respectively; SI

202

Appendix, Fig. S2b), which are bacteriophages with the same form of genome repair mode. The

203

poor prediction of viruses from this group indicates that some of the rate constants in the training

204

data for viruses with these attributes may be inaccurate, leading to worse performance for

205

bacteriophages with host mediated repair.

206

All-virus model. Larger data sets generally add predictive power to models, though the

207

increased signal from additional data can be attenuated or negated by increased heterogeneity. We

208

therefore compared the performance of the separate (+) ssRNA and dsDNA virus models with a

209

model that incorporated data from all Baltimore classes. In addition to the genomic variables and

210

repair-related predictors (i.e., genome repair mode and host cell type) included for (+) ssRNA and

211

dsDNA viruses, a categorical predictor for nucleic acid type (i.e., double-stranded or single-

212

stranded) was included. Boosted trees models were the top performing models using all viruses

213

(SI Appendix, Table S3); these performed significantly worse than the models trained using only

214

(+) ssRNA viruses (RMSrPE(+) ssRNA = 0.22 ± 0.23, RMSrPEall = 0.45 ± 0.33; SI Appendix, Table

215

S5) or only dsDNA viruses (RMSrPEdsDNA = 0.31 ± 0.28 vs RMSrPEall = 0.45 ± 0.35; SI Appendix,

216

Tables S3 and S5). This suggests that using our modeling approach and combining viruses with

217

diverse genome types and infection cycles into one model can negatively impact performance of

218

virus predictions, possibly owing to insufficient data from less studied classes. Based on these

219

results, we used the separate (+) ssRNA and dsDNA models for subsequent analyses.

220

Predicted rate constants align with new experimental rate constants. We applied the

221

optimized (+) ssRNA and dsDNA models to predict the rate constants of one (+) ssRNA virus and

222

one dsDNA virus for which experimental data were not available and then measured the rate

223

constants experimentally. Specifically, we predicted and measured the rate constants for MHV, a

224

(+) ssRNA mouse coronavirus, and HS2, a dsDNA marine bacteriophage. Based on its large

225

genome size (i.e., ~ 270% longer than the largest (+) ssRNA virus genome included in the training

226

and validation set) MHV provided an opportunity to assess the (+) ssRNA model’s predictive

227

power using a virus with attributes outside those in the training and validation set (SI Appendix,

228

Fig. S3). HS2 bacteriophage has similar genomic attributes to many of the other viruses in the data

229

set (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), and genome repair-related predictors are the same as those for most of

230

the phages. Bacteriophage MS2 was included in each experimental solution to confirm UV254

231

doses; the measured MS2 rate constants were in line with those in the literature (0.12 to 0.14 cm2

232

mJ-1; SI Appendix, Fig. S4 and Table S1).

233

The predicted inactivation rate constant for MHV (kpred = 2.05 ± 0.88 cm2 mJ-1; mean ±

234

95% margin of error) was not significantly different than the experimental rate constant (kexp =

235

1.92 ± 0.17 cm-2 mJ-1), with a percent error of only 7% (Figure 4a). The prediction accuracy the

236

model achieved despite MHV’s elevated UV254 sensitivity compared with other (+) ssRNA viruses

237

in the data set highlights how linear regression approaches are capable of extrapolating predictions

238

239

rate constant predicted with the top performing nonlinear approach, boosted trees, was 79%

240

different the experimental value, with a rate constant of 0.40 ± 0.25 cm2 mJ-1. The accuracy of the

241

MHV rate constant prediction and the relatively low RMSPE obtained for the top performing (+)

242

ssRNA virus model provide confidence that the (+) ssRNA model can effectively predict UV254

243

rate constants for emerging or difficult-to-culture (+) ssRNA viruses.

244

The experimental HS2 inactivation kinetics exhibited significant tailing beyond UV254

245

fluences of 50 mJ cm-2; we therefore modeled the first ~5-log10 of inactivation to obtain a rate

246

constant from the first-order portion of the curve. The resulting dsDNA HS2 bacteriophage

247

experimental rate constant of kexp = 0.28 ± 0.08 cm2 mJ-1 was 71% lower than the predicted rate

248

constant of kpred = 0.48 ± 0.29 cm2 mJ-1(Figure 4b). Although the error of this dsDNA estimate

249

was larger than that of the (+) ssRNA estimate, the HS2 predicted and experimental constants are

250

not significantly different. This result, in combination with the cross-validation results, suggest

251

that the dsDNA model can effectively predict if a dsDNA virus is particularly resistant to UV254

252

treatment.

Discussion

272

Through evaluation of a large set of models from four distinct model classes developed

273

with the best currently available data, we identified effective models for predicting UV254

274

inactivation rate constants of (+) ssRNA and dsDNA viruses using simple virus attributes as model

275

predictors. UV254 primarily targets viral nucleic acid during irradiation. Pyrimidine bases are more

276

photoreactive than purines (38), and pyrimidine dimers, in particular, cause a large portion of the

277

UV-induced damage to DNA (38–44). Limited research centered on ssRNA photolysis suggests

278

pyrimidine hydrates are the primary lesions inducing UV damage (45). Photochemical damage to

279

nucleic acids can stall or inhibit enzymes required for productive viral infection of host cells (46–

280

48). Based on this a priori knowledge, we included several combinations of pyrimidine bases as

281

predictors in our (+) ssRNA and dsDNA models, namely the numbers of U, UU, UUU, UUUU,

282

UUUUU, C, UC, and CU in (+) ssRNA models and the numbers of T, TT, TTT, TTTT, TTTTT,

283

C, TC, and CT in dsDNA models.

284

Ultimately, the top performing (+) ssRNA virus model employed one principal component

285

incorporating multiple genomic variables (i.e., numbers of C, U, UU, and UUU), and the top

286

performing dsDNA virus model employed repair mode, host cell type, and one principal

287

component representing three genomic variables (i.e., numbers of C, TT, TTTTT). The relative

288

importance of variables in our top performing predictive models may provide insight into the

289

mechanisms driving UV254 inactivation of viruses. Among the (+) ssRNA models, many of the

15

290

multiple linear regression models that included distinct subsets of genomic variables performed

291

similarly. This is likely because these genomic variables are so highly correlated that different

292

variable combinations resulted in a similar set of principal components as predictors in modeling,

293

ultimately yielding similar performance among different models. Separating the effects of

294

individual genomic variables was therefore difficult in the (+) ssRNA model. Although the top

295

performing model incorporated multiple genomic variables, several linear regression models using

296

as few as one genomic variable as a predictor resulted in similar model performance. This finding

297

demonstrates that simple aspects of the (+) ssRNA genome provide all the necessary information

298

to accurately predict rate constants for this class of viruses. In the dsDNA model, performance was

299

significantly improved when genome repair predictors were included in addition to principal

300

components incorporating genomic variables. The importance of genome repair was expected. For

301

example, the two dsDNA bacteriophages T2 and T4 have similar genome sizes and composition

302

(SI Appendix, Fig. S3b and Table S2) but dissimilar UV254 inactivation rate constants (5.1 cm-2

303

mJ-1 for T2 and 1.7 cm-2 mJ-1 for T4; SI Appendix, Table S1). T4 phage’s UV254 resistance is due

304

to an additional virus-controlled repair gene in the T4 genome not present in the T2 genome (50,

305

51). Interestingly, the relative contribution of genomic variables in the dsDNA model was

306

significantly less than the genome repair predictors, which suggests that genome repair is a more

307

important factor in dsDNA UV254 inactivation than genomic variables.

308

Including genome repair as a model predictor presented some limitations. First, the mode

309

and extent of genome repair is not known for many viruses and has not been well-studied across

310

virus families. A single predictor encompassing the contribution of genome repair was therefore

311

not possible. We instead applied multiple categorical predictors. With this approach, only viruses

312

that shared a particular genome repair mode or host cell type with at least one other virus in the

16

313

dsDNA data set could be used in cross-validation. Ultimately, the data set used for dsDNA model

314

development and validation lacked numerous forms of dsDNA viruses with distinct repair modes

315

and host cell types, resulting in uncertainty in model performance for certain dsDNA viruses not

316

represented in the training and validation set. To improve future dsDNA virus models, it is critical

317

to have a better understanding of genome repair mechanisms and how they affect UV254

318

inactivation.

319

Our top performing UV254 virus prediction models provide improvements over earlier

320

prediction approaches (28, 29). On average, the (+) ssRNA and dsDNA virus models predicted

321

rate constants to within ~0.2x and ~0.3x of experimental constants, respectively. A previous

322

approach using genome length to determine genome size-normalized sensitivity values for a

323

number of virus families expected uncertainties in predicted values of ~2x (28). A more recent

324

approach developed predictive models for ssRNA and dsDNA UV254 inactivation using genome

325

dimer formation potential, a value that incorporated pyrimidine doublets, genome length, and

326

purines with adjacent pyrimidine doublets (29). Their reported error as a coefficient of

327

determination (i.e., R2) was 0.67 for ssRNA viruses compared to 0.74 (adjusted R2) for our model,

328

and an R2 value of 0.62 for dsDNA viruses compared to 0.99 (adjusted R2) for our model. Several

329

factors can be attributed to the improved performance of our models, including extensive curation

330

of data based on quality and the incorporation of genome repair into dsDNA modeling.

331

In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the need for effective

332

decontamination strategies, our predictive models provided an opportunity to predict rate constants

333

for a critical group of viruses with very little published inactivation data. Limited data on UV254

334

inactivation for coronaviruses in aqueous suspension are available and the published information

335

did not pass the inclusion criteria of our rapid systematic review (10, 52–54). This paucity of

17

336

information on the susceptibility of coronaviruses to UV254 is of critical importance for developing

337

effective decontamination strategies. Our predicted rate constants for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-

338

2, and MERS, and our measured rate constant for the mouse coronavirus MHV, suggest that

339

coronaviruses are much more susceptible to UV254 inactivation than other (+) ssRNA viruses. A

340

recent estimate of SARS-CoV-2 UV254 susceptibility using the previously developed Lytle and

341

Sagripanti approach (28) is ~ 1.7x greater than our estimate indicates (55). Discrepancies in new

342

experimental coronavirus data still persist, likely stemming from a lack of checks on UV254

343

attenuation of suspensions.

344

More robust models are possible with larger data sets that consist of more diverse viruses.

345

Unfortunately, a large portion of UV254 inactivation data found during the rapid systematic review

346

did not pass our inclusion criteria. The most common reason for excluding data from our

347

systematic review was a failure to report solution UV254 attenuation. An earlier study of SARS-

348

CoV-1 inactivation by UV254 (54), for example, did not account for UV254 attenuation in the

349

experimental DMEM suspension. The reported inactivation rate constant of 0.003 cm2 mJ-1 was

350

nearly three orders of magnitude lower than our predicted rate constant for SARS-CoV-1 and our

351

measured value for MHV, likely in part due to solution attenuation. We estimate that their rate

352

constant would be closer to 0.35 cm2 mJ-1 after accounting for solution attenuation. This value

353

more closely aligns with our coronavirus values. Similarly, several studies reported UV254

354

inactivation of viruses in blood products without describing how attenuation was considered in

355

their reported doses (10, 56–58). Although these doses are likely representative for these fluids,

356

they cannot be extrapolated to other matrices. More stringent reporting of UV254 experimental

357

conditions (59), including matrix solution transmission at 254 nm, will facilitate future modeling

358

efforts. We note when UV254 inactivation rate constants are known for a solution with 100%

359

transmittance (e.g., purified virus in buffer solution), the rate constant can be adjusted to account

360

for a solution with significant attenuation (e.g., blood products) based on the Beer-Lambert law

361

(60).

362

The developed models allow us to predict the effectiveness of current UV254 treatment

363

strategies on viral pathogens that are difficult or impossible to culture. For example, human

364

norovirus, which causes gastrointestinal disease, is a major target of UV254 disinfection processes

365

in water treatment and food processing. Our (+) ssRNA virus model predicts an inactivation rate

366

constant of 0.28 cm2 mJ-1 for human norovirus GII.4, which is similar to our recently reported rate

367

constant of k = 0.27 cm2 mJ-1 for human norovirus GII.4 Sydney using RT-qPCR data coupled

368

with a full-genome extrapolation approach (61). This finding indicates that current water treatment

369

guidelines for adequate UV254 virus inactivation, which are defined to treat adenovirus 41 (62), are

370

more than sufficient to inactivate human norovirus to acceptable levels. In fact, none of the viruses

371

for which we predicted rate constants had UV254 resistance greater than viruses in the Adenoviridae

372

family.

373

The limited and unbalanced data set that we obtained from the systematic review and used

374

in modeling efforts created challenges in our modeling work. Of primary concern, we could not

375

take a commonly used approach to evaluating models, in which a portion of data is held back

376

during model development to assess performance. Holding back the typical 10 – 20% of data

377

would correspond to holding back only two to four viruses from the (+) ssRNA or dsDNA classes

378

for testing. This could result in high variance estimates of prediction performance that would also

379

be highly dependent on the viruses withheld during training. We consequently used leave-one-

380

virus-out cross-validation to more efficiently estimate prediction performance on out of sample

381

data. Another limitation of our models is that they were developed and validated for only (+)

382

ssRNA and dsDNA viruses. Although many human viruses are in these two classes, many

383

emerging and noteworthy human viruses belong to other classes. In particular, the (-) ssRNA virus

384

class includes several important human pathogens, such as lassa virus, nipah virus, influenza virus,

385

and ebolavirus. Since only two (-) ssRNA viruses were included in our data set, we were unable

386

to assess whether inactivation rate constants for viruses in this group could be accurately predicted

387

with our (+) ssRNA model. More high quality UV254 experimental inactivation data for a broader

388

set of viruses would facilitate the holdout approach for validating models and the development of

389

models for other virus Baltimore classification groups.

390

This research demonstrates the value of predictive models for estimating virus fate in

391

various settings. Using readily available viral genome data, we developed models to predict UV254

392

inactivation of (+) ssRNA and dsDNA viruses. The benefits of predictive models are underlined

393

by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: access to the biosafety level 3 laboratories required to work

394

with SARS-CoV-2 has been limited and, as a result, few experimental inactivation studies have

395

been performed. Our approach can rapidly determine virus susceptibility to UV254 using available

396

genomes, but without relying on culture systems that are often unavailable or difficult to access.

397

Other potential applications of our models including identifying outlier UV254 data that are

398

published and predicting potential worst-case scenarios for viruses and their susceptibility to

399

UV254. Ultimately, we expect that this predictive modeling approach can be applied to estimate

400

inactivation of microorganisms with other disinfectants and in different settings, such as on

401

surfaces or in air.

404

Rapid systematic review of UV254 virus inactivation data. We used a rapid systematic

405

literature review to capture high quality UV254 virus inactivation data (63, 64). Data were extracted

406

from studies if they adhered to all of the following criteria: the UV254 lamp fluences were measured

407

and reported; sources emitted UV irradiation principally at wavelengths of 253, 253.7, 254, or 255

408

nm; viruses were irradiated in a liquid suspension; infective viruses were enumerated with

409

quantitative culture-based approaches (e.g., plaque assay); attenuation through the sample solution

410

was taken into account, or negligible UV254 attenuation was reported (transmittance > 95%) or

411

could be assumed based on the reported viral stock purification techniques and matrix solution

412

composition; stirring was reported when attenuation was significant (transmittance < 95%); first-

413

order kinetics were reported or could be confirmed with reported data points for at least two UV254

414

fluences; the first-order inactivation rate constant or log-removal dose (e.g., D99) was provided or

415

could be determined with data presented in a plot or table. For publications that contained valuable

416

data, but for which not all criteria could be evaluated, corresponding authors were contacted when

417

possible to inquire about the criteria. For studies that reported multiple UV254 inactivation

418

experiments for the same virus (e.g., in different solutions, with multiple UV254 sources), we

419

combined all data to determine a single inactivation rate constant with linear regression analysis.

420

All data were re-extracted by a second reviewer and discrepancies were addressed. Additional

details of our rapid systematic review process are included in the SI Appendix, Supplementary

viruses with three or more inactivation rate constants obtained from the systematic review, outlier

determine values for each predictor are included in the SI. A list of the exact predictors as well as

450

the values used for each virus are available in SI Appendix, Table S2.

451

Predictive model optimization. We used four model classes, namely multiple linear

452

regression, elastic net regularization, boosted trees, and random forests, to predict virus

453

inactivation during UV254 disinfection. For each model class, we developed individual models

454

using only (+) ssRNA viruses and only dsDNA viruses. We also generated a single model

455

developed using all viruses included in the collected data set and thus not separated by virus

456

Baltimore classification groups. We assessed model performance using leave-one-virus-out cross-

457

validation. Further details of model training, validation, and prediction performance evaluation are

458

included in the SI Appendix, Supplementary Text. Data manipulation, statistical analyses, and

459

modeling work were conducted in R software version 4.0.0 (65). The raw data files and the scripts

460

for model development and prediction will be made available on Github upon publication.

461

Multiple linear regression. Several of the genomic variables are collinear (e.g., numbers of

462

U and UU). We therefore conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the genomic variables

463

prior to linear modeling to reduce variable dimensionality and eliminate collinearity. The

464

predictors nucleic acid type, genome repair mode, and host cell type were not included in the PCA.

465

We then developed linear regression models containing either the first, first and second, or first,

466

second, and third principal components, as well as the other predictors. Only the first through third

467

principal components were assessed for inclusion in the linear regression models, because they

468

cumulatively explained 97% of the variation in genomic variables. Genomic variables were

469

standardized to unit variance prior to PCA to eliminate dissimilarities in the magnitude of variable

470

values. Linear regression can include one or more predictors that can affect model accuracy. We

471

therefore used best subset selection to evaluate a wide range of potential multiple linear regression

472

models.

473

Elastic net regularization. As an alternative to best subset selection, we considered linear

474

regression with parameter regularization using L1 (“Lasso”) and L2 (“Ridge”) penalties, a

475

technique known as the elastic net. We used the ‘glmnet’ package in R to create models with elastic

476

net regularization. The alpha and lambda hyperparameters, which control the relative contribution

477

and overall scale of the L1 and L2 penalties, respectively, were tuned using a grid search to find

478

the optimal hyperparameters for the data set as determined by leave-one-virus-out cross-validation.

479

Specifically, 11 different values ranging from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.1 were assessed for the

480

hyperparameter alpha, and 100 different lambda values were evaluated for each alpha.

481

Random forests. To accommodate the use of the modified inverse variance weights, the

482

random forests model was developed in R using the ‘xgboost’ package with a single round of

483

boosting, and other hyperparameters were set to match defaults from the ‘randomForest’ package

484

as well as possible (66).

485

Boosted trees. Boosted trees modeling was conducted using the ‘xgboost’ package in R.

486

The number of boosting rounds was selected to minimize the cross-validated error. The

487

hyperparameters for learning rate, tree depth, and minimum terminal node weight were 0.3, 6, and

488

1, respectively.

489

Experimental and predicted UV254 inactivation of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and

490

bacteriophage HS2. To consider how well the models may predict inactivation of a virus not

491

already included in the collected data set, we determined the UV254 inactivation rate constant of

492

MHV, a virus in the Coronaviridae family and Betacoronavirus genus, and of HS2, a marine

495

UV254 inactivation of viruses. All UV254 inactivation experiments were conducted with a

496

custom-made collimated beam reactor containing 0.16 mW cm-2 lamps (model G15T8, Philips).

497

UV254 irradiance was determined using chemical actinometry (67, 68) and MS2 (ATCC 15597-

498

B1) was included in all experimental solutions as a biodosimeter to further confirm UV254 doses.

499

Infective MS2 was assessed using the double agar overlay approach with host Escherichia coli

500

(ATCC 15597) (69). For each UV254 exposure, 2 mL of the experimental solution was added to a

501

10 mL glass beaker and continuously stirred. Sample solution depth (0.8 cm) and transmittance (~

502

47% to 53% for MHV experiments, ~ 79% to 80% for HS2 experiments) were used to determine

503

the average UV254 irradiance of the sample according to the Beer-Lambert law (60). Infective

504

viruses were assayed immediately following experiments. Dark controls were conducted with each

505

experiment and consisted of the virus suspended in experimental solution but stored in the dark on

506

ice for the duration of experiments. Three independent replicates were conducted for each

507

inactivation experiment.

508

For MHV experiments, solutions contained MHV and MS2 diluted in 1X PBS to a final

509

concentration of ~ 105 pfu/mL and ~ 1010 pfu/mL, respectively. Samples were exposed to UV254

510

for 0 s, 5 s, 15 s, 25 s, and 35 s, which corresponded to UV254 doses of approximately 0 mJ cm-2,

511

0.62 mJ cm-2, 1.2 mJ cm-2, 1.9 mJ cm-2, 3.1 mJ cm-2, and 4.3 mJ cm-2. MS2 infectivity was assayed

512

after larger UV254 doses due to its slower inactivation kinetics, namely 37 mJ cm-2 and 74 mJ cm-

513

514

concentration of ~ 108 pfu/mL and ~ 109 pfu/mL, respectively. Samples were irradiated for 0 s,

180 s, 300 s, 480 s, 600 s, and 720 s, which resulted in UV254 doses of approximately 0 mJ cm-2,

516

26 mJ cm-2, 44 mJ cm-2, 70 mJ cm-2, 88 mJ cm-2, and 105 mJ cm-2.

517
518
519

The inactivation rate constant, kexp in cm2 mJ-1, for MHV, HS2, and MS2 was determined
by the following equation:
6

𝑙𝑛 56 7 = 𝑘89: ∙ 𝐷<=>?@
&

(4)

520

where C0 and C are infectious virus concentrations before and after UV254 exposure, respectively,

521

in pfu/mL, and DUV254 is the average UV254 dose, in mJ cm-2.

522

Experimental inactivation rate constants (i.e., kexp) were determined with linear regression

523

analyses conducted in Prism version 8.4.2 (GraphPad) to obtain experimental inactivation rate

524

constants (i.e., kexp). UV254 inactivation curves for some viruses exhibited tailing at high doses. In

525

these situations, only the linear portions of the inactivation curves were included in the linear

526

regression analyses.

527

MHV and HS2 inactivation rate constant prediction. The UV254 inactivation rate constants

528

of MHV and HS2 were predicted using the best-performing inactivation models for (+) ssRNA

529

viruses and dsDNA viruses, respectively. The MHV genome sequence was provided by Dr.

530

Leibowitz (SI Appendix, Supplementary Text File S1), and the HS2 genome sequence is available

531

in NCBI (accession no. KF302036).

532

Predicting UV254 inactivation of emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses. The inactivation

533

rates of several emerging and difficult-to-culture viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, were predicted

534

using the best-performing inactivation model. Sequence data for these viruses were obtained from

535

NCBI and all viruses with sequence information are included in SI Appendix, Table S2.
