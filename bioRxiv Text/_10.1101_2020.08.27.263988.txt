Abstract

21

Transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) between livestock and

22

humans is a potential public health concern. We demonstrate the susceptibility of rabbits to

23

SARS-CoV-2, which excrete infectious virus from the nose and throat upon experimental

24

inoculation. Therefore, investigations on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed rabbits should

25

be considered.

Text
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic only

29

months after its discovery in December 2019 (1). Slowing down its spread requires a full

30

understanding of transmission routes, including those from humans to animals and vice versa. In

31

experimental settings, non-human primates, ferrets, cats, dogs and hamsters have been found to

32

be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (2-4). Moreover, ferrets, cats and hamsters were able to

33

transmit the virus via the air (2, 4, 5). In domestic settings, both dogs and cats have been found to

34

carry the virus, displaying very mild to more severe symptoms, respectively (5). Recently,

35

SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from mink at multiple Dutch farms. Workers at those farms

36

carried viruses that were highly similar to the viruses detected in mink and phylogenetic analyses

37

supported transmission from mink to workers (6). Thus, measures to control the spread of SARS-

38

CoV-2 should also include preventing spill over into potential reservoirs, especially since

39

infectious agents can spread rapidly in livestock due to the high densities at which some animals

40

are kept. Given the fact that rabbits are commonly farmed worldwide, we investigated the

41

susceptibility of rabbits to SARS-CoV-2.

The study
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) dictates the host range for SARS

46

coronaviruses (7), because it engages the viral spike (S) glycoprotein for cell attachment and

47

fusion of the viral and host membranes (8). Contact residues of human and rabbit ACE2 critical

48

for binding S are relatively well conserved (9). We overexpressed ACE2 from different species

49

on a receptor-deficient cell line followed by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus or authentic virus

50

infection. Successful infection of both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus was

51

observed for human, rabbit and the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) ACE2 (Figure

52

1, panel A and B). The ACE2 from a distantly related bat, the great Himalayan leaf-nosed bat

53

(Hipposideros armiger), did not support infection and served as a negative control. Transfection

54

of rabbit ACE2 rendered cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated by a clear

55

overlap between infection and ACE2 expression (Figure 1, panel C).

56

Next, we inoculated three rabbits with 106 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)

57

SARS-CoV-2 for a 21 day follow up. None of the inoculated animals showed clinical signs of

58

infection. As shown in Figure 2 (panel A), we found viral RNA in the nose for at least twenty-

59

one days (mean shedding of 15.33 days, SD=5.13), up to fourteen days in the throat (mean

60

shedding of 11.33 days, SD=2.52) and up to nine days in the rectum (mean shedding of 5 days,

61

SD=3.61). Infectious virus shedding from the nose lasted up to seven days (mean shedding of

62

6.67 days, SD=0.58) with a peak at day two, followed by a second peak at day seven post

63

inoculation (p.i.) (Figure 2, panel B). In the throat, infectious virus was detected only on day one

64

p.i. for one animal. No infectious virus was detected in rectal swabs. All animals followed up to

65

day 21 seroconverted with plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) titers of 1:40, 1:320 and

66

1:640.

67

Additionally, three groups of three animals were inoculated with either 104, 105 or 106 TCID50

68

SARS-CoV-2 and swabs were taken for four days before the animals were euthanized and

69

autopsied. All animals inoculated with 106 TCID50 were viral RNA positive in the nose and

70

throat for at least four days with a single animal positive in the rectum at day three (Figure 2,

71

panel C). Animals inoculated with 105 TCID50 were RNA positive in the nose for at least four

72

days, for at least three days in the throat but not in the rectum (Figure 2, panel D). These animals

73

also shed infectious virus in the nose for up to three days (mean shedding of 1.67 days, SD=1.53)

74

and one animal shed virus two days post infection in the throat (data not shown). Animals

75

inoculated with 104 TCID50 did not shed any detectable viral RNA (Figure 2, panel E). Although

76

nasal turbinates yielded on average 8.42x103 RNA copies/ml, lung homogenates of animals

77

inoculated with 106 TCID50 virus were found viral RNA negative (Figure 2, panel F). Despite the

78

fact that no viral RNA was detected in the lungs, histological examination of the lungs of

79

infected animals sacrificed four days p.i. revealed a multifocal mild to moderate increase in

80

alveolar macrophages in the alveolar lumina with multifocal presence of few neutrophils. Mainly

81

associated with the terminal bronchioles, multifocal mild thickening of the septa, with

82

infiltrations of neutrophils, eosinophils and occasional lymphocytes, plasma cells and

83

macrophages was observed (Figure 2, panel G). Mild multifocal necrosis of alveolar epithelial

84

cells and the presence of a few enlarged, syncytial cells in the alveolar lumina were seen (Figure

85

2, panel H). There was mild peribronchiolar and peribronchial lymphoplasmacytic infiltration

86

with eosinophils and moderate to severe bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue proliferation

87

(Supplementary figure 1, panel A). Some animals showed enlarged tracheo-bronchial lymph

88

nodes consistent with mild lymphoid hyperplasia. In the nose, there was multifocal infiltration of

89

moderate numbers of eosinophils and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the olfactory epithelium

90

(exocytosis) and in the lamina propria, alongside mild hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the

91

olfactory epithelium (Supplementary figure 1, panel B). Mild eosinophilic exocytosis was

92

present in the trachea.

93

Conclusions

94

This study demonstrates that rabbits are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. While the infection

95

is asymptomatic, infectious virus with peak titers corresponding to ~103 TCID50 could be

96

detected up to day seven post inoculation in the nose. The minimum dose to establish productive

97

infection was 105 TCID50, indicating that virus transmission between rabbits may be less

98

efficient compared to ferrets and hamsters. The use of young, immunocompetent, and healthy

99

New Zealand White rabbits in this study however may not reflect virus shedding and disease in

100

other rabbit breeds or rabbits at different ages. Thus, surveillance studies - including serological

101

testing - may be needed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed rabbits.

102

Viral shedding in rabbits occurred in a biphasic pattern, which was also observed for

103

SARS-CoV-2 infected African green monkeys (10). This pattern is potentially linked to early

104

innate immune responses that act within days, followed by adaptive responses that generally take

105

one week to be activated. These observations are in line with recent findings that the presence of

106

neutralizing serum antibodies in humans negatively correlates with infectious virus shedding,

107

and that shedding of viral RNA outlasts shedding of infectious virus (11). The presence of

108

eosinophils in the nose and lungs of infected animals suggests a possible helper T cell 2 (Th2)-

109

mediated immune response. The preferential upper respiratory tract infection in the absence of

110

robust replication in the lower respiratory tract of rabbits resembles what has been observed in

111

experimentally inoculated ferrets (5).

112

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to mink caused viral spread between farm animals

113

and spillover to humans, resulting in mass culling of mink to limit the spread of the virus (6).

114

This study provides evidence of susceptibility of rabbits to SARS-CoV-2 infection warranting

115

further investigations on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed rabbits.

The protocol for VSV-G pseudovirus rescue was adapted from Whelan and colleagues (1).

230

Briefly, a 70% confluent 10 cm dish of HEK-293T cells was transfected with 10µg pVSV-eGFP-

234

(1X) + GlutaMAX. Forty-eight hours post-transfection the supernatant was transferred onto new

235

plates transfected 24 hours prior with VSV-G. After a further 48 hours, these plates were re-

236

transfected with VSV-G. After 24 hours the resulting pseudoviruses were collected, cleared by

237

centrifugation at 2000 x g for 5 minutes, and stored at -80°C. Subsequently, VSV-G pseudovirus

238

batches were produced by infecting VSV-G transfected HEK-293T cells with VSV-G

239

pseudovirus at a MOI of 0.1. Titres were determined by preparing 10-fold serial dilutions in

240

Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX. Aliquots of each dilution were added to monolayers of 2 ×

241

104 Vero cells in the same medium in a 96-well plate. Three replicates were performed per

242

pseudovirus stock. Plates were incubated at 37°C overnight and then scanned using an

243

Amersham Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). Individual infected cells were quantified using

dropwise addition of 500 ng ACE2 expression plasmids using a PEI ratio of 1:3 (DNA:PEI) in

268

Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX. After 24 hours, cells were washed twice and replaced with fresh

269

Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX prior to pseudovirus or live virus infection. Pseudovirus

270

transduction was performed by infecting plates with 103 VeroE6 titrated particles per well. Plates

271

were incubated for 16 hours at 37°C before quantifying GFP-positive cells using an Amersham

272

Typhoon scanner and ImageQuant TL software. Authentic virus infection was performed by

273

adding 104 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 per well and incubating plates for 8 hours at 37°C. After

275

mouse anti-SARS nucleoprotein (Sino Biological) and 1:1000 rabbit anti-human ACE2

(Abcam), followed by 1:1000 goat anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 594, 1:1000 goat anti-mouse Alexa-

277

Fluor 488, and 1:1000 TO-PRO3 (Thermo Fisher) to stain nuclei. Quantification of virus

278

infected cells was performed using an Amersham Typhoon scanner and ImageQuant TL software

279

as described above, while confocal imaging was performed on a LSM700 confocal microscope

280

using ZEN software (Zeiss).

281

In vivo study design

282

Animal experiments were approved and performed according to the guidelines from the

283

Institutional Animal Welfare Committee (AVD277002015283-WP04). The studies were

284

performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions. Three month-old New Zealand White

285

rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), specific pathogen free, and seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 were

286

divided into four groups of three animals. Animals were inoculated under ketamine-

287

medetomidine anesthesia intranasally with 1 ml SARS-CoV-2 (0.5 ml per nostril). Three groups

288

were infected intranasally with respectively 104, 105 or 106 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 and monitored

289

for four days post infection, and an additional three animals were infected with 106 TCID50

290

SARS-CoV-2 and monitored for 21 days post infection. Animals monitored for four days were

291

swabbed from the nose, throat, and rectum daily before being sacrificed for pathology on day 4

292

post infection. The remaining three 106 TCID50 infected animals were followed until 21 days

293

post infection with swabs taken on days zero to seven, then on days nine, 11, 14 and 21 post

294

infection. In addition, on day 21 sera was collected from these animals for serological testing.

295

Plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50). Serum samples were tested for their

296

neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 as described before (2). Heat-inactivated (56

degrees Celsius for 30 minutes) samples were 2-fold serially diluted in Dulbecco modified Eagle

298

medium supplemented with NaHCO3, HEPES buffer, penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% fetal

299

bovine serum, starting at a dilution of 1:10 in 50 μL. Fifty μL virus suspension (~400 plaque-

300

forming units) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour before transferring to

301

VeroE6 cells. After incubation cells were washed and supplemented with medium, followed by

302

an 8 hour incubation. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-

303

buffered saline (PBS) and stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS-CoV antibody (Sino

304

Biological), followed by a secondary peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako). The signal

305

was developed by using a precipitate forming 3,3′,5,5′ tetramethylbenzidine substrate (True

306

Blue; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) and the number of infected cells per well was

307

quantified using an ImmunoSpot Image Analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH). The serum

308

neutralization titer is the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in an infection reduction of

309

>50% (PRNT50). A titer >20 was considered positive.

310

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR

311

Swabs, lung homogenates and nasal turbinate homogenates were thawed and centrifuged at

312

2,000 x g for 5 min. Sixty μL supernatant was lysed in 90 μL MagnaPure LC Lysis buffer

313

(Roche) at room temperature for 10 minutes. RNA was extracted by incubating samples with 50

314

μL Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) for 15 minutes at room temperature,

315

washing beads twice with 70% ethanol on a DynaMag-96 magnet (Invitrogen) and eluting in 30

316

μL ultrapure water. RNA copies per mL were determined by qRT-PCR using primers targeting

317

the E gene (37) and compared to a counted RNA standard curve.

Alveolitis severity, bronchitis/bronchiolitis severity, tracheitis and rhinitis severity were scored:

320

0 = no inflammatory cells, 1 = few inflammatory cells, 2 = moderate number of inflammatory

321

cells, 3 = many inflammatory cells. Alveolitis extent, 0 = 0%, 1 = <25%, 2 = 25-50%, 3 = >50%.

Alveolar oedema presence, alveolar haemorrhage presence, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia

323

presence, 0 = no, 1 = yes. Extent of peribronchial/perivascular cuffing, 0 = none, 1 = 1-2 cells

Immunohistochemistry

326

Semiquantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen expression in the lungs was

327

performed as reported for SARS-CoV earlier (3) with a few amendments: for the alveoli, twenty-

328

five arbitrarily chosen, 20x objective fields of lung parenchyma in each lung section were

329

examined by light microscopy for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, without the

330

knowledge of the allocation of the animals. The cumulative scores for each animal were

331

presented as number of positive fields per 100 fields. For the bronchi and bronchioles, the

332

percentage of positively staining bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium was estimated on every

333

slide and the average of the four slides was taken to provide the score per animal. For the trachea

334

and nose, the percentage of positively staining epithelium was estimated on every slide.
