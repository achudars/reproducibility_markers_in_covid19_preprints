Abstract
Changeux et al. recently suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein may interact with nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Such interactions may be involved in pathology and infectivity.
Here, we use molecular simulations of validated atomically detailed structures of nAChRs, and of the
S protein, to investigate this ‘nicotinic hypothesis’. We examine the binding of the Y674-R685 loop of
the S protein to three nAChRs, namely the human α4β2 and α7 subtypes and the muscle-like αβγδ
receptor from Tetronarce californica. Our results indicate that Y674-R685 has affinity for nAChRs and
the region responsible for binding contains the PRRA motif, a four-residue insertion not found in other
SARS-like coronaviruses. In particular, R682 has a key role in the stabilisation of the complexes as it
forms interactions with loops A, B and C in the receptor’s binding pocket. The conformational
behaviour of the bound Y674-R685 region is highly dependent on the receptor subtype, adopting
extended conformations in the α4β2 and α7 complexes and more compact ones when bound to the

muscle-like receptor. In the α4β2 and αβγδ complexes, the interaction of Y674-R685 with the receptors
forces the loop C region to adopt an open conformation similar to other known nAChR antagonists. In
contrast, in the α7 complex, Y674-R685 penetrates deeply into the binding pocket where it forms
interactions with the residues lining the aromatic box, namely with TrpB, TyrC1 and TyrC2. Estimates
of binding energy suggest that Y674-R685 forms stable complexes with all three nAChR subtypes.
Analyses of the simulations of the full-length S protein show that the Y674-R685 region is accessible
for binding, and suggest a potential binding orientation of the S protein with nAChRs.

Main text
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel strain of coronavirus
that first appeared in China in late 2019 and causes the potentially fatal disease COVID-19. This virus
initially infects respiratory epithelial cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting 2 enzyme1 (ACE2)
and may cause pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.2,3 Since it emerged as a
human pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 27.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and
903,756 deaths worldwide as of 9th September, 2020.4 Several major risk factors for the development
of COVID-19 have been identified, namely age, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension.5 Recently,
given the apparently low prevalence of smokers among hospitalised COVID-19 patients,6-8 it was
proposed that nicotine may offer some protective value to mitigate COVID-19 (the ‘protection’
hypothesis).6 It has been suggested that medicinal nicotine (either in patches, gum, or electronic delivery
systems) should be investigated as a therapeutic option for this disease.6,9 Clinical trials for nicotine are
underway (e.g. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04429815). It should be noted that alternative
explanations to the ‘protection’ hypothesis have been proposed:10 the first relates to the failure in
correctly identifying smokers upon hospital admission,10 and the second is that hospitalised COVID-19
patients may be less likely to smoke as their comorbidities motivate them to quit (‘smoking cessation’
hypothesis).10
Based on the early observations of the lower than expected smoking prevalence in hospitalised COVID19 patients, Changeux and colleagues suggested a role for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)
in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 via a direct interaction between these receptors and the viral spike
(S) glycoprotein.11 This suggestion was based in the fact that the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 contains
a sequence motif similar to known nAChR antagonists11 (Figure S1), such as α-bungarotoxin from
Bungarus multicinctus and glycoprotein from Rabies lyssavirus (formerly Rabies virus). Changeux et
al. also proposed that COVID-19 might be controlled or mitigated by the use of nicotine, if the latter
can sterically or allosterically compete with the virus for binding to these receptors.9,11

nAChRs are cation channels that belong to the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family.12 They are
present in both the peripheral (at the skeletal neuromuscular junction and in the autonomic nervous
system) and central nervous system (CNS).13 The neuronal receptors have emerged as important targets
for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, pain and nicotine addiction.13,14 Mutations of
muscle nAChR can cause congenital myasthenia gravis.4 There is a large repertoire of nAChR subtypes
which differ in the homo- or heteromeric assembly of five monomers arranged around a central channel
axis.15-17 Each subtype shows different selectivity for agonists and antagonists.15-17 All nAChRs share
the same basic architecture (Figure 1B), formed of a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD),
where the agonist binding site is located; a transmembrane domain (TMD) surrounding the ion channel;
an intracellular domain (ICD); and a short extracellular C-terminal domain (CTD).15-17 The ligandbinding pocket is located at the interface between two neighbouring subunits (Figure 1B) and is formed
by loops A, B and C from the principal subunit and D, E and F from the complementary subunit (Figure
S2).
According to Changeux et al.’s ‘nicotinic hypothesis’, direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and
nAChRs is proposed to occur via a loop in the viral S protein11 (Figure S3). Here, we investigate this
potential interaction for three nAChR subtypes, using fully solvated, all-atom molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. Our modelling (using atomically detailed structures of the glycosylated S protein,18
and the muscle-type nAChR from Tetronarce californica19) suggests that the association between the S
protein and nAChR is not possible when the two proteins are parallel to each other but can be achieved
in an orthogonal arrangement (Figure S3). The S protein from SARS-CoV-2 is a fusion protein20,21
found on the surface of the virion that mediates entry into host cells. It is an extensively glycosylated
homotrimer with each monomer formed by three domains (Figure 1A): head, stalk and cytoplasmic tail
(CT).21 The head comprises two subunits: S1 is responsible for binding to ACE2 of the host cell,21 and
S2 for membrane fusion.21 The SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains two proteolytic cleavage sites:21 one
(‘furin cleavage’ site) at the S1/S2 boundary thought to activate the protein22 and a second in the S2
subunit that releases the fusion peptide.23 The loop suggested by Changeux et al. to be directly involved
in the interaction with nAChRs spans from Y674 to R685 and is located in the head region of the protein,
at the interface between the S1 and S2 domains, immediately preceding the S1/S2 cleavage point21
(Figure 1A). Furin cleaves the peptide bond after R685, thus separating it from its neighbour S686 (e.g.
before viral exit from the host cell).22 Cleavage activation of viral glycoproteins is known to be
important for infectivity and virulence.21,22 Analysis of the dynamics of Y674-R685 in MD simulations
of the full-length glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein18 (see Supporting Information) reveals that the
furin loop region is only weakly shielded by the glycans, and predominantly solvent exposed, especially
when the S protein is in the closed state (Figure S4). In these simulations, Y674-R685 shows a different
extent of conformational flexibility according to the state (open or closed) of the S protein, which might
allude to a different binding propensity. This is most likely a structural consequence of the S protein’s

receptor binding domain transitioning between the two states, which ultimately affects the packing of
the three monomers. However, the peptide is found to adopt conformations potentially compatible with
binding to nAChRs (Figure S5).
The Y674-R685 region contains the 4-residue PRRA insertion not present in other SARS-CoV-related
coronaviruses,24 and includes a sequence motif homologous to several neurotoxins known to target
nAChRs.11 In SARS-CoV-2, abrogation of the PRRA motif moderately affects virus entry into cells.21,22
This motif has recently been shown experimentally to interact with neuropilin-1 receptors25 and has
also been suggested to have an affinity for T cell receptors.26 The high sequence similarities between
Y674-R685 region and several known nAChR antagonists (Figure S1) suggests that this region of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein may bind to nAChRs, and could potentially act as an antagonist thus inhibiting
gating.11 Hence, it has been postulated that nicotine may have an effect in COVID-19 by competing and
interfering with this binding. Note that very recently an alternative region (G381 to K386 in the S1
subunit) in the S protein has been hypothesized to interact with nAChRs.27

protein represents the closed state of the protein, after furin cleavage.18 The S protein is a homotrimer:21 each
monomer is shown in a different colour, namely green, cyan and orange, with glycans depicted in pink. Each
monomer is formed by three domains: head, stalk and cytoplasmic tail (CT).21 The Y674-R685 region is shown
in red. In MD simulations of the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein,18 Y674-R685 is accessible, being only
weakly shielded by the glycans (Figure S4) and also shows high flexibility (Figure S5). (B) The cryoEM structure
of the muscle-type receptor from Tetronarce californica (PDB code: 6UWZ). 19 This receptor is a heteropentamer
formed of two α (green), one β (blue), one δ (yellow), and one γ (orange) subunits. Each monomer is formed by
four domains:15-17 extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), intracellular (ICD) and C-terminal domain
(CTD). The agonist binding site is located in the ECDs at the interface between two neighbouring subunits.

Here, we use molecular simulation to examine the nicotinic hypothesis proposed by Changeux et al.11
of whether the SARS-CoV-2 S protein can bind stably to nAChRs via the Y674-R685 region. To test
this, we built structural models for the complexes formed by the 12-residue region from the S protein
(S-peptide) and the ECDs of three different nAChRs, namely the human α4β2, human α7 and musclelike αβγδ receptor from Tetronarce californica (hereafter named αβγδ). These simulations build on our
successful previous extensive simulations of nAChRs, which have e.g. identified a general mechanism
for signal propagation in this receptor family.28-30
The α4β2 nAChR is the most prevalent heteromeric subtype in the brain: it is implicated in diverse
processes such as cognition, mood and reward, and is necessary for nicotine addiction.15-17,31 The
homomeric α7 nAChR is also abundant and widely expressed in the CNS, where it contributes to
cognition, sensory processing and attention.32 The 7 subtype is also expressed on a variety of nonneuronal cells, such as immune cells, astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, where it contributes to
anti-inflammatory pathways.33-35 Due to its role in the downregulation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines,33-35 it has been suggested that the α7 nAChR may be involved in the hyperinflammation response that can be caused by SARS-CoV-2.9,36 The muscle-type receptor derived from
the electric organ of Tetronarce californica (formerly Torpedo californica) is one the most extensively
studied nAChRs, and has provided significant structural insight into this receptor family. It is formed
by two α and one β, δ and γ subunits and has high sequence similarity (55%-80% identity) with its
human counterpart.37 For this reason, and because of the availability of structural information, we used
it here as a proxy for the human muscle-type nAChRs. Muscle fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia are
common symptoms in COVID-19 patients, but we are not aware of studies reporting the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 in the skeletal muscles, joint, or bones. It is still unclear how the virus affects the
musculoskeletal system.38
Structural models of the three SARS-CoV-2 S-peptide–nAChR complexes were built based on the
cryoEM structure of the αβγδ receptor from Tetronarce californica with bungarotoxin.19 αbungarotoxin is a neurotoxin that acts as a nAChR antagonist, directly competing with acetylcholine,39

and has high sequence similarity with the Y674-R685 region of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure
S1). Twenty models were generated for each complex, and the one with the lowest Modeller objective
function40 (Figures 2 and S6) was used as the starting point for MD simulations (see the Supporting
Information for more details). Three replicates, each 300 ns long, were performed for each complex to
investigate the peptide-receptor conformational behaviour and possible induced-ﬁt effects.

At the beginning of the simulations, the S-peptide was located in the binding pocket, bound by
interactions with both the principal and complementary subunits (Figures 2 and S6). A closeup view
of the peptide-receptor interface reveals extensive contacts (Figures 2B and S6B), mainly with the
principal subunit. In all three complexes, the sidechain of R682 of the S-peptide binds as the recognised
positively charged group, a strictly conserved pharmacophore of all nAChR ligands.41,42 As can be seen
in Figure 2B, the guanidinium group of R682 is well-positioned inside the aromatic box, forming
several cation-π interactions with TyrC1 (α4Y223, α7Y210, αY214 in the human α4β2, human α7 and
muscle-like αβγδ receptor from Tetronarce californica, respectively), TyrC2 (α4Y230, α7Y217,
αY222) and TyrA (α4Y126, α7Y115, αY117). Note that these cation-π interactions do not entirely
mimic the binding of nicotine as no interactions with TrpB are present.43 R682 is part of the four-residue
PRRA insertion not found in other SARS-like coronaviruses,24 and it forms part of the furin cleavage
site located the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits.21 Additional binding interactions with the
peptide are also observed with different residues depending on the receptor subtype: in the α4β2
nAChR, hydrogen bonds involving the sidechains of α4Y223, α4E224, β2S192, β2D195 in the receptor
and Q675, N679 and the main-chain nitrogen of A684 of the S-peptide are observed; in the α7 nAChR,
two hydrogen bonds between α7D186 and α7Y210 in the receptor and S-peptide Q675 and Q677 are
seen; in the αβγδ receptor from Tetronarce californica, hydrogen bonds involving αY214 and δD186
from the receptor and Q675, N679, R682 and R683 of the peptide are observed.
During the simulations, distinct patterns of dynamical behaviour were identified for the S-peptide in the
different receptor subtypes. In the α4β2 and α7 complexes, the peptide showed high positional and
conformational variability, while in the αβγδ complex, it generally remained in the same pose
throughout the simulation (Figures S7 and S9). Similar behaviour is observed for the peptides in the
two binding pockets in each complex. When bound to the α4β2 and α7 nAChR, the peptide adopted
many different binding modes inside the pocket, ranging from highly compact to fully extended
conformations (Figure S9). In contrast, in the αβγδ receptor, the peptide was more compact (Figure
S9). The range of the radius of gyration values for the S-peptide in all three complexes is similar to that
observed in the simulations of the full-length glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein embedded in a viral
membrane18 (Figures S5). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the dynamics of the peptide revealed
different conformational behaviour of the peptide in the three complexes. When bound to the musclelike receptor, the peptide shows limited dynamical freedom: it explores a restricted conformational
space spanned by the first two principal components (Figure S10).
The number of hydrogen bonds between the peptide and the receptors was determined over the
simulations (Figure S11). Two more H-bonds are observed in the αβγδ complex than in the α4β2 and
α7 receptors (Figure S11). These additional interactions with the complementary subunit (Figure S11)

probably contribute to the increased stability of this complex and the more compact conformation of
the peptide in the αβγδ receptor.
Analysis of the distribution of the distance between the R682 of the peptide and the conserved aromatic
residues forming the aromatic box shows the distinctive behaviour of the peptide bound to different
receptors (Figure S12). Interactions with R682, TyrC1 and TyrC2 are quite frequent in all three
complexes, being present more than 60% of the time. To examine how deeply in the binding pocket the
peptide inserts, we monitored the interactions of R682 with TrpB, a residue lining the back wall of the
nAChR aromatic box. TrpB (α4W182, α7W171 and αW173) is highly conserved across the nAChR
family, and it makes cation-π and H-bond interactions with the positively charged group on the
ligands.41,42 In the α4β2 and αβγδ complexes, the S-peptide does not extend far into the pocket and
interactions between R682 and TrpB are mostly absent (Figure S12). In contrast, in the α7 complex,
the peptide binds more deeply into the hydrophobic cavity, adopting conformations that allow not only
for the direct contact between R682 and TrpB (Figures S13-S14) but also achieve optimal core-binding
interactions (Figure 3). In such configurations, other interactions are present in addition to those with
TrpB, namely cation-π interactions with TyrC1 and TyrC2 (Figure S14). Although no direct contact
between R682 and TyrA is observed, both residues are connected through a H-bond network mediated
by Q675 from the S-peptide (Figure S15). This is significant because interactions with TyrA, TrpB,
TyrC1 and TyrC2 are known to be critical for ligand binding and to modulate gating in the 7 subtype.4446

and the aromatic rings of TrpB (α7W171), TyrC1 (α7Y210) and TyrC2 (α7Y217) are shown with dashed lines.

The binding of a ligand or a peptide can be expected to affect the conformational dynamics of the
receptors. To investigate this, the Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) profiles of the Cα atoms were
determined for all three receptors. Distinct dynamic behaviours are observed for the binding site regions
(Figures S16-S18). Such differences are mostly located in loops C and F, two structural motifs
important for binding and selectivity.45,47,48 Loop F shows decreased flexibility in the α4β2 complex,
while loop C dynamics is more restricted in the muscle-like αβγδ receptor, compared to the other two
subtypes.
At the beginning of the simulations, in all the three complexes, loop C adopted an open conformation
due to the steric interference of the peptide. During the simulations, the αβγδ and α4β2 receptors mostly
maintained this open conformation. In the α7 complex, as the peptide moves deeper into the binding
pocket, loop C rotates inwards, adopting a semi-closed structure. Loop C capping is known to be
important for the anchoring of the ligands into the binding pocket45,47 and has been suggested to be
indirectly involved in gating.29,49 A possible relation between loop C position and ligand activation has
also been proposed,48 with agonists stabilising more compact loop conformations and antagonists
disfavouring proper loop closing. Our findings could indicate that the S-peptide may act as an antagonist
in the αβγδ and α4β2 receptors whereas in the α7 receptor it is unclear whether the peptide works as an
agonist or antagonist.
A molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) approach50,51 was employed to
estimate the free energy of binding of the S-peptide to the different receptors (Table S1). MM-PBSA
calculations have emerged as an efficient and useful method to determine binding free energies,50,51 and
are widely used to study protein-ligand interactions in medicinal chemistry,52-54 including in drug design
for nAChRs.55,56 The favourable calculated binding energies suggest stable complex formation between
the S-peptide and all three nAChRs (Table S1).
In silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed to identify important residues (referred to as ‘hotspots’) driving peptide−receptor association (Figures S19-S21). Hot-spots are residues with high
energetic contributions to the thermodynamic stability of a given complex.57 Alanine-scanning methods
provide a detailed energy map of a protein-binding interface.57 Here, we used the fast in silico method,
BudeAlaScan,57 in which every residue, for both receptor and peptide, is mutated to alanine, and hotspots are determined by the difference between the binding free energies of the mutant and wild-type
complexes (ΔΔGbind).57 Hot-spots were identified at the interface of the receptor, some of them common
to all three subtypes (Figure S22 and Tables S2-S3). In particular, TyrC1 (α4Y223, α7Y210, αY214)
and the negatively charged residues in the upper part of loop F (β2D195, α7D186, δD201, δE203)

strongly stabilise the complex. In the human α7 nAChR, the substitution of several key agonist-binding
residues within the aromatic box, namely TyrA (α7Y115), TyrC1 (α7Y210), TrpB (α7W171) and TrpD
(α7W77), by alanine is also predicted to destabilise the interface between the peptide and the receptor.
Concerning residues in the peptide, Y674, R682 and R685 are the major contributors to stabilizing the
interface (Figure S23). Overall, this analysis reinforces the critical role of R682 in binding to nAChRs.
In summary, the findings reported here support the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein can
interact with nAChRs. Our calculations indicate stable binding of the S protein to these receptors
through a region adjacent to the furin cleavage site and corresponding to the Y674-R685 loop. They
also show apparent subtype-specific interactions and dynamics for the Y674-R685 region. COVID-19
is known to cause a range of neurological,58,59 muscular,38 and respiratory60 symptoms, and these
predicted interactions may be relevant to understand the pathophysiology associated with this disease.
Our results indicate that the Y674-R685 region from the S protein has affinity for nAChRs in general.
The region in the S protein responsible for the binding to nAChRs harbours the PRRA motif and shares
high sequence similarity with neurotoxins known to be nAChRs antagonists. In particular, the
guanidinium group of R682 is the key anchoring point to the binding pocket, where it forms several
interactions with the residues that form the aromatic box. Analysis of the structure and dynamics of the
full-length glycosylated S protein shows that the Y674-R685 region protrudes outside the glycan shield,
and is flexible, showing that it is accessible to bind to nAChRs (and to other receptors such as
neuropilins25). Modelling the interaction between the full-length S protein and nAChRs indicates that
association is possible with the proteins in a non-parallel orientation to one another. It has been shown
experimentally that not all S proteins protrude straight from the viral surface and a tilt angle up to 60°
relative to the normal axis of the membrane is observed.61,62 This apparent flexibility of the S-protein
would facilitate binding to host nAChRs.
In the α4β2 and αβγδ complexes, the conformational dynamics of the bound Y674-R685 peptide are
compatible with the hypothesis of it acting as an antagonist: it forces the loop C to adopt an open
conformation and prevents the formation of key interactions within the binding pocket. Intriguingly, in
the α7 complexes, the peptide adopts binding modes that allow for the establishment of strong
interactions within the aromatic box, thus raising the question of whether, in this subtype, it promotes
gating. This is important because activation of 7 nAChR triggers anti-inflammatory signalling
mechanisms in inflammatory cells, leading to a decrease in cytokine production, which may have
relevance in understanding COVID-19 pathology. If nicotine does indeed prove to have any clinical
value, it is likely that it would be due to interfering with the association with nAChRs. If so, nicotine
analogues (e.g. smoking cessation agents) such as varenicline,63 cytisine64 and cytisine derivatives30
could also find useful application for COVID-19.

Given the promising results presented here, structural, mutational and single-channel studies will be of
interest to test the importance of the interactions of the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nAChRs, and
the potential relevance of these interactions to pathology and infectivity in COVID-19.
