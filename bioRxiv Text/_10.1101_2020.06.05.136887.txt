Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is one of three recognized coronaviruses (CoVs) that have caused epidemics or pandemics
in the 21st century and that have likely emerged from animal reservoirs based on genomic similarities to
bat and other animal viruses. Here we report the analysis of conserved interactions between amino acid
residues in proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-related viruses. We identified pairs and networks of residue
variants that exhibited statistically high frequencies of covariance with each other. While these
interactions are likely key to both protein structure and other protein-protein interactions, we have also
found that they can be used to provide a new computational approach (CoVariance-based Phylogeny
Analysis) for understanding viral evolution and adaptation. Our data provide evidence that the
evolutionary processes that converted a bat virus into human pathogen occurred through recombination
with other viruses in combination with new adaptive mutations important for entry into human cells.
Results and Discussion
The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as human pathogens is attributed to zoonotic
infections in bats that transferred to civets and camels, respectively, while SARS-CoV-2 is similar to
viruses isolated from both bats and pangolins implicating these species in the emergence of this historic
virus (Al-Omari et al., 2019; Corman et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017; Li, 2005; Wu et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
2020). The ~30kb genome size of all SARS-related CoVs render sequence alignment and pairwise
distance methods effective for phylogenic studies and predicting the likely source of such coronaviruses
(CoVs). While nucleic acid sequence-based phylogenies are informative they clearly have limitations.
Thus, we focused on variations in protein sequence to understand CoV evolution and the key functional
interactions that drive adaption to new hosts or that influence transmission and pathogenicity.
We selected the conserved CoV proteins called 1a/1b, Spike (S protein), 3a, E, M, and N from a
set of 850 viral genomes (Supplemental table S1). The alignment resulted in a 9639 amino acid consensus
sequence with only 2% of sites being gaps with low coverage and 2% with low sequence conservation

(Supplemental File F1). Because there are regions of diverged nucleotide identity in these viral genomes,
our goal was to use amino acid identity to initially estimate phylogeny and then integrate that analysis
with the identification of covariant residues within these six core viral proteins. Both SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 are represented by a large collection of independent isolates from previous and current
epidemics as well as from variants selected during passage in various laboratories (Supplemental Table
S1) (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017). Similar to nucleic acid sequence-based analyses, our constructed
phylogeny (Supplemental Figure S1) shows that SARS-CoV is closely related to CoVs found in civets
and groups of bat CoVs that were previously suggested as likely ancestors (Li, 2005; Song et al., 2005).
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 is related to bat CoV RATG13 and also more similar to two bat CoVs, SZXC21
and SZC45, than other bat CoVs and its relationship to these in nucleotide similarity varies between large
sections of the genome (Li, 2005; Paraskevis et al., 2020; Song et al., 2005). Five recently isolated
pangolin CoVs identified as closely related to SARS-CoV-2 are also related to these three bat CoVs
(Zhang et al., 2020) and our protein-based also analysis supports this observation. Thus, amino acid
sequence-based analysis supports the conclusion that both bat and pangolin CoVs share or represent
probable common ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 (Xia, 2020).
To survey the frequency of covariance among CoVs, we extracted pairs and groups (here
designated ‘Clusters’) of covarying amino acid residues and organized these using a correlating tandem
model that was set at different purity thresholds between 0.8 and 1.0. We selected a stringent purity
threshold (0.96) to reduce noise based on our sampling size (Supplemental Table S2). We then applied
force-directed mapping algorithms to visualize the relationships between these clusters of covarying
residues and the CoV isolates from which they were derived (Jacomy et al., 2014). This graphing
technique simulates repulsion between nodes (residues, clusters, and genomes) as well as attraction
between edges (links between nodes) and then plots them to minimize both the complexity (fewer crossed
edges) and to reduce edge lengths in two dimensions. Nodes are force-directed according to hierarchy and
this orients these based on sequential linkage (edges) to clusters and then residues. Remarkably, we find
that force-directed mapping of the linkage of covariance clusters readily organized all CoV isolates into
groups that were consistent with phylogenic analysis (Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure S1). Thus,
related genomes are forced into groupings in the middle of the graph surrounded by related clusters that
are then flanked by networks of covarying residues. Furthermore, we provide every cluster and all
residues identities by gene, genome, and host in a table and Gephi force map file (Supplemental Table S3
and Supplemental File S1) as well as an interactive website (https://sarscovresidues2.com/ ) We call this

collective approach to understanding viral evolution ‘CoVariance based Phylogeny Analysis (CoVPA)’ in
that it provides novel insights into the evolutionary origins of viral genomes.
Some covariant clusters are ubiquitous to the entire grouping while others are exclusive to only
one strain. We binned these clusters to compare covarying residues that are restricted to isolates from a
given host species or a given group of CoVs. By comparing networks of clusters of covarying residues
between distinct groupings, we could identify clusters that are restricted to various combinations of bat,
civet, pangolin, and human CoV isolates. Thus, this annotated comprehensive dataset identifies all distinct
residue identities that strongly covary in each CoV protein and the distribution of these in CoVs that
include the human pathogens SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In its entirety, this provides a novel dataset
that can be accessed through an interactive website (https://sarscovresidues2.com/) which allows one to
explore the relatedness of CoV isolates based on conserved amino acid interactions that contribute to
structure, protein-protein interactions, or biological function that multiple proteins drive interactively.
Both the civet and bat CoVs were previously identified as the closest relatives of SARS-CoV (Hu
et al., 2017; Song et al., 2005) and these are positioned immediately adjacent to SARS-CoV in CoVPA
mapping analysis. There are a few residues that are different between Civet CoVs (Cluster 26) and SARSCoV (Cluster 65), but 103 residues are uniquely shared by both (Cluster 182). This supports previous
findings that few genomic changes occurred between civet and the human-adapted SARS-CoV and that
the majority of these polymorphisms likely arose during the initial transition from bats to civets (Song et
al., 2005)). We conclude that these three clusters include residue identities that separate closely related bat
CoVs from those enriched by passage and adaptation through other host species. The majority of these
residues are in 1a/1b polyproteins, S, and 3a while covariance in E, M, and N is virtually absent.
Analogous to the civet and SARS-CoV relationship, three bat CoVs including RATG13 and five
pangolin CoVs are all closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and are thus positioned in proximity in the
CoVPA- network mapping approach because these share a significant number of covariant residues and
clusters. In total, 10 clusters contain 1231 uniquely covarying residues specific to SARS-CoV-2 and the
three most closely related bat CoVs. Covariant residues are highly represented in gene 1a encoding nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp4), as well as the S protein and viroporin 3a (Supplemental Table S5). We
surmise these enriched covariant residues include those that facilitated transmissibility into humans.
Covariant residues are least represented in the RNA replication proteins, viroporin E, and membrane
protein M. We did not find any cluster exclusive to all SARS-CoV-2 strains apart from those emerging in
clinical isolates (Clusters 5 & 23) and instead find common overlapping clusters of covariant residues.
For example, SARS-CoV-2 covariant residues are found to overlap with RATG13 (Cluster 183), or with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.136887; this version posted June 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

RATG13 and pangolin CoVs (Cluster 194), or with the three bat viruses RATG13/COVCZ45/COVXC21
(Cluster 190), or with these three bat CoVs with pangolin CoVs (Cluster 197). As these CoVs share
significant nucleotide similarity with another, this is not surprising; however, our covariance analysis also
reveals key diverging features for the SARS-CoV-2 group that likely have biological significance. For
example, there are covariant residues in the S protein that reside in its receptor binding domain (RBD), its
amino-terminal domain (NTD), and in a structural region proximal to the furin cleavage site in its Cterminal domain (CTD). These SARS-CoV-2 covariant residues are likely key to the adaptation of this
virus to new host species (see below).
We next focused on determining the covarying residues that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to emerge as a
human pathogen by passage through intermediate hosts. To demonstrate the results of this analysis, we
graphically show the stepwise progression and location of SARS-CoV-2 covariant clusters that overlap
with those found in 48 bat CoVs and its most related bat isolate, RATG13 (Figure 2A, 2B, Supplemental
Table S4). We plotted all covariant residue positions across multiple groups of CoV genomes to map their
locations at the gene product level. The largest density of covarying residues in this progression to SARSCoV-2 maps to both the NTD and RBD subdomains of S protein and the 3a viroporin protein. We
conclude that enriched covariance networks between S and 3a allowed certain CoV isolates to adapt to
growth in intermediary hosts and ultimately humans.
The role of covariant residues distinctly enriched in a specific host may be important in the
context of adaption and infection. To separate such ‘restricted’ variants that are unique to CoVs from
different species, we binned groups of covariants and then compared their mapped locations on CoV
genomes (Figure 2B). Those classified as ‘restricted’ are found in clusters linked to specific groups and
absent in other groups. Surprisingly both bat- and pangolin-restricted covariants are represented in distinct
regions of the genome; for example, bat restricted residues are primarily located in nonstructural proteins
encoded in 1b (2’O-Mtase, NendoU, ExoN) and enriched in 3a and N but not S or M. Clearly SARSCoV-2 covariant residues belong to clusters linked to bat CoVs, but we found residues that are linked to
this virus which are absent in other restricted categories (see below).
A large section in gene 1a (~3000 AA, nsP1-nsP4) is unique to SARS-CoV-2 and distinct from
the rest of the genome based on our covariance analysis. These contextual differences would not be
readily apparent using standard nucleic acid-based single nucleotide polymorphism analyses. The identity
and network of covariant residues in this region are unique based on matching mutations to those in bat
viruses including those most similar such as RATG13 suggesting that this genomic region in SARS-CoV2 experienced different selective pressures and evolutionary history (Figure 2A and 2B). The 3’-boundary

of this region is aligned to a recombinational hotspot (Tagliamonte et al., 2020) and this suggests that
hybridization of different CoV isolates likely led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Though this region
of SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to RATG13, the divergence of covariance residues between bat and
pangolin CoVs here provides strong evidence that parts of SARS-CoV-2 emerged from an independent
distinct source (Figure 2C).
In contrast to host-restricted covariant clusters, others are conserved covarying residues in other
CoVs. For example, the Enriched Conserved A group contains residues that align in at least more than
one independent category (Figure 2A and 2C); these enriched covariant groups include residues that are
part of large networks of covarying residues (for example, in the nsp1-nsp4 region). This particular group
was found to be also densely enriched in the NTD and RBD of the S protein, in much of 3a, and in both
the CTD and NTD domains in N. The networks of covariant residues in the S protein may provide
plasticity in protein domains important for receptor recognition and possibly escape from antibody
responses given that the same regions are rich in dominant neutralizing epitopes (He et al., 2005; Qiu et
al., 2005).
We examined the distribution and possible roles for the SARS-CoV-2 residues using the
consensus sequence and by mapping these to domains in the S protein using the structural information
present in the recently solved SARS-CoV-2 S trimer PDB file (Walls et al., 2020). In line with bat COVs,
covariant residues in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 are densely represented in both its NTD (residues 1330) and its RBD (residues 333-527) (Supplemental Table S5). This includes residues between 438 and
506 that are part of the RBD interface with the ACE-2 receptor and also those between 333 and 526 that
are thought to help stabilize the Beta-sheet and short connecting helices and loops that form the core of
the RBD (Lan et al., 2020). Between 438 and 510 we identify 7 of the 16 residues shown to interact
directly with ACE-2 (Lan et al., 2020) are covariant (Supplemental Figure S2). As covariance analysis
detects residues that change with others, nearly all (6 of 7) are residues that differ between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. When aligned to known SARS-CoV RBD contacts with 80R, a potent
neutralizing monoclonal antibody that has been co-crystalized with the S trimer (Hwang et al., 2006), we
found that 13 of 19 residues contacted by 80R are covariants that differ between both SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 (Lan et al., 2020). Notably, though much of S is highly conserved in structure and many
CoVs share ACE-2 as a common receptor, it has been suggested that residues in the RBD-ACE-2
interface between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are distinct enough to have arose by convergent
evolution (Lan et al., 2020). Our analysis suggests that covariant residues likely influenced the receptor
binding specificity of the S protein and perhaps also its ability to escape neutralizing antibodies.

To examine how the observed covariance compares to enriched mutations in the current
epidemic, we examined 13,611 clinical strains sequenced since the emergence of the human epidemic
from the GISAID database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017). We identified covariant residue pairs most
highly represented in clinical isolates and find these form small closed networks within and between
proteins (Supplemental Figure 3A, Supplemental Table S6). These networks include some of the most
abundant polymorphisms previously identified such 614 G/D in the S protein and 336 P/L in RdRp
protein (Pachetti et al., 2020). Several residues located in the same small exposed flexible loop domain
with 614 are predicted to be covariant in our 850 strains with residues in viroporin 3a as well as other
residues in the S protein located between its RBD and furin cleavage site (Supplemental Figure 3B). The
3a and E viroporins of SARS-CoV are thought to be a K + and Ca++ efflux channels and it is interesting
that furin is proteolytically activated by these cations (Izidoro et al., 2010; Molloy et al., 1992). Furin
cleavage of the S protein trimer is strongly implicated in its activation for membrane fusion events
(Coutard et al., 2020). In this regard, we find residue 614 maps near the furin cleavage site in the S
protein structure suggesting that 3a may be interacting with S during the process that leads to S cleavage
and activation of membrane fusion. 3a and S protein have been found to form a complex but the nature of
the interaction is still largely unknown at the structural level (Shen et al., 2005; Tan, 2005; Tan et al.,
2004). Curiously residues in this exposed loop with 614 G/D are found to also covary with residues in the
NTD of the S protein and in 3a suggesting there is an evolutionary relationship between 3a protein, S
domains proximal to the furin cleavage site, and its NTD.
Our observed covariance in the 3a viroporin was mapped to predicted functional domains of the S
protein (Supplemental S3B, S4A). The 3a protein of SARS-CoV is predicted to assemble as both a
homodimer and a tetramer that form a membrane channel (a viroporin) in the cell and possibly the viral
particle membrane (Ito et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2006). We noted covariance in distinct separate domains of
3a. There are covariant residues within a more variable NTD region (the first 30 residues of 3a) which is
predicted to be surface-exposed as well as in other predicted extracellular and cytoplasmic loops
(Supplemental Figure S4A). Antibodies to 3a and its N-terminal ectodomain from convalescent-phase
SARS-CoV patients are commonly found (Qiu et al., 2005; Zhong, 2006) and the covariant residues that
map here overlaps with a hypervariable region predicted to be more antigenic (Supplemental Figure S4B,
S4C, S4D). We also identified a cluster of covariable residues in the CTD between 168 and 189; there is
no role for this subdomain though it partially overlaps between residues 160 to 173 that contain putative
intracellular protein sorting and trafficking motifs (Huang et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2004). In addition to a
role in intracellular vesicle formation through interactions with Caveloin-1, the 3a viroporin of SARS-

CoV protein is known to cause activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, NF-kB activation, and
chemokine induction as well as efficient viral release from infected cells (Castaño-Rodriguez et al., 2018;
Chen et al., 2019; Freundt et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2006; Padhan et al., 2007). Thus identifying 3a as a
hotspot for covariance and mutational selection may have relevance to the severe inflammation seen in
COVID-19 disease and suggests that the 3a protein is a potential new target to consider for SARS-CoV-2
immunoprophylaxis.
The mutational history of genes are seldom random throughout evolution and display biases in
regard to purine or pyrimidine substitutions that may reflect selective pressures such as polymerase
fidelity, codon usage, and functionality of encoded gene products (Reviewed by Lyons and Lauring,
2017). We wondered whether these biases might provide further evidence of the selective pressures
experienced by covariant residues during the evolutionary histories of SARS CoV virus families. We
measured the frequency of transition (purine-purine, pyrimidine-pyrimidine) and transversion (purinepyrimidine) signal nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between SARS-CoV-2, RATG13, and one of the
closely related Pangolin genomes analyzed in this work, PanCoV-GX-PL4, and found similar to other
studies (Lam et al., 2020) a bias against transversions. We did not compare these with Guangdong
Pangolin CoVs GD/P1L and GDP2 from Lam et al, 2020 that possesses a RBD even more similar to
SARS-CoV-2 due to an incomplete sequence at the time of this work. The frequency of this bias (ratio of
transition to transversion mutations) between the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 was
approximately 2.0; in contrast, when comparing these two CoVs to PanCoV-GX-PL4 this bias was 7.5
(Figure 3). We interpret this result as evidence for the very recent evolutionary divergence between
SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 while PanCoV-GX-PL4 is clearly more evolutionarily distant relative to
RATG13 and SARS-CoV-2.
Though the rate of SNP accumulation across the 30Kb genomes appears at a gross level to be
linear, there are regions in genes where SNPs are densely represented relative to other regions. In the
RBD of the S protein, a recognized region enriched for covariant residues in this work, we find the
frequency of transversion SNPs exceeds that of transition SNPs (Figure 3b). This 8.3-fold change in the
ratio of transition to transversion, 7.5-fold to 0.90-fold, within the region encoding the RBD involves
many codons encoding covariant residues. For example, 12 of 16 residues that changed in this region are
in covariant residues in SARS-CoV-2 and many of these have accumulated 2 to 3 SNPs. Furthermore,
non-covariant residue 483, a codon entirely absent in SARS-CoV, is found to differ at all 3 codon
positions as transversion SNPs when SARS-CoV-2 is compared to RATG13 and PanCoV-GX-PL.

The differences in the RBD of the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 compared to RATG13, and
pangolin viruses such as PCoV_GX-P4L has been previously attributed to recombination events that
occurred between related ancestral viruses (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
However, we show here that the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 possess a pattern of conserved
covariant residues (Supplemental Figure S2), that were likely evolved in both these viruses under
selection pressures that cannot be easily attributed to recombination alone. The inherent diversity of
covariant residues identified in this analysis is demonstrated by the observation that only one covariant
residue (N487 of the S protein) is also conserved in identity between SARS-CoV and SAR-CoV-2
(Supplemental Figure S2). Of the 16 residues in SARS-CoV shown to interact with the human ACE-2
receptor (Lan et al., 2020), 7 are covariant residues and an additional 5 are adjacent to covariant positions.
These residues are predicted to covary with others in the RBD and residues primarily within S and 3a in
both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that the purifying selection imposed by these and
other covariant networks resulted in the enhanced selection of radical changes in the covariant residues in
the RBD of SARS CoV-2 that we observed. Thus, the observed co-variability of residues in the NTD and
RBD of S as well as within the 3a protein is more easily explained by selective processes that can drive
mutations in multiple sites within the same or different proteins rather than simple recombination events
that would produce dramatic but uncoordinated changes in the structure of proteins.
Though CoVPA presents covariance networks with numerous residues in SARS-CoV-2, there are
a few small clusters identified in this work that likely reveal host-adaptation of CoVs. For example,
Cluster 62 identifies 5 residues that emerged in SARS-CoV during its further passage and adaptation in
the mouse model. In the context of human CoV diseases, we also identified one covariance network of
eight residues in the S protein (Cluster 126) found only in SARS-CoV and SARS SARS-CoV-2 and the
most closely related civet, pangolin, and bat CoVs (Supplemental Figure S5A, S5B). Though some of
these residues are missing from the available models of the S trimers from both SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2, we find residues Q23, H66, and V213 are proximal to one another when comparing the tertiary
NTD structures of both (Supplemental Figure S5B, S5C). The relative position of two other covariant
residues L54 and M153 in the NTD is difficult to determine in that they reside within disordered and
exposed regions in the cryo-EM S trimer reconstructions of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. There are no
known interactions or roles for these protruding NTD regions of the S trimers. Because the NTD of the S
protein is especially enriched in covariant residues, we propose that host- or immune-driven selective
pressure has occurred within this subdomain. In combination, covariant residues in S protein appear to

have emerged independently and are enriched in viruses that caused two independent pandemics
suggesting they are particularly important to human infection.
Previously covariant network analysis applied to other RNA and DNA viruses demonstrates
observed covariance in viruses is often not an artifact of chance and likely influenced by imposed
pressure, structure, and selection, including those provided by therapeutics (Aurora et al., 2009; Donlin et
al., 2012; Sruthi and Prakash, 2019). Coevolving residues for large orthologous groups of proteins have
also been useful in predicting structure (de Juan et al., 2013) and protein-protein interactions (Kamisetty
et al., 2013) that could be targeted for drug interference. In the present study, we identified networks of
co-varying amino acid residues in proteins encoded by nearly 13,600 CoV isolates. Because these
interactions can be in theory critical to the CoV family of viruses based on their conservation in the
evolution and adaption of these viruses to humans, we propose that they could define novel antigen and
drug targets for CoV-related viruses. These targets are uniquely valuable because they are likely under
strong selective pressure at two or more amino acid sites in one or more proteins; this property will make
it less likely for a virus to mutant to escape immune responses or anti-viral drugs directed at protein sites
enriched in such covariant-related targets. Finally, our data also provide evidence and a novel perspective
not readily apparent in standard sequence alignment analysis for new adaptive recombination events and
mutations that likely drove the emergence of SARS-CoV-related viruses into the human host. These
insights could inform preparedness through therapeutic and vaccine development, as well as public health
policy.
Methods
Genome and protein sequences were downloaded from available NCBI and GISAID public
databases. All genomes and accession numbers are provided in Supplemental Table S1. Protein
sequences for genes in 1a,1b, S, 3a, E, M, and N were concatenated and aligned using CLC Bio
Workbench (v8) for the 850 genomes using a gap open cost of 2.0 and a gap extension cost of 1.0 in very
accurate mode and with MAFFT for the clinical SARS-CoV-2 strain using the default FFT-NS-2 setting
(CLC-Bio Workbench 8, Nakamura et al., 2018). 13,611 clinical strains available on May 10, 2020 with
significant contiguous coverage over the reference genes (>95%) were kept in the alignment. For
Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny, we applied a WAG protein substitution model to our alignment and
performed bootstrap analysis using 1000 replicates.
Pairwise and multiple residue covariance and scored were predicted using FastCov (Shen and Li,
2016). We set a purity score (0.96) for stringency cutoffs, but for clarity a raw table of predicted

covariants is provided as Supplemental Table S2. This allowed binning of clusters and respective strains
for Force Mapping in Gephi using the Multigravity ForceAtlas 2 setting and comparison of covariant
residues based on clusters and strains (Jacomy et al., 2014). All clusters, strains, and residues are
tabulated in Supplemental Table S3.
Clusters and residues were mapped in Gephi using the MultiGravity ForceAtlas 2 algorithm and
this file is provided (Supplemental File F1) (Jacomy et al., 2014). The JavaScript Sigma.js library was
used to export this as an interactive website.
Residues in S protein were mapped onto the PDB structure for the S trimer (6VXX.pdb and
6ACC.pdb) using PyMol (v.2.3.4) (PyMol, Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2020). Arpeggio was used to
calculate interacting residues in the PDB file (Jubb et al., 2017). Circular graphing of key collections of
residues was done using Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009). Epitope mapping in the 3a NTD 44 amino
acids was accomplished using BepiPred-2.0 (Jespersen et al., 2017)

Figure 1. CoVPA map of covariant amino acid pairs and clusters of residues present in 850
SARS CoV genomes. Shown is a Gephi force map of the results of genome-wide covariance analysis
which we have termed ‘CoVariance based Phylogeny Analysis (CoVPA)’. The data can be fully accessed
via an interactive website (https://sarscovresidues2.com/) where a user can click on a map feature and site
will then identify the protein residues, gene products, and viral genomes displaying the covariant residues
or cluster selected. Complete tabular data sets of covariance data are also provided in Supplemental
Table S3 and Supplemental File S1.

Figure 2. Plotting of predicted covariant residues in different CoVs by protein. (A) Mapped covariant
residues in 1a/1b polyproteins, S, 3a, E, M, and N proteins from the bat CoVs found in SARS-CoV-2 .
Conserved residues found in other groups are mapped as a reference. (B) Graph showing a progression
of Clusters and residue content more abundant in Bat CoVs to those more restricted to SARS-CoV-2 and
closely related bat and pangolin viruses. (C) Residues found to covary that are restricted to categories of
virus isolates. Notably, those restricted to SARS-CoV-2 are also shared with some Bat and Pangolin CoVs,
but these residues are also uniquely exclusive to SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Those with overlaps and that are
particularly well-conserved in between CoVs are shown as “Conserved A”; these covariant residues and
clusters may have particular importance to the human infectivity of these pandemic viruses.
Figure 3. Measurement of the frequency of transition and transversion SNPs between SARS-CoV-2,
RATG13, and PCoV-GX-P4L. (A) Plots separately showing the frequency of transitions and transversions
in SARS-CoV-2, RATG13, and PCoV-GX-P4L. (B) The alignment of both amino acid and nucleotide
identities RATG13 and PCoV-GX-P4L to SARS-CoV-2 within the RBD domain of S protein. Covariant
residues are colored red and conserved residues blue. Arrows indicate determined contacts between
ACE-2 and RBD residues of the S protein.

Supplemental Figures, Files, and Tables
Supplemental Figure S1. Phylogeny of the 850 CoVs. Maximum Likelihood Tree using the aligned amino
acids from 1a/1b, S, 3a, M, E, and N proteins from bat, pangolin, civet, and human CoVs.
Supplemental Figure S2. Alignment of covariants with the S receptor-binding domain. Aligned SAS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the S protein RBD showing sequence conservation (blue), covariant
residues in SARS-CoV-2 (red arrows), determined contacts between both ACE-2 and Ab R80 and SARSCoV S protein.
Supplemental Figure S3. Plotting of predicted covariant and interacting residues in clinical strains and
highlighted residues in the S protein. (A) 796 Covarying residue pairs detected in the a 13,611 clinical
isolates. Abundance is indicated by hue. High abundance indicates both residues vary in at least 4% in
these isolates, mid-abundance indicates one of these residue pairs is varied at least 4% in these isolates,
and low-abundance is that neither are found in more than 4% of isolates. Overlap pairs are those
covariant residues detected in both the 850 CoVs and the clinical strains. (B) Residues predicted to
physically interact within the S protein from the PDB (6VXX) are orange. Residue linkages with S 614 and
S and 3a proteins in the SAR-CoV-2 clusters are indicated in dark blue. The Location of residues
identified in this work as emerging in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are circled in black.
Supplemental Figure S4. Covariant residues in 3a domains and observed variance in the 3a
ectodomain. (A) Diagram showing the positions of extracellular, cytoplasmic, and transmembrane
domains (TMD) in 3a protein. Red arrows indicate covariant residues from 850 CoVs and blue and purple
arrows are those from clinical strains as shows in Supplemental S3. (B) Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV residues in the 3a N-terminal ectodomain and arrows from (A) showing covariance. Distinct
residues are colored blue. (C) The consensus sequence of 3a protein derived from the alignment of CoVs
in this work and substitutions observed each position. Variable residues are colored red. (D) BepiPred2.0 epitope prediction using residues in the 3a ectodomain.
Supplemental Figure S5. Covariants that emerged during SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. (A) Gephi Force
map inset showing Cluster 126 and highlighted genomes that possess the Cluster 126 residues. The ML
phylogenic tree showing the relative relationship of circled strains is included as a reference. (B)
Alignment of strains to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 showing the order and diversity of these 8
residues in S protein. (C) Structures of both SARS-CoV-2 (PDB 6VXX) and SARS-CoV-2 (6ACC) showing
highlighted residues belonging to both. Q23 is missing from the SARS-CoV-2 and the closest residue A27
was labeled to provide an approximate location.
