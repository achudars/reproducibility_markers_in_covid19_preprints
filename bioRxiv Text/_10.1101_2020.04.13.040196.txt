Abstract

33

Lower respiratory viral infections, such as influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome

34

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections, often cause severe viral pneumonia in aged individuals.

35

Here, we report that influenza viral pneumonia leads to chronic non-resolving lung pathology

36

and exaggerated accumulation of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in the respiratory

37

tract of aged hosts. TRM accumulation relies on elevated TGF-b present in aged tissues. Further,

38

we show that TRM isolated from aged lungs lack a subpopulation characterized by expression of

39

molecules involved in TCR signaling and effector function. Consequently, TRM cells from aged

40

lungs were insufficient to provide heterologous protective immunity. Strikingly, the depletion of

41

CD8+ TRM cells dampens persistent chronic lung inflammation and ameliorates tissue fibrosis in

42

aged, but not young, animals. Collectively, our data demonstrate that age-associated TRM cell

43

malfunction supports chronic lung inflammatory and fibrotic sequelae following viral pneumonia

44

in aged hosts.

Introduction

64

Aged individuals (65 and older) will comprise 20 percent of the population in developed

65

countries in the coming decades. It is well established that the peripheral CD8+ T cell

66

compartment that contributes to cellular immunity shrinks in number, diversity, and quality as

67

we age [1-3]. As a consequence, memory T cells are enriched and T Cell Receptor (TCR)

68

repertoires are narrowed during homeostasis [4]. Consequently, the magnitude and the quality of

69

primary effector CD8+ T cell response often is compromised in aged hosts following pathogen

70

challenge [5]. Likewise, the development of CD8+ memory T cell responses in the circulation

71

and/or in the lymphoid organs is often impaired during aging [6, 7]. This age-related CD8+ T cell

72

attrition in memory T cell differentiation and/or function has been linked to impaired host

73

responses to pathogens following primary infection or vaccination in aged hosts [8].

74
75

Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRM) with potent effector potential are mainly located in

76

peripheral tissue at portals of pathogen entry, whereas circulating central and effector memory T

77

cells survey lymphoid organs and/or peripheral tissues [9, 10]. It has been shown that CD8+ TRM

78

cells can provide nearly sterilizing protection if present in sufficient numbers [11]. Therefore,

79

great enthusiasm has recently centered on enhancing local CD8+ TRM responses as a promising

80

vaccination strategy to control mucosal infections including influenza virus infection [12]. Much

81

progress has been made recently regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating

82

TRM cell development and maintenance [13, 14]. However, relatively less is known regarding the

83

effects of aging in the development and/or function of TRM responses in the mucosal tissues

84

following primary infection. Of note, analysis of spatial and temporal maps of T cell

85

compartmentalization revealed that aged lungs harbor increased levels of CD8+ CD69+ TRM-like

86

cells compared to young lungs [1]. However, it is unclear whether this is caused by a gradual

87

build-up of memory T cells following frequent experiences of prior infections in the lungs, or

88

due to enhanced generation of CD8+ TRM cells following a single infection in the elderly.

89

Therefore, the development and function of CD8+ TRM cells in aged hosts following primary

90

infection remains to be examined.

91

Lower respiratory tract viral infections represent a major public health challenge and economic

92

burden worldwide. In a matter of months, emerging respiratory viral diseases can alter social

93

norms, stagnate economies, and overwhelm healthcare infrastructures across the globe, as

94

demonstrated by the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

95

pandemic. Among respiratory viral pathogens, influenza virus can infect 5–10% of the

96

population [15], resulting in up to 35.6 million illnesses and 56,000 deaths annually in the U.S.

97

alone since 2010 [16]. For reasons that are still not fully defined, many respiratory viruses

98

including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus cause disproportionately severe morbidity in the

99

elderly population [17, 18]. For instance, the vast majority of the mortality associated with both

100

influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections, occur in people 65 years and older. It has been shown

101

that influenza disease severity is elevated, prolonged, and linked with increased comorbidities

102

and death in the elderly population [19]. In addition to the acute mortality caused by respiratory

103

viral infections, evidence has suggested that survivors of primary viral pneumonia may display

104

persistent impairment of lung function due to lung fibrosis [20]. Furthermore, it is predicted that

105

a large proportion of elderly Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors will be prone to

106

persistent impairment of lung function and pulmonary fibrosis as was observed in survivors of

107

SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [21]. At this time, there are no

108

preventative means or therapeutic interventions available to mitigate and/or reverse lung fibrosis

109

development following viral pneumonia. Currently, the cellular and molecular mechanisms

110

regulating the development of chronic lung fibrotic sequelae following primary viral pneumonia

111

are still largely unknown. This major knowledge gap likely represents a future bottleneck for

112

development of successful therapeutics for patients with chronic lung fibrosis induced by SARS-

113

CoV-2 infection.

114

Here, we report that influenza infection in aged mice leads to non-resolving inflammation and

115

persistent chronic lung pathology. Transcriptional and flow cytometric analyses revealed that

116

lungs from aged mice exhibited enhanced accumulation of CD8+ CD69+ memory T cells.

117

Parabiosis experiments showed that those age-associated lung CD8+ CD69+ T cells were tissue

118

resident. Further, the excessive accumulation of lung CD8+ TRM cells depends on the aging-

119

associated increase in environmental TGF-b. Single cell (sc) RNA-seq analysis demonstrated

120

that TRM against a major influenza protective epitope exhibited diminished effector function in

121

response to TCR signaling. As a result, CD8+ TRM failed to provide protective immunity against

122

a secondary heterologous virus infection in aged mice. Strikingly, we further showed that the

123

depletion of CD8+ TRM cells resulted in decreased tissue inflammation and lowered lung collagen

124

deposition. Thus, we have discovered an age-associated paradox in CD8+ TRM cell responses.

125

CD8+ TRM cell accumulation in aged hosts was not coupled to enhanced protective immunity, but

126

rather, to chronic lung pathology and fibrotic sequelae following primary viral pneumonia.

Results

155

Non-resolving tissue inflammation and pathology following influenza virus infection in

156

aged hosts

157

To investigate the short and long-term effects of aging on influenza disease severity, young (2

158

month old) and aged (21-22 month old) C57BL/6 mice were infected with influenza A virus

159

(IAV; A/PR8/34 strain (PR8), Figure 1A). While 100% of young mice survived from intranasal

160

infection with PR8, ~50% of aged mice succumbed to the infection by day 12 (Figure 1B), which

161

are consistent with previous reports that aged mice exhibited enhanced host mortality following

162

primary influenza infection [22]. Aged mice that survived exhibited prolonged weight recovery,

163

although their weight completely recovered by 20 days post infection (d.p.i.) (Figure 1C).

164

Interestingly, these differences in acute morbidity and mortality were seen despite similar viral

165

replication at 9 d.p.i. and complete viral clearance in the respiratory tract in both groups by 15

166

d.p.i. (Figure 1D) similar to previous reports [23].

167
168

Recent clinical and experimental evidence suggests that severe acute influenza infection may

169

cause persistent lung pathology, remodeling, and pulmonary dysfunction [20, 24]. To determine

170

whether these acute differences in host morbidity result in differential tissue pathological

171

sequela, we examined the kinetics of histopathology in the lungs following acute PR8 infection

172

in young and aged hosts. While common features of pulmonary aging such as enlarged alveoli

173

were observed prior to infection (0 d.p.i.), leukocytic infiltrates were not prominent in either

174

aged or young naive lungs (Figure 1E). At peak of host inflammatory responses and weight-loss

175

(9 d.p.i.) and even several weeks later (30 d.p.i.), lung histopathology and tissue damage

176

appeared comparable between young and aged mice (Figure 1E & F). However, at 60 d.p.i.,

177

lungs from aged mice showed a higher density of parenchymal disruption compared to lungs

178

from young mice (Fig. 1E & F). These data suggest that acute influenza virus infection in aged

179

mice results in persistent non-resolving pathological pulmonary responses.

180
181

To confirm these lung histopathological data, we examined the presence of inflammatory

182

monocytes and neutrophils, two major inflammatory cells that can cause pulmonary

183

inflammation and tissue damage [22, 25]. To discern the anatomical location of the cell

184

infiltrates, we examined the vascular and parenchymal fractions of the lungs through the

185

injection of intravenous CD45 antibody (Ab) 5 min before sacrifice [26] (Figure 1G). In this

186

setting, CD45i.v.- cells were within lung tissue, while CD45i.v.+ cells were in lung blood vessels.

187

Neutrophil counts in the circulation exhibited a slight increase in aging relative to young as has

188

been reported at 9 d.p.i. (Figure 1H) [22]. Further, there were more tissue-resident neutrophils

189

and monocytes in the aged group at 9 d.p.i. (Figure 1H). By 60 d.p.i., the differences of

190

neutrophil and monocytes numbers in the circulation were lost compared to 9 d.p.i., yet evidence

191

of parenchymal neutrophil and monocytes persisted in aged lungs compared to young mice

192

(Figure 1H). Together, the data point to an infection-induced age-related non-resolving

193

inflammatory response following primary influenza virus infection.

194
195

We next measured the expression of 560 immune-related genes in the lungs before (0 d.p.i.) or at

196

60 d.p.i. using Nanostring. The immune gene profiles of the lungs from young or aged

197

uninfected mice were quite similar except a few genes-associated with “inflammaging” [27],

198

which were modestly increased in aged lungs (Figure 1I). Further, the expression profile of the

199

immune-related genes in the lungs from infected young mice (60 d.p.i.) was quite similar to

200

those of lungs from uninfected mice, suggesting that lungs from infected young mice largely

201

return to immune homeostasis at 60 d.p.i. However, the expression of most immune response-

202

related genes were upregulated in infected aged lungs relative to those of uninfected young or

203

aged lungs, or infected young lungs (Figure 1I). The mRNA signal ratios of infected versus non-

204

infected lungs in the young or aged groups identified 52 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

205

shared between young and aged groups; 12 were unique to young and 349 were unique to aged

206

samples (Figure 1I, top right panel). When comparing gene expression ratios of aged to young

207

lungs, before and after infection, there were only 16 unique age-related DEGs prior to infection,

208

whereas 32 were shared prior to and after infection between young and aged groups. In contrast,

209

348 unique DEGs were observed at day 60 post-infection in aged groups compared to infected

210

young lungs (Figure 1I, bottom right panel). Among those DEGs, influenza infection led to

211

greatly increased expression of myeloid cell-associated genes, cytokine and chemokine genes,

212

and genes involved in lymphocyte responses in aged lungs (Figure S1A-C). Together, these data

213

indicated that the immune landscape of aged and young lungs is grossly similar prior to

214

infection, but aged lungs exhibit greatly exacerbated inflammatory gene expression and failed to

215

return to immune homeostasis months after primary infection.

216
217

Excessive accumulation of CD69+ parenchymal memory CD8+ T cells in aged hosts

218

To gain more insight on the lung global transcription profiles of influenza-infected young or

219

aged mice, we performed bulk RNA-seq on lung tissues from infected young or aged mice at 60

220

d.p.i. There were around 700 genes differentially expressed between the lungs of young and aged

221

mice (Figure 2A). Among those 700 DEGs, aged lungs expressed higher levels of inflammatory

222

cytokines and molecules-associated with adaptive immune responses (Figure S1D). Gene set

223

enrichment analysis (GSEA) found that young lungs were enriched with gene sets associated

224

with tissue repair such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apical junction (Figure

225

S1E). In contrast, aged lungs were enriched with gene sets associated with inflammatory

226

responses and adaptive immune responses (Figure 2B & C and S1F).

227
228

We were intrigued with the enrichment of adaptive immune responses in the aged lungs as

229

previous reports described that influenza infected aged mice had decreased levels of memory T

230

cell responses in the circulation [28]. Therefore, we performed flow cytometric analysis to

231

measure splenic, lung circulating and parenchymal memory T cell responses following i.v.

232

injection of CD45 Ab as above at 60 d.p.i. (Figure S2A). There were increased CD4+, CD8+ T

233

and B cell presence in aged lung parenchyma but not within the lung vasculature (circulation)

234

(Figure 2D & E and Figure S2B & C). Lung CD8+ CD69+ CD103- or CD8+ CD69+ CD103+ TRM-

235

like cells were also increased in aged lungs compared to those of young lungs (Figure 2 D, F).

236

Consistent with previous reports, adaptive immune cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, were

237

decreased in the spleens of aged mice [29] (Figure 2G).

238
239

We next examined influenza-specific CD8+ memory T cells in the lungs and spleens of infected

240

young or aged mice through the staining of H2Db/nucleoprotein (NP) peptide 366-374 tetramer

241

(Db-NP) or polymerase (PA) peptide 224-233 (Db-PA) tetramers (Figure 2 H and Figure S2 D).

242

Aged lungs harbored significantly higher numbers of influenza-specific Db-NP and Db-PA

243

memory T cells, selectively in the lung tissue, compared to young lungs (Figure 2I). In contrast,

244

there was a drastic reduction of influenza-specific CD8+ memory T cells in aged spleens (Figure

245

2J). Thus, we observed an unexpected increase of memory T cells present in aged lungs, despite

246

the attrition of memory T cells in the spleen or circulation. Increased TRM responses in the lungs

247

could be due to increased infiltration of effector T cells in aged mice. We therefore examined

248

effector T cell responses in the lungs and spleens at 10 d.p.i. We found that while Db-PA

249

responses appear to be equivalent in the lungs between young and aged mice, there was a deficit

250

in the generation of Db-NP specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs (Figure 2K). Furthermore, there

251

were significantly lower levels of both Db-NP and Db-PA effector T cells in the spleens and

252

circulation (Figure 2K) of aged mice compared to controls as previously reported [33].

253

Therefore, aged mice exhibit enhanced CD8+ TRM numbers despite having lower levels of

254

effector T cell responses.

255
256

Influenza-specific lung memory CD8+ T cells of aged hosts are tissue resident

257

To verify whether the CD8+ CD69+ T cells in the lung that were protected from intravenous

258

labeling where bona fide tissue-resident cells, we infected aged mice with influenza and

259

performed parabiosis surgery to join the circulation of infected aged mice (CD45.2+) with a

260

young naive congenic (CD45.1+) animal at 5 weeks post infection (Figure 3A). Four weeks after

261

parabiosis, we observed equilibration of CD8+ T cells from each parabiont in the blood and

262

spleens (Figure 3B & C and S3A), confirming the successful exchange of circulating immune

263

cells between parabionts. A vast majority of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages belonged to

264

the host in both animals as would be expected from this population that is maintained mainly

265

through self-renewal [34] (Figure S3B). Together, these two observations indicate that shared

266

circulation was achieved and the model is able to distinguish the origin of circulating and

267

residential immune cells in a manner consistent with previously described findings.

268
269

The parenchymal compartment of the aged infected hosts had a significantly larger number of

270

CD8+ CD69+ T cells than the uninfected parabiont, of which ~95% were from the aged

271

parabiont, despite indistinguishable numbers of CD8+ T cells in both the lung vasculature and

272

spleens between the young and aged parabionts (Figure 3D & E). Roughly 99% of total

273

parenchymal CD8+ CD69+ Db-NP+ cells in the lungs of two parabionts were found in aged lungs

274

(Figure 3 F, G). In contrast, there were comparable CD45-i.v.+ CD8+Db-NP+ cells that were

275

found in the lung circulation between young and aged parabionts (Figure 3G). Likewise, we

276

observed similar patterns on the distribution of the Db-PA-specific CD8+ T cells in lung

277

parenchyma and circulation (Figure 3H & I & S3E). Notably, there were no major differences in

278

CD8+ splenic memory T cells between the two parabionts for the same antigen specificities

279

(Figure S3D & F). Together, these data suggest that aged lung parenchymal CD8+ influenza-

280

specific memory T cells are mainly tissue-resident.

281
282

Age-associated TRM cell accumulation is dependent on environmental TGF-b

283

It remains unclear if the excessive accumulation of TRM cells in aged lungs is due to the aged

284

environment or intrinsic T cell differences in the development and/or repertoire between young

285

and aged mice. To examine these possibilities, we adoptively transferred CD8+ Ovalbumin

286

(OVA)-TCR transgenic OT-I T cells of young naive donors to young or aged hosts. We then

287

infected the mice with recombinant influenza virus expressing cognate OVA peptide

288

(SIINFEKL) (PR8-OVA) [35] and evaluated memory T cell responses at 7 weeks after infection

289

(Figure 4A). There were increased numbers of OT-I TRM present in aged lung tissue versus

290

young (Figure 4B), while equivalent numbers of lung circulating or splenic memory OT-I cells

291

were observed between young and aged mice (Figure 4C & D). Together, these data indicated

292

that the aged microenvironment facilitates lung TRM cell accumulation following influenza virus

293

infection even though the responding cells were from the same young donor.

294
295

To explore the potential mechanisms regulating CD8+ TRM cell accumulation during aging, we

296

performed qRT-PCR analysis on infected lungs to examine the expression of Il15, Tnf and Tgfb1,

297

which are important in TRM cell development and/or maintenance [36-40]. We found that Tgfb1

298

transcript levels were elevated in infected aged lungs compared to those of infected young lungs

299

(Figure 4E). Previously, TGF-bR signaling was shown to be critical for the development of both

300

CD69+ CD103+ and CD69+ CD103- lung TRM cells [41]. Therefore, we examined whether the

301

excessive accumulation of CD8+ TRM cells in aged lungs is dependent on TGF-bR signaling. To

302

this end, we adoptively transferred young WT or TGFbRII-deficient (TGFbRII KO, dlLck-Cre

303

Tgfbr2fl/fl). OT-I cells into young or aged hosts, and then infected the mice with PR8-OVA.

304

TGFbRII deficiency not only diminished OT-I TRM development in young mice, but also

305

abolished the excessive accumulation of OT-I TRM in aged mice (Figure 4F). However, TGFbRII

306

deficiency did not significantly affect splenic memory T cell responses in young or aged mice

307

(Figure 4G). Thus, these data suggest that excessive accumulation of CD8+ TRM cells in aged

308

lungs is dependent on d TGF-bR signals in aged tissue environment.

309
310

Age-associated dysfunction of TRM cells against a major protective epitope

311

TRM cells are vital for heterologous influenza virus reinfection [43]. Since aged lungs

312

accumulated significant more CD8+ TRM cells, it is plausible that aged mice may exhibit

313

enhanced protective heterologous immunity against viral reinfection. To this end, we employed a

314

heterologous infection and challenge model in which we infected young or aged mice with PR8

315

virus and then re-challenge the mice with a lethal dose of X31 virus in the presence of FTY720,

316

which blocks the contribution of protective circulating memory T cells [12]. PR8 and X31

317

viruses differ in viral surface proteins, but share internal viral proteins such as NP, which are

318

cross-recognized by memory CD8+ T cells [44, 45]. We confirmed that FTY720 treatment

319

abolished T cell migration (Figure S4A). We then followed host morbidity and mortality daily

320

following X31 challenge. All naïve young or aged mice succumbed to lethal X31 infection

321

(Figure S4B), while PR8-infected young mice were fully protected from lethal X31 infection in

322

the presence of FTY720 (Figure 5A). Strikingly, ~75% of PR8-infected aged animals succumbed

323

to secondary X31 re-challenge, which was almost comparable to mortality of primary X31

324

infection in those mice (Figure 5A and S4B). Thus, the enhanced presence of CD8+ TRM cells in

325

aged lungs failed to provide heterologous protection against influenza reinfection.

326
327

Among influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, Db-NP-specific T cells appear to be particularly critical

328

for the protection against secondary heterologous viruses [46]. To examine the mechanisms

329

underlying the impaired protective function of TRM cells in aged lungs, we sorted polyclonal Db-

330

NP-specific TRM from infected young or aged lungs, and performed scRNAseq at 60 d.p.i.

331

(Figure S4C). Compared to Db-NP TRM cells from aged mice, Db-NP TRM from the young mice

332

were enriched in genesets associated with NF-kB signaling and inflammatory immune responses

333

(Figure 5B). Furthermore, Db-NP TRM from aged mice had decreased expression of effector

334

molecules such as Ifng and Tnf, and molecules involved with TCR signaling such as Lck and

335

Junb (Figure 5C). Additionally, Bhlhe40, a key transcription factor necessary for the expression

336

of effector molecules in TRM cells [13], was diminished in TRM from aged lungs (Figure 5C). We

337

performed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and found that Db-NP TRM

338

from young and aged mice can be divided into 4 clusters (Figure 5D and S4D). Cluster 0 cells

339

were mainly comprised of TRM cells from young mice, and clusters 2 and 3 cells consisted

340

mainly of TRM cells from aged mice, while cluster 1 cells were equally divided by TRM cells from

341

young and aged mice (Figure 5D & E). Compared to the rest of cluster cells, cells in cluster 0

342

express high levels of genes associated with classical TRM signature (such as Bhleh40, Cd69 and

343

Jun), molecules associated with better TCR signaling (such as Lck, Cd3e and Cd28) and genes

344

associated with CD8+ T cell effector function (such as Ccl4 and Tnf) (Figure 5F). Thus, age-

345

associated lung TRM cells lose a functional subpopulation that is characterized with robust

346

expression of CD8+ T cell effector and functional molecules, which likely explain the lack of

347

protection against secondary viral re-challenge.

348
349

To further test the capacity of TRM to elicit a protective response, we stimulated lung cells from

350

young or aged mice with NP 366-374 peptide and then measured IFN-g and TNF production by

351

CD8+ TRM cells through intracellular staining. Consistent with the scRNAseq data, Db-NP-

352

specific TRM cells from aged mice exhibited diminished production of IFN-g compared to young

353

mice, particularly on the IFN-g levels were evaluated on a per cell basis (Figure 5 G-I).

354

Moreover, CD8+ TRM cells from aged lungs were defective in simultaneously producing both

355

IFN-g and TNF following peptide re-stimulation (Figure 5J). Of note, splenic CD8+ memory T

356

cells were also impaired in producing both IFN-g and TNF following peptide re-stimulation

357

during aging (Figure S5A), suggesting that the impaired production of functional effector

358

molecules following peptide re-stimulation was not restricted to TRM cells. In contrast to their

359

diminished cytokine production following peptide stimulation (TCR signaling), total CD8+ or

360

Db-NP-specific TRM cells were capable of producing IFN-g and TNF following PMA/Ionomycin

361

restimulation (Figure S5B, C). These data suggest that Db-NP TRM cells exhibit impaired

362

production of effector molecules specifically following TCR stimulation. Interestingly, following

363

ex vivo stimulation of Db-PA specific TRM cells by PA 224-233 peptide, we found that Db-PA

364

TRM cells from aged and young hosts had similar ability to produce IFN-g and TNF (Figure

365

S5D). These data suggest that the impaired production of effector molecules by Db-NP-specific

366

TRM cells is likely not due to the aged environment, but their developmental defects as

367

demonstrated before [28]. Consistent with this idea, young OT-I cells transferred into the aged

368

hosts did not exhibit functional defects in cytokine production compared to OT-I cells transferred

369

into young mice (Figure S5 E & F).

372

Resident CD8+ T cells in aged hosts drive persistent pulmonary inflammation and lung

373

fibrosis

374

Excessive accumulation of TRM cells following PD-L1 blockade in influenza-infected mice leads

375

to persistent inflammatory and fibrotic responses in the lungs at the memory stage [41]. Since

376

aged lungs harbored enhanced TRM cells and persistent lung pathology, we hypothesized that

377

excessive accumulation of CD8+ TRM in aged lungs may cause persistent inflammation and

378

fibrotic sequela. To test this hypothesis, we infected aged mice with PR8 virus and then injected

379

the mice with high or low doses of CD8 depleting antibody (a-CD8) at 21 d.p.i. to deplete CD8+

380

T cells systemically in lymphoid and peripheral tissues (high dose) or only in lymphoid organs

381

and the circulation (low dose) [40, 47, 48] (Figure 6A). Both low dose and high dose CD8 Ab

382

treatment largely ablated splenic CD8+ T cells, however, only high dose CD8 Ab injection

383

caused significant ablation of CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma (Figure 6B and S6A).

384

Neither high nor low dose of CD8 Ab treatment caused significant reduction of CD4+ T or B cell

385

compartments in the lungs (Figure S6 B). Lung histopathological analysis revealed marked

386

reduction of inflammatory lesions following high dose, but not low dose of CD8 Ab treatment

387

particularly in aged mice following infection (Figure 6 C-E), indicating that lung resident CD8+

388

T cells drive chronic lung pathology at the memory phase. Consistent with the histology data,

389

high dose, but not low dose, of CD8 Ab treatment caused significant reduction of Ly6C+

390

monocyte and neutrophil infiltration in aged, but not young lung tissues (Figure 6F). Thus,

391

resident CD8+ T cells are responsible for the constant recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils

392

to the tissue at the memory phase. To further explore the roles of resident CD8 T cells in

393

promoting tissue inflammation at the memory stage, we measured immune-associated genes in

394

the lungs by Nanostring. There was a marked decrease in the expression of multiple cytokines

395

and particular chemokines in the lungs of mice that received high CD8 Ab treatment, compared

396

to those of lungs of mice received control Ab or low dose of CD8 Ab at 60 d.p.i. (Figure 6G &

397

6SC & D), likely explaining the diminished monocyte and neutrophil infiltration in the tissue

398

following resident CD8+ T cell depletion.

399
400

Acute influenza virus infection can cause persistent lung remodeling and collagen deposition

401

[24]. We therefore examined whether CD8+ T cell depletion at 3 weeks post infection could

402

affect lung fibrosis at the memory stage. CD8+ T cell depletion did not affect lung collagen

403

content in infected young mice revealed by both Mason’s trichrome staining and hydroxyproline

404

assay (Figure 6H and I), which measures total collagen protein [49]. These data suggest that

405

normal CD8+ TRM cell responses in young mice contribute minimally to lung fibrotic responses

406

following acute influenza virus infection, which is in contrast to the excessive CD8+ TRM cell-

407

induced fibrotic sequelae following PD-L1 blockade [41]. In contrast to young mice, aged mice

408

exhibited increased lung collagen deposition, particularly in the lung parenchyma (Figure 6H &

409

J). Strikingly, mice received high CD8 Ab treatment had markedly reduced lung fibrosis as

410

revealed by Trichome staining and hydroxyproline assay, compared to lungs of mice that

411

received control Ab or low dose of CD8 Ab (Figure 6J & K). These data suggest that resident but

412

not circulating CD8+ T cells are important in promoting chronic lung collagen deposition

413

following the resolution of primary influenza infection. In summary, our data indicate that

414

excessive accumulation of lung resident CD8+ T cells does not lead to enhanced protective

415

immunity in aged mice, but rather drive age-associated persistent lung inflammation and chronic

416

fibrosis following viral pneumonia.

433

Discussion

434

In this report, we demonstrate that acute influenza infection leads to persistent chronic

435

pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are largely propagated by an exaggerated CD8+ TRM

436

response in aged hosts. Somewhat counterintuitively, elevated CD8+ TRM cells in the aged lung,

437

fail to provide the protective heterologous immunity to that observed in young mice, likely due

438

to a selective dysfunction in a protective CD8+ TRM cell population (i.e. Db-NP CD8 T cells) [50,

439

51].

440
441

Previous reports suggest that both T cell-intrinsic and extrinsic environmental factors could

442

contribute to the suboptimal effector and memory CD8+ T cell responses during aging [8, 52,

443

53]. To our surprise, we observed enhanced TRM cell accumulation, despite diminished lung

444

effector T cell responses and lower levels of splenic memory T cells observed in aged hosts. Our

445

data further indicate that aged environment, likely through elevated tissue TGF-b, promotes TRM

446

cell generation and/or maintenance in a T cell-extrinsic fashion during aging. Of note, aging has

447

been linked to altered naïve T cell repetoires and enhanced representation of senescent virtual

448

memory T cells [54]. Whether these T cell intrinsic changes in aged hosts, in addition to

449

environmental factors, contribute to an enhanced TRM generation, requires further investigation.

450

Notably, despite a numeric increase in TRM cells, protective heterologous immunity is impaired

451

in aged hosts due to a qualitative defect in TRM cells not present in young mice. The protective

452

function of TRM cells is usually associated with their effector activities at the site of pathogen re-

453

entry [56]. For instance, it has been shown that IFN-g is important for TRM cell protective

454

immunity against secondary heterologous influenza virus infection [43]. Consistent with the

455

notion, scRNAseq analysis found that TRM cells against a major protective CD8+ T cell epitope

456

(Db-NP) from aged mice lose a functional TRM subset observed in young hosts; this subset was

457

characterized with robust expression of molecules associated with TCR signaling and effector

458

molecules. As a result, Db-NP specific TRM cells are less sensitive to TCR stimulation for the

459

simultaneous production of IFN-g and TNF. Thus, defective TCR-mediated effector cytokine

460

production could underlie the impaired protection against secondary influenza virus infection.

461

Notably, TRM cells can undergo in situ proliferation and generate secondary effector T cells [41,

462

57, 58]. Previously, it has been shown that memory T cells in aged mice are senescent in

463

proliferation during secondary expansion [8]. Therefore, it is also possible that impaired TRM

464

proliferation and secondary effector T cell expansion could together contribute to the impaired

465

TRM protective function.

466
467

Interestingly, impaired effector cytokine production by Db-NP TRM cells was not observed in Db-

468

PA or transferred young OT-I TRM cells, suggesting that this functional defect in Db-NP T cells is

469

likely not caused by the aged environment. It has been shown that Db-NP, but not Db-PA, CD8+

470

T cells have preferential age-associated loss in responsiveness, which is mainly due to the

471

narrowed TCR-b repertoire in Db-NP CD8+ T cells or their recruitment into a response [6, 28,

472

32]. Thus, intrinsic developmental defects are likely the cause of the functional decline in Db-NP

473

TRM cells [28]. Notably, our data highlight the importance of Db-NP TRM cells in protective

474

immunity as functional impairment specifically in Db-NP cells could translate into differences in

475

the secondary protective immunity. This notion is consistent with previous reports, which have

476

pinpointed robust expansion of Db-NP memory T cells over Db-PA memory T cells in the

477

secondary expansion to provide enhanced protective immunity following heterologous challenge

478

[46, 59].

479
480

CD8+ TRM cells exhibit higher levels of expression of multiple effector molecules compared to

481

central and effector memory T cells [13, 60]. The heightened expression of these molecules

482

confers CD8+ TRM cells with superb antiviral function, but may potentially cause bystander tissue

483

inflammation and injury [41]. In experimental models, both CD4+ and CD8+ TRM cells have been

484

implicated in causing tissue immunopathology ranging from persistent allergic inflammation to

485

inflammatory bowel disease [61, 62]. Previous reports have demonstrated that influenza

486

infection in young mice leads to chronic inflammation and collagen deposition [24]. Notably,

487

resident CD8+ T cell depletion only moderately affected pulmonary inflammation and lung

488

collagen deposition in young mice, even though exaggerated CD8+ TRM responses following PD-

489

1 blockade can lead to inflammatory and fibrotic sequelae [41]. These data suggest that

490

influenza-infected young lungs are able to tolerate “normal levels” of TRM cells, likely due to the

491

expression of various inhibitory molecules expressed by TRM cells [41]. During aging, however,

492

influenza virus infection leads to excessive accumulation of TRM cells, which exceeds the ability

493

of the aged tissue to “counterbalance” the pathogenic activities of TRM cells, driving enhanced

494

pulmonary inflammation and parenchymal fibrosis. The cellular and molecular mechanisms

495

underlying TRM-mediated lung pathology and fibrosis during aging are unclear currently.

496

However, aging is associated with the impaired capability of tissue repair [27]. It is possible that

497

epithelial injury caused by persistent low level release of cytopathic molecules by TRM cells

498

surpasses the limited recovery capability of the aged tissue. To this end, even though Db-NP TRM

499

cells have diminished TCR signaling for IFN-g and TNF production, their responses to PMA and

500

Ionomycin are intact. Therefore, they may remain capable of producing low levels of effector

501

molecules in response to environmental inflammatory factors that are constitutively observed in

502

aged tissues [22, 27]. Alternatively, it is possible that enhanced accumulation of those

503

“functionally-intact” TRM cells such as Db-PA TRM cells may be responsible for the persistent

504

tissue inflammation and fibrosis in aged hosts. Additionally, TRM cells in aged mice may have

505

different traits than TRM cells in young mice [63, 64], thereby causing increased lung

506

inflammation and tissue fibrosis.

507
508

Aging is associated with enhanced development of a number of chronic lung diseases including

509

chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis [65]. Interestingly,

510

aging is also associated with increased susceptibility of acute lung injury and severe disease

511

development following respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 [17,

512

66, 67]. Increasing evidence has suggested that acute viral infections may cause persistent lung

513

function impairments due to pulmonary fibrosis [20]. Indeed, lung fibrosis is well-documented in

514

a substantial number of patients who have recovered from the infection of SARS-CoV or MERS-

515

CoV [68, 69] and a group of influenza patients with severe acute diseases [20]. Emerging

516

evidence has also suggested that COVID-19 survivors will likely exhibit persistent impairment

517

of lung function and the development of pulmonary fibrosis [21, 70-74]. Data presented here

518

suggests for the first time that excessive TRM cells are likely the cause of chronic lung diseases

519

and pulmonary fibrosis following viral pneumonia in aged individuals. Of note, recent data on

520

scRNAseq analyses have suggested that pulmonary T cells from COVID-19 patients are enriched

521

with TRM signature and CD8+ T cell clonal expansion in the airways

522

(doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690). Thus, strategies aimed at decreasing

523

exuberant TRM responses and/or inhibiting the pathogenic potential of TRM cells may be

524

promising in treating chronic lung diseases following viral pneumonia in the elderly, including

525

COVID-19 survivors.

526
527

In summary, we have unveiled an age-associated paradox in CD8+ TRM cell responses. The

528

excessive accumulation of TRM cells is not protective but rather drives inflammatory and fibrotic

529

sequalae following primary respiratory viral infection. Moving forward, it is crucial to better

530

understand the mechanisms of age-associated TRM malfunction so that we can selectively restore

531

TRM protective function while minimizing their pathogenic potential in the elderly.

Materials & Methods

558

Mice, infections, and adoptive transfers.

559

C57BL/6 were originally purchased from Jackson (Harbor, ME) Laboratory and mostly bred in

560

house. Aged mice were received at 20-21 months of age from the National Institutes of Aging

561

and maintained in same specific-pathogen-free conditions for at least one month prior to

562

infection. In most of cases, aged and young subject bedding was cross-contaminated weekly to

563

control for different microbial environments. Young OT-I and dLck-Cre Tgfbr2fl/fl OT-I

564

lymphoid tissues (KO, CD45.1+) were shipped from Nu Zhang (University of TX Health Science

565

Center at San Antonio). All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment and used

566

under conditions fully reviewed and approved by the internal animal care and use committee

567

(IACUC) guidelines at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). For primary influenza virus infection,

568

influenza A/PR8/34 strain (~100 pfu/mouse) was diluted in FBS-free DMEM media (Corning)

569

on ice and inoculated in anesthetized mice through intranasal route as described before [76]. X-

570

31 strain was prepared identically and 2.8x105 pfu was administered per mouse for secondary

571

challenge. During the secondary challenge phase, experimental mice were treated with 1 µg/g

572

FTY720 daily starting one day prior to re-challenge.. For adoptive transfers, 1x104 OT-I from

573

lymph nodes of 8-10 weeks old females were transferred intravenously and mice were infected

574

as indicated 1 day later.

575
576

Cell depletions.

577

For depletion of CD8 T cells, starting at day 21 post-infection, mice were given 20 µg (Low

578

dose) or 500 µg of anti-CD8 Ab (53-6.7) or control rat IgG (500 µg) in 200 µL PBS through

579

once weekly intraperitoneal injections. Mice were sacrificed 3 days after the last treatment.

581

Parabiosis surgery

582

To examine tissue residency of lung CD69+ parenchymal CD8+ T cells, parabiotic surgery was

583

performed. CD45.1+ young naive mice were paired with infected aged CD45.2+ congenic mice at

584

35 d.p.i. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. After disinfection,

585

incisions were made in the shaved skin area then the olecranon of the knee joints of each mouse

586

was joined. Opposing incisions were closed with a continuous suture on the dorsal and ventral

587

sides. Parabionts were then allowed to rest for 4 weeks before sacrifice and examining the lung

Tissue Processing, cellular isolation, stimulations, and data analysis.

593

Animals were injected intravenously with 4 µg of CD45 or 2 µg CD90.2 antibody labeled with

594

various fluorochromes. 2 minutes post-injection, animals were euthanized with an overdose of

595

ketamine/xylazine and processed 3 minutes later. Following euthanasia, spleens were removed

596

and the right ventrical of the heart was gently perfused with PBS (10 mL). Lungs were instilled

597

with either 1 mL of 10% formalin for histology studies or 1 mL of digestion buffer (90%DMEM

598

10% PBS+Calcium with 180 U/mL Type 2 Collagenase (Worthington) and 15 µg/mL DNase

599

(Sigma) additives). Tissue was processed on a gentleMACS tissue disrupter (Miltenyi) for 40

600

minutes at 37ºC followed by hypotonic lysis of red blood cells in ammonium-chloride-potassium

601

buffer and filtering through 70 µm mesh. FC-gamma receptors were blocked with anti CD16/32

602

(2.4G2). Cells were washed twice in PBS and stained with near infrared Zombie viability dye per

603

manufacturers protocol (Biolegend). Cell surfaces were immuno-stained with the following

604

cocktails of fluorochrome-conjugated Abs (Biolegend). Immuno-staining was performed at 4 ̊C

605

for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 2% FBS, 0.09%

606

Sodium Azide), prior to fixation and ran on an Attune NxT autosampler (Life Technologies).

607

FCS files for myeloid stains were analyzed with FlowJo 10.2 (Tree Star). Antibody clones are as

608

following: Siglec-F (E50-2440), CD11c (N418), CD11b (M1/70), CD64 (X54-4/7.1), Ly6G

609

(1A8), I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2), Ly6C (HK1.4), CD8a (53-6.7), CD69 (H1.2F3), CD44 (IM7),

610

CD103 (2E7), PD-1 (29F.1A12). For functional assays, following digestion protocols above,

611

cells were resuspended at 3x106/mL in RPMI with 10% FCS and stimulated with indicated

612

amount of peptide or PMA and Ionomycin for 3 hours before adding monensin for the last 2

613

hours of culture.

614

Hydroxyproline assay

615

50 mg lung tissue was hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 6 M HCl at 95°C overnight. Hydroxyproline

616

standard solution was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydroxyproline concentration is

Quantification of Histopathology.

622

Hematoxylin and eosin stained formalin-fixed lung sections were scanned using an Aperio Image

623

Scanner (leica). Tiff files were converted to 16-bit black and white and two threshold

624

measurements were taken using Image J software (NIH). One measured the total parenchymal

625

area and the other the inflamed area of the tissue. The caveat of the method is that bronchiole

626

epithelium is thresholded in both measurements. To account for this, values from a group of age-

627

matched naive mice were subtracted from the above ratios to yield % of inflamed/infiltrated

628

parenchyma.

629
630

Quantitative RT-PCR

631

Total RNA was extracted from lung tissue from Trizol preparations. Random primers

632

(Invitrogen) and MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) were used to synthesize first-strand

633

cDNAs from equivalent amounts of RNA from each sample. These cDNA were subjected to

634

realtime-PCR with Fast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Realtime-PCR

635

was conducted on QuantStudio3 (AppliedBioscience). Data were generated with the comparative

636

threshold cycle (Delta CT) method by normalizing to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase

637

(HPRT) transcripts in each sample as reported previously [78].

638
639

Nanostring analysis

640

Total RNA was extracted from bulk lung samples in Trizol 0 or 60 d.p.i. 100 ng of RNA was

641

either pooled between group or used from individual samples as indicated. Library hybridization

642

was established by following the instructions of the manufacturer. Aliquots of Reporter CodeSet

643

and Capture ProbeSet were thawed at RT. Then, a master mix was created by adding 70 µl of

644

hybridization buffer to the tube containing the reporter codeset. Eight microliters of this master

645

mix was added to each of the tubes for different samples; 5 µl of the total RNA sample was

646

added into each tube. Then, 2 µl of the well-mixed Capture probeset was added to each tube and

647

placed in the preheated 65°C thermal cycler. All the sample mixes were incubated for 18 hours at

648

65°C for completion of hybridization. The samples were then loaded into the sample hole in the

cartridge and loaded into the NanoString nCounter SPRINT Profiler machine (NanoString).

650

When the corresponding Reporter Library File (RLF) running was finished, the raw data were

651

downloaded and analyzed with NanoString Software nSolver 3.0 (NanoString). mRNA counts

652

were processed to account for hybridization efficiency, background noise, and sample content,

653

and were normalized using the geometric mean of housekeeping genes. All data were normalized

654

by housekeeping genes. Heat maps were generated by an assortment of R language packages.

Sorted (CD8+CD44HiCD69+i.v.CD90-Db-NP tetramer PE/APC-double fluorochrome positive) T

658

cells from pooled lung cells of mice (10-18 mice) infected with influenza virus (60 d.p.i.) were

659

loaded on the Chromium Controller (10x Genomics). Single-cell libraries were prepared using the

660

Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent kit (10x Genomics) following manufacturer’s instruction.

661

Paired-end sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in rapid-run mode.

662

CellRanger software package (10x Genomics) were used to align and quantify sequencing data

663

from 10x Genomics. All scRNA-seq analyses were performed in R using the Seurat package

664

(version 3.0).

665
666

Total RNA-sequencing

667

RNA was extracted from bulk lung samples with trizol. After quality control, high quality

668

(Agilent Bioanalyzer RIN >7.0) total RNA was used to generate the RNA sequencing library.

669

cDNA synthesis, end-repair, A-base addition, and ligation of the Illumina indexed adapters were

670

performed according to the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The

671

concentration and size distribution of the completed libraries was determined using an Agilent

672

Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Santa Clara, CA) and Qubit fluorometry (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,

673

CA). Paired-end libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 following Illumina’s

674

standard protocol using the Illumina cBot and HiSeq 3000/4000 PE Cluster Kit. Base-calling was

675

performed using Illumina’s RTA software (version 2.5.2). Paired-end RNA-seq reads were

676

aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38/mm10) using RNA-seq spliced read mapper

677

Tophat2 (v2.1.1). Pre- and post-alignment quality controls, gene level raw read count and

678

normalized read count (i.e. FPKM) were performed using RSeQC package (v2.3.6) with NCBI

679

mouse RefSeq gene model. For functional analysis, GSEA was used to identify enriched gene

Statistical analysis. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± Standard of Deviation. Unpaired

684

two-tailed Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unequal variance) was used to determine statistical

685

significance with Prism software (Graphpad). Where appropriate, ANOVA corrected for

686

multiple comparisons was used (Graphpad). We considered p < 0.05 as significant in all

687

statistical tests and denoted within figures as a * for each order of magnitude p value.
