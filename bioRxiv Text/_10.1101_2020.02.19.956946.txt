Abstract
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the cellular
receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is causing the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the
2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike
glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the
structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid
transporter B0AT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length
human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9
Å in the presence of B0AT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5
Å, allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor.
Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the
extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues.
Pairwise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine the
different affinities between ACE2 and the RBDs from these two related viruses.

Introduction
For background introduction to ACE2 and B0AT1, please refer to our recent posting on
bioRxiv that reports the 2.9 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the full-length ACE2 in
complex with B0AT1, assembled as a dimer of heterodimers (1). The presence of B0AT1
appears to stabilize the overall conformation of the full-length human ACE2.

The surface spike glycoproteins (S proteins) of the coronaviruses are responsible for
attaching to host cells through interaction with the surface receptors. S protein exists as
a homotrimer, with more than 1200 amino acids in each monomer. In the S protein of
the SARS-CoV, a small domain containing residues 306-575 was identified to be the
receptor binding domain (RBD), in which residues 424-494 known as the receptor
binding motif (RBM) directly mediate the interaction with ACE2 (2).

ACE2 has also been suggested to be the receptor for the 2019-nCoV (3, 4). The
ectodomain of the 2019-nCoV S protein was reported to bind to the PD of ACE2 with
a Kd of ~ 15 nM, measured with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (5). Docking analysis
based on our structure of the ACE2-B0AT1 complex suggests that RBD can access to
the PD, which protrudes into the extracellular space, in the presence of B0AT1,
indicating compatibility of all three proteins for ternary complex formation (1).
Structural elucidation of the interface between S protein-RBD and ACE2-PD will not
only shed light on the mechanistic understanding of viral infection, but also facilitate
development of viral detection techniques and potential antiviral therapeutics. Highresolution cryo-EM structural determination of the dimer of the ACE2-B0AT1
heterodimers established the framework for structural resolution of the ternary complex
using single-particle cryo-EM.

Overall structure of the RBD-ACE2-B0AT1 complex
To reveal the recognition details between ACE2 and the 2019-nCoV, we purchased 0.2
mg recombinantly expressed and purified RBD-mFc of the 2019-nCoV (for simplicity,

we will refer it as RBD for short if not specified) from Sino Biological Inc., mixed it
with our purified ACE2-B0AT1 complex at a stoichiometric ratio of ~ 1.1 to 1, and
proceeded with cryo-grid preparation and imaging. Following the same protocol for
data processing as for the ACE2-B0AT1 complex, a 3D EM reconstruction of the ternary
complex was obtained. The structural findings about the dimeric full-length ACE2 and
its complex interaction with B0AT1, which were reported in detail in our bioRxiv
posting (1) , will not be repeated here. In this manuscript, we will focus on the interface
between ACE2 and RBD.

In contrast to the ACE2-B0AT1 complex, which has two conformations, “open” and
“closed”, only the closed state of ACE2 was observed in the dataset for the RBD-ACE2B0AT1 ternary complex. Out of 527,017 selected particles, the overall resolution of the
ternary complex was achieved at 2.9 Å. However, the resolution for the ACE2-B0AT1
complex is substantially higher than that for the RBDs, which are at the peripheral
region of the complex (Fig. 1A). To improve the local resolutions, focused refinement
was applied. Finally, the resolution of the RBDs reached 3.5 Å, supporting reliable
modelling and interface analysis (Figs. 1, 2; Supplementary Figures S1,S2, Table S1).

Interface between RBD and ACE2
As expected, each PD accommodates one RBD (Fig. 1B). The overall interface is
similar to that between the SARS-CoV and ACE2 (2, 6), mediated mainly through polar
interactions (Fig. 3A). An extended loop region of RBD spans above the arch-shaped
α1 helix of ACE2 like a bridge. The α2 helix and a loop that connects the β3 and β4
antiparallel strands, referred to as Loop 3-4, of the PD also make limited contributions
to the coordination of RBD.

The contact can be divided to three clusters. The two ends of the “bridge” attach to the
amino (N) and carboxyl (C) termini of the α1 helix as well as small areas on the α2
helix and Loop 3-4. The middle segment of α1 reinforces the interaction by engaging

two polar residues (Fig. 3A). For illustration simplicity, we will refer to the N and C
termini of the α1 helix as right and left. On the left, Gln498, Thr500, and Asn501 of the
RBD form a network of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) with Tyr41, Gln42, Lys353, and
Arg357 from ACE2 (Fig. 3B). In the middle of the “bridge”, Lys417 and Tyr453 of the
RBD interact with Asp30 and His34 of ACE2, respectively (Fig. 3C). On the right,
Gln474 of RBD is H-bonded to Gln24 of ACE2, while Phe486 of RBD interacts with
Met82 of ACE2 through van der Waals forces (Fig. 3D).

Interface comparison between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV with ACE2
The structure of the 2019-nCoV RBD (nCoV-RBD) is similar to the RBD of SARSCoV (SARS-RBD) with a root mean squared deviation of 0.68 Å over 139 pairs of Cα
atoms (Fig. 4A) (2). Despite the overall similarity, a number of sequence variations and
conformational deviations are found on their respective interface with ACE2 (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Figure S3). On the left end of the “bridge”, Arg426 Asn439, Tyr484
 Gln498, and Thr487  Asn501 are observed from SARS-RBD to nCoV-RBD (Fig.
4B). More variations are observed in the middle of the bridge. The most prominent
alteration is the substitution of Val404 in the SARS-RBD with Lys417 in the nCoVRBD. In addition, from SARS-RBD to nCoV-RBD, the following alternation of
interface residues, Tyr442  Leu455, Leu443  Phe456, Phe460  Tyr473, and
Asn479  Gln493, may also change the affinity with ACE2 (Fig. 4C). On the right end,
the corresponding locus for Leu472 in the SARS-RBD is occupied by Phe486 in the
nCoV-RBD (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
On the basis of our cryo-EM structural analysis of the ACE2-B0AT1 complex, we
hereby report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the ternary complex of RBD
from the 2019-nCoV associated with full-length human ACE2 in the presence of
B0AT1.

The 2019-nCoV has killed more people in the past two months than SARS-CoV
because of its high infectivity, whose underlying mechanism remains unclear. A furin
cleavage site unique to the S protein of the 2019-nCoV may contribute to its greater
infectivity than SARS-CoV (7, 8). The recently reported higher affinity between the
nCoV-RBD and ACE2 may represent an additional factor (5).

Structures of ACE2 in complex with nCoV-RBD and SARS-RBD establish the
molecular basis to dissect their different affinities. In this study, we carefully analyzed
the interface in both RBD-ACE2 complexes. Whereas some of the variations may
strengthen the interactions between nCoV-RBD and ACE2, others may reduce the
affinity compared to that between SARS-RBD and ACE2. For instance, the change
from Val404 to Lys317 may result in tighter association because of the salt bridge
formation between Lys317 and Asp30 of ACE2 (Figs. 3C, 4C). Change of Leu472 to
Phe486 may also make stronger van der Waals contact with Met82 (Fig. 4D).
However, replacement of Arg426 to Asn439 appears to weaken the interaction by
losing one important salt bridge with Asp329 on ACE2 (Fig. 4B).

Our structure provides the molecular basis for computational and mutational analysis
for the understanding of the affinity difference. It should be noted that additional
approaches, such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscal
thermophoresis (MST), should be applied to validate SPR-measured affinities.

Structural elucidation nCoV-RBD to ACE2 also set up the framework for the
development of novel viral detection methods and potential therapeutics against the
2019-nCoV. Structure-based rational design of binders with enhanced affinities to
either ACE2 or the S protein of the coronaviruses may facilitate development of
decoy ligands or neutralizing antibodies that block viral infection.
