SUMMARY

27

Recent studies have characterized the single-cell immune landscape of host immune

28

response of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), specifically focus on the severe

29

condition. However, the immune response in mild or even asymptomatic patients

30

remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptome

31

sequencing and T cell/B cell receptor sequencing on 3 healthy donors and 10

32

COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, moderate, and severe conditions. We found

33

asymptomatic patients displayed distinct innate immune responses, including

34

increased CD56briCD16- NK subset, which was nearly missing in severe condition

35

and enrichment of a new Th2-like cell type/state expressing a ciliated cell marker.

36

Unlike that in moderate condition, asymptomatic patients lacked clonal expansion of

37

effector CD8+ T cells but had a robust effector CD4+ T cell clonal expansion, coincide

38

with previously detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed

39

individuals. Moreover, NK and effector T cells in asymptomatic patients have

40

upregulated cytokine related genes, such as IFNG and XCL2. Our data suggest early

41

innate immune response and type I immunity may contribute to the asymptomatic

42

phenotype in COVID-19 disease, which could in turn deepen our understanding of

43

severe COVID-19 and guide early prediction and therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

49

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative

50

agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly caused a worldwide

51

pandemic with ever-increasing cases and COVID-19-related deaths (Organization,

52

2020). COVID-19 patients exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical manifestation, ranging

53

from mild or even asymptomatic infection to severe disease or death (Raoult et al.,

54

2020). Therefore, understanding the host immune response involved in the disease

55

course is of supreme importance to the development of effective therapies.

56

In severe COVID-19 patients, hyper-inflammation responses referred to as a

57

cytokine storm (Jose and Manuel, 2020; Mehta et al., 2020) and lymphopenia (Chen

58

et al., 2020a; Huang et al., 2020) have been considered risk factors associated with

59

the detrimental progression of COVID-19 patients. Elevated pro-inflammatory

60

cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils

61

and a sharp decrease in lymphocytes have also been reported in severe patients

62

(Chen et al., 2020a; Chen et al., 2020b; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Huang

63

et al., 2020; Jose and Manuel, 2020; Lucas et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Skarica

64

et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2020). Further, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)

65

studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or bronchoalveolar lavages

66

have reported the immunological profiles to SARS-CoV-2 in severe and moderate

67

patients (Lee et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Wilk et al., 2020;

68

Zhang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), suggesting moderate disease was associated

69

with more protective T cell-dependent response, with exacerbated systemic

70

inflammation and less effect T cells in severe disease. Longitudinal immune

71

responses of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients have been analyzed by flow

72

cytometry (Lucas et al., 2020), while unbiased longitudinal single-cell transcriptome

73

profiling is still missing. On the other hand, the contribution of asymptomatic

74

individuals to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 rise a significant public health concern

75

(Gandhi et al., 2020). Despite the clinical and immunological assessment of

76

asymptomatic individuals (Long et al., 2020), transcriptome profiles of asymptomatic

77

individuals is lacking, which might help us understand the nature of the asymptomatic

COVID-19 disease.
To elucidate characteristics that might lead to immunopathology or protective

80

immunity in asymptomatic, moderate, and severe COVID-19, we performed scRNA-

81

seq together with single-cell V(D)J sequencing to longitudinal analyses the

82

immunological profile of PBMCs from ten hospitalized COVID-19 patients and three

83

healthy donors, and to identify correlations between distinct immune phenotype and

disease severity.

RESULTS

87

Single-cell transcriptomes profiling of PBMCs from COVID-19 patients

88

In order to explore the immunological changes of patients with COVID-19, the

89

immune profiles of PBMCs from ten patients and three healthy donors (HD) were

90

analyzed by scRNA-seq with T cell and B cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing using

91

the 10x Chromium platform (Figure 1a). The demographics and clinical features of

92

these patients are shown in Table S1. The ten patients were classified into severe

93

(Ps, n=1), moderate (Pm, n=7), and asymptomatic (Pa, n=2), aged 17 to 62 years

94

old, and 6 of them were male. A total of 31 blood samples were collected from 10

95

patients, and 8 of 10 patients provided blood samples ≥ three times at different time

96

points during hospitalization (Figure 1a). For moderate and severe patients, the days

97

were recorded based on the time after their symptom onset. The days were recorded

98

for asymptomatic patients based on the time they confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive by

99

RT-PCR test.
After removing low-quality cells and doublets, we kept 73592 cells for

100
101

downstream analysis, including 62386 cells from ten patients and 11206 cells from

102

three healthy donors. On average, there were 2300 cells for each participant at each

103

time point (Figure 1b). We identified 15 major cell types after data integration and

104

unsupervised clustering (Figure 1c-e; Figure S1a, 1c), including innate T cells

105

(TRGV9+), effector T cells (GZMK+), naive CD8+ T cells (CCR7+SELL+), memory CD8

106

+

107

(IL7R+CCR7-), proliferative T/natural killer (NK) cells (MKI67+), NK cells (NKG7+),

T cells (GPR183+), naive CD4+ T cells (CCR7+ SELL+), activated CD4+ T cells

108

progenitor cells (CD34+GATA2+), B cells (CD79A+MS4A1+), plasma B cells

109

(CD38+MZB1 +), monocytes (CD14+ monocytes: LYZ +; CD16+ monocytes: FCGR3A+),

110

platelet (PPBP+), monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mono DC: CD1C+), and erythroid

111

cells (ALAS2+).

112

To quantify changes in major cell types, we investigated the relative proportions

113

of 15 cell types among PBMCs in different disease conditions and stages (Figure 2a-

114

c; Figure S1a-c). Unlike asymptomatic and moderate patients, severe patients had

115

significant changes across multiple cell types, especially for a significantly increased

116

proportion of NK cells (Figure 2a). Further analysis with unsupervised clustering on

117

relative proportions of the 15 major cell types from all samples revealed a marked

118

increase of NK cells, plasma B cells and platelets, and a decrease of CD4+ and CD8+

119

T cells in severe patients (Figure 2b). We summarised the samples from moderate

120

patients into 3 stages, based on the days after symptom onset (<10 days, 10-20

121

days, and >20 days), and this classification was used throughout the study. Further

122

statistical analyses showed that the proportions of T cell subsets were highly

123

heterogeneous among different stages in moderate and asymptomatic patients,

124

including activated CD4+ T cells and memory CD8+ T cells with consistently lower

125

abundance in severe and healthy conditions (Figure 2c; Figure S2a, 2b). In

126

contrast, the relative proportion of NK cells, plasma B cells, and platelets was

127

increased in severe patients (Figure 2c).

128
129

Immune profiles of T cells and NK cells in COVID-19 patients

130

To further characterize the T/NK subsets in detail, we extracted the data from T/NK

131

cells and repeated the data integration and clustering. With the refined clustering

132

analysis, we identified 14 cell subtypes (Figure 3a, b), including rare clusters absent

133

in previous clustering analysis (Figure 1c; Figure S3a). We identified four CD4+ T

134

cell subsets, including naive CD4+ T cells (TN, CCR7+), CD4+ central memory T cells

135

(TCM, GPR183+CCR7+), CD4+ effector memory T cells (TEM, CCR7-SELL-GZMA+),

136

and CD4+ effector cells (TE, GZMA+GZMB+). We identified three CD8+ T cell subsets,

137

including CD8+ TN cells (CCR7+), CD8+ TE cells (GZMA+GZMB+), and CD8+ TCM cells

138

(GPR183+). Additionally, we identified seven innate immune subsets, including

139

mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT, SLC4A10+TRAV1-2+), gamma-delta T

140

(γδT) cells (TRGV9+TRDV2+), immature NK cells (iNK: KIT+), CD56briCD16- NK cells,

141

CD56dimCD16+ NK cells, and a previously uncharacterized Th2-like lymphoid

142

population (CD4-CD8A-PTGDR2+). We also identified a proliferative T/NK population

143

(MKI67+).

144

To gain insights into features in T/NK cell subtypes, we assessed the abundance

145

of each cell type across disease conditions and stages (Figure 3c; Figure S4b).

146

Notably, the proportion of CD4+ TE significantly increased in asymptomatic patients

147

compared with severe patients, while the moderate and severe patients had

148

increased CD8+ TE (Figure 3c). We also observed an increased proportion of CD8+

149

Tcm in asymptomatic patients compared with other disease conditions and stages,

150

and all patients had a decreased proportion of CD4+ Tcm compared to healthy donors

151

(Figure 3c). Of interest, the abundance of CD56briCD16- NK was significantly higher

152

in asymptomatic patients than other conditions and was increased in moderate

153

patients over time (Figure 3c). In contrast, the CD56dimCD16+ NK, which was the

154

most abundant NK subset, was substantially enriched in severe patients. Like

155

CD56briCD16- NK, its precursor iNK also increased in asymptomatic patients. In

156

addition, we found that the Th2-like lymphoid had increased abundance in

157

asymptomatic patient samples and some early moderate patient samples (<10 days

158

post symptom onset). These results indicated that asymptomatic patients had distinct

159

innate immune cell distribution compared with other conditions.

160

Next, we sought to identify the specific signature of the NK and Th2-like innate

161

immune cells with distinct distribution in asymptomatic and severe conditions. We

162

found that CD56briCD16- NK cells have high expression of XCL1, XCL2, and IFNG

163

(Figure 3d), consistent with our knowledge that these cells are efficient cytokine

164

producers (Michel et al., 2016). The Th2-like lymphoid cells were

165

TCR-CD3-CD4-CD8- but expressed Th2 markers such as PTGDR2 and GATA3, they

166

were classified mainly as Th2-like cells by singleR (Figure S5a). In addition, Th2-like

167

cells expressed myeloid cell markers such as LMO4, which is also expressed in

168

eosinophils/basophils/mast cells (Herman et al., 2018), while these cell types were

169

not present in this dataset. We also found that TNFRSF19 uniquely expressed in the

170

Th2-like cells in this dataset (Figure S5b). Interestingly, although TNFRSF19 is

171

absent in most of the immune cells according to previous study (Kojima et al., 2000)

172

and the human lung cell atlas database (Travaglini et al., 2020). It is highly

173

expressed in epithelial cells such as ciliated cells, which also express ACE2 and are

174

considered as entry cells of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S5c). The Th2-like cells also

175

expressed NPDC1 and RGS1, which has been linked to human tissue-resident

176

memory T cells and gut T cell trafficking correspondingly (Gibbons et al., 2011;

177

Kumar et al., 2017).

178

To further investigate the difference of transcriptomes for each cell type of T and

179

NK cells across different conditions, we performed systematic differential gene

180

expression (DGE) analysis. We found distinct signatures expressed in severe and

181

asymptomatic patient samples in NK cells and effector T cells (Figure S6a-e). Genes

182

related to type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway was widely upregulated in

183

severe conditions (Figure S6b). We observed upregulated chemokine XCL2 and

184

CXCR4 and cytokine IFNG in CD56dimCD16+ NK and CD56briCD16- NK cells in

185

asymptomatic conditions (Figure 3e-3f; Figure S6a, 6c). Effector CD4+ and CD8+ T

186

cells in asymptomatic conditions were marked by the upregulation of distinct genes,

187

including immediate early genes (IER2 and IER5) and IFNG (Figure S6d-e). We

188

observed an upregulated expression of COL6A3 in CD4+ effector T cells and NK cells

189

of asymptomatic conditions. COL6A3 encodes type VI collagen, and the expression

190

of collagens in structure cells is expected to enhance their ability to interact with

191

hematopoietic cells(Krausgruber et al., 2020). However, the expression of collagens

192

in immune cells is less discussed, and we suspect they might also facilitate better

193

interaction with structure cells.

194
195

Clonal expansion in T cells and usage of V(D)J genes COVID-19 patients

196

To evaluate the clonal relationship among individual T cells and usage of V(D)J

197

genes across different conditions, we also analyzed single-cell TCR sequencing data

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.276865; this version posted September 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this

198

and reconstructed high-quality TCR sequence in 70.5% of the T cells with various

199

degrees of clonal expansion among T cell subsets (Figure 4a; Figure S7a-d). The

200

clonal expansion was evident in patients compared with healthy donors, whereas

201

moderate patients presented higher clonal expansion than those of the asymptomatic

202

and severe conditions (Figure 4b-d). In addition, clonal expansion was enriched in

203

CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cell in moderate patients, whereas CD4+ effector T cells in

204

asymptomatic patients have more clonal expansion (Figure 4c), which was

205

consistent with the distribution of T cell subsets that asymptomatic patients have

206

more CD4+ effector T cells instead of CD8+ effector T cells. Of note, samples from

207

moderate conditions had high clonal expansion and low diversity at the early stage

208

and decreased over time, indicating a recovery of the disease (Figure 4d).

209

Meanwhile, large clonal expansions (clonal size >200) were absent in the severe

210

condition (Figure 4b), indicating that severe patients might lack efficient clonal

211

expansion of effector T cells during early-stage infection of SARS-CoV-2.

212

We compared the usage of V(D)J genes across disease conditions and disease

213

stages of moderate patients (Figure 4d-e; Figure S7e-f). We observed a different

214

usage of V(D)J genes with decreased diversity in severe patients, which was more

215

pronounced in TRA genes (Figure 4e). We also found that over-representation of

216

TRAJ40 and TRBJ2-7 in severe patients compared to moderate and asymptomatic

217

patients (Figure 4e; Figure S7e-f). The preferred TRBJ gene in severe patients was

218

TRBJ40, whereas TRBJ2-1 was preferred in moderate and asymptomatic patients

219

(Figure 4e). The selective usage of V(D)J genes indicated that different

220

immunodominant epitopes may drive the molecular composition of T cell responses

221

and may be associated with SARS-CoV- 2-specific infection.

222
223

Features of B cells and expansion and specific rearrangements of V(D)J genes

224

We extracted single-cell B cells sequencing data and repeated the data integration

225

and clustering analysis. We identified three B cell subsets according to the

226

expression of canonical B cell markers, including naïve B cells (MS4A1+IGHD+),

227

memory B cells (CD27+), and plasma B cells (MZB1+CD38+) (Figure 5a, b). Severe

228

patients and early-stage samples (<10 days after symptom onset) from moderate

229

patients had a higher proportion of plasma B, and a declining trend of the plasma B

230

proportion was observed over time for the samples of moderate patients (Figure 5c).

231

Next, we analyzed the single-cell BCR sequencing data and reconstructed high-

232

quality BCR sequences in more than 80% of the B cells. We found an apparent BCR

233

clonal expansion in severe patients compared to asymptomatic, moderate, and

234

healthy donors (Figure 5d), indicating robust activation of B cell activity and humoral

235

immune responses in severe patients. There was less clonal expansion in moderate

236

patients, and the clonal expansion decreased over time (Figure 5d), suggesting

237

humoral immune responses reduced at the convalescent stage. We also evaluated

238

the distribution of IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgA at different disease conditions and stages

239

(Figure 5e). Overall, all patients had higher IgG and lower IgM compared to healthy

240

donors, especially for asymptomatic patients, who also had significantly higher IgG

241

and low IgM (Figure 5e). The IgG and IgM were highly variable at the early moderate

242

patient sample and returned to similar levels of healthy donors at the late stage (>20

243

days post symptom onset).

244

Next, we assessed V(D)J rearrangements of the BCR and analyzed the usage of

245

V(D)J genes across different disease conditions and stages (Figure S8a). We found

246

more specific V(D)J usage in the severe condition than the other three conditions,

247

indicating that B cells might have undergone unique and specific V(D)J

248

rearrangements. We also identified comprehensive usage of IGHJ4 and IGLJ3 in all

249

patients, but the paired IGHV genes of IGHJ4 and IGLJ3 were different in severe

250

patients (IGHV3−33 and IGLV1−51, respectively) compared with asymptomatic and

251

moderate conditions (IGHV3−23 and IGLV1−44, respectively) (Figure S8a).

252

Moreover, the top two paired V-J frequencies in severe patients were

253

IGLV1−51/IGKJ3 and IGHV3−33/IGHJ4, whereas IGHV3−23/IGHJ4 and

254

IGLV1−44/IGLJ3 for asymptomatic patients, and IGLV1−44/IGLJ3 and

255

IGLV2−14/IGLJ2 for moderate patients (Figure S8a).

256
257

To further investigate transcriptomic changes in B cells after SARS-CoV-2
infection, we performed a DGE analysis comparing different conditions in each B cell

258

subsets (Figure 5f). We found increased expression of CD69 and TSC22D3 in

259

disease compared to healthy controls. Like T/NK cells, we found an increased

260

expression of marker genes, including IFITM1, ISG15, XAF1, and IFI44L, involving

261

the IFN-I signaling pathway in the severe and early stage of moderate patients

262

(expression decreased over time) (Figure 5g). However, severe patients have much

263

higher expression of these genes (Figure 5g), indicating more robust activation of

264

IFN-I signaling pathway response and a pro-inflammatory state. Notably, we also

265

found increased expression of STAT1 in severe patients (Figure 5g), which was

266

consistent with a previous study (Zhu et al., 2020).

267
268

DISCUSSION

269

In this study, we performed longitudinal scRNA-seq and V(D)J-sequencing on

270

PBMCs from COVID-19 patients in different conditions from asymptomatic to severe.

271

A part of the result generated in this study was consistent with recent studies. First,

272

we confirmed that early-stage severe patients had increased type I interferon (IFN-I)

273

response in most of the immune cells compared to other conditions, which might

274

contribute to a hyper-inflammatory response. The longitudinal analysis revealed that

275

the early-stage moderate patients also showed increased IFN-I response but less

276

than severe condition, and the response declined with time. While we only have

277

samples from the early stage in a severe patient and cannot assess the change in

278

late stage, another study has shown that the cytokines related to IFN-I, such as IFN-

279

a, did not decrease in severe condition over time (Lucas et al., 2020). Second, we

280

found different proportions of immune subsets in different conditions that consistent

281

with recent studies (Lee et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2020; Wilk et al.,

282

2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), including the increased plasma B cells

283

and decreased T subsets in severe conditions. Higher proportions of T subsets were

284

marked in moderate condition, and TCR analysis showed increased clonal expansion

285

of T cells compared to other conditions (Zhang et al., 2020). The BCR analysis

286

revealed increased clonality of B cells in severe conditions, with decreased IgM and

287

increased IgG proportions in all disease conditions compared to healthy controls,

288

which came back to normal levels in late-stage moderate patients. We did not

289

observe a significant increase of monocytes in severe conditions (Schulte-

290

Schrepping et al., 2020), which might due to the sampling time that only early-stage

291

severe samples were included in this study. Collectively, the severe condition was

292

marked by a hyper-inflammatory immune response, including upregulated IFN-I

293

response, impaired T cell clonal expansions, and increased plasma B cells and BCR

294

clonality. In contrast, the moderate patients have activated, but relatively lower

295

expression of IFN-I related genes and robust T cell clonal expansions at early-stage

296

with decreased immune response at later-stage, indicating convalescence.

297

Although different immune responses between moderate and severe conditions

298

have been the focus of many recent studies (Lee et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020; Wilk

299

et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), the mechanisms under

300

asymptomatic phenotype of COVID-19 are less studied and have become the

301

elephant in the room. In this study, we performed comprehensive comparisons

302

between asymptomatic and other conditions, and found that asymptomatic condition

303

is not just an intermediate state between healthy and moderate but has its unique

304

immunological features. PBMCs in asymptomatic patients had lower IFN-I related

305

gene expression than in severe and early-stage moderate conditions. Asymptomatic

306

patients did not show strong clonal expansion of BCR and TCR, but they had a

307

robust effector CD4+ T cells clonal expansion and less effector CD8+ T cells

308

expansions, while the former was lacking in the severe patient. Moreover, the CD4+

309

effector T cells in asymptomatic patients had upregulated IFNG compared to other

310

conditions, which together with the increased CD4+ T cells suggested an activated

311

type 1 immunity. CD4+ effector T cells play an essential role in regulating the antiviral

312

inflammatory response and mediating viral clearance through direct cytotoxic effects

313

on virus-infected cells (Swain et al., 2012), it could also recognize SARS-CoV-2 by

314

cross-reactive epitopes in unexposed individuals (Grifoni et al., 2020). We

315

hypothesize that the increased activity of effector CD4+ T cells in asymptomatic

316

patients may originated from pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and promote

317

early rapid control of the disease.

318

Despite the difference in adaptive immune response, there were profound

319

differences in innate immune responses between asymptomatic condition and others.

320

Asymptomatic patients had significantly increased fractions of CD56briCD16- NK cells

321

and their precursor (iNK), while the severe patient had increased CD56dimCD16+ NK

322

subsets. Moderate patients had fewer CD56briCD16- NK cells at the early stage, and

323

the fraction was increased at the later stage. We found CD56briCD16- NK subsets

324

had upregulated cytokine-related genes such as XCL1, XCL2, and IFNG, consistent

325

with current knowledge that these regulatory cells act as potent cytokine and

326

chemokine producers. CD56dimCD16+ NK cells are considered to be differentiated

327

from CD56briCD16- NK cells and have more cytotoxic potential (Abel et al., 2018). In

328

addition to the difference in abundance, there were significant differences in gene

329

expressions between severe and asymptomatic conditions, with cytokine related

330

genes such as IFNG and XCL2 upregulated in asymptomatic conditions.

331

CD56briCD16- NK cells have been linked to virus infection. Infection of influenza A

332

Virus induced NK cell hyperresponsiveness and cytokine production, particularly in

333

the CD56briCD16- NK subset (Scharenberg et al., 2019). An asymptomatic

334

hemophiliac patient coinfected with HIV/HCV also had increased CD56briCD16- NK

335

cells (Fregni et al., 2013). These results suggested that the CD56briCD16- regulatory

336

NK cells may play a critical role in the protection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

337

asymptomatic patients.

338

On top of the NK cells, we also identified a previously uncharacterized Th2-like

339

innate immune cell subset enriched in asymptomatic patients. Interestingly, the Th2-

340

like cells uniquely expressed gene TNFRSF19, which is rarely expressed in immune

341

cells (Kojima et al., 2000). However, it is highly expressed in epithelial cells, which

342

also express ACE2 and was considered as entry cells of SARS-CoV-2 infection

343

(Sungnak et al., 2020). These cells also expressed genes related to tissue-homing

344

and immune cell migration. Although the role of these Th2-like lymphoid cells in

345

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear, we speculate that these cells might

346

interact with infected epithelial cells.

347

There are several limitations to this study. Our sample size is relatively small,

348

with only one severe and two asymptomatic patients. In addition, only early-stage

349

blood samples were available from the severe patient. Therefore, future studies with

350

longitudinal samples from more COVID-19 patients, especially for asymptomatic

351

patients, are needed to further identify the relationships between immune

352

characteristic and asymptomatic infection. Second, only blood samples from patients

353

were used for immunological analyses, but not bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples

354

because of the difficulty of obtaining these samples due to biosafety reasons.

355

Overall, our analyses provide the first comprehensive characterization of the

356

immune landscape of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and highlight the importance

357

of innate immune response towards disease progression. The reduced abundance of

358

CD56briCD16- NK subset in the early-stage severe patient suggested avenues for

359

both diagnostic and clinical intervention at the early stages of the disease,

360

considering drugs such as Natalizumab could induce the expansion of CD56briCD16-

361

NK cells (Skarica et al., 2011).

385

Ethics statement

386

The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Institutional

387

Review Board of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences approved the study

388

protocol (IRB number: AF/SC-08/02.46). All patients or their surrogates provided

389

written informed consent.

390
391

Patients

392

Ten patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled from the Fifth

393

Hospital of Shijiazhuang from March to April 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected

394

in the patient’s nasopharyngeal swab or sputum specimens by real-time reverse-

395

transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit (Cat

396

No. DA0930-DA0932, DAAN GENE Ltd., Guangzhou, China). Peripheral blood was

397

collected from all patients during hospitalization, and blood draws from patients

398

occurred in concert with usual care and patient’s willingness to avoid frequent blood

399

sampling and unnecessary personal protective equipment usage. The patients’

400

demographic, clinical features, laboratory findings, and chest radiographs were

401

collected from their electronic medical records.

402

The disease severity was defined as asymptomatic, moderate, and severe,

403

according to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 issued by the

404

Chinese National Health Committee (Trail Version 7). Asymptomatic infection was

405

defined as an individual who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR but without any

406

associated clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 days and during hospitalization.

407

Moderate was defined according to the following criteria: (i) fever and respiratory

408

symptoms; (ii) radiological signs of pneumonia. Severe was defined if satisfying at

409

least one of the following items: (i) breathing rate ≥30/min; (ii) pulse oximeter oxygen

410

saturation (SpO2) ≤93% at rest; (iii) ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen

411

(PaO2) to a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤300 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa).

412
413

Isolation of PMBCs

414

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood using

415

density gradient centrifugation with Lymphoprep in SepMate tubes (Stemcell

416

Technologies) in a biosafety level 2+ facility according to the manufactory’s

417

instruction. Briefly, the blood was centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 10 min. PBMCs were

418

harvested and washed twice with PBS at 400 × g for 10 min. Isolated PBMCs were

419

frozen in cell recovery Media containing 10% DMSO (GIBCO), supplemented with

420

90% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and stored liquid nitrogen before assays

421

analyses.

423

The droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing

424

Single-cell suspensions at a density of 1000 cells/μl in PBS plus 0.04% bovine serum

425

albumin (BSA) were prepared for scRNA-seq using the Chromium Single Cell 5’

426

Reagent version 2 kit and Chromium Controller (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA),

427

aiming for an estimated 4,000 cells per library following the manufacturer’s

428

instructions. Briefly, 9,000 cells per reaction were loaded for gel bead-in-emulsion

429

(GEM) generation and barcoding. GEM-RT, post-GEM-RT cleanup, and cDNA

430

amplification were performed to isolate and amplify cDNA for library construction.

431

Libraries were constructed using the Chromium Single Cell 5’ Reagent kit

432

(10×Genomics) and Gel Bead Kit, Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cell

433

(1000005) and a Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human B Cell (1000016)

434

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Library quality and concentration were

435

assessed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were sequenced on

436

an Illumina PE150.

438

Single-cell RNA-seq data processing

439

Reads from each sample were processed with Cell Ranger (3.0.1) separately.

440

Human reference genome GRCh38 and genome of SARS-CoV-2 were merged with

441

corresponding GTF files used to annotate genes. The filtered matrices were then

442

delivered into R (3.6.2) for downstream analysis. In order to demultiplex samples

443

pooled into one sequencing run, we applied Souporcell (2.0) (Heaton et al., 2020) to

444

separate them by individuals. Next, we used the shared_samples.py script in

445

Souporcell to identify individuals. The script uses vcf files to compare shared

446

variations when there were overlapped patients between the two runs and identifies

447

the shared patient.

448

Quality control was performed using R's scater (1.14.6) (McCarthy et al., 2017)

449

to remove cells with: (1) more than three median absolute deviations (MADs) of the

450

log10 read counts below the median; (2) more than 3 MADs of the log10 genes

451

detected below the median; and (3) more than 3 MADs of the genes coming from

452

mitochondria above the median. Size factors were then considered for calculating

453

average counts per features, and features with average counts above 0 were kept.

454

COVID-19 genes were removed in this step as they are not detected in the data.

455

Afterward, we used Seurat (3.2.0) (Satija et al., 2015) for data normalization and to

456

identify highly variable genes.

457
458

Data integration and clustering

459

RunFastMNN (Haghverdi et al., 2018) wrapped in Seurat was performed using the

460

top 2000 highly variable genes to integrate data sets from each sample. The first 30

461

MNN dimension reductions were applied to construct a SNN graph and FindClusters

462

with Louvain algorithms using standard Seurat pipeline. UMAP was also generated

463

with the first 30 MNN dimension reductions to embed the data sets into two

464

dimensions for visualization. Doublets labeled by Souporcell and clusters enriched

465

for doublets (>15%) were removed from further analysis. We removed ribosomal and

466

mitochondrial genes for further explore the subtypes of T/NK cells and B cells, then

467

performed the integration and clustering again using the same strategies.

469

Cell-type annotation

470

To annotate each cluster, we used FindAllMarkers in Seurat to find marker genes for

471

each cluster and selected immune cells marker genes, as shown in the dot plot in

472

Figure1, Figure3, and Figure5. SingleR (1.0.5) (Aran et al., 2019)was also applied to

473

help interpretation with Monaco Immune Data (Monaco et al., 2019) (Monaco

474

Immune Cell Data (GSE107011)) used as reference data to annotate the Th2-like cell

475

types, which was shown in FigureS 5a. We applied FindMarkers in Seurat to

476

compare the innate immune subsets that have distinct distribution in asymptomatic

477

conditions. The selected marker genes from the comparison were shown in Figure

478

3d. We searched the expression of ACE2 and TNFRSF19 using the human lung

479

atlas visualization tool

480

(https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/d/krasnow_lab_human_lung_cell_atlas_10x-

481

1.cxg/), and the results were shown in Supplementary Figure 5c.

482

The cell type abundance in Figure 2 was calculated by dividing the number of

483

cells in a certain cell type to total cell number for a given sample, while the cell type

484

abundance in Figure 3 and Figure 5 was calculated by dividing the number of cells in

485

a certain cell type to the number T/NK cells and the number of B cells

486

correspondingly. The heatmaps that present the proportions of each cell type were

487

generated using the proportions calculated as detailed above and are scaled by row

488

to be plotted on the same color scale. We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to

489

compare the proportions of cell types between different conditions and stages. P-

490

values were added to the plot by stat_compare_means function in ggpubr (0.3.0)

491

package.

492
493

DEG analysis

494

For subtypes of T cells, NK cells, and B cells with >200 cells, we aggregated the

495

counts for cells in each sample and generated pseudobulk samples, following the

496

data analysis workflow specified by a previous study (Crowell et al., 2020). Non-

497

protein-coding genes and genes related to sex were removed in the counts before

498

being analyzed by edgeR (3.28.1) (Robinson et al., 2010). glmQLFit and glmQLFTest

499

from edgeR were used to find marker genes between each condition. Genes with a

500

log fold change above 1 and FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) less than 0.05 were

501

selected. Then, genes with logCPM above 5 were shown in heatmaps in FigureS 6.

502

GO analysis was conducted on upregulated genes using topGO (3.28.1) (Alexa et

503

al., 2006), and the top 10 enriched GO terms were plotted.

504
505

TCR and BCR analysis

506

Raw fastq files were processed with CellRanger (3.0.1) pipeline with default settings

507

with the aforementioned reference. For TCR analysis, only cells with at least one

508

TCR alpha chain (TRA) and one TCR beta chain (TRB) were considered as detected

509

TCR. Moreover, each unique TRA-TRB pair was defined as a clone type. The

510

following analyses were based on cells with detected TCR. To analyses the clonal

511

abundance and diversity of cells from each stage, we use the alakazam (1.0.2)

512

(Gupta et al., 2015) package. For the clonal abundance curve, the 95% confidence

513

interval was estimated via bootstrapping. For the diversity curve, special cases of the

514

generalized diversity index correspond to the most popular diversity measures in

515

ecology. At q=0 different clones weight equally, regardless of sample size. As the

516

parameter q increase from 0 to +∞, the diversity index (D) depends less on rare

517

clones and more on common (abundant) ones. For BCR analysis, only cells with at

518

least one heavy chain (IGH) and one light chain (IGK or IGL) were considered high-

519

quality BCR and kept for further analysis. Furthermore, each unique IGH-IGK/IGL

520

pair was defined as a clone type. A clone type was considered clonal if it is detected

521

in more than one cell. All plots were generated using ggplot2 (3.3.1) (Wickham,

522

2016), and heatmaps were generated using pheatmap (1.0.12) unless otherwise

523

specified.
