Abstract
The second half of the Spring 2020 semester has been an unprecedented time globally
due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 pandemic has
forced more than one billion students out of school, has disrupted the world and led all
university courses switched to online instruction social distancing actions taken to limit
the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pandemic
related changes for undergraduate students, to assess their perspectives related to their
learning, experiences in two courses, and to discuss the far-reaching potential
implications for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. An electronic survey was
conducted to gather data on the student perceptions and learning characteristics of this
transition from face-to-face (F2F) to online at a medium-sized university in the
Southeast in the Spring 2020 semester. Nearly 88% of the participants indicated that
the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their education, while 19% indicated that they prefer
online over F2F learning. Furthermore, the online modality significantly increased
attendance in General Biology I. Our study also showed that the usage of live
conferencing and digital applications increased due to the pandemic. The current
research fills the gap in the existing literature by providing the first study on the effects
of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate learning and experiences in the
most unique dual modality of the Spring 2020 semester.

Introduction
Viruses are very small pieces of organic material that are only visible under an
electron microscope and cause diseases in humans, animals, and plants (Urry et al.,
2020). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China on
December 8, 2019 and resulted in an unprecedented public health crisis (WHO, 2020).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spike proteins that attach to host receptors (ACE2,
angiotensin converting enzyme 2) via droplets within a 2 m range with an estimated
reproduction number of 2.68 (R0; CDC, 2020). As of August 30, 2020, the global
number of confirmed cases stands at 25 million while the fatal cases stand at 843,586
(CSSE 08/30/20; Fig. 1). After the COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World
Health Organization (WHO, March 11, 2020), universities responded by temporarily
closing down campuses to slow the virus’s spread and flatten the curve. The world has
changed due to the aggressive spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and all face-to-face
(F2F) university courses shifted to online for the first time in the middle of the Spring
2020 semester.
As opposed to F2F, the online modality is characterized by the separation of the
instructor and learners in an online environment (Fig. 2; Nilson & Goodson, 2018).
Similar to the correspondence distance education programs that started in 1800s, the
online modality offers several benefits including learning at anytime and anywhere, a
faster completion time, flexible scheduled learning, and lower costs due to the absence
of room logistics needs (Fig. 2; Nilson & Goodson, 2018). Moreover, strategies such as
live video conference lecturing via Zoom (ZM, San Jose, CA) have been utilized to
increase student engagement.
Additionally, F2F and online instruction modalities share many qualities including
digital tools, group projects, student learning objectives (SLOs) and assessment (Fig.
2). Nennig et al. (2020) compared student attitudes in online and F2F inorganic
chemistry courses. No significant differences were found in performance, grade
distribution, and student attitudes. Another study by Mullen (2019) compared F2F with
synchronous online learning and found that the online modality was equally as effective.
In a medical education study, the researchers showed that both F2F and online formats
delivered the same benefits to students in Australia (Ifediora, 2019).
At our university, there is currently a focus on developing more online STEM
courses. While previous studies have investigated both modalities, there is no literature
on dual modalities in the same semester with one instructor.
Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the differences in
undergraduate student perceptions in F2F versus online STEM biology courses in the
unique dual modality of the Spring 2020 semester at Florida A&M University.

Methods
Course Structures
The current study was conducted with a cohort of students at a medium-sized university
in the Southeast who were enrolled in General Biology I (BSC1010) and Plant
Morphology (BOT3303). The Spring 2020 semester was divided into F2F (January to
mid-March) and online (mid-March to May) modality sections that were taught by the
same instructor. The F2F sections were taught in-person while the online sections were
taught using the Zoom (Fig. 3a; Zoom Video Communications [ZM], San Jose, CA)
software with video-conferencing and screen sharing.

Survey Process, Participants, and Outcome Measures
The survey of student experiences in this new normal time and COVID-19’s impact on
learning was designed as an electronic survey (Tables 1 and 2). The survey consisted
of 10 statements and 11 questions. The answer options for the statements ranged from
1 to 5 (1= Strongly Disagree, 2= Disagree, 3= Neutral, 4= Agree, and 5= Strongly
Agree). The remaining survey questions were open ended and multiple choice (MC)
types. All survey items were reviewed by researchers with undergraduate teaching and
assessment expertise. The response rate was approximately 88% of the students
enrolled.
Class attendance was recorded both before and after pandemic for the F2F and
online modalities, respectively. The two courses surveyed in this study were the
following: General Biology I (BSC1010) and Plant Morphology (BOT3303).

Ethics Statement
The Institutional Review Board at the university reviewed and approved this study under
“IRB Approval Number 1597667-1”.

Results
Instruction Modality
Face-to-face (F2F) instruction is a live teaching modality in which the students and
instructor are physically present in a classroom space (Fig. 2). On the other hand,
online instruction is a virtual teaching modality via the internet that could be
synchronous or asynchronous with a more flexible scheduling (Fig. 2). For centuries,
universities have been using the F2F instruction modality. In the Spring 2020 semester,
our courses shifted to online in mid-March. Therefore, Spring 2020 has emerged as an
unprecedented dual modality semester with F2F and online.

General Characteristics and Demographics of Courses
Table 1 summarizes the demographic information of those surveyed in this study.
Overall, the students were biology, premedicine, or pharmacy majors. The survey
included data from the General Biology I (BSC1010) and Plant Morphology (BOT3303)
courses during the Spring 2020 semester. The majority of the participants were female
(74%). While 33% of the participants were first-generation college students, 65%
attended all classes (Table 1). Based on the Spring 2020 semester, the average class
attendance increase was 9% in BSC1010, but there was not a significant increase in
BOT3303 (Fig. 4). Moreover, the majority of the respondents stated that they enjoyed
learning (Table 1).

Student Perceptions of Online Learning
The Florida higher education board directed all universities to move classes online to
slow the spread of the coronavirus in mid-March. In general, the majority of the
participants (88%) reported that the current COVID-19 pandemic climate impacted their
education (Fig. 4). The survey revealed that 79% of the participants reported that the
F2F in classroom instruction format was the best modality for them. Students stated
that they have taken online courses before this semester and they like having 24/7
accessibility to the course material in their own environment as online learners (Fig. 5).
Our survey also included the perceptions of students which are summarized in
Table 2 under four themes. In response to a question on the best part of online
learning, students enjoyed 24 h accessibility to course documents, recorded lectures,
and self-paced learning. As a response to the challenges of online learning, students
reported motivation, concentration difficulty, and internet connection issues. It should
be noted that student participants did not report major changes in their upcoming
Summer or Fall semester plans (Table 2).

Discussion
Extraordinary unprecedented circumstances are being endured during the deadly
coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). As a result, universities adapted to the new era by
moving teaching online. Video conferencing technologies such as Zoom (ZM, San
Jose, CA) allowed the live delivery of lectures and laboratories remotely.
In a challenging COVID-19 pandemic environment, both F2F and online
instruction were taught by faculty and taken by the same students in the same semester
(Spring 2020). In terms of class attendance, our study showed a modest increase of
9% in General Biology I (BSC1010) but no significant differences in Plant Morphology
(BOT3303) (Fig. 4). Although it is difficult to interpret the attendance pattern

differences, it is assumed that no travel time due to the pandemic and less distraction
should result in improved remote attendance. Moreover, freshman class students were
more likely to participate in online classes compared to upper class students in Plant
Morphology (BOT3303).
The online modality allowed the instructor to connect distantly, broadcast both
classes (BSC1010 and BOT3303) synchronously to all students via Zoom (Fig. 3a)),
and record short videos (~6 min duration) to share on the newly developed STEM
channel (DrhaciExplains, 2020; Fig. 3b). Furthermore, a majority of students also
agreed that they have utilized digital applications such as Zoom, Blackboard, Socrative,
YouTube, and Khan Academy among others (Fig. 3c).
Student comments concentrated on four major themes. Our survey results
demonstrated that while the majority of students prefer the F2F instruction and learning
approach, they also liked having access in their own environment, the 24/7 accessibility
of course materials, and videos (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the findings of previous
studies in Australia, which showed that both modalities delivered the same overall
benefits to students (Ifediora, 2019).
When asked what they liked the least about online learning, student comments
highlighted their lack of concentration, internet connection issues, and the lack of library
availability (Table 2). When asked about future plans, student comments did not point
to any major changes (Table 2). These results mirror previous studies where student
attitudes regarding online and F2F did not differ at the University of Wisconsin (Nennig
et al., 2020).
As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic’s spread was detected statewide, in
accordance with the guidance issued by the State University System, the university
moved classes online by March 13 (Fig. 1b). The results presented in this study are
promising and contained data from two biology STEM courses at a public HBCU in
Florida, USA. Therefore, the Spring 2020 semester represented two equally relevant
sections of F2F and online learning.

Conclusions
This study investigated the impacts of COVID-19 on the undergraduate education,
therefore it enhances the literature regarding F2F and online learning experiences. In
conclusion, the current research fills the gap in the existing literature by providing the
first study on the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate learning
and experiences in the most unique dual modality of the Spring 2020 semester. Further
research is recommended to examine what is occurring in other educational settings
due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
