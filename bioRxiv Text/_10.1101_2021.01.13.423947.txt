Abstract
Morphological profiling of cells in the presence of perturbants, also known as
phenomics, is gaining momentum given its successful implementation for drug
discovery and compound profiling. The current COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the
search for new and fast methods to identify novel or repurposed therapeutic drugs. A
popular

method

to

identify

antiviral

drugs

is

the

use

of

antibody-based

immunofluorescence to visualise infected cells. However, this method lacks depth
towards the effect of such drugs on the host cells. Here we present a phenomics
workflow for untargeted phenotypic drug screening of virus infected cells, combining
Cell Painting with antibody-based detection of viral infection in a single and simple
method and provide a semi-automated image analysis pipeline for classification and
feature extraction of virus infected cells. Our phenomics workflow provides valuable
information about the effect of both virus and drugs on the host cells. We validated our
method using a panel of 9 antiviral compounds including known and novel compounds
on MRC5 human lung fibroblasts infected with Human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E).
Two of the compounds showed strong antiviral efficacy concomitant with a recovery of
the morphological profile towards non-infected.

Introduction
In the light of the current Covid-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), development of new therapies against emerging viruses is of
high priority. Understanding how viruses affect the host cells is key to identify potential targets
for treatment. RNA viruses are characterized by their fast mutation rate resulting in resilience
against antiviral drugs, as well as heavy reliance on host pathways for replication (1,2).
Coronaviruses are an exception to this norm given the existing RNA proofreading machinery
within their genome, but nevertheless develop treatment escape mutants (3). Therefore, host
targeting- as well as combination- therapies might be advantageous to battle current and future
virus outbreaks. To this end, new methods to profile cellular responses during virus infection
that can be leveraged for drug screening are greatly needed.
Image-based morphological cell profiling is a multiparametric method for studying biological
and chemical perturbations at single-cell level. The Cell Painting approach is a high-content
image-based assay for morphological profiling that uses six multiplexed fluorescent dyes.
These dyes reveal eight relevant cellular components or organelles interrogating numerous
biological pathways simultaneously (4). The resulting images can be analyzed using traditional
image analysis techniques to provide information-rich profiles of individual cells, as well as
serve as input for machine or deep learning approaches (5). Previous studies showed that
analysis of the Cell Painting-derived features can be used to study drug toxicity, predict cell
health indicators, detect morphological disease signatures, and give insights into the
mechanism of action (MoA) of both existing and novel compounds (6–10). In contrast to targetbased screens, where only a limited number of features are quantified to select for a known
cellular phenotype, morphological profiling combined with statistical analysis can unravel
subtle morphological patterns and provide insights into new pathways (11).
While morphological profiling is gaining ground in the field of pharmacology and toxicology,
the employment of phenotypic profiling in the field of virology has been limited. One possible
explanation is the methodological complexity when combined with high-throughput pipelines,
as previously suggested (12). However, with the increased momentum in virology research
caused by the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, phenotypic profiling is progressively being
implemented as a strategy for the selection and optimization of drugs, and drug combinations,
for the treatment of virus-infected cells (13,14).

Traditional immunofluorescence-based antiviral screening methods commonly rely on the use
of specific antibodies for the visualisation and quantification of virus-infected cells. These
methods have been proven successful for identifying drugs that directly affect cell survival and
infectability of the virus, but lack the depth to provide detailed information about the effect on
the host cell. In this paper we describe a novel phenomics workflow, combining morphological
profiling with antibody-based detection of virus infection in a single and simple assay. We
provide an automated image analysis pipeline for the identification of infected and non-infected
cells, generating hundreds of data points, to study host-cell biology at a single-cell level.
To validate our method, we have applied our phenomics workflow on Human coronavirus 229E
(CoV-229E) infected MRC5 primary lung fibroblasts, in the absence or presence of a number
of known and novel antiviral drugs. The results of this study show that the extracted phenotypic
features successfully capture effects of viral infection and that treatment with the compounds
Remdesivir and E-64d could reverse the cellular phenotype from an “infected”- towards a “noninfected” morphological profile. Taken together, our phenomics workflow provides a novel
method for the unbiased study of virus-induced effects on host cells that can be leveraged for
drug screening of novel or repurposed antiviral drugs.

Results
A phenomics workflow to morphologically profile cells exposed to viruses
In order to investigate how viral exposure affects the host cells, the original morphological
profiling protocol known as Cell Painting (4), was modified and combined with antibody-based
staining. Incorporation of an antibody specific against coronavirus nucleoprotein, allowed for
the identification of virus-infection, as well as the parallel measurement of hundreds of
parameters from the organelles stained using the remaining Cell Painting dyes, which more
specifically consisted of Hoechst (Nuclei), SYTO 14 (nucleoli and cytoplasmic RNA),
Concanavalin A for visualisation of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), Wheat Germ Agglutinin
(plasma membrane and Golgi), and Phalloidin for F-actin (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Once the
morphological profiling protocol was set up, an analysis workflow was designed to capture the
in-depth morphological profiles induced by virus infection as well as treatment with selected
antiviral compounds (Fig. 1B). To validate our method, we chose human lung fibroblasts
(MRC5) as host cells and infected them with the Human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E). The
analysis part of our phenomics workflow included quality control of the images, feature
extraction of the image data, data analysis on the extracted features, and finally data
representation (Suppl. Fig. 1).

Cell Painting features capture effects of viral infection
An image analysis pipeline was designed to distinguish between infected and non-infected
cells using the coronavirus nucleoprotein antibody stain, implemented as a Cell Profiler
pipeline (15). The pipeline is designed to be universal, requiring only adjustments for accurate
segmentation when applied on different cell lines and viruses; in this manuscript we
demonstrate it on MRC5 cells to evaluate the effect of CoV-229E infection.
Cell classification based on the virus antibody intensity measures in the perinuclear space
accurately discriminated infected from non-infected cells (Fig. 2A), which allowed us to further
analyse the morphological features and differentiate both cell populations in an unbiased
manner (Fig. 2B). While we collected as many as 1200 morphological features, there were
clear changes in a subset of them, including Concanavalin A and SYTO 14 mean intensities,
which were elevated in the infected cells compared to non-infected (Fig. 2B and Suppl. Table
1). Next, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis on the extracted features, visualizing
the results in a heat map and generated morphological profiles for each condition. Clearly,
CoV-229E infection induced measurable morphological changes, as depicted by the distinct
morphological profiles between DMSO conditions in the absence or presence of CoV-229E
(Fig. 2C).

To visualize the distribution of phenotypic features of each condition, we performed Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Principal Component (PCA) analyses. For
this, we excluded the features corresponding to the anti-coronavirus nucleoprotein antibody,
thus solely using the Cell Painting produced features to study host-cell morphology.
Remarkably, PCA analysis revealed a separation of infected from noninfected cells in the first
principal component (Fig. 2D and E). The associated PCA loadings revealed that phenotypic
features relating to the ER and nucleoli/cytoplasmic RNA stains, as well as granularity, size
and shape features were most important on the direction of the first principal component
(Suppl. Table 1). Overall, our analysis demonstrated the strength of phenomics profiling to
identify morphological changes exclusive of virus-infected cells.

Assessment of antiviral activity of reference drugs by an antibody-based
approach
To benchmark our phenomics workflow to the traditional methods to screen for antiviral drugs,
we first explored the antiviral efficiency of a set of 9 compounds that included two direct-acting
drugs targeting viral RNA polymerase (Remdesivir and Favipiravir), and seven host-targeting
antiviral compounds (E-64d, Camostat, Cathepsin L inhibitor and Bafilomycin A1), including
three novel in-house developed broad-spectrum antiviral compounds TH3289, TH6744 and
TH5487 were tested (16,17) (Fig. 3A). MRC5 cells were either not infected or infected with
CoV-229E and then exposed to the compounds at the indicated concentrations (Fig. 3A). We
determined cell survival by nuclei count and infection rate by the number of anti-coronavirus
nucleoprotein positive cells, both in respect to DMSO (infection 91%) (Fig. 3B). Antiviral
activity with no cellular toxicity was observed upon Remdesivir and E-64d treatment. Treatment
with clinically available Remdesivir reduced infection between 58% at 0.1µM and 91% at 1µM
and 8µM concentrations. At the same time E-64d treatment resulted in a reduction in viral
infection of 52%, 77% or 85% compared to DMSO at 1, 10 or 30 µM concentrations,
respectively, providing an adequate therapeutic window (Fig. 3B, C). The recently developed
broadly active host-targeting antiviral compounds TH3289, TH6744 and TH5487 showed 58%,
52% and 53% reduction in the levels of infected cells, respectively, upon 10 µM treatments.
Neither FDA-approved Favipiravir nor pre-clinical compounds Camostat or Cathepsin L
inhibitor reduced the number of infected cells, while Bafilomycin A1 was toxic at all tested
concentrations (Fig. 3B and C and Suppl. Fig 2A).

Validation study: Phenomics approach identifies antiviral drugs against
coronavirus that recover infected morphological profiles
To validate our method, we used the developed phenomics workflow to assess the antiviral
activity of the drugs and compounds that were tested at the same concentration using a
traditional antibody-based method (Fig. 3). We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering of
the extracted morphological profiles to compare the phenotypic profiles among all the tested
conditions (Suppl. Fig. 3A). The profiles from infected cells treated with Remdesivir or E-64d,
which showed the most prominent antiviral effect, were similar to the non-infected cells in
DMSO, suggesting a rescue or prevention of the virus-induced phenotypic profile (Fig. 4A,
Suppl. Fig 4A). In the absence of the virus, the morphological profiles of the drugs with strong
antiviral effect (Remdesivir and E-64d), were largely similar to the DMSO condition (Suppl.
Fig 2A). The treatment with compound TH6744 induced morphological profiles that were
closer to non-infected controls on the first component of the PCA, but deviated on the second
component (Fig 4D). Finally, the profiles for Camostat, which exhibited no antiviral effect, and
no toxicity, remained unchanged compared to DMSO, both in the presence or absence of the
virus, confirming the lack of activity of this compound in the tested conditions. To facilitate the
interpretation of the data, we next performed dimensionality reduction by PCA of the
phenotypic features for each of the drugs and compounds tested. In the case of Remdesivir
and E-64d, the PCA resulted in several clusters: one cluster corresponding to the DMSO
condition in infected cells, followed by clusters corresponding to the treatments, which deviated
towards the cluster belonging to the DMSO condition in non-infected cells (Fig. 4B and C).
Analysis of the morphological profiles induced by TH6744 treatment also separated from the
DMSO condition in the presence of the virus on the first principal component, but separated
on the second principal component (Fig. 4D). Camostat treatment clusters were
indistinguishable from the DMSO-treated infected cells (Fig. 4D). In summary, these results
validate our phenomics method to identify antiviral drugs.

Discussion
Traditional targeted screens for antiviral drugs, such as antibody-, reporter-, or biochemicalbased assays, can be costly and time-consuming, and are often biased for discovery
constrained by what we know. Cell profiling enables an untargeted approach for
characterization of cellular responses with a high spatiotemporal resolution, high throughput,
and on a single-cell level. Here, we present a method utilizing Cell Painting combined with
antibody staining to profile host cell responses upon virus infection and validate its potential to
serve as a platform for finding effective antiviral compounds.

Utilizing our phenomics workflow, we successfully captured distinct morphological profiles
upon CoV-229E infection. Drug treatment with Remdesivir and E-64d, which have been
previously shown to ameliorate coronavirus infections (18,19), successfully reversed the
morphological profile from a disease (infected) to a control (non-infected) one. In fact,
hierarchical clustering of the morphological profiles by similarity among the tested compounds,
resulted in Remdesivir and E-64d clustering with the non-infected conditions (Suppl. Fig 4A).
On the other hand, under our tested conditions we could not reproduce the previously reported
antiviral activities from Favipiravir, Camostat, Cathepsin L inhibitor or Bafilomycin A1 (19–22).
These results may be explained by cell-dependent effects, the timing of treatment or by viral
infection, which could be addressed by optimisation of the experimental conditions. However
this is out of the scope of this work. While this could be considered a caveat of this method,
assay and conditions optimisation are a requisite for any type of screening method.
The antiviral activity of TH6744, TH3289 and TH5487 has previously been characterized on
viral progeny release (16), which differs from the primary virus infection used in this work. This
methodological difference might explain the mild antiviral activity found by both the traditional
antibody-based approach and our phenomics workflow. However, the mild antiviral activity of
these newly developed compounds, in particular of TH6744, was reflected by its morphological
profile and PCA, which showed that TH6744 partially rescued the virus-induced phenotype.
A clear advantage of using morphological profiling to screen for antiviral drugs is the in-depth
analysis of the host cell status upon infection as well as compound treatment. Thus, despite
not being able to recapitulate the antiviral activities of the above mentioned compounds, using
our phenomics workflow, we have obtained important information that can be used to further
understand the biological effect of both a given virus or a given compound, and importantly it
validates our method to identify potential novel antiviral compounds.
Overall, we demonstrated that our phenomics workflow, which includes an adapted Cell
Painting protocol, complemented with a custom image analysis pipeline, can be utilized the
unbiased study of virus-induced effects on host cells that can be leveraged for drug
repurposing, as well as for the discovery of novel antiviral compounds. We anticipate that this
untargeted approach, with only minor adjustments of the image analysis pipeline, will enable
other applications using diverse human-derived cell lines, as well as different viruses and
antibodies.

Materials and Methods
Biosafety
All experiments in presence of infectious virus were performed under respective biosafety
laboratory (BSL) conditions according to Swedish Work and Health Authorities. Experiments
using CoV-229E were performed at BSL2 at Karolinska Institutet.
Cell culture
MRC5 cells (from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in Minimum Essential Media
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). The cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and the cell culture was
routinely tested for Mycoplasma using a luminescence-based MycoAlert kit (Lonza).
Virus production
CoV-229E (VR-740; from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) stocks were amplified in Huh7 cells.
Virus titers were determined in Huh7 cells by end point dilution assay combined with highthroughput immunofluorescence imaging of viral protein staining as described previously (16).

Compounds
Remdesivir and Favipiravir were purchased from Carbosynth. TH6744, TH3289 and TH5487
were in-house produced and recently described (16,17). Compounds Camostat, E-64d,
Cathepsin L inhibitor, Bafilomycin A (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell painting positive and negative
controls included the Etoposide (E1383), Fenbendazole (F5396), Metoclopramide (M0763),
and DMSO (Sigma Aldrich).

Virus infection and compound treatments
Antiviral compounds and cell painting positive controls were dispersed in 96-well source plates
at 500✕ of the final concentration using the D300e Digital Dispenser (Tecan, Männedorf,
Switzerland) and stored at －20 °C until use. Compound and virus infection conditions were
randomized within the plates and multiple plate layouts were used to compensate for
systematic effects related to well position. Replicates were placed both on the same plate and
in independent plates. To further avoid plate and edge-effects, the outer wells were excluded.
Before performing the assay, 198 µL culture medium was added on the source plate reaching

200 µL of 5✕ dilution of the final concentration. Three doses were chosen for each antiviral
compound (final concentration; max DMSO 0.3% v/v). A total of 2500 MRC5 cells per well
were seeded in black 96 multiwell plates 24 hours before infection (Costar 3603, Corning Life
Science, Corning, New York, USA) in 100 µL culture medium, kept at room temperature for 20
minutes to aid homogeneous spreading in the wells and incubated overnight at 37 ℃ at 5%
CO2 atmosphere. Cells were infected with a MOI 10 or 15 in 50 μL culture medium for 1 h and
at least four wells per plate were left uninfected as a mock control. Virus-containing medium
was removed, replaced with 80 μL culture medium and 20 µL compound-containing medium
in at least technical duplicates, reaching 1✕ of the final compound concentration. Cells were
incubated for 24 or 48 hours. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in PBS (Gibco, USA) for 20 min, washed twice with PBS and
stored at 4℃ prior processing for the Cell Painting and antibody detection.

Cell Painting and antibody detection
To profile morphological features of coronavirus infected cells an adapted version of the cell
painting assay was used (11). Specific fluorescent probes or fluorophore-conjugated small
molecules were used for the detection of the nucleus, nucleoli, endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
actin cytoskeleton, Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane (Table 1). To accommodate virusspecific antibody detection in parallel to Cell Painting, one dye of the Cell Painting assay was
replaced with coronavirus-nucleoprotein specific antibody (4). Compared to the original cell
painting assay consisting of 6 dyes targeting eight components/ cell organelles, here 5 dyes
and a virus-specific antibody were used to target virus nucleoprotein in parallel to 7 cell
organelles and cell components in a single multiplexed staining assay (table 1). Example
images of each of the stains can be found in Fig 1A. Coronavirus pan monoclonal antibody
was combined with a secondary antibody using Alexa Fluor 647 fluorophore, chosen for its
narrow emission and excitation spectra to limit interference with the other channels. In this
assay, the mitochondrial dye was removed. To avoid fading of the chemical stains, in our
experience, the secondary antibody is best added together or after staining with chemical dyes.
Concentrations of secondary antibodies might need to be adjusted for a good signal-to-noise
ratio in the multiplexed assay. In Table 1, working concentrations for the different cell lines and
antibodies are presented. A detailed pipeline can be found in Suppl. Fig 1.
Fixed cells were washed twice (BioTek, 405 LS washer) and permeabilized by incubation with
80 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 minutes at room temperature, followed by two washes with
1x PBS. Then, 80 μl of 0.2% BSA in PBS (Multiflo FX, multimode dispenser, BioTek) was
added and incubated for 30 minutes. Next, the plates were washed twice with 1X PBS and

50μl primary antibody was added. Primary antibody was incubated for 4 hours at room
temperature after which the plates were washed 3 times for 5 minutes. A staining solution of
Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, cat.no H3570), SYTO 14 green (Invitrogen, cat.no S7576),
Concanavalin A/Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, cat.no C11252), Wheat Germ Agglutinin/Alexa
Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, cat.no W32464) and Phalloidin/Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, cat.no
A12380) was prepared in PBS in addition to Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed
Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen Catalog # A-21235). 50 μl of staining mixture
was added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes, after which the plates were washed a
final 3 times for 5 minutes. Plates were either imaged immediately or sealed and kept at 4°C
to be imaged later.
All washing steps were performed using a Biotek 405 LS washer, dispensing was done using
the Biotek Multiflo FX, multimode dispenser. Plates were protected from light as much as
possible.

Image Analysis pipeline
Image Quality control and preprocessing
Images were processed and analysed with the open-source image analysis software
CellProfiler (available at https://cellprofiler.org/), version 4.0.6 (29). Prior to analysis, a quality
control pipeline was run on the raw images to detect images with artefacts, which may corrupt
the data with false values (5). We computed various measures to represent a variety of
artefacts and used statistical analysis to detect outliers. Images deviating more than 5 standard
deviations from the median of FocusScore, MaxIntensity, MeanIntensity, PercentMaximal,
PowerLogLogSlope and StdIntensity were flagged, inspected and removed if necessary. To
remove blurred images, the PercentMaximal score and PowerLogLogSlope was computer and
images with percentMaximal values higher than 0.25, or PowerLogLogSlope values lower than
-2.3 were removed from the dataset. The QC detected 95 images as outliers, as indicated by
one or multiple of the control measures. To assess the reproducibility of the assay and detect
possible plate and drift effects across multiple plates, we visualized the quality measures and
performed visual inspection (Supp. Fig. 5).
In addition, we used cell-level quality control based on the Hoechst staining to detect bright
artefacts and clumped cells. Bright artefacts in the DAPI channel were identified using the
Indentify Primary Object module in CellProfiler, artefacts and surrounding pixels were masked
to avoid interference with segmentation.
Segmentation
Nu segmentation based on the DAPI channel was performed by applying a gaussian blur
followed by Otsu thresholding to segment the outlines of each nucleus. The cell objects were
segmented using Watershed segmentation using minimum Cross-entropy of the cytoskeleton
stain, using the nuclei as a seed. The cytoplasm cell compartment was defined as the cell
object subtracted from the nuclei. Segmentation of the perinuclear cell compartment was
accomplished by the expansion of 20 pixels in the concanavalin A channel and subtraction of
the nuclei. The pipeline can be found as a supplement to this paper. Adjustments on the
parameters might be needed to be used between different experimental setups and on
different cell lines.
Feature extraction
After identification of the four cell compartments, phenotypic characteristics were measured
using shape (AreaShape), intensity-based (Intensity, Radial-distribution), texture (granularity),

as well as microenvironment and context features (location, Neighbors) [4]. A total of 1211
features were extracted from each object which were exported into csv format for downstream
analysis.
Classification
To classify the cells, the mean intensity of the antibody channel in the perinuclear cell
compartment was used as measurement in the Classification module in CellProfiler. Visual
inspection and validation using CellProfiler Analyst, confirmed that this measure was highly
indicative for the infection state of the cells. Background levels of antibody signals were
determined based on analysis of the histograms of noninfected cells, and used as a set-off for
the infection status.
Antiviral dose-response and cytotoxicity
To capture relevant cellular phenotypes, cytotoxic compounds were removed from the
analysis. Cell count was used to check the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50),
defined as a 50% reduction in cell count compared to solvent control conditions. Antiviral
efficacy was calculated by dividing the number of infected cells by the infection rate in solvent
controls.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (GraphPad Software Inc).
Two-way-ANOVA was performed for all the datasets that required comparison among multiple
data points within a given experimental condition. Dunnet was applied for the correction of
multiple comparisons, and the family-wise alpha threshold and confidence level were 0.05
(95%confidence interval).
Feature analysis
In order to facilitate the broad use of our phenomics approach, an image analysis pipeline is
provided with the paper, which is tailored to the application here presented, and once executed
will provide the necessary feature data for subsequent analysis. A step-by step narrative of the
methods used to analyse and visualize the feature data is presented below. Downstream
analysis of the feature data was performed using Python 3. Prior analysis, feature data was
cleaned from images with artefacts as identified by our QC pipeline described above. Next,
the feature values were centered and normalized. More specifically, the feature values were
fit to the data and then transformed using the fit.transform method of StandardScaler of scikit-

learn module (version 0.22.1). Normalization was done across all plates. Invariant features
were removed.
All analyses were performed on the total of all extracted features, excluded from the metadata
columns and features representing counts (e.g. number of children objects), and percentile
counts. The analysis studying virus-induced morphological profiles were excluding features
relating to the virus antibody.
To compare morphological profiles the features were presented as cluster maps. Features
were scaled using the sklearn StandardScaler method, by subtracting the mean and scaling
to unit variance. This ensured that each feature (clustermap column) has a mean of 0 and
variance of 1. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the morphological profiles was
computed using the Euclidean metric, and the clustering algorithm using Ward's method and
visualized using the seaborn data visualization library (version 0.11.0).
Visualization of the high dimensional data was done using dimensional reduction methods
including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP) using sklearn (version 0.22.1). UMAP visualization was done using 30
neighbors (30).
Data availability
Image Data will soon become publicly available at Figshare. Image analysis pipelines can be

Figure Legends
Figure 1. A phenomics workflow for identification of antiviral drugs. A. MRC5 lung
fibroblast cells infected with Human coronavirus 229E, stained using Hoechst (Nuclei), SYTO
14 (nucleoli and cytoplasmic RNA), Concanavalin A (Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)), Wheat
Germ Agglutinin (plasma membrane and Golgi), and Phalloidin (F-actin), in combination with
an anti-coronavirus nucleoprotein antibody. Note the presence of non-infected (asterisk) and
infected cells. B. Overview of the phenomics workflow. Cells are seeded in multiwell plates,
incubated for 24 hours followed by virus infection. Subsequently, virus-containing media is
removed and compounds are added and incubated for 24 or 48h followed by fixation fixed.
Next, antibody staining and Cell Painting is performed on the cells, followed by high content
imaging, image analysis and data analysis of the extracted phenotypic features (a more
detailed description of the workflow can be found in Suppl. Fig. 1).
Figure 2. Morphological profiling of virus-infected MRC5 cells. A. A representative
composite image of infected cells with F-actin in green, nuclei in blue and anti-coronavirus
nucleoprotein antibody in red. Segmentation and classification of individual cells visualized by
an outline with infected cells in purple and non-infected cells in yellow. B. Boxplots of a few of
the morphological features that were altered in infected cells compared to non-infected. C.
Morphological profiles of infected (+CoV-229E) and non-infected cells (-CoV-229E). Columns
in the matrix represent extracted features after clustering, colour intensity represents the
magnitude of increase or decrease in a measured feature. D and E. Dimensionality reduction
using UMAP and PCA was applied to the extracted Cell Profiler features to reduce redundancy
and correlation of the features (15). The results were then plotted as single cells and coloured
according to their infected or non-infected classification based on antibody staining.

Figure 3. Antiviral efficacy assessment. A. A set of two reference drugs (Remdesivir and
Favipiravir), seven antiviral compounds (E-64d, Camostat, Cathepsin L inhibitor and
Bafilomycin A1), including three in-house developed broad-spectrum antiviral compounds
(TH3289, TH6744 and TH5487) were used to assess antiviral efficacy by anti-coronavirus
nucleoprotein staining. B. Percentage of survival (red) and percentage of infected cells (blue)
normalised to DMSO (solvent control). Coloured intervals denote standard deviation. C.
Representative images of MRC5 cells non-infected, or infected with CoV-229E. Hoechst
staining for nuclei are visualized in blue, and anti-coronavirus nucleoprotein antibody against
CoV-229E in yellow. Two-way ANOVA was performed to assess the statistical significance of
each condition (*p<0.02, **p<0.002, ***p<0.0002).
Figure 4. Identification of phenomics profiles of antiviral drugs efficient against
coronavirus. A. Similarity matrix of phenomic profiles of the indicated samples based on their
proximity in feature space. Two main groups are shown, non-infected (-229E) and infected
(+229E), in the presence or absence of Remdesivir, E-64d, TH6477, Camostat or DMSO
(vehicle) at the indicated concentrations. B, C and D. PCA analysis of morphological features
upon treatment with Remdesivir, E-64d, TH6477 and Camostat in non-infected (-229E) and
infected (+229E) conditions compared to DMSO control. Each dot in the PCA represents one
image by taking the mean of all objects in the image.
