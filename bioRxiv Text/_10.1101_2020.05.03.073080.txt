Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic, attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, resulted in
millions infected worldwide and an immediate need for antiviral treatments. The main protease
(Mpro) in SARS-CoV-2 is a viable drug target because of its essential role in the cleavage of the
virus polypeptide and subsequent viral replication. Feline infectious peritonitis, a fatal infection
in cats caused by a coronavirus, was successfully treated previously with a dipeptide-based
protease inhibitor. Here we show this drug, GC376, and its analog GC373, are effective
inhibitors of the Mpro from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values in the nanomolar
range. Crystal structures of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with these inhibitors have a
covalent modification of the nucleophilic Cys145. NMR analysis reveals that inhibition proceeds
via reversible formation of a hemithioacetal. GC373 and GC376 are potent inhibitors of SARSCoV-2 in cell culture, with EC50 values near one micromolar and little to no toxicity. These
protease inhibitors are soluble, non-toxic, and bind reversibly. They are strong drug candidates
for the treatment of human coronavirus infections because they have already been successful in
animals (cats). The work here lays the framework for their use in human trials for the treatment
of COVID-19.

Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 3CLpro, coronavirus, main protease, kinetics, SARS,

The COVID-19 outbreak evolved into a pandemic due to the virulent nature of SARS-CoV-2,
reaching over 3 million cases worldwide by end of April 2020, with the number of infected
growing rapidly worldwide1. This current scenario contrasts the less virulent SARS outbreak in
2002-03, which had only 8000 cases and 774 deaths (WHO, 2004) 2. There is an urgent need for
antiviral therapies for acute COVID-19 infections, especially until an efficacious vaccine is
developed. The main protease of the coronavirus is a strong drug target due to its essential nature
for virus maturation and subsequent infection3. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that hijack the
host’s translational machinery to generate viral proteins. The viral RNA encodes two
overlapping polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab, which are 450 kD and 750 kD, respectively. The
polyproteins need to be cleaved in order to release individual functional proteins for viral
replication and transcription. Viral encoded proteases include the main protease (Mpro), also
called 3CLpro, and a papain-like protease (PLpro). Mpro cleaves the polyproteins at 11 positions
primarily at conserved Leu Gln | Ser Ala Gly sequences, which allows for virus assembly. Given
its crucial role in virus replication, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a prominent drug target for COVID19 antiviral therapy. The coronavirus Mpro is a cysteine protease for which many different
inhibitor classes exist4. Protease inhibitors are common drug candidates if they meet the
requirements of low toxicity, solubility, and reversibility5. Several proteases have been identified
as molecular targets and used for the development of novel classes of drugs5 including
Tipranavir for the treatment of HIV6. However, inhibition of cysteine proteases by thiol reactive
species is often untenable for human drugs unless the inhibitor is reversible. Michael acceptor
drugs that are irreversible in vivo, such as Rupintrivir, have failed in clinical trials due to low

bioavailabilty3. Undesired irreversible reaction occurs with numerous mammalian thiols to
destroy the inhibitor. Reaction with host protein thiols could also potentially lead to acute
toxicity or immune reaction. In this regard, the reversible reaction of thiols with aldehyde
inhibitors to make hemithioacetals presents a unique opportunity for effective cysteine protease
inhibition, as they can potentially bind more effectively in the active site of their target protein
than with other thiols7. Water soluble aldehyde bisulphite adducts are readily made, reversibly
from the parent aldehyde under physiological conditions, and can be ideal prodrugs for cysteine
protease inhibition as described below.
In early studies we developed peptide-based inhibitors, including aldehydes, against viral
cysteine proteases7 that were subsequently studied with Mpro during the SARS coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) outbreak in 20038. Peptide aldehydes and their bisulphite derivatives were later
used to inhibit the main protease of the Feline Coronavirus FCoV9. FCoV generally causes mild
symptoms, but it can lead to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is usually fatal in cats. The
bisulphite adduct GC376, which converts readily to peptide aldehyde GC373, was well tolerated
and able to reverse the infection in cats10. This, along with other studies that included ferret and
mink coronavirus Mpro, demonstrated the broad specificity of this protease inhibitor11. A crystal
structure of GC376 was solved with the homologous MERS Mpro and demonstrated a covalent
interaction with the catalytic cysteine of the Mpro 12. Recently, structures of the SARS-CoV-2
Mpro protease were solved with a peptide-based ketoamide inhibitor13 and various re-purposed
drugs such as anti-cancer agents14. However, these Mpro inhibitors have not been tested in animal
models of coronavirus infection nor have they been reported in human or animal trials for SARS.
A number are known to have severe side effects and human cell toxicity, especially those that are
anticancer agents. In this study, we examine whether GC373 and GC376, established as effective

drugs in cats, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro reversibly and have potential for use as antiviral therapy
in humans.

GC373 and GC376 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
We synthesized the key dipeptidyl compounds, aldehyde GC373 and bisulphite adduct
GC376 (Figure 1A)9 (Extended data, Figure S1), to test whether these FIP inhibitors are
efficacious towards the Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2 and Mpro from SARS-CoV (associated with the
2002 outbreak). This compound consists of a glutamine surrogate in the substrate, P1 position, a
Leu in P2 position and benzene ring in the P3 position, which reflects the known specificity for
the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was cloned as a SUMO-tag fusion, which
allowed for high-yield expression, enhanced stability, and generation of native N- and C-termini
(Extended data, Figure S2 and S3). Similarly, SARS-CoV Mpro was expressed and purified to
obtain native N- and C-termini according to previous methods8. Kinetic parameters for both the
SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2-Mpro were determined using a synthetic peptide FRETsubstrate with an anthranilate-nitrotyrosine donor-acceptor pair (Abz-SVTLQSG-TyrNO2R Extended data, Figure S4) as it displays over 10-fold more sensitivity compared to the
equivalent EDANS-Dabcyl system15. Both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro exhibited
cooperative substrate binding of the FRET-substrate (Extended data, Figure S5)
IC50 measurements revealed that both GC373 and GC376 inhibit the SARS-CoV Mpro
and the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in vitro at nanomolar concentrations (Figure 1B and C). For the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, IC50 for GC373 and GC376 are 0.40±0.05 µM and 0.19±0.04 µM,
respectively. This is in agreement with studies of these compounds with Mpro from related
viruses. For FCoV Mpro the IC50 for GC376 was 0.04 ±0.04 µM and for GC373 was 0.02 ±0.01

µM9. For SARS-CoV Mpro we observed an enhanced IC50, demonstrating the broad inhibition by
both compounds, with GC373 and GC376 being 0.070 ± 0.02 µM and 0.05 ± 0.01 µM,
respectively. The bisulphite adduct GC376 shows slightly higher potency for both enzymes
compared to the free aldehyde. Our in vitro IC50 values for GC373 and GC376 reflect tight
binding for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro compared to other inhibitors tested in vitro, e.g. ebselen (IC50
0.67 µM)14, tideglusib (IC50 1.55 µM)14, carmofur (IC50 1.82 µM)14, disulfiram (IC50 9.35 µM)14,
shikonin (IC50 15.75 µM)14, PX-12 (IC50 21.39 µM)14. Both GC373 and GC376 are also more
potent than recently reported ketoamide inhibitors (IC50 of the lead compound 0.67 µM)13.
Recently, a related peptidyl inhibitor was reported with a similar warhead to our compound, but
with an indole group at the P3 position and an IC50 of 0.05±0.005 µM16. However, that
compound has not been demonstrated to be efficacious in animals, as is the case for GC376.

Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with GC373 and GC376
To gain insight into the mechanism of inhibition, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures
with inhibitors GC373 and GC376 were determined at 2.0 Angstroms (Figure 2 and Extended
data, Table S1). The three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB Code 6WTM)
is highly similar to the recently solved structures with an RMSD of 0.38 Å2 (PDB Code 6LU7)
13,14

. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystallized as a dimer facilitated by an N-finger of protomer A (residues

1 to 7) that fits into a pocket in protomer B. Each promoter displayed a two-lobe structure with
one lobe composed of two-antiparallel b-barrels (Domains I and II), which form a chymotrypsin
and 3C-like peptidase fold, with the active site comprised of a Cys-144 and His-41 dyad located
at the domain interface. The oxyanion hole, influenced by dimerization17, is formed from the
main chain residues Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145. The C-terminal domain III, is involved in

domain swapping and facilitates dimer formation18. Molecular replacement with structure
6Y7M.PDB revealed electron density in the Fo-Fc map at the catalytic cysteine for both
inhibitors GC373 (PDB Code 6WTK) and GC376 (PDB Code 6WTJ). In both structures the
peptidyl inhibitor is covalently attached to Cys-145 as a hemithioacetal, showing that as
expected the bisulphite group leaves GC376 (Extended data, Figure S6). In contrast to the
MERS Mpro-GC376 structure, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro electron density indicated the formation of
only one enantiomer for this inhibitor12. A strong hydrogen bond network is established from
side chain of His163 and backbone amide of His164, and Glu166, with backbone contributions
from Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 defining the oxyanion hole (Figure 3). Together this provides
strong binding and a low IC50 for the inhibitor. The glutamine surrogate in the substrate P1
position interacts with the side chain of His163, while the Leu in P2 inserts into a hydrophobic
pocket, representing the S2 subsite of the enzyme. Similar to what was observed in the MERSMpro-GC376 structure12, the benzyl ring and the b-lactam of the Gln surrogate forms a stacked
hydrophobic interaction, which stabilizes the inhibitor in the active site of the protease. A close
examination of the subsite for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro reveals regions to allow for future inhibitor
development (Extended data, Figure S6).
To confirm the formation of a covalent hemithioacetal as a single enantiomer in the
active site, GC373 was prepared with 13C label (>99%) at the aldehyde carbon and mixed in 7.8fold excess with the Mpro protease from SARS-CoV-2 in deuterated buffer. HSQC NMR analysis
(700 MHz) showed appearance of a single crosspeak signal (one isomer only) for the
hemithioacetal carbon at 76 ppm (13C) and 5.65 ppm (1H) in accordance with previous chemical
shift reports for hemithioacetals7 (Extended data, Figure S7).

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has enhanced catalytic activity compared to SARS-CoV Mpro
Recent crystal structural analysis reported differences in the residues residing between
the dimer interface of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro when compared with the SARS-CoV Mpro13. Previous
mutagenesis studies, which altered residues at the dimer interface of SARS-CoV Mpro, enhanced
catalytic activity 3.6 fold19. In agreement with this, our analysis shows that the catalytic turnover
rate for SARS-CoV-2-Mpro (135±6 min-1) is almost 5 times faster than SARS-CoV Mpro (30±2
min-1) with our substrate Abz-SVTLQSG-TyrNO2R (Table 1). With this FRET substrate, we
demonstrate a higher catalytic efficiency with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (1.8±0.4 min-1µM-1) compared
to SARS-CoV Mpro (0.6±0.2 min-1µM-1). This finding is in contrast to recent reports where no
differences were observed in the catalytic efficiency between SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2
Mpro using a different substrate: 3011±294 s-1M-1 (0.18±0.02 min-1µM-1) and 3426±416.9 s-1M-1
(0.2±0.03 min-1µM-1), respectively)13. It remains to be determined whether this influences the
virulence of SARS-CoV-2.

GC373 and GC376 are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture
To test the ability of GC373 and GC376 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, plaque reduction assays were
performed on infected Vero E6 cells in the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations
of either GC373 (Figure 4A) or GC376 (Figure 4B) for 48 hours. The results were plotted as a
percent inhibition of the number of plaque forming units per well. The EC50 for GC373 was 1.5
µM while the EC50 for GC376 was 0.92 µM. To examine cell cytotoxicity, ATP production was
measured using the CellTiter-Glo assay on either Vero E6 cells or A549 cells incubated in the
presence of the inhibitors for 24 hours. The CC50s of both GC373 and GC376 were greater than
200 µM. To further examine their antiviral activities, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on

supernatants from cells untreated, and GC373 (Figure 4C) or GC376 (Figure 4D) treated cell
cultures. It was observed that both GC373 and GC376 are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2
decreasing viral titers 3 logs, compared with a 2 log decrease in recently published results using
other aldehyde compounds16. These results indicate that both GC373 and GC376 are potent
inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 with a therapeutic index of >200.
Numerous drugs were designed originally to inhibit the SARS-CoV Mpro 3. However, the
SARS outbreak of 2002 was controlled by public health measures and these compounds were
never licensed. GC376 has been used to cure FIP in cats as the Mpro of FIP is effectively
inhibited by its breakdown product GC373. Analogs of these drugs also inhibited the MERS
CoV Mpro and blocked viral replication in cells at an EC50 of 0.5 µM12. Our studies show GC376
and GC373 to be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Clearly these drugs need to be
advanced quickly into human trials for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 and
is a virus with a significant mutation rate20. Also, in some patients the virus has persisted longer
than 2 months with some possibility of re-infection21 . Vaccines are critically important, but still
likely a year or more away as this virus will likely present vaccine challenges.
There are many clinical trials testing drugs repurposed from their original indications.
Remdesivir, a polymerase inhibitor developed as a treatment for Ebola virus22 is showing very
promising early results and will likely be confirmed in clinical trials23. Another drug designed to
inhibit RNA dependent RNA polymerase, including in coronaviruses, is EIDD 2801 (a N4hydroxycytidine triphosphate that is incorporated into viral RNA to promote errors in progeny
RNA). These examples of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for COVID-19 are critically
important24. Both GC373 and GC376 compounds are also DAAs designed specifically for
coronaviruses. It is likely that several very potent drugs will be required to treat SARS-CoV-2

and to prevent the evolution of resistance they may need to be used in combination. We believe
that GC373 and GC376 are candidate antivirals that should be accelerated into clinical trials for
COVID-19.

Synthesis of GC376
General Characterization Methods
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra was obtained using an Agilent VNMRS 700
MHz of Agilent/Varian VNMRS 500 MHz spectrometer. For 1H (700 and 500 MHz)
spectra, δ values were referenced to CDCl3 (7.26 ppm) or (CD3)2SO (2.50 ppm), and for
13C

(175 of 125 MHz) spectra, δ values were referenced to CDCl3 (77.16 ppm), CD3OD

or (CD3)2SO (39.52 ppm) as the solvents. Infrared spectras (IR) were recorded on a
Nicolet Magna 750 or a 20SX FT-IR spectrometer. Cast film refers to the evaporation of
a solution on an IR plate. Mass spectra were recorded on a ZabSpec IsoMass VG (high
resolution electrospray ionization (ESI)). LC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent
Technologies 6220 orthogonal acceleration TOF instrument equipped with +ve and –ve
ion ESI ionization, and full-scan MS (high-resolution analysis) with two-point lock mass
correction operating mode. The instrument inlet was an Agilent Technologies 1200 SL
HPLC system.

Reagents and Solvents
All commercially available reagents and protected amino acids were purchased and
used without further purification unless otherwise noted. All the solvents used for
reactions were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Dry solvents
refer to solvents freshly distilled over appropriate drying reagents prior to use.
Commercially available ACS grade solvents (> 99.0% purity) were used for column
chromatography without any further purification.

Purificaton
All reactions and fractions from column chromatography were monitored by thin layer
chromatography (TLC) using glass plates (5 × 2.5 cm) pre-coated (0.25 mm) with silica
gel (normal SiO2, Merck 60 F254). Visualization of TLC plates was performed by UV
fluorescence at 254 nm in addition to staining by KMnO4. Flash chromatography was
performed using Merck type 60, 230-400 mesh silica gel at elevated pressures.

This known compound was synthesized based on a literature procedure1. L-Glutamic
acid (30.00 g, 202.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added to a flame-dried RBF under Ar,
followed by the addition of dry MeOH (506.0 mL). The stirred suspension was then
cooled to 0 ºC, and TMSCl (113.1 mL, 891.7 mmol, 4.4 equiv) was added slowly over
15 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1.5 h, and then stirred overnight
at rt. Triethylamine (182.5 mL, 1316 mmol, 6.5 equiv) was added to the reaction mixture
slowly over 15 minutes. Next, Boc2O (48.62 g, 222.3 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added in one
portion, and then the reaction mixture was capped with pressure-equalizing Ar and
stirred at rt for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure
to produce a white solid. The solid was triturated by suspension in Et2O (500 mL), and
collected by filtration. The solid was washed with additional volumes of Et2O (3 × 250
mL), and then concentrated in vacuo to produce a crude oil. The crude product was
purified using silica column chromatography (50% EtOAc in hexanes), and yielded a
clear, yellow oil (50.44 g, 183.2 mmol, 91%): Rf = 0.61 on SiO2, 50% EtOAc in hexanes;

(1.00 g, 3.62 mmol, 1.00 equiv) was deposited in a flame-dried RBF under argon, to
which 10.34 mL of freshly distilled THF was added. The oily starting material was
dissolved at rt before LiHMDS (1.0 M in THF, 7.82 mL, 7.82 mmol, 2.16 equiv) was
added over a period of 2 min at –78°C. The reaction mixture went from clear and nearly
colourless to light yellow, and was allowed to stir at –78 °C for 1 h. Next BrCH2CN
(0.270 mL, 3.88 mmol, 1.07 equiv) was slowly added over a period of 1 h (addition rate
of ca. 0.02 mL / 5 min), while maintaining reaction temperature at –78 °C. The reaction
mixture was then stirred at –78 °C over a period of 2 h. After 2 h, some starting material

remained but the reaction mixture was quenched by addition of 5.2 mL of HCl at –78 °C.
The reaction mixture was then removed from the cooling bath to allow the ice in the
flask to melt, stirring for 50 min. The mixture was then extracted with EtOAc (3x). The
combined EtOAc layers were washed with H2O (2x) and brine (1x). Drying over MgSO4
and concentration by rotovap furnishes a dark brown oil. This oil was then dissolved in
5.0 mL of DCM, to which activated charcoal (0.35 g) and silica (1.40 g) was added. The
slurry was spun on a rotovap without heat or vacuum for 1 h. Afterwards, the charcoal
and silica was filtered through a celite pad and the filtride washed with additional
volumes of DCM. Concentration of the filtrate furnishes a yellow oil. This oil was then
transferred to a flame-dried RBF under argon, to which CoCl2•6H2O (0.290 g, 1.22
mmol, 0.67 equiv) was added. The material was then dissolved in 20.0 mL of freshly
distilled MeOH. The solution was then cooled to 0 °C and NaBH4 (0.462 g, 12.20 mmol,
6.74 equiv) was added in multiple portions over a period of 30 min. Upon addition of
NaBH4, the reaction mixture immediately turned black and started bubbling. Once
addition was finished and bubbling slowed, the reaction mixture was capped under a
blanket of pressure-equalizing argon, removed from the ice bath, and allowed to warm
to rt, stirring for 24 h. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated on the rotovap
to a minimal volume. To the obtained residue was then added 1 M of citric acid at 0 °C.
The mixture was further diluted with EtOAc and extracted with EtOAc (3x). The
combined EtOAc layers were then washed with sat. NaHCO3 (2x) and brine (1x). Drying
over Na2SO4 and removal of solvent furnishes a very pale yellow oil as crude. This
material was then purified via flash column chromatography using an eluent system of
EtOAc. Elution of product was monitored by KMnO4 staining (Rf = 0.16, EtOAc).

co-evaporated with DCM (5x). In a separate flame-dried RBF under argon was
deposited Cbz-Leu-OH (90% purity, 4.12 g, 13.97 mmol, 1.0 equiv), HATU (5.31 g,
13.97 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The material was then dissolved in 70 mL of DMF. Next, HOAT
(0.6 M in DMF, 2.33 mL, 1.40 mmol, 0.1 equiv) was added, followed by DIPEA (7.30
mL, 41.91 mmol, 3.0 equiv). The reaction mixture turned bright yellow and was
incubated for 5 min. The previously concentrated Boc-deprotected material was then
dissolved in 70 mL of DCM and added dropwise to the incubating solution, with the
bright yellow colour quickly fading. The reaction mixture was the capped under a
blanket of argon and allowed to react at rt for 1.5 h. Next, the reaction mixture was
diluted with H2O and EtOAc. The layers were separated and the H2O layer was further
extracted with EtOAc (3x). The combined EtOAc layers were then washed with sat.
NaHCO3 (2x), 1 M HCl (2x), and brine (1x). Drying over Na2SO4 and concentrating on
the rotovap furnishes a crude yellow oil. This material was used without further
purification but may be purified by flash column chromatography over silica, using an
eluent system of pure EtOAc. Product elution was monitored by TLC and KMnO4
staining (Rf = 0.43, 5/95 MeOH/EtOAc), and concentration of product fractions furnishes
a transparent, slightly yellow oil as the desired product (6.056 g, 13.97 mmol, 100%).

This compound was synthesized based on a literature procedure2. (3) (0.167 g, 0.385
mmol, 1.0 equiv) was deposited in a flame-dried round bottom flask under argon and
dissolved in 2.31 mL of dry THF. To the RM was then added LiBH4 (2.0 M in THF, 0.578
mL, 1.156 mmol, 3.0 equiv) dropwise. Addition causes RM to turn bright yellow in
colour. Continued addition eventually results in fading of yellow colour. Gas evolution
occurred. After gas evolution ceased, 1.16 mL of dry MeOH was added dropwise. This
was followed by a second gas evolution event. RM was allowed to stir at rt for 1.5 h

until pH 1—2. The reaction mixture was then concentrated on rotovap and the resulting
residue was dissolved in EtOAc and brine. The layers were separated and the EtOAc
layer was dried over Na2SO4. Concentration and co-evaporation with Et2O furnishes a

This compound was synthesized based on a literature procedure2. (4) (0.319 g, 0.786
mmol, 1.0 equiv) was dissolved in dry DCM under argon. Dess—Martin periodinane
(0.500 g, 1.179 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was then added at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was
capped under a blanket of argon and allowed to warm to rt. The reaction was then
allowed to stir at rt for 3h. Reaction mixture was then quenched with the addition of 3
mL of 10% Na2S2O3 followed with stirring for 15 min. The layers were then separated
and the DCM layer was washed sequentially with 10% Na2S2O3 (1 x 3 mL), sat.
NaHCO3 (2 x 3 mL), H2O (2 x 3 mL), and brine (2 x 3 mL). The DCM layer was then
dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to furnish a yellow residue. The TLC of this crude
is very messy (extensive streaking) but the product was successfully purified via flash
column chromatography on silica using an eluent system of 2.5/97.5 MeOH/EtOAc.
Elution of product was monitored by TLC and KMnO4 staining (Rf = 0.14, 2.5/97.5
MeOH/EtOAc). Concentration of product fractions furnishes an oil that solidifies to a
yellow foam upon co-evaporation with Et2O (0.206 g, 0.511 mmol, 65%).

This compound was synthesized based on a literature procedure2. GC373 (0.030 g,
0.074 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was deposited in a vial and dissolved in 0.296 mL of dry EtOAc
and 0.178 mL of absolute EtOH. To this was added 1 M NaHSO3 (0.074 mL, 0.074
mmol, 1.0 equiv). The reaction vessel was then capped and stirred at 50 °C for 3 h.
Afterwards, the mixture was filtered to remove solids and the solids were thoroughly
washed with additional volumes of EtOH. The combined washings were dried over
Na2SO4 and filtered again. Concentration of the filtrate furnishes a yellow oil. To this oil
was added 0.5 mL of Et2O, causing a white solid to crash out after mixing. The mixture
was then centrifuged and the Et2O was removed. This step was repeated once more.
The resultant white solid was then treated with Et2O (0.444 mL) and EtOAc (0.222 mL).
Mixing for 5 min followed by centrifuge and removal of solvent furnishes the white
bisulfite adduct as the product. The material was dried on hi-vac overnight to remove
residual solvent (0.018 g, 0.037 mmol, 50%). A check by LCMS shows the desired
adduct as the major product (0.255 g, 0.050 mmol, 68%) and was used without further
purification.

FRET Substrate Peptide Synthesis
General 2-Chlorotrityl Chloride Resin Loading Procedure
2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin was transferred to a SPPS vessel and washed with
dry CH2Cl2 (2 × 10 mL) and then dry DMF (2 × 10 mL) for one min each, and then
bubbled under Ar in dry DMF (10 mL) for 10 min. The desired Fmoc-protected amino
acid (1.0 equiv, based on desired resin loading) and DIPEA (5.0 equiv) were suspended
in 10 mL of a 50/50 mixture of dry CH2Cl2/DMF. This solution was bubbled under Ar for
2.5 h to load the desired amino acid onto the solid support, continually topping up the
CH2Cl2 to maintain an approximately 10 mL volume. To end cap any remaining trityl
groups, dry MeOH was added to the vessel (0.8 mL per gram of resin) and bubbled
under Ar for 15 minutes. After draining, the resin was washed with dry DMF (3 × 10 mL),
dry CH2Cl2 (3 × 10 mL), and then with dry MeOH (3 × 10 mL) for one min each. The
resin was dried thoroughly and then stored at –20 °C under Ar.

General Automated SPPS Elongation Method
All peptides were synthesized on a PreludeX (Gyros protein technologies). SPPS
was carried out on a 0.1 mmol scale using Fmoc chemistry on 2-chlorotrityl resin (0.8
mmol/g). Commercially available Fmoc-protected amino acids were loaded on the

peptide synthesizer as 0.2 M solutions in DMF. All amino acids were coupled using 1[Bis(dimethylamino)-methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium3-oxid

hexafluoro-

phosphate (HATU) as the activating agent with a coupling time of 1 h. Fmoc residues
were deprotected using a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF.

General Method for Cleavage of Peptide from Resin
Resin-bound analogue was suspended in 95/2.5/2.5 TFA/TIPS/H2O with shaking
for 2-3 h. The resin was removed via filtration through glass wool, rinsed with TFA, and
the solution concentrated in vacuo. Cold diethyl ether (2 × 5 mL) was added to triturate
the crude residue. The diethyl ether was decanted and briefly centrifuged for 3 minutes
at 13000 rpm to pellet any residual peptide. The ether was removed and the peptide
pellet was then dried thoroughly by centrifugation in a vacuum centrifuge for 5 minutes.
The pellet and triturated crude residue were pooled together and dissolved in 0.1%
aqueous TFA.

HPLC Purification Method
The FRET peptide substrate was purified using a C18 RP-HPLC column with
aqueous 0.1% TFA (solvent A) and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (solvent B) as eluents. The
analytical purification method used was: 0 – 3 min 10% B, 3 – 4.5 min 10% – 25% B,
4.5 – 14.5 min 25% – 40% B, 14.5 – 17 min 40% – 90% B, 17 – 19.5 min 95% B, 19.5 –
20.5 min 95% – 10% B, 20.5 – 30 min 10% B.

Synthesis of FRET Peptide Substrate
Fmoc-L-Arg(Pmc)-OH was loaded onto 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin (0.18 mmol/g)
using the aforementioned general procedure. The resin was elongated using automated
SPPS, introducing amino acids in the following order: Fmoc-Tyr(NO2)-OH, Fmoc-GlyOH,

Fmoc-Ser(OtBu)-OH,

Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH,

Fmoc-Leu-OH,

Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH,

Fmoc-Val-OH, Fmoc-Ser(OtBu)-OH, and Boc-Abz-OH with the final N-terminal Boc
group being left on the peptide. The peptide was then cleaved off the resin using the
aforementioned procedure, and purified using a Vydac Si C18 RP-HPLC semipreparative column (300 Å, 5 µM, 10 × 250 mm) and HPLC method A, with the desired
peptide eluting at 16.2 minutes. The HPLC fractions were pooled and lyophilized to
produce the peptide as a yellow powder. The peptide was analyzed using HRMS (ESI)
calcd for C50H77N15O18 [M + 2H]2+ 587.7780, found 587.7781.

Cloning, Expression and Purification of SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
DNA encoding the main protease Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from
BioBasic Inc. (Ontario, Canada) and codon optimized for expression in Escherichia coli.
The gene was cloned into the pET SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) expression
vector (Invitrogen). Clones were sequenced to ensure that the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein
was in frame with the His-tagged SUMO fusion protein. The resulting plasmid was
transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and the E. coli transformant was grown in Luria
Broth, Miller at 37 °C with shaking (220 rpm) to an OD600 of 0.6-0.7 using kanamycin (50
μg/mL) as selective pressure. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by the
addition of 0.5 mM IPTG to the cell culture and the culture was grown for an additional

4-5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 g for 10 min at 4 °C) and
suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl). Cells were lysed by
sonication on ice and the lysate was centrifuged (17000 g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove
cellular debris. The supernatant was isolated and, after adding imidazole (5 mM), mixed
with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The mixture was loaded on a fritted column and allowed to
flow by gravity at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of lysis
buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The fusion protein was eluted using 2 CV of lysis
buffer containing increased concentrations of imidazole (40, 60, 80, 100, 200 and 500
mM). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those that contained the fusion
protein were pooled together, dialyzed against lysis buffer containing 1 mM DTT at 4 °C
and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore) with a MWCO of 10 kDa. The
fusion protein was digested by His-tagged SUMO protease (McLab, South San
Francisco, CA) at 4 °C for 1-2 h to remove the SUMO tag. The cleavage mixture was
added to Ni-NTA resin and loaded on a fritted column. The flow through containing
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
protein was further purified using size exclusion chromatography (G-100, GE
Healthcare, 1 ml/min flow rate, 4°C) in 20 mM Tris, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.8.
Immunoglobulin G, 166 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; and
lysozyme, 15kDa were used as calibration standards. Fractions containing the SARSCoV-2 Mpro protein were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 filter with a
MWCO of 10 kDa. In addition, a sample of the fusion protein SUMO-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
was also purified using size exclusion chromatography and concentrated as described
above. The plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV Mpro with an N-terminal His-tag upstream

of an FactorX cleavage site was the kind gift of Dr. Michael James, which was
expressed a purified according to previous protocols3.

Mass Spectrometry of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
The mass of the free SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was confirmed by HR-MALDI on a
MALDI-TOF (Bruker Ultrafelxtreme, Bruker Daltronics, USA) and LC-MS on an ESI-TOF
instrument (Agilent Technologies 6220, California, USA) using electrospray ionization.

Enzyme Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpro
A synthesized fluorescent substrate containing the cleavage site (indicated by
the arrow, ↓) of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (2-Abz-SVTLQ↓SG-Tyr(NO2)-R-NH2) was used for
the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cleavage assay4. The
protease reactions of both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro towards fluorescent
substrate was performed in activity buffer (20 mM Bis Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT) at 37 °C
for 10 min. The final concentration of proteases used in the assay was fixed at 80 nM
and the concentrations of the substrate were varied from 0.1 to 500 μM. Reaction was
started with the enzyme and the fluorescence signal of the Abz-SVTLQ peptide
cleavage product was monitored at an emission wavelength of 420 nm with excitation at
320 nm, using an Flx800 fluorescence spectrophotometer (BioTek). Before kinetic
calculations, it was verified that the proportionality between the fluorescence emitted
and the amount of the substrate used in the assay was linear. The minimal
concentration of the enzyme and time of reaction that gave a linear dependence of

amount of generated product with time was chosen. Initial velocities in corresponding
relative fluorescence units per unit of time (ΔRFU/s) were converted to the amount of
the cleaved substrate per unit of time (μM/s) by fitting to the calibration curve of free
Aminobenzoyl-SVTLQ. All data are corrected for inner filter effects by an adopted
literature protocol. In short, the fluorescence signal (RFU) at each substrate
concentration was determined and defined as f(FRET). Then, 5uL free AminobenzoylSVTLQ at final 5uM was added to each concentration and fluorescence was taken
f(FRET+ Aminobenzoyl-SVTLQ). Simultaneously, a reference reading was taken with
the same free Aminobenzoyl-SVTLQ concentration and defined as f(ref). The inner-filter
correction was obtained as:
corr% = (f (FRET + Aminobenzoyl-SVTLQ) – f (FRET)) / f (ref) x 100%
The corrected initial velocity of the reaction was calculated as
V = Vo / (corr%).
Vo represents the initial velocity of each reaction.

Kinetic constants (vmax and Km) were derived by fitting the corrected initial velocity
to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v = vmax × [S] / (Km + [S]) using GraphPad Prism 6.0
software. kcat/Km was calculated according to the equation, kcat/Km = vmax / ([E] x Km).
Triplicate experiments were performed for each data point, and the value was presented
as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

Inhibition parameters
Stock solutions of GC373 and GC376 were prepared with 10% aqueous DMSO.
For the determination of the IC50, 80 mM of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was incubated with
GC373 or GC376 at various concentrations from 0 to 100 μM in 20 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.8,
1 mM DTT at 37°C for 10 min. The protease reaction was started by addition of 100μM
of the substrate. The GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad) was used for the
calculation of the IC50 values. Both inhibitors were tested for non-specific binding by
performing a reference titration in the absence of DTT showing no influence in the
obtained fluorescence readings (data not shown).

Crystallization and Structural Determination
Crystallization
For crystallization, purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was dialysed against buffer
containing 10 mM NaCl and 5mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 overnight at 4 °C, and concentrated
with a Millipore centrifugal filter (30 kDa MW cutoff) to a concentration of 9 mg/mL.
Protein was incubated with 5 molar excess of inhibitor at 4 °C for 2 h prior to
crystallization. For SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, the protein was subjected to the PACT
crystallization screen (Molecular Dimensions), with hits identified in several conditions
for both inhibitors. Best crystals were observed with hanging drop trays at room
temperature at a ratio of 1:1 with mother liquor 0.2 M Sodium sulfate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris
propane pH 6.5, 20 % w/v PEG 3350. While the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with ligands

% w/v PEG 6000. Prior to freezing, crystals were incubated with 15% glycerol as a
cryoprotectant. Crystals were initially screened on our 007 MicroMax (Rigaku Inc) home
source with final data collection at SSRL, beamline 12-2.

Diffraction Data Collection, Phase Determination, Model Building, and Refinement
All diffraction data sets were collected using synchrotron radiation of wavelength
0.97946 Å at beamline 12-2 of Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL)
California, USA, using a Dectris PILATUS 6M detector. Several data sets were collected
from the crystals of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro free enzyme as well as with GC376 and GC373
treated. XDS5 and Scala were used for processing the datasets. The diffraction dataset
of the free SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was processed at a resolution of 1.75 Å, in space group
P21 (Table S1). For the complex of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC376 and GC373, the
dataset collected, was processed at a resolution of 1.9 Å and 2.0 Å and in space group
C2 (Table S1). All three structures were determined by molecular replacement with the
crystal structure of the free enzyme of the SARS-CoV2 Mpro (PDB entry 6Y7M as search
model, using the Phaser program from Phenix. Ligand Fit from Phenix was employed
for the fitting of both inhibitors in the density of pre-calculated map from Phenix
refinement, using the ligand code K36. Refinement of the three structures was
performed with phenix.refine in Phenix software. Statistics of diffraction, data processing
and model refinement are given in (Table S1).

NMR Samples
NMR samples were first prepared by dialyzing SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme to
exchange buffers (target buffer: D2O, 50 mM phosphate, pD 7.5 with 20 mM DTT) by
spin filtration (Amicon micro-spinfilter, 10 kDa cutoff). A 50 µL solution of 2.6 mg/mL
enzyme was added to the spin filter and diluted to 300 µL, then spun at 6600 g for 18
min. This was repeated an additional 2 times, and the sample was then made up to 300
µL in volume and transferred to the NMR tube. Samples of enzyme in the presence of
inhibitor were prepared by administering an additional 1.5 µL of

13C

labelled GC373

solution (20 mM in DMSO) to the aforementioned enzyme sample. Sample data was
acquired in 5 mm Varian specific D2O susceptibility matched microcell (i.e. BMS-00V)
Shigemi NMR tubes purchased from Wilmad Lab-glass Inc. All NMR solvents were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich. NMR tubes were washed between runs using 5 rinses
of D2O, and then inverted to air dry overnight.
Small volume additions (e.g. inhibitor added to enzyme) to samples in Shigemi
NMR tubes were done by adding to the top of the outer NMR tube with the inner plunger
removed, and then carefully tapping the sample tube in an almost horizontal position
while rotating to break the surface tension and allow sample liquid to flow up the tube.
The sample volume was allowed to travel up until making contact with the additional
material. The tube was then repeatedly whipped downward to move the material to the
bottom. This was repeated several times so that additions were rinsed down into the
microcell ensuring proper mixing.

NMR experiments were collected at 16.45 T (i.e. 700 MHz) using a 4-channel
‘VNMRS’ (Varian/Agilent) NMR spectrometer (VNMRJ 4.2 patch110 software) with an
Agilent 7620 automatic sample handling system. A 5mm triple resonance cryogenically
cooled (20 K) 1H direct-detection (i.e. with

13C15N

on the outer coil) probe was utilized

for all experiments. The probe had cooled preamplifiers on the 1H and 13C detection
channels. The sample temperature was calibrated to 27°C using methanol6.
All spectra were run “locked” on the 2H resonance signal and chemical shifts
were referenced using the residual proton 1HOD signal position7 (i.e. 4.7 ppm) prior to
saturation. One dimensional 1H data were acquired using presaturation8,9 for residual
1HOD

solvent suppression, followed by a 90° excitation pulse and data acquisition. The

saturation carrier position amplitude were manually optimized using a position sweep
array and based on the calibrated high-power pulse, respectively. Saturation was
applied directly on the water resonance (i.e. depending on water suppression efficacy
and the ability to avoid analog to digital and/or receiver overloads with sufficient gain for
data acquisition). The saturation was applied with a gammaB1 induced field strength of
~80 Hz10, and a duration of 2 seconds. The 90° pulse width was determined after tuning
and matching each sample, using one-pulse nutation optimization11. Other specific 1D
acquisition parameter settings were: sweep width of 14044 Hz, acquisition time 2.5
seconds, with 70224 total (i.e. real plus imaginary) data points.
A gradient-selected phase-sensitive two dimensional 1H,13C-heteronuclear single
quantum correlation (HSQC)12–14 with adiabatic inversion, refocusing and decoupling
13C

pulses (i.e. gHSQCAD Varian/Agilent “ChemPack”, Krish Krishnamurthy) was used

for all experiments. The HSQC spectra were acquired with 1H and 13C sweep widths

(and recorded points) of 8389 Hz (~12 ppm) and 38722 Hz (220 ppm), respectively
(1678 total directly detected and 32 complex indirectly detected points, also
respectively). A gradient stabilization delay of 500 µs was used and 146 Hz JHC applied
for INEPT transfers. Adiabatic inversion/recovery 13C pulses were applied at a 13.1 kHz
induced field with a 600 us duration covering ~400 ppm. Adiabatic decoupling was
applied at ~2.6 kHz induced field during the entire 100ms acquisition period. Carbon
chemical shift referencing and carrier position (100 ppm) was based on indirect IUPAC
1H

referencing15. The carbon carrier position was moved (e.g. 80, 90, or 100 ppm) to

eliminate the possibility of peaks of interest near the carrier position being artifactual
(i.e. quadrature “glitch”).
For processing of NMR data, all dimensions were zero-filled to twice the number
of acquired points. A line-broadening apodization function of 0.25 Hz was applied for
1H-1D

spectra while a π/2 squared sine-bell weighting function was utilized for the 2D-

HSQC (both dimensions). No linear prediction was applied nor was non-linear/nonuniform data acquisition utilized to avoid any possible artifacts in the resulting data. The
final spectra were manually phased and baseline corrected.

Determination of EC50 by Plaque Assay
SARS-CoV-2/CANADA/VIDO 01/2020 was a kind gift from Darryl Falzarano
(University of Saskatchewan). Vero (Female green monkey kidney) E6 cells were
infected with an MOI of .0001 pfu/cell in infection medium consisting of DMEM
supplemented with 1x non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES, 2% fetal
bovine serum, 50 IU/mL penicillin, 50 IU/mL streptomycin different doses of antiviral
drugs. After 1h, the infecting medium was removed and monolayers were overlaid with
MEM supplemented with 10mM HEPES and 1.2% Avicel RC-591 (DuPont). After 48 h,
cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and stained using 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet.
Plaques were counted and data was plotted as % inhibition vs the log10[drug] using
Prism (GraphPad). EC50’s were determined using a non-linear regression analysis.
Experiments were done in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviation.

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA in Cell Culture Supernatants by
qRT-PCR
Cell supernatants (140 µL) were collected at various points after infection, and
RNA was isolated using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit as per manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out on 2 µL using Superscript IV Vilo
master mix (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was carried out using 2 µL of cDNA in
TaqMan Fast Master mix using primers and probe for the N gene (N2 primers) designed
by the United States center for disease control and prevention (IDT cat#10006606). A
standard curve was generated using dilutions of positive control standards from CDC
(IDT cat # 10006625).

Measuring Cytotoxicity in A549 and Vero E6 cells
Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability
assay (Promega). Either A549 (male human lung epithelial) cells or VeroE6 cells were
seeded at 5x103 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated overnight before treatment.
Compounds GC373 and GC376 were solubilized in DMSO and added to cells in an
eight-point four-fold serial dilution (200 µM to 0.0122 µM). Cells were incubated in the
presence of compounds for 24 hours before addition of the luminescence substrate and
measurement of ATP activity according to manufacturer’s instructions. The percentage
of viable cells was calculated relative to cells treated with solvent alone (0.5% DMSO).
Results were plotted as the mean of three independent experiments ±SD, where each
experiment consisted of quadruplicate wells per concentration of compound.
