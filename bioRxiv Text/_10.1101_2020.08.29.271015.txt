ABSTRACT
Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the COVID19 pandemic, remains viable and therefore potentially infectious on several materials. One strategy to
discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface
chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine
fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and
viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while
mammalian cells would remain unaffected.
Materials
SARS-CoV-2 virions (2x104 PFU/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v)
of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively.
Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48
hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was
quantitated by plaque assay.
Results
Vero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10
minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w/v). However, the
SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in
viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure.
Conclusions
Si3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The
viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure. Surface
treatment strategies based on Si3N4 may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and
infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.

1. INTRODUCTION.
The spread of viruses through contaminated surfaces is of concern in crowded indoor environments such
as schools, nursing homes, hospitals, and day-care centers.1 In addition to the aerosol transmission of
respiratory viruses due to sneezing, coughing, and talking, evidence suggests that contaminated hands and
fomites also play a significant role in the person-to-person proliferation of disease.2 The global spread of
COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2, has rekindled interest in
the role of contaminated surfaces in viral transmission.
Viruses can survive for long periods on a variety of surfaces. Rotavirus is the agent that causes acute
diarrhea in pediatric patients. In fecal samples, rotavirus particles are stable even after 2½ months of
storage at temperatures above 30°C, with even longer survival times at lower temperatures.3 The 2002
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China was caused by SARS-CoV;4, 5 a virus that
is infective for up to 9 days in suspension, and 6 days in the dried state.6 The pathogenic coronavirus
HuCoV-229E causes upper respiratory infections in humans; at room temperature, this virus can persist
for up to 5 days on surfaces ranging from glass to stainless steel.7 A recent report has shown survival times
of 4 to 72 hours of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic, copper, and cardboard surfaces, and up to 7 days on surgical
masks.8
Surface decontamination by disinfectant application,9 or by irradiation,10, 11 can control fomite-induced
viral spread. Some materials, notably metals such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), and silver (Ag)
have also been shown to rapidly inactivate viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.7, 12, 13 Incorporation of Cu
alloy surfaces in health care facilities reduces the microbial burden and the incidence of nosocomial
infections.14–16 Quaternary ammonium compounds such as ammonium chloride are also capable of
inactivating viruses by deactivating the protective lipid coating that envelopes viruses like SARS-CoV-2
rely on; these compounds are used as disinfectants to clean surfaces and remove persistent viral particles.17
Silicon nitride (Si3N4) is a non-oxide ceramic that is FDA-cleared for use in implantable spinal fusion
devices; clinical data have shown excellent long-term outcomes in both lumbar and cervical fusion with
Si3N4 when compared to other spine biomaterials such as bone grafts, titanium, and
polyetheretherketone.18–23 In aqueous environments, Si3N4 spine implants undergo surface hydrolysis,
resulting in the microscopic elution of ammonia which is converted into ammonium, nitrous oxide, and
other reactive nitrogen species that inhibit bacterial growth and proliferation.24 This inherent resistance to
bacterial colonization may explain the lower incidence of bacterial infection with Si3N4 spinal implants
(< 0.006%) when compared to other spine biomaterials (2.7% to 18%).25
Similar to bacterial inhibition, viral exposure to an aqueous solution of Si3N4 particles inactivated H1N1
(Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934), Enterovirus (EV-A71), and Feline calicivirus.26 Recent findings have
shown that Si3N4 particles in aqueous suspensions also inactivated SARS-CoV-2 with antiviral activity
that compared favorably to Cu ions. Unlike Si3N4, Cu exhibited toxicity to mammalian cells.12 The present
study hypothesized that exposure to Si3N4 would not elicit a toxic response from mammalian cells under
experimental conditions while demonstrating a time- and dose-dependent inactivation of SARS-CoV-2.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS.
2.1. Preparation of Si3N4 powder.
A doped Si3N4 powder (SINTX Technologies, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT USA) with a nominal composition
of 90 wt.% α-Si3N4, 6 wt.% yttria (Y2O3), and 4 wt.% alumina (Al2O3) was prepared by aqueous mixing
and spray-drying of the inorganic constituents, followed by sintering of the spray-dried granules (~1700°C
for ~3 h), hot-isostatic pressing (~1600°C, 2 h, 140 MPa in N2 ), aqueous-based comminution, and freezedrying.27 The resulting powder had a trimodal distribution with an average particle size of 0.8 ± 1.0 µm
as shown in Figure 1. Doping Si3N4 with Y2O3 and Al2O3 is essential to densify the ceramic and convert
it from its α- to ß-phase during sintering. The mechanism of densification is via dissolution of α-phase
and subsequent precipitation of ß-phase grains facilitated by the formation of a transient intergranular
liquid that solidifies during cooling. ß-Si3N4 is therefore a composite composed of about 10 wt.%
intergranular glass phase (IGP) and 90 wt.% crystalline ß-Si3N4 grains.

2.2. Cell culture and viral stocks.
Vero green African monkey kidney epithelial cells (ATCC, Cat #CCL-81) were chosen for this analysis
due to their ability to support high levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication and their use in antiviral testing.28,
29
These cells were cultured in DMEM (VWR, Cat # 10128-206) supplemented with 10% FBS (VWR Cat
# 97068-085), 1% L-glutamine (VWR Cat # 45000-676), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (VWR Cat #
45000-652). Cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 was
obtained from BEI Resources (Cat #NR-52281). Vero cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.1)
to generate viral stocks. Cell-free supernatants were collected at 72 hours post-infection and clarified via

centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes and filtered through a 0.2 µm filter (Pall, Cat # 4433). Stock
virus was titered according to the plaque assay protocol detailed below.
2.3. Cell viability assays.
The Si3N4 powder was suspended in 1 mL DMEM growth media in microcentrifuge tubes. Tubes were
vortexed for 30 seconds to ensure adequate contact and then placed on a tube revolver for either 1, 5, or
10 minutes. At each time point, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and
filtered through a 0.2 µm filter. Clarified supernatants were added to cells for either 24 or 48 hours.
Untreated cells were maintained alongside as controls. Cells were tested at each time point using CellTiter
Glo (Promega, Cat #G7570), which measures ATP production, to determine cell viability.
2.4. Antiviral activity testing.
SARS-CoV-2 was diluted in DMEM growth media to a concentration of 2 x 104 PFU/mL. Four mL of the
diluted virus was added to tubes containing silicon nitride at 20, 15, 10, and 5% (w/v). The virus without
Si3N4 was processed in parallel as a control. Tubes were vortexed for 30 seconds to ensure adequate
contact and then placed on a tube revolver for either 1, 5, or 10 minutes, while a virus only control was
incubated for the maximum 10 minutes. At each time point, the samples were centrifuged, and the
supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.2 µm filter. The remaining infectious virus in the
clarified supernatant was quantitated by plaque assay. An overview of the antiviral testing method is
provided in Figure 2.
2.5. SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay.
Vero cells were plated at 2 x 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate on the day before the plaque assay. Clarified
supernatants from the antiviral testing were serially diluted (10-fold) and 200 µL was added to Vero cells
which were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO2. Plates were rocked every 15 minutes to ensure adequate
coverage and at 1 hour, a 1:1 ratio of 0.6% agarose and 2X EMEM (VWR, Cat # 10128-758) supplemented
with 5% FBS, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids (VWR, Cat # 45000-700), 1%
sodium pyruvate (VWR, Cat # 45000-710), and 1% L-glutamine was added to the cells before incubating
for 48 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained
with 2% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for counting.
3. RESULTS
3.1. No toxicity of Si3N4 to Vero cells up to 20 wt.%/vol.
The impact of Si3N4 on eukaryotic cell viability was tested. Si3N4 was resuspended in cell culture media
at 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v). Samples were collected at 1, 5, and 10 minutes and added to Vero cells. Vero
cell viability was measured at 24 and 48 hours post-exposure (Figure 3A and 3B). No significant decrease
in cell viability was observed at either 24 or 48 hours post-exposure with 5%, 10%, or 15% silicon nitride.
A small impact on cell viability (~10% decrease) was observed at 48 hours in cells exposed to 20% Si3N4.
Interestingly, a ~10% increase in Vero cell viability was observed at 48 hours with the 5% - 10 minute
and 10% - 10 minute samples (Figure 3B), suggesting that Si3N4 may be stimulating cell growth or cellular
metabolism under these conditions. These data indicate that Si3N4 has minimal impact on Vero cell health
and viability up to 20 wt.%/vol.

3.2. Si3N4 Inactivated SARS-CoV-2.
Given that 5, 10, 15, and 20% Si3N4 were non-toxic to Vero cells, antiviral testing at these concentrations
was performed. SARS-CoV-2 virions were exposed to Si3N4 at these concentrations for 1, 5, or 10
minutes. Following Si3N4 exposure, the infectious virus remaining in each solution was determined
through plaque assay. Virus processed in parallel but only exposed to cell culture media contained 4.2 x
103 PFU/mL. SARS-CoV-2 titers were reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4 tested
(Figures 4A and B). The inhibition was dose-dependent with SARS-CoV-2 exposed for 1 minute and 5%
Si3N4 having reduced viral titers by ~0.8 log10, 10% Si3N4 by ~1.2 log10, 15% Si3N4 by 1.4 log10, and 20%
Si3N4 by 1.7 log10 (Figure 4A). Similar results were observed with the 5 and 10 minute samples. This
reduction in viral titers corresponded to 85% viral inhibition at 5% Si3N4, 93% at 10% Si3N4, 96% at 15%
Si3N4, and 98% viral inhibition at 20% Si3N4 (Figure 4B). Higher Si3N4 concentrations for longer times
resulted in increased inhibition – leading to 99.6% viral inhibition at 20% Si3N4 and 10 minute exposure
(Figure 4B). These data indicate that Si3N4 has a strong antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2.
4. DISCUSSION
The remarkable finding in the present study is that a one-minute exposure to a 5% solution of Si3N4
resulted in 85% inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, while Vero cell viability was minimally impacted even after
a 48 hour exposure to a 20% concentration of the same material. This finding is consistent with previous
work showing that Si3N4 exerts a fortuitous dual effect, whereby the material can inactivate viruses12, 26
and inhibit bacterial biofilm formation29 without negatively impacting mammalian cell viability. The
present study is also consistent with a recent investigation that showed the rapid inactivation of SARSCoV-2 upon exposure to 15% (w/v) Si3N4,12 and related data showing that the antiviral effect of Si3N4
may be generally applicable to other single-strand RNA viruses such as Influenza A, Feline calicivirus,
and Enterovirus.26 Taken together, these studies suggest that Si3N4 may be a suitable material platform for
the development of fabrics for personal protective equipment such as masks, and also to manufacture
commonly-touched surfaces where viral persistence may encourage the spread of disease.
The antiviral effect of Si3N4 is related to several probable mechanisms that have been hypothesized
previously.12 One mechanism is the viral RNA fragmentation by reactive nitrogen species derived from a
slow and controlled elution of ammonia from the surface of Si3N4; and the subsequent formation of
ammonium, with the release of free electrons and negatively charged silanols in aqueous solution. Also,
as reported previously, the similarity between the protonated amino groups, Si–NH3+ at the surface of
Si3N4 and the N-terminal of lysine, C– NH3+ on the virus triggers a competitive binding that leads to
SARS-CoV-2 inactivation.12 An advantage of Si3N4 is that these phenomena reflect a sustained
mechanism of action secondary to a hydrolysis-mediated chemical equilibrium on the surface of the
material, rather than a reliance on repeated applications required of commonly-used disinfecting agents.
While the antiviral effectiveness of Si3N4 is comparable to Cu, a historically-recognized viricidal agent,
the use of Cu is limited by its cell toxicity.30 In contrast to Cu, ceramic implants made of Si3N4 that have
the same composition as the material used in this study have shown successful clinical and radiographic
outcomes even after three decades in the human body.31 An advantage of Si3N4 toward the potential
development of antiviral and antibacterial surfaces is the versatility of the material; thus sintered Si3N4
has been incorporated into polymers, bioactive glasses, and even other ceramics to create composites and
coatings that retain the favorable osteogenic and antibacterial properties of Si3N4.32–36

We recognize that this study has limitations; a powdered form of doped-Si3N4 was used, rather than the
monolithic material employed as spine implants. While this study demonstrates that this powdered form
of doped-Si3N4 is an effective antiviral agent, future studies will need to show that its viricidal efficacy is
retained when compounded into or coated onto other materials such as polymers, paints, metals, fabrics,
or ceramics. To be truly effective, the surface hydrolysis and release kinetics of ß-Si3N4’s moieties will
have to be optimized for each composite material and device. Additionally, further refinement of the
current composition of doped ß-Si3N4 may enhance its ability to release these moieties for the benefit of
mammalian cells and the destruction of pathogens. Studies are also needed to identify whether simple
physical contact with Si3N4 particles, or exposure to its soluble components, or both, are necessary for the
antipathogenic effects observed in the present study.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, Si3N4 proved harmless to mammalian cells, while demonstrating a time- and dosedependent inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. While Si3N4 is not suitable for ingestion or inhalation, its
antiviral activity, which is not limited to SARS-CoV-2, suggests that it may be a fortuitous platform to
engineer surfaces and personal protective equipment to discourage viral persistence, and thereby control
the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases.
