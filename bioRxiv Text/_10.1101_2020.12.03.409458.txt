Abstract: A novel disease, COVID-19, is sweeping the world since end of 2019. While in
many countries, the first wave is over, but the pandemic is going through its next phase with
a significantly higher infectability. COVID-19 is caused by the novel Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that seems to be more infectious than
any other previous human coronaviruses. To understand any unique traits of the virus that
facilitate its entry into the host, we compared the published structures of the viral spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 with other known coronaviruses to determine the possible
evolutionary pathway leading to the higher infectivity. The current report presents unique
information regarding the amino acid residues that were a) conserved to maintain the
binding with ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), and b) substituted to confer an
enhanced binding affinity and conformational flexibility to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
The present study provides novel insights into the evolutionary nature and molecular basis
of higher infectability and perhaps the virulence of SARS-CoV-2.
Keywords: COVID-19; SARS coronavirus; evolution & virulence; spike protein; sequence

1. Introduction
None of the recent outbreak like, SARS, HIV, Swine flu, could match the current pandemic
COVID-19 except perhaps the flu pandemic that occurred over 100 years ago (Ashour et al.,
2020). COVID-19 claimed around 54 million infections and over 1 million deaths globally
while writing this report (WHO, 2020). SARS-CoV-2, unlike many other viruses, can be
spread by asymptomatic individuals (Andersen et al., 2020; Ashour et al., 2020). Elucidating
the molecular and cellular bases of the viral infection would enhance the understanding of the
virulence of the virus.
Besides major damage to the respiratory system following SARS-CoV-2 infection, other
important associations of the disease are neurological defects (overtly loss of taste and
renal failure, coagulopathy and vascular disease along with many other conditions (Jin et al.,
2020; Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). A genome-wide association study linked an increased
susceptibility to the COVID-19 in patients with blood group A and in males (Zhao et al.,
2020). Among co-morbidities, hypertension and diabetes are the main concerns. In addition,
the virus itself presents some intrinsic yet unknown features to enhance its virulence like- a)
proof-reading mechanism(s) to protect itself from external adverse effects and agents; b) a
larger genome, thrice that of HCV and double that of influenza virus (Benvenuto et al.,
These along with many other molecular features of SARS-CoV-2 have made the specificity

and affinity of its spike protein, for ACE2 of the human host, significantly higher (Walls et
2020). The higher affinity, dynamic rearrangement, and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein for ACE2 are among the key factors that might have made the virus more
virulent (Yan et al., 2020). The pertinent question is how it acquired such potential and
precise machinery within a short span, following the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
that took place in 2003 and 2012. We, therefore, attempted to understand the evolution of
coronavirus of various kinds, with special emphasis on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 to determine cues on the evolutionary dynamics that have enhanced the
virulence and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We have analyzed the amino acid sequences of
Spike proteins of 45 relevant coronaviruses and the structural features of select ones to
understand the major differences that might explain the increased binding efficiency of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to human ACE2. The Spike proteins from coronaviruses
into two distinct fragments, S1 and S2. Fragment S1 is involved in recognition of host cell
surface receptors, and the fragment S2 is involved in generation of the pre-fusion complex.
Fragment S1 is comprised of two major domains- N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD)
domains (Li, 2016). Collectively, NTD and CTD are also known as the receptor binding
domain (RBD). The CTD interacts with molecules like ACE2 and CD26, in case of
SARS-CoV/CoV-2 and MERS/Bat-CoV, respectively. The NTD is known to recognize
sugar containing molecules and cell adhesion molecules (Li, 2016; Sun et al., 2020). The
physiological state of the Spike proteins is comprised of a homo-trimer with a central
three-fold symmetry with the three S1 fragments sitting atop the respective membrane
anchored S2 fragments (Figure 1A) (Li, 2016). We validated the protein structural data by
analyzing the differences in the coding nucleotide sequences. The results showed the
plausible mutations that act as the driving force in the natural selection of SARS-CoV-2.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Protein Sequence and Structure analysis
The sequences of 45 Coronavirus Spike proteins were retrieved from the SwissProt
database. The details of the sequences are presented in Table S1. The sequences were
aligned using Clustal Omega (Sievers and Higgins, 2014) and a maximum likelihood
phylogenetic tree was generated using the NEXUS algorithm (Giribet, 2005). The sequence
alignments were represented using Espript 3.0 (Gouet et al., 2005).
The 3-D structures of Spike Proteins (native proteins, Fragment S1- C-terminal
domains in complex with host receptors) from SARS-CoV-2 (IDs- 6VYB, 6M0J),
SARS-CoV (IDs- 5XLR, 3SCI), MERS-CoV (ID- 4L72), Bat Coronavirus HKU14 (ID4QZV) and Bovine Coronavirus (ID- 4H14) were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank.
Multiple structure alignments were performed at the POSA web server (Li et al., 2014) using
both flexible and rigid body algorithms. Two structure alignments were performed at the
FATCAT web server (Veeramalai et al., 2008) using both flexible and rigid body algorithms.
Complex of Fragment S1- C-terminal domains with the ACE2 binding domain were
generated using the ZDOCK web server (Pierce et al., 2014) and the complexes generated
were refined using the GalaxyRefineComplex web server (Heo et al., 2016). Interaction and
binding properties of Spike proteins’ C-terminal domains with host receptor proteins were
predicted using the PRODIGY web server (Xue et al., 2016). Surface area of interactions
between Spike proteins’ C-terminal domains with host receptor proteins were determined

using the InterProSurf (Negi et al., 2007) and the PISA (Baskaran et al., 2014) web servers.
In silico alanine scanning mutagenesis for the protein-protein complexes were performed at
the DrugScorePPI (Krüger and Gohlke, 2010), the SpotOn (Moreira et al., 2017) and the
mCSM-PPI2 web servers (Rodrigues et al., 2019). Pymol 2.3 was used for structural
visualizations (DeLano, 2020).
2.2 Nucleotide sequence analysis
45 nucleotide sequences of the coronavirus Spike proteins were retrieved from NCBI
nucleotide database. The details of the sequences are presented in Table S1. The sequences
were aligned using MEGA X software (Kumar et al., 2018) with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) as
the alignment algorithm using the default parameters . Post alignment, a distance matrix was
calculated from the aligned output followed by both neighbour joining (NJ) and unweighted
pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) methods. Following this, distance matrix
calculator for maximum Parsimony and Maximum likelihood analyses were performed. The
phylogenetic trees were generated using the R-package “ggtree” of Bioconductor including
the genera and host of the respective coronavirus (Yu et al., 2017). For maximum likelihood
we estimated the best model using the modelTest function from the “phangorn package”
(Posada and Crandall, 1998). GTR+G+I was selected as the model to perform Maximum
likelihood phylogenetic tree with 100 iterations. The sequence alignments were represented
using Espript 3.0. The ancestry and substitution analysis were performed using MEGA X.
2.3 Dendrogram comparison analysis
Aligned amino acid and nucleotide sequences were assigned the same names in both
the alignments for comparison. The phylogenetic distances were calculated for UPGMA
using the “phangorn library” (Schliep, 2011). The best model was calculated for both
nucleotide and amino acid sequences using the “modelTest” function where the “Akaike
Information Criterion” (Ingram and Mahler, 2013) was applied to determine the best model
for both trees and then each tree was converted into a dendrogram using “as.dendrogram”
function. These dendrograms were further taken for dendrogram comparison using the
“dendextend tanglegram function” (Galili, 2015). Tree distance was calculated using
“treedist” function (Smith, 2020).
2.4 Synonymous and non-synonymous mutation analysis
For synonymous and non-synonymous mutation analysis, the 45 nucleotide sequence
files in which the headers were labelled same as the respective amino acid sequences were
used. Using the reverse align function the nucleotide sequences were reverse aligned by
seqinr library (Charif and Lobry, 2007). The webserver RevTrans 1.4 (Wernersson and
Pedersen, 2003) was used to generate amino acid/codon based alignment of nucleotide
sequences. The codon aligned sequences were used to determine the synonymous (Ka) and
non-synonymous (Ks) substitutions. By using these values, we evaluated the dN, dS and
dN/dS value matrices. These matrices were further used for visualization of the sequence
clustering using heatmaps. “Ward D2” was used as the clustering algorithm to cluster the
samples into the genera and primary hosts of the respective virus.
3. Results
3.1 SARS-CoV-2 has both structural and functional similarities with the previous human
coronaviruses but with much higher infectivity and lower morbidity (Walls et al., 2020). It is
further noted that besides the similar host recognition molecules, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher
affinity and a tighter binding with the human cellular receptor (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al.,

2020). These two features of SARS-CoV-2 prompted us to ask an important and obvious
question- how and when did the novel coronavirus emerge to be a distinct lineage in terms of
its enhanced infectability? What are the molecular markers that can be analyzed to
understand the molecular basis of the stronger affinity and higher infectability? In the current
report, we investigated these questions by- a) comparing the protein structures of spike
proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and other related Bat-CoVs; b)
establishing the similarity and differences in major amino acid residues to understand the
higher affinity of SARS-CoV-2 towards ACE2 binding compared to other coronaviruses;
and c) comparing the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of spike proteins to estimate the
most probable evolutionary trend.
3.1.1. A comparison both at the sequence and structure levels of the coronavirus Spike
proteins
A multiple sequence alignment of 45 experimentally verified Spike proteins sequences from
several species of coronaviruses showed a significant difference in the conservation status of
the two fragments S1 and S2 (Supplementary File S1). The fragment S2 (aa 662-1272 for
SARS-CoV-2) exhibited a significantly higher sequence conservation, with 76 amino acids
strictly conserved across species. However, the fragment S1 (aa1-aa661 for SARS-CoV-2)
exhibited an unusually low conservation with only 10 strictly conserved residues, possibly
attributed to the wide repertoire of the host receptor molecules recognized by this domain (Li,
2016). The amino acid cysteine displayed the highest conservation across all sequences, at 16
different positions across the length of the sequences. Spike proteins form various inter- and
intra-molecular di-sulphide bonds in order to stabilize the core monomeric structure as well
the physiological homo-trimeric form (Li, 2016). A recent study by Wang et al. on the crystal
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein CTD in complex with human ACE2, established
the residues of CTD ( K417, G446, Y449, Y453, L455, F456, Y473, A475, G476, E484,
F486, N487, Y489, F490, Q493, G496, Q498, T500, N501, G502, and Y505) that interact
with the human ACE2 (Figure S1) (Wang et al., 2020). Of these 21 residues, only 8 residues
(Y436, Y440, N474, Y475, Y484, T486, G488, and Y491) are conserved in the
SARS-CoV CTD.
In order to investigate the evolutionary divergence of the Spike protein, we generated an
evolutionary tree (Figure S2). Interestingly, of the seven known human coronaviruses, the
three coronavirus species associated with higher infectivity and morbidities, i.e.,
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 formed a distinct evolutionary cluster. Notably,
the other members of these clusters were overtly the bat coronavirus species. Such a specific
clustering suggests a possible co-evolution in the Spike proteins of humans and bat
coronaviruses that led to the association with more severe infections.
3.1.2 Comparison of the 3-D structures of the Spike proteins reveals residues critical
for ACE2 binding
This association of functional features prompted an investigation into the structural
similarities of the spike proteins from aforementioned human coronaviruses associated with
high fatality and bat coronavirus. While the spike proteins SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
displayed an overall conservation of the protein structure (Figure S3 A), the CTD domain of
the SARS-CoV-2 is relatively compact and contains, unlike SARS-CoV, an extended

long loop. (Figure S3 B & C). Notably, most of the β-strands of the central sheet in
SARS-CoV-2 CTD are longer in size than that of the corresponding sheet in SARS-CoV.
The scenario is however much different in other coronaviruses. Particularly, the CTD of
Bat-CoV and MERS-CoV are larger with an anti-parallel β-sheet replacing the loop like
structures of the ACE2 recognizing region of the CTD of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S4). This
comparative structural analysis hinted at a divergent evolution of the CTDs into two
independent lineages- a) MERS-CoV and b) SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the core
structure of the NTDs of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the lectin binding NTD of
Bov-CoV (Bovine Coronavirus) spike protein are largely similar (Figure S5). Taken
together, the results suggest that the evolution of the host receptor recognizing domain in the
coronavirus spike proteins are more local in nature while the global architecture demonstrate
significant conservation (Figure 1B).
To explore these subtle evolutionary changes, we probed into the local architecture of the
interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 CTD/hACE2 and SARS-CoV CTD/hACE2 complexes
reported in the cryo-EM determined structures (Figure 1C) (Wrapp et al., 2020). Our
analyses led to important findings that could help not only understanding the evolution and
origin of the SARS-CoV-2 but also will help in developing potential intervention. Apart
from the two small β-strands present in the SARS-CoV-2 CTD, the interfaces in the
complexes were primarily lined up with loop like structures from the CTD of the spike
protein and the N-terminal helix of the ACE2 (Figure 1D). It is important to note that
SARS-CoV-2 CTD has 21 residues that interact with ACE2 N-terminal helix, while the
SARS-CoV CTD has only 17 interacting residues. A closer inspection of the amino acid
residues, involved in the interactions, suggested that residues Y453, Y473, G476 and F486
from SARS-CoV-2 CTD were crucial towards providing a stronger interaction with ACE2,
with no identical residues from SARS-CoV in the respective molecular environment (Figure
2A). In order to determine any evolutionary correlation, the MERS-CoV and Bat-CoV CTDs
were docked onto N-terminal helix region of the ACE2 followed by in silico energy
minimization of the complexes. The MERS-CoV and Bat-CoV CTDs exhibited 18 and 19
residues interacting with ACE2 N-terminal helix, respectively (Figure 2B & 2C). Notably,
the Y453 of SARS-CoV-2 superimposed with the identical interacting residues Y499 and
Y503 from MERS-CoV and Bat-CoV CTDs, respectively in the molecular
microenvironment (Figure 2B & 2C). In order to understand the contribution of each
interacting residue of the CTDs in ACE2 binding, in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis
analysis was performed. While Y453 of SARS-CoV-2 contributed 2.018 kcal mol-1, F486
contributed 3.01 kcal mol-1 to the interaction. Interestingly, Y499 and Y503 of MERS-CoV
and Bat-CoV CTDs contributed significantly higher to their respective interactions- 2.877
and 3.017 kcal mol-1, respectively (Figure 2D). Also, a significant rise was observed in the
dissociation constants (Kd) of binding with the ACE2 following alanine mutations of the
aforementioned residues (Figure 2D). These energy values suggest the spatial conservation
of this tyrosine residue in the CTD of SARS-CoV-2 being key to a stronger ACE2 binding,
which is completely absent in the CTD of SARS-CoV.
A comparison of the in silico binding properties of the four aforementioned CTDs with the
ACE2 revealed that despite a higher Kd for SARS-CoV-2, there was a significant decrease in

the surface area of interaction, suggesting a higher specificity of interaction between residues
of the CTD and the ACE2 N-terminal helix (Table 1). It is also worth noticing that while the
interacting residues are widely spread across the interacting surface of the SARS-CoV CTD.
However, for SARS-CoV-2 CTD the interactions localize on the far ends of the interacting
surface (Figure S6 A-D). This phenomenon is crucial as the central region of the interacting
surface is primarily comprised of uncharged residues that arch away from the N-terminal
helix of the ACE2 in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV CTDs. In a stark cont-rast, majority
of the interacting residues in MERS-CoV and Bat-CoV CTDs were localized in the central
region of the interacting surfaces. This observation further hinted at a divergent evolution,
resulting in the formation of the β-sheet protruding out of the region in case of MERS-CoV
and Bat-CoV CTDs, as opposed to loop like structures in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
CTDs.
3.1.3. Maximum Likelihood and Parsimony analyses of the Spike protein nucleotide
sequences at a glance
The nucleotide sequences of the spike proteins were aligned. The results were plotted for
both maximum parsimony (Figure S7A) and maximum likelihood (Figure S7B) trees. The
amino acid phylogenetic analysis showed a significant cluster overlapping among
SARS-CoV (P59594), MERS-CoV (K9N5Q8) and SARS-CoV-2 (P0DTC2). These
coronaviruses already established high morbidities in humans. These groups of
coronaviruses cluster separately with several Bat-CoVs as observed in the amino acids
sequences phylogenetic tree. Comparison of the Parsimony and Maximum likelihood
analyses and the structural data together established the facts that SARS-CoV, Bat-CoV,
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to a similar functional, structural and evolutionary
cluster. A similar pattern was observed in case of nucleotide phylogenetic analysis where the
aforementioned coronaviruses form a distinct cluster. A co-phylogenetics analysis was
performed to compare the nucleotide and amino acid sequence dendrograms (Figure 3). The
trees exhibited an entanglement score of 0.22, with a topological distance of 1.548986. The
treedist analysis suggested a symmetric difference score of 60.000000; branch score
difference of 1.764349; path difference of 166.679333; and quadratic path difference of
20.924544, suggesting that tree are near identical despite the noticeable differences in the
evolutionary lineages. The Baker's Gamma correlation coefficient (Baker, 1974) was
calculated to be 0.4489648 and the Cophenetic correlation (Lapointe and Legendre, 1995)
between amino and nucleotide trees the value was found 0.8245775. These values suggest a
significant similarity between the two trees. Taken together, these analyses suggest that
majority of the changes observed in the nucleotide sequences were pronounced in the
difference in amino acids, with a negligible codon bias.
3.1.4 Estimating the selection pressure on Spike proteins
We sought to investigate the possible selection pressure on the Spike proteins genes,
particularly targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The numbers of non-synonymous
substitutions (dN) between species, and the number of synonymous substitutions (dS)
between species were calculated and used to determine the ratio of dN and dS (Rocha et al.,
2006). A higher dN is associated with a positive selection, suggesting that associated
mutations not only cause increased fitness but also indicate a recent divergence in species.

Concurrently, a higher dS is indicative of a purifying selection, that remove deleterious
mutations which reduced fitness. We estimated the dN and dS values for the set of 45 Spike
proteins’ polypeptide sequences. While the dN values varied between -6 to 2, a significant
proportion of the clusters depicted value greater than 1, suggesting higher number of
non-synonymous substitutions across the spike protein sequences (Figure S8). More
importantly, the dS values varied from -4 to 4 (Figure S9) with a majority of the values being
less than 1. Such a distribution of dS values indicated that purifying selection in Spike
proteins is limited to a small section of the coronaviruses. In stark contrast to the overall
higher dN scores, it was strikingly low within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Bat-CoV
suggesting a negligible positive selection. In concurrence, the dS scores within the
aforementioned Spike proteins, suggested a possibly weak purifying selection. However, the
comparison of MERS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Bat-CoV suggested a
strong positive selection as was evident from the high dN and the low dS values. In order to
further understand the nature of selection pressures on Spike protein, the ratios of dN to dS
were estimated. The ratios revealed a distribution range from -4 to 4 and presented an
interesting scenario (Figure 4), suggesting a mild purifying selection driving the Spike
protein evolution in SARS-CoV-2 and a strong positive selection in case of MERS-CoV. In
addition, the comparison also suggested that the divergence of MERS-CoV could be an
evolutionarily recent event while the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred over a
comparatively longer time span.
3.1.5 A comparison of the amino acids and nucleotide sequences of the coronavirus
Spike proteins
To better understand the aforementioned evolutionary conundrum, we closely examined the
protein (Figure S10) and nucleotide (Figure S11) sequence of CTDs of five Spike protein
sequences - SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Bat-CoV (all belonging to the
sub-genus Sarbecovirus) (Table S2). The CTDs of these Spike proteins exhibited 25
conserved residues. The CTDs of MERS-CoV and Bat-CoV are evidently longer and shorter,
respectively in comparison to the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 CTDs. The theoretical pI for
the CD26 binding CTDs is around 5 suggesting an abundance of negatively charged amino
acids. However, the ACE2 binding CTDs have a theoretical pI greater than 8, suggesting a
higher proportion positively charged residues. However, despite containing equivalent
proportions of aromatic amino acids, the MERS-CoV CTD is significantly more
hydrophobic than the others. Notably, ACE2 is localized strictly on the cell membranes,
whereas DPP4 localizes on the cell membrane as well as in the cytoplasmic and extracellular
fluids. The differential location of targeting receptors might be the possible reason for the
lower infectivity of MERS-CoV despite having a significantly higher mortality. A
comparison of the Spike Protein CTD coding sequences revealed that the SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, and Bat-CoV had a higher GC content (~39%) than the SARS-CoV-2 (~34%).
This in turn was evident from the comparison of the codon usage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein wherein a significantly higher proportion of amino acids were encoded by the AT rich
codons (Figure S12).
Further, we closely examined the binding regions of the four CTDs, emphasising specifically
on the evolution of Y453 (Figures 5A & 5B). The residues 449-456 of the Spike Protein from
SARS-CoV-2 are Asn-Tyr-Leu-Tyr-Arg-Leu-Phe-Arg. The aligned residues for this stretch

from SARS-CoV are Asn-Tyr-Lys-Tyr-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Arg. The triad Tyr-Arg-Tyr in
SARS-CoV generate a strong steric hindrance causing both the tyrosine residues to remain
buried within the CTD (Figure 2A, middle panel). Interestingly, mutating the second tyrosine
a similar yet smaller amino acid leucine (Tyr-Arg-Leu) in SARS-CoV-2 reduces the steric
hindrance (Figure 2A, top panel). This allowed the otherwise buried Tyr453 to interact with
amino acids from ACE2, resulting in an enhanced binding. However in MERS-CoV and
Bat-CoV, these triads are present as Tyr-Ile-Asn and Tyr-Arg-Ser, respectively. This
decrease in hydropathicity significantly reduces the binding affinity of MERS-CoV and
Bat-CoV spike proteins with ACE2 under physiological condition. However, this in turn
enables it to bind CD26 with a stronger affinity, suggesting a positive selection. Taken
together; the removal of the second tyrosine from the triad to a weakly hydrophobic and
smaller amino acid suggests a purifying selection in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.

Although there are several reports on the evolutionary and outbreak trends of
SARS-CoV-2 (Acter et al., 2020; Holmes and Rambaut, 2004; Luk et al., 2019; Shi and
Wang, 2011), there are no reports so far describing the comparative molecular basis of the
evolution, overtly for the spike protein CTDs with respect to the immediate and similar
candidates such as Bat-CoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. To establish and understand the
molecular basis of infection for this pandemic strain along with other related coronaviruses
are of utmost importance in the areas of- a) developing intervention, b) predicting the next
strain in the course of evolution and c) develop an understanding of the changes in the
virulence of the pandemic strains by analyzing the mutations observed. A recent report has
established various mutations that are occurring in the pandemic strains and the current
report can easily be extrapolated to include all the newer mutations to provide further insights
into the virulence trend of the mutated strains (van Dorp et al., 2020). The novelty of the
current study is that we have compared 45 verified sequences of Spike proteins from related
coronaviruses to understand the unique and conserved segments of the spike proteins in order
to decipher the structural and sequence similarities among the related coronaviruses to build
a correlative basis.
The current study compared the spike protein sequences at amino acid (aa) and genomic
nucleotide (nt) sequences. The comparison unequivocally established the corroboration of
two independent analyses (aa and nt levels) and the analysis validated the results to reveal
fact that SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV-1 than other two closely related
coronaviruses (Bat-CoV and MERS-CoV). Also, the significant conservation of amino
in the S2 fragment of the Spike protein might be indicative of the conservation of the viral
entry mechanism utilized by various coronaviruses irrespective of the host identity and the
corresponding host receptor molecule. Our analysis also indicates a purifying selection
driving the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have demonstrated a positive effect
of the GC content on the dN value, thereby driving a positive selection (Du et al., 2018;
Meunier and Duret, 2004). This further strengthens the theory of a purifying selection, as
evident by the lower GC content in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein coding sequence. A higher
GC content exerts higher energy demands at the nucleotide level while compensating for
same by coding for energy efficient amino acids. This in turn makes the replication of

GC content genomes energy consuming, thus slowing the process genome replication and
resultant viral replication. Structural, energetics and in silico mutational analyses further
confirm the observation and establish the properties and locations of the binding residues
Tyr453 to explain the higher affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 receptor. We propose that
the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in parallel yet independently of MERS-CoV,
following a set of recombination and mutational events involving the genomes of the
Bat-CoV and the SARS-CoV.

It is important to mention that the current study is the first of its kind to establish a
comparative molecular basis on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to acquire its virulence and
infectivity over other related coronaviruses. The work has the potential to merge with the
other published data and transform the knowledgebase on SARS-CoV-2 in a newer
dimension to predict upcoming outcomes and aid in the development of novel and effective
interventions.

Figure 3: A tanglegram comparsion for the Spike protein amino acids and nucleotide

phylogenies. With an entanglement score of 0.22, the phylogenies suggest a strong

565

concordance, suggesting that codon usage has negligible impact on the divergence of Spike

566

proteins. (Dashed branches differ between both phylogenies and coloured clades are identical

567

to both trees. Amino acid phylogeny in left panel and row matched Nucleotide phylogeny in

568
