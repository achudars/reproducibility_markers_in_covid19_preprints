ABSTRACT
In this paper we report the analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome and related viruses using
an upgraded version of the open-source algorithm G4-iM Grinder. This version improves the
functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features
affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for
2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters
two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These
sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA,
their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic).
These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV
(+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were
further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were
studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best
candidates was then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found
several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable theranostic targets against the 2019nCoV.

INTRODUCTION
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) is a
positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus from the Betacoronavirus genus, within the
Coronaviridae family of the Nidovirales order. Although it is believed to have originated from a
bat-borne coronavirus, (1–3) the 2019-nCoV can spread between humans with no need of other
vectors or reservoirs for its transmission. The virus is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of infected, and a disastrous
strain on the economy of most countries and citizens worldwide.
The origin of the virus has been traced back to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first
cases of infected individuals were reported amongst the workers of the Huanan Seafood Market
(4, 5). This wet exotic animal market, where wild animals including bats and pangolins are sold
and prepared for consumption, offers ample opportunities for pathogenic bacteria and virus to
adapt and thrive. Such circumstances led Cheng and colleagues to predict the current pandemic
back in 2007 (6). In their own words: “the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses
in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time
bomb. The possibility of the re-emergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or
laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored”.
The fight against the 2019-nCoV has now become a global problem. In this current
scenario, the scientific community is playing a fundamental role in defeating the virus and
minimizing the number of victims. Their work includes, to name a few, the development of fast
and reliable detection methods, the identification of therapeutic targets within the virus, and the
development of active drugs and vaccines to cure and to prevent infections, respectively.
G-Quadruplexes (G4s) and i-Motifs (iMs) have been proposed as therapeutic targets in
many disease aetiologies. G4s are Guanine (G) rich DNA or ARN nucleic acid sequences where
successive Gs stack in a planar fashion via Hoogstein bonds to form four-stranded structures,
stabilized by monovalent cations (7). iMs on the contrary, are Cytosine (C)-rich regions that fold

into tetrameric structures of stranded duplexes (8–10). These are sustained by hydrogen bonds
between the intercalated nucleotide base pairs C·C+ when under acidic physiological conditions.
The importance of these genomic secondary structures has been abundantly studied
during the last years (11–16). They have been found to be regulatory elements in the human
genome implicated in key functions such as telomere maintenance and genome transcription
regulation, replication and repair (17). G4 structures have also been identified in fungi (18–21),
bacteria (22–26) and parasites (27–32). Their occurrence are known in many viruses that afflict
humans as well. These include the HIV-1 (33–35), Epstein-Barr (36, 37), human and manatee
papilloma (38, 39), herpes simplex 1 (40, 41), Hepatitis B (42), Ebola (43) and Zika (44) viruses.
Here they can regulate the viral replication, recombination and virulence (28, 45, 46).
iMs have been less studied in general, especially outside of the human context. With
regards to viruses, Ruggiero et al. recently published the formation of an iM in HIV-1 (47), whilst
we reported the presence of the known cMyb.S (48) iM within the Epstein-Barr virus (49). Despite
the lack off reports, iMs present great potential as viable targets against viruses. For example, the
in silico analysis of the rubella virus revealed an extremely dense genome of potential iMs
(density as counts per genomic length) that surpassed its human counterpart by over an order of
magnitude (49). Other viruses, such as the measles and hepacivirus C, were also very rich in
potential iMs with densities similar to the human genome.
In this work, we wished to contribute to the ongoing effort against the COVID-19
pandemic by investigating the relationship between the 2019-nCoV and quadruplex targets. With
this aim, we analysed the prevalence, distribution and relationships of Potential G4 Sequences
(PQS) and Potential iM Sequences (PiMS) in its genome. These PQS and PiMS have been
assessed according to their potential to form, uniqueness, frequency of appearance, conservation
rates between 3297 different 2019-nCoV clinical cases, confirmed quadruplex-forming sequence
presence and localization within the genome. The study of the 2019-nCoV and its quadruplex
results were expanded to integrate the Coronaviridae family, Group IV of the Baltimore
classification and the entire virus realm, as to allow a wider range of interpretation. With all this

information at hand, our final objective was to identify biologically important PQS and PiMS
candidates in the virus. To substantiate our bioinformatic analysis, we analysed experimentally
some of these sequences by CD and NMR spectroscopies. Our in vitro results confirmed the
formation of stable quadruplexes that can form in the viral genome, suggesting that they may be
suitable targets for new therapeutic or diagnostic agents (46, 50). Hence, our analysis into the
virus realm, and especially the 2019-nCoV, may provide useful insights into using quadruplex
structures as targets in future anti-viral treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
G4-iM Grinder and G4-iM Grinder’s database upgrade
In this work, we have used the G4-iM Grinder (GiG) package for the analysis of all
viruses (49). GiG is an R-based algorithm that locates, quantifies and qualifies PQS, PiMS and
their potential higher-order versions in RNA and DNA genomes. In order to extract more
information and better analyse the viruses, we first upgraded GiG. Two new functions were
developed and are now incorporated in the GiG-package (as of GiG version 1.6.0) named
GiG.Seq.Analysis and GiG.df.GenomicFeatures (supplementary material, section 1). To help us
locate any G4 or iM already studied in the literature, we updated the GiG’s DataBase (GiG.DB)
to version 2.5.1. The library now includes 2851 quadruplex-related sequences that can be
identified within any of GiG’s results. The database is categorized by the capability of the
sequence to form or not form quadruplex structures (2141 do, 710 do not), their relation to Gbased or C-based quadruplexes (2568 G4, 283 iM) and the genome type (1858 DNA, 993 RNA).
The reference information (including DOI and/or PubMedID) of each sequence is also listed and
accessible to facilitate further studies.

Pre-analysis. G4-iM Grinder’ parameter configuration
With these upgrades at hand, we retrieved the 2019-nCoV’s reference sequence
(GCF_009858895.2) from the NCBI database (51). We also downloaded those of 18 other viruses
which can cause mortal illness in humans, including six other pathogenic Coronavirus, as
comparison (supplementary material, section 2).
As a workflow, we applied the functions GiG.Seq.Analysis (to study their G- and C-run
characteristics), G4iMGrinder (to locate quadruplex candidates) and G4.ListAnalysis (to compare
quadruplex results between genomes) from the G4-iM Grinder package (GiG) to all the viruses.
The ‘size restricted overlapping search and frequency count’ method (Method 2, M2A and M2B)
was used to locate all the potential candidates. Then, these PQS and PiMS were evaluated by their
frequency of appearance in the corresponding genome, the presence of known-to-form
quadruplex structures sequences within and their probability of quadruplex-formation score (as
the mean of G4Hunter (52) and the adaptation of the PQSfinder algorithm (53)). To compare
between virus species, we calculated the density of potential quadruplex sequences per 100000
nucleotides (Density = 100000 ×

We previously saw that viruses have a wider-range of PQS and PiMS densities than that
of the human, fungi, bacteria and parasite genomes (49). Some were totally void whilst others
were very rich in potential candidates. So, we explored different quadruplex definitions to
determine the most useful configurations for the analysis of the viruses at hand. These different
definitions control the characteristics of what the algorithm considers a quadruplex. They include
the acceptable size of G- or C-repetitions to be considered a run, the acceptable amount of bulges
within these runs, the acceptable loop sizes between runs, the acceptable number of runs to
constitute a PQS or PiMS, and the total acceptable length of the sequence (Figure 1, A). A flexible
configuration of quadruplex definitions will detect larger amounts of candidates at the expense of
requiring more computing power and accepting sequences that are more ambiguous in forming
quadruplex structures in vitro (as determined by their score; with longer loops, smaller runs, more

bulges and more complementary G/C %, Figure 1, B). More constrained definitions result in the
opposite. Hence, for the analysis, we chose three different configurations: a Lax configuration
(which accepts run bulges and longer ranges of runs, loops and total sizes), the Predefined
configuration of the package (which restricts sizes but still accepts run bulges), and the original
Folding Rule (54, 55) (which restricts length and does not accept run bulges) (Figure 1, C Left).
Then, we calculated the PQS and PiMS densities of each virus to allow a direct size-independent
comparison between them all (Figure 1, D), and filtered the results by their in vitro probability of
formation score. The score filters were set to |20| and |40| to allow us the study of both the medium
(PQS Score ≥ 20; PiMS Score ≤ -20) and the high probability candidates (PQS Score ≥ 40; PiMS
Score ≤ -40; Figure 1, B) within the results.
The best configuration to obtain a sufficient amount of results for almost all the viruses
analysed was the Lax set-up. This was also relevant for the reference genome of the 2019-nCoV
(Figure 1, C Right). Given the small size of the viral genomes, the increase in computational
power was deemed acceptable and hence, we established this Lax configuration as the default
configuration for all posterior searches with GiG.

Figure 1. A. Results with G4-iM Grinder depend on the quadruplex definitions introduced to the
algorithm. Sizes of G- or C-runs, loops and the entire sequence, together with an acceptable
number of bulges within the runs are part of the definitions. B. The structures found with GiG
under the definitions proposed by the user can be evaluated for their in vitro probability of
formation. This scale is the mean of G4Hunter (that considers G richness and C skewness for PQS
or vice versa for PiMS as factors) (52) and an adaptation of PQSfinder (that considers run, loop
and bulge effects on the structure) (53). Positive values mean that the sequence is more capable
of forming G4s, whilst more negative values mean that it is more capable of forming i-Motifs.
Values near zero are not good candidates. C. Left, GiG’s quadruplex definitions used in this work.
Granting more freedom to the quadruplex search will increase the number of structures found, at
the expense of requiring more computational power and potentially finding more sequences with

Analysis with G4-iM Grinder and other tools
The 3297 different 2019-nCoV viral genomes sequenced during the pandemic (from
December-2019 to July-2020, by different laboratories worldwide) were retrieved from the online
database GISAID (56, 57). These genomes are the result of filtering the database by their coverage
(<1 % N content), completeness (>29000 nucleotides) and association to a clinical patient history
(only those that have it). All other viral genomes used were retrieved from the NCBI database.
To analyse these genomes, we employed the workflow described in the pre-analysis
section using the Lax parameter configuration. We investigated the biological features potentially
affected by candidates using the function GiG.df.GenomicFeatures. The conservation of each
PQS and PiMS found in the reference genome was calculated as {Conservation (%) = 100 ×
𝑁𝑔+ ⁄∑ 𝑁𝑔} where Ng is the total number of genomes, and Ng+ is the number of genomes with
the PQS or PiMS candidate. The genomic pairwise alignments, used to study the similarity
between viruses and detect PQS and PiMS variations between species, were done using the
package Biostrings from the Bioconductor repository. To compare potential quadruplex presence
and prevalence between genomic groupings (species, families, groups and the entire virus realm),
we calculated the genomic density of several arguments. These were calculated using the
GiGList.Analysis function of the GiG package (density per 100000 nucleotides). The arguments
were the density of results (PQS and PiMS), density of results with score filters (with at least |20|
or |40|), density of already confirmed sequences that form G4 or iM within, and uniqueness (as
{Uniqueness (%) = 100 × 𝑁𝑠 f=1⁄∑ 𝑁𝑠} where Ns is the number of sequences, and Nsf=1 is the
number of sequences with a frequency of appearance of 1 in its respective genome). For the Gand C-runs density analysis of the viruses, we used the function GiG.Seq.Analysis from the GiG
package. The arguments here were: densities of runs with different sizes (two or three to five long
G- or C-runs) and with different bulges per run (zero and/or one). Relationships between
arguments were calculated through Spearman’s rank correlation (), Pearson correlation (corr)
and Kendall’s  (Supplementary material, section 3, Figures 6 – 10).

Candidate selection
PQS and PiMS candidates were selected according to their potential to form, uniqueness,
frequency of appearance, conservation between 3297 different 2019-nCoV clinical case genomes,
confirmed quadruplex presence and localization within the genome.

NMR experiments
Oligonucleotides (0.3 mM) for NMR experiments were purchased from IDT, and
suspended in 200 l of H2O/D2O 9:1 in 25 mM KH2PO4 and 25 mM KCl buffer. Spectra were
acquired on Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at 600 MHz, and processed with Topspin
software. Experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 5.1 to 45 ºC and pH from 5
to 7. NOESY spectra in H2O were acquired with a 150 ms mixing time. Water suppression was
achieved by including a WATERGATE module in the pulse sequence prior to acquisition

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Circular dichroism (CD) studies were performed on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter
using a 1 mm path length cuvette. Spectra were recorded in a 320–220 nm range at a scan rate of
100 nm min−1 and a response time of 4.0 s with four acquisitions recorded for each spectrum.
Data were smoothed using the means-movement function within the JASCO graphing software.
Melting transitions were recorded by the monitoring the decrease of the CD signal at 264 nm.
Heating rates were 30 °C/h. Transitions were evaluated using a nonlinear least squares fit
assuming a two-state model with sloping pre- and post-transitional baselines. Oligonucleotide
solutions for CD measurements were prepared at the same buffer conditions as the NMR
experiments. Oligonucleotide concentration was of 50 M.

RESULTS
2019-nCoV and quadruplexes
G4-iM Grinder’s analysis of the 2019-nCoV reference genome revealed 323 PQS and
189 PiMS candidates. As none scored over |40| (high probability of formation), we focussed on
the candidates with scores higher than |20| (medium probability). This filter resulted in the
detection of 71 PQSs, 7 of which also scored over 30 (22 and 2 %, respectively; Figure 2, A).
Regarding PiMS, 35 scored -20 or less, and 10 below -30 (19 and 5 %, respectively). In both
cases, all the candidates were unique (only occuring once in the 2019-nCoV genome) and none
included confirmed G4s or iMs (listed in the GiG.DB) within their sequence.
We studied the potential biological effect of these candidates by determining their
location and distribution within the genome of the 2019-nCoV. All PQSs with scores over |30|,
except one (found in the N gene; entry 7, Figure 2, A), were located in the orf1ab polyprotein
gene (in the nsp 1, 3 and 10 areas). Similarly, all the high-scoring PiMS were located in the orf1ab
gene (in the nsp3, 4, 12 and 13 areas), except a candidate located in the 5’ UTR region (entry 8,
Figure 2, A). When we lowered the score filter to |20|, most results were identified as part of the
orf1ab polyprotein. However, some PQSs were also found as part of the S, orf3a, M, orf8 and N
genes and some PiMS as part of the S, orf3a, N genes and 3’ UTR. When no score-filter was
applied, nearly all biological features presented quadruplex candidates, with the exception of
orf7a, orf7b and orf10, as well as the orf6 gene in the case of PIMS (Figure 2, B and D).
For each PQS and PiMS detected on the reference 2019-nCoV, we studied its
conservation rates using different 2019-nCoV genomes sequenced by different research
groups/laboratories/institutions at different times and locations of the pandemic. In total, we
analysed 3297 different 2019-nCoV genomes associated with clinical cases of CoVID with
morbid or mortal outcomes. On average, the PQS conservation rate for all candidates was 98.6 ±
7.4 %, whilst for PiMS it was 96.7 ± 12.7 %. For results that score at least |20|, PQS conservation
decreased to 98.4 % whilst PiMS increased to 97.4 %.

The relationship between the candidate’s conservation rate and the biological features
potentially affected by the PQS and PiMS were then explored. On the one hand, we found that
the less conserved sequences are located mainly in the 5’ UTR section, where sequence
conservation can fall to 27 %. On the other hand, the 3’ UTR region, showed higher conservation
levels with minima of 90 %. The rest of the sequences found in most of the other landmarks
presented very high conservation rates, ranging between 99 and 100 % (297 PQS out of 323, 153
PiMS out of 189). Some exceptions exist, however. For example, three PQSs were located in the
N gene with conservation rates of 70 – 74 %, and another candidate was found in the orf1ab gene
(position 8775, nsp4 region) with a conservation rate of 89 %. In addition, one PiMS found in the
orfab gene (position 14391, nsp12 within the Coronavirus RPol N-terminus) was located also
with a very poor conservation (29 %).
In a wider context, the total number of PQSs found in the 3297 different 2019-nCoV
genomes ranged from 228 to 468 sequences (reference genome is 323). None of them presented
already confirmed G4 sequences and all were unique (not repeated in the genome). The total
number of results for PiMS were between 133 to 241 sequences (reference genome is 189).

family members. The most similar genomes found to that of the 2019-nCoV were the SARScoronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Bat coronavirus BM48-31/BGR/2008 (Bat-CoV-BM), with
pair-alignment score values of 79 and 75 % respectively. These two genomes also presented
several PQSs and PiMSs in common with 2019-nCoV. The common candidates were analysed
and their potential biological influence within the 2019-nCoV genome determined.
For PQSs, nine sequences are common between all three genomes (2019-nCoV, Bat-CoV-BM
and the SARS-CoV), and can be found in the 5’ UTR, 3’ UTR and in the middle of the polyprotein
orf1ab regions of the 2019-nCoV. Eleven other sequences are common only to the Bat-CoV-BM
and are located within the 5’ UTR region, near to the orf1ab starting positions or in the middle of
the orf1ab polyprotein. Eight additional PQSs are common only to the SARS-CoV and appear in
the orf1ab gene and 3’ UTR region of the 2019-nCoV.
For PiMS, only one sequence common to all three genomes is located in the middle of
the orf1ab gene. Five other PiMSs common only to the Bat-CoV-BM are found in the 5’ UTR
region, near to the orf1ab starting positions or in the middle of the orf1ab polyprotein. Nine
additional sequences are common only to the SARS-CoV and can be found in the start (less than
40 nucleotides away from the UTR; 2/9) and in middle of the polyprotein orf1ab gene (4/9), the
E gene (1/9), and the N gene (2/9) of the reference 2019-nCoV.
The common PQS and PiMS’s position difference between the 2019-nCoV and the
SARS-CoV is 59 ± 47 nucleotides, whilst the difference between the 2019-nCoV and the BatCoV-BM is 133 ± 109 nucleotides. The scores of these common sequences are however rather
poor. None of the PiMS scored less than -20 and only four PQSs scored more than 20 (at least
medium probability of formation; Figure 3, A). Of these, the best candidate scored over 30, (entry
6, Figure 2 and entry 2 in Figure 3). In general, the sequences presented small run sizes, a high
number of bulges, long loop lengths and a high number of complementary nucleotides within,
which lowered their probability for quadruplex-formation.

We focused on the highest scoring sequences found in 2019-nCoV but not common to
the other SARS-CoV and Bat-CoV-BM, and identified the variations in their sequences (Figure
3, B). To do so, the previously found common PQS and PiMS were used as fixed points of a
genomic-alignment to retrieve the tracks of interest that contain the potential quadruplex
sequences.
For PQS1, the changes between the three species occurred in four different nucleotides, three of
which are loops. In the Bat-CoV-BM version, the fourth G-run is annulled by the substitution of
a G for a C, although a different G-run exists that can still allow the potential quadruplex
formation. This PQS, however, has more bulges, longer loops and an increased number of C,
which will make it less stable if formed. The 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV versions have a
potential fifth G-run domain downstream which can potentially interact with the PQS.
For PQS2, modifications are greater between species and occur in the central loop and second run
area. In SARS-CoV, these modifications allow for a more potentially stable PQS derived from
the incorporation of an extra 2-residue G-run. The Bat-CoV-BM version of the PQS has the
majority of the central loop deleted and second run invalidated. These modifications, however,
do not impede the potential formation of the quadruplex since a nearby G-run downstream can
give rise to an alternative PQS.
For PiMS 3, the modifications directly prevent the potential formation of the iM in both SARSCoV and Bat-CoV-BM genomes. PiMS 4 showed a greater level of conservation. Only two
modifications between species occur and are located in the first and third loops. The Bat-CoVBM version includes an extra C in the last C-run, which makes the PiMS more potentially stable
than in the other family versions.

We analysed the potential quadruplex presence and relevance in the family of genomes
through a more macroscopic perspective (Figure 4, A). PQS density between Coronaviridae
species lied between 705 to 3381 PQSs per 100000 nucleotides, with a mean of 1802 (PQS density
for 2019-nCoV is 1080). Rousettus bat coronavirus, Rat coronavirus, Parker and Beluga whale
coronavirus SW1 had the highest densities in the classification, whilst the human coronavirus
HKU1 and several other HKU-CoV had the lowest. All these results were unique and therefore
are repeated only once in the genome. 62 % (28 out of 45) of the family presented one or more
PQSs with a score of over 40 (most probable PQSs to form quadruplex). The 2G_L1.NAR (27)
G4 (in its RNA variant) was found within nine PQSs in the Wigeon-CoV HKU20 genome.
For PiMS, the range for the density of Coronaviridae family was in between 142 and
4938 sequences per 100000 nucleotides, with a mean of 1030 ± 929 (2019-nCoV PQS density is
632). Magpie-robin coronavirus HKU18, Sparrow coronavirus HKU17 and Porcine coronavirus
HKU15 toped the classification with densities of 4938, 3933 and 2930 respectively. Wencheng
Sm shrew coronavirus was the least dense genome, followed by the Human coronavirus HKU1
and Human coronavirus OC43. 64 % of all members (29 out of 45) presented within their results
at least one PiMS with a score of -40 or less (most probable PiMS to form in vitro). None had
already confirmed iMs within their sequence and all were unique, being repeated only once in the
genome.

2019-nCoV, the Virus Realm and quadruplexes
We further expanded the search to the remaining viruses classified in the NCBI database
and found several PQS and PiMS in common with the reference 2019-nCoV. These had a good
score and very high inter-2019-nCoV conservation rates (Figure 3, A entry 5 and 6). All of these
matches were made with Group I viruses (of the Baltimore classification; dsDNA viruses). One
PQS candidate located in the N-gene and CDS region of the 2019-nCoV was found in common
with a Mycobacteria phage virus. This virus is known to infect the bacterial Mycobacterium genus

that causes several diseases in humans (tuberculosis and leprosy). The PQS was identified as part
of a scaffolding-protein gene within the Mycobacteria phage. Also, a PiMS located in the 2019nCoV’s orf1ab gene is common to three different viruses; two from the Herpesviridae family that
infects mammals (marsupials and murids) and a Podoviridae virus that infects bacteria from the
Vibrio/Aliivibrio genus.
In Group IV (which includes the Coronaviridae family and 1309 other viruses), we
explored the quadruplex presence and distribution per family (Figure 4, B) and calculated their
mean and standard deviation (Supplementary material, section 3. Figure 1 to 5). These were then
compared to the Coronaviridae results.
For PQS, the Coronaviridae family is in the lower range of the group’s distribution. As a whole,
the group’s density was double of that found in the Coronaviridae family (means of 4034 and
1802, respectively). To the contrary, the Flaviviridae and Tombusviridae families showed the
highest densities, with genomes that surpassed that of the Coronaviridae several fold. In particular
for Flaviviridae, its mean PQS density was found to be more than four times that of Coronaviridae
(means of 9079 and 1802, respectively). 106 viruses within the Group also presented already
confirmed G4 sequences within their results. These were found in 36 species belonging to the
Flaviviridae family, 9 to the Picorbiridae, 8 to the Tombusviridae and 7 to the Closteroviridae
families, amongst others.
For PiMS, the Coronaviridae family was again in the low end of the group’s distribution. The
group’s mean density was over three times that of Coronaviridae’s (mean of 3731 and 1043,
respectively). Contrastingly, the Tymoviridae family was found to be very rich in potential
candidates (mean of 25359). Its results surpassed by over an order of magnitude most of the other
group member results. The Picornaviridae, Secoviridae and Luteoviridae families also had very
dense genomes, and within these four families, 9 virus species presented confirmed iMs in their
genome (of 11 in total).
In a wider context, we investigated the prevalence and distribution of potential
quadruplexes in the entire virus realm and compared them to Group IV’s results. We also

examined the results on a global scale (Figure 4, C).
For PQS, we detected relatively small differences between the groups. Group I (dsDNA) viruses
displayed the highest mean density followed by Groups III, II and VI. The entire virus realm
density was found within the limits of 40 to 27687 PQSs per 100000 nucleotides with a mean of
4441. The Herpesviridae and Siphoviridae families from Group I and Inoviridae family in Group
II displayed the highest PQS densities amongst the 6680 viruses analysed. Additionally, several
G4s confirmed in the literature were found in 1372 viruses within Group I, 133 within Group II,
74 within Group III, 106 within Group IV, 18 within Group V, 8 within Group VI and 14 within
Group VII (Supplementary material, section 3. Figure 11). Group differences for PiMS were also
relatively small, with the largest mean being Group VI followed by Groups I, III and IV. Here,
the virus realm density was calculated in the range of 0 to 51771 with a mean of 4221. The
Tymoviridae family and other Group IV families, mentioned previously, topped the rank, together
with some species of the Herpesviridae family from Group I. iMs confirmed in the literature were
found in 175 viruses within Group I, 5 within Group II, 11 within Group IV, 2 within Group V
and 2 within Group VI.

Biophysical Experiments
To validate the predictions of our bioinformatics search, we selected three candidates
using the criteria mentioned in the material and methods section. Two of them were potential G4
forming sequences and the third one was an iM candidate.
The first G4 (CoVID-RNA-G4-1) examined is found in the N-gene of the 2019-nCoV
with a conservation rate of 99.48 % (Figure 5, A entry 1). The NMR spectra of this RNA exhibited
a broad set of signals around 11 – 12 ppm, characteristic of guanine imino protons involved in Gtetrads. These signals are observed at high temperatures indicating that the G-quadruplex is quite
stable (Figure 5, B left). Additional signals around 12 – 13 ppm, which are characteristic of
Watson-Crick base-pairs, can also be observed at low temperature. These interactions may arise
from loops between G-tracts or alternative conformation such as hairpin-like structures. The CD
spectra of the candidate revealed a positive band at 264 nm and negative band with a minimum
at 240 nM consistent with the formation of a G4 of a parallel topology (Figure 5, D, left). Melting
experiments monitored by CD confirmed the great stability of the G4, whose melting temperature
(Tm) was calculated to be 54.4 ºC at [K+] = 50 mM. Encouraged by these results, we additionally
selected another candidate for experimental analysis with a very high conservation rate (CoVIDRNA-G4-2; Figure 5, A, entry 3). This candidate is located in the orf1ab gene within the nsp3
region. As for the previous analysis, NMR and CD spectra revealed a stable parallel G4quadruplex (Figure 5, B and D, right), with a CD-monitored Tm of 48.1 ºC. In this case, the CD
spectra presented an additional band at 310 nm, most likely related to the association between
two quadruplexes to form a dimeric structure. This is consistent with the number of imino signals
observed in the NMR spectra at high temperatures, which suggests the presence of more than two
G-tetrads.
In the case of PiMS, we selected a very conserved candidate (100 %) found in the orf1ab
– nsp12 region of the virus (CoVID-RNA-iM-1; Figure 5, A entry 4). In NMR, only two small
signals appeared in the 12.5 – 14.5 ppm range at neutral pH. Under acidic conditions more signals
were observable, including a peak at 15 ppm which could be associated with C·C+ iminos.

However, further analysis by 2D NMR spectroscopy revealed that this signal arises from an AU
base pair (Supplementary material, section 4. Figure 13). We must conclude that this sequence,
although folded, does not form an iM. This result is not totally unexpected, since the lower
stability of RNA vs DNA iM is well known. In spite of this negative result, and to check the
capability of our algorithm to detect iMs, we decided to study the DNA version of this sequence
(CoVID-DNA-iM-1; Figure 5, A, entry 5). Most interestingly, the NMR spectra of this DNA
oligonucleotide exhibited several imino signals in the 15 – 16 ppm range, characteristic of C·C+
base pairs. These signals are observable in the 5.5 to 6.7 pH range (Figure 5, C, and
Supplementary material, section 4. Figure 14). Additionally, amino groups from C·C+ (in the 9 –
10 ppm range) and TT base pairs (in the 11 ppm region) are also observable. As TT base pairs are
common capping groups in iMs, it is interesting that the SARS version of this sequence (SARSDNA-iM-1; Figure 5, A, entry 6), which only differs from 2019-nCoV in a single nucleotide
within the first loop (from TT to TG), was unable to form an iM under all pH conditions studied
(even at pH 5.4).

DISCUSION AND CONCLUSIONS

G4-iMGrinder and settings
In this work, we have used G4-iM Grinder to analyse the genome of the 2019-nCoV, and
that of many other viruses, in search off potential quadruplex (both G4 and iM) therapeutic targets.
To do so, we first expanded G4-iM Grinder’s quadruplex identification and characterization
repertoire with two new functions, GiG.Seq.Analysis and GiG.df.GenomicFeatures. Other
functions such as G4iMGrinder and GiGList.Analysis were upgraded to better analyse and
summarise the quadruplex results obtained. Furthermore, over 2800 quadruplex-related
sequences were searched for in the literature and included in G4-iM Grinder’s database to rapidly
identify confirmed G4s and iMs within all results.
An initial study of the 2019-nCoV genome and 18 other pathogenic viruses revealed the
special characteristics that need to be considered for quadruplex-related examinations in these
organisms. For most, the original folding rule (which accepts no bulges within the runs and is
very constrained in its quadruplex definitions) and the predefined parameters of G4-iM Grinder
(which allows more liberty by accepting bulges and longer loops) are too strict to find associated
runs that can give rise to quadruplexes. Although other organisms such as Plasmodium falciparum
or Entamoeba histolytica may be less rich in G and C content (49), the size of these genomes
enables finding rich G- or C- tracks that can ultimately form potential quadruplexes. In most
viruses, however, this does not take place because of the small size of the genomes (in the range
of tens to hundreds thousand nucleotides versus the tens of millions for the parasites mentioned,
and thousands of millions for humans). Furthermore, most of the G4s found in viruses are
complex sequences, with short runs and bulges (for example, HIV-1(33, 35) and Ebola(43)),
which elude detection when following traditional quadruplex definitions. To overcome these
problems, we took advantage of the great modulability of G4-iM Grinder, and developed, tested
and successfully employed a lax quadruplex definition configuration for the analysis. With these
settings, the number of candidates found increased greatly and included the complex sequences
expected in viruses, at the expense of needing more computational power.

2019-nCoV
With all these updates and configurations at hand, we focused on the reference 2019nCoV and located 323 PQS and 189 PiMS unique (only occurring once in the genome) sequences
dispersed unevenly in the genome. 20 % of these candidates had at least a medium probability of
formation (score over |20|). These were concentrated in the orfab gene (especially nsp 1 and 3
areas for PQS; and nsp 3, 4 and 12 for PiMS), the N-gene and S-gene (a highly variable gene that
binds to the ACE2 membrane receptor and controls the viral penetration into the cell (3)). The
orf3a (related to virulence by necrotic death inducement and cytokine expression (60)), M-gene
(which encodes membrane glycoprotein (61)), orf8 and UTR regions also presented these
candidates. Here they may play their biological role if formed. Other genes, such as orb7a and b,
and orf10 were found totally void of any quadruplex candidates.
We calculated the 2019-nCoV candidate’s quadruplex conservation rates and quadruplex-related
region variability under three different scopes. First, the attention was set exclusively on the virus
in an intra-species analysis comprising 3297 genomes of the 2019-nCoV sequenced at different
places and times of the pandemic. Here we saw that most of the sequences analysed presented
very high conservation rates, although a few candidates in the 5’UTR, orf1ab and N landmarks
displayed low conservation with respect to the reference genome (with a minimum of 27 %).
The search was then expanded to the rest of the Coronaviridae family. 53 2019-nCoV
PQS and PiMS candidates were found in common with the SARS-CoV and/or Bat coronavirus
BM48-31/BGR/2008 (Bat-CoV-BM), all of which are suspect of having bats as hosts during their
evolution. These common sequences were located in the 3’UTR, N and E genes of the 2019nCoV, although most were positioned in the orfab gene, and especially in the 5’UTR region.
Paradoxically, the candidates found in the 5’UTR site (which regulates the translation of the RNA
transcript) include the least conserved group of candidates of the inter-species analysis (with
conservation rates as low as 27 %), while also hosting a very conserved family-wise group of
candidates (Supplementary material, section 3, Figure 12). One set of sequences are highly
conserved within species and family, and another is very un-conserved altogether. On the one

hand, high conservation in candidates (maintained through natural selection) may be an important
factor for the survival of the virus. This importance may transcend beyond the 2019-nCoV and
into other familiar species were PQS and PiMS were found in common. On the other hand,
variability in the region may also play a vital role in the ability of the virus to adapt to new hosts,
situations and environments.
The highest scoring candidates found in 2019-nCoV were however not common to any other
Coronaviridae member species. So, we investigated the differences between them through
genome alignments and found that most of the sequence versions amongst species (6 out of 8)
were still able to form potential quadruplex structures even with modifications. Therefore, these
PQS and PiMS, although different from those in the 2019-nCoV, maintain their potential
biological role and importance.
Expanding the search for common candidates to the entire virus realm, we matched one
PQS and PiMS from the 2019-nCoV with the potential quadruplexes found in four viruses from
Group I belonging to the Herpesviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae families (all dsDNA).

2019-nCoV and the virus realm
With G4-iM Grinder, we analysed the entire virus realm in a similar fashion to other
studies in the literature (62, 63). However, we used a lax definition of quadruplexes to detect Gand C- structures and focused the comparison of the realm to the 2019-nCoV.
Whilst the 2019-nCoV did not present any of the published quadruplex sequences listed
in the GiG.DB within its genome, other viruses including a wigeon-afflicting Coronavirus did. In
the entire virus realm, 1725 viruses presented at least one confirmed G4 sequence in their genome,
while 195 at least one confirmed iM sequence (the dimensional discrepancies between both results
may partially be due to the difference in the number of G4 and iM entries in the database; 2568
and 283 respectively). The sheer volume of species with confirmed quadruplex structures in all
groups of viruses suggests that quadruplexes may be common and necessary genomic regulatory

elements for viruses to “live”, thrive and adapt; as seen in other organisms such as humans.
However, the prevalence is not homogeneous and varies broadly at the group level although not
that much at the family level. For example, some families like Group I’s Herpesviridae and
Sphaerolipoviridae, Groups IV’s Matonavirirdae and Flaviviridae and Groups II’s Spiroviridae
presented the highest PQS densities; whilst Groups V’s Aspiriviridae and Fimoviridae, Groups
IV Mononiviridae and Mesoniviridae and Group’s I Mimiviridae displayed the lowest. PiMS
showed a similar tendency with Group I (Sphaerolipoviridae and Herpesviridae) and especially
IV (Tymoviridae, Matonaviridae and Gammaflexiviridae) families being the densest in
candidates; whilst Groups IV (Monoviridae and Yueviridae), Groups V (Fimoviridae and
Phasmavirirdae) and Groups I families (Mimiviridae) displayed the lowest. These results
indicate that viruses/families (and particularly single-stranded ones) are probably more oriented
to a kind of quadruplex structure in a group/genome-type independent manner, whilst being
contingent upon cation concentration and pH of the environment for formation.
Altogether, the 2019-nCoV displayed general poverty regarding quadruplex candidates
when compared in a macroscopic perspective to the virus realm. Its PQS and PiMS density were
in the lower end of results from the Coronaviridae family, which itself was in the lower end of
the (+) ssRNA Group IV (in an approximate ratio of 1:2:4 for PQS and 1:2:8 for PiMS). When
put into the entire virus realm context, the 2019-nCoV PQS density was lower than 5813 other
viruses analysed (out of 6680), whilst PiMS density was lower than 6125. Nevertheless, other
viruses with similar densities to that of the 2019-nCoV were found to possess confirmed G4 and
iM sequences within, supporting the potential these structures have for targeting the 2019-nCoV.

Candidate confirmation in vitro
We, therefore, selected the best candidates to evaluate in vitro. The highly conserved
candidate CoVID-RNA-1 formed a parallel G4 stable even at 45 ºC. This G4, located in the Ngene, can possibly interact with the viral RNA packaging, transcription and replication functions

of the virus (64). The second sequence, CoVID-RNA-2, also formed a stable parallel quadruplex
structure. In this case, the quadruplex monomers interacted amongst themselves to form a higher
order structure. CoVID-RNA-2 is located in the nsp3 region of orf1ab very near its SUD domain.
This area has been associated with the increased pathogenicity of the virus compared to other
Coronaviridae that do not present it (65). Additionally, it has been suggested that the SUD domain
interacts with G-quadruplexes of the host. These results, however, open the possibility of an
intrinsic gene modulation that may be linked with an increased virulence. Such a hypothesis can
be extended to the SARS-CoV, as another stable PQS candidate was found in its genome in the
same location (Figure 3, B1).
For PiMS, the DNA version of a candidate located in the orf1ab gene of the 2019-nCoV
and with a 100 % conservation rate formed an iM at almost neutral pH. However, the SARS-CoV
version of the iM (which differs by one nucleotide in the first loop, from TT to TG) was unable
to form even at pH 5.1. As TT base pairs are common capping positions, the substitution of the T
might prevent the folding in SARS-CoV. Additionally, the presence of C in G4s lowers overall
stability of the quadruplex as C can base pair with G and ultimately hinder G-quartet formation
(66). For C-based structures, the opposite but with the same effect might also be happening.
When we analysed the RNA version of the 2019-nCoV iM, it did not form a quadruplex structure.
Despite the fact that the sequences found in 2019-nCoV have an intermediate probability of
formation, RNA iMs are known to be less stable than their DNA-versions (59). Still, G4-iM
Grinder methodology identified several more candidates with the potential to form iMs in the
virus. These results prove that especially for DNA, G4-iM Grinder can be used to find and
characterize iMs in even C-poor genomes.
Overall, these results greatly expand the current knowledge we have regarding
quadruplexes and the 2019-nCoV (67), and open the door for targeting viruses in general, and the
2019-nCoV in particular, through the use of these nucleic sequences as therapeutic targets in
future anti-viral treatments.
