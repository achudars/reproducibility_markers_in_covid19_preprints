Summary

14

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emphasized the vulnerability of human

15

populations to novel viral pressures, despite the vast array of epidemiological and

16

biomedical tools now available. Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary

17

information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses

18

that have impacted our ancestors – pointing to which viruses have future pandemic

19

potential. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover

20

selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses,

21

including SARS-CoV-2, that likely started more than 20,000 years ago. These adaptive

22

events were limited to the population ancestral to East Asian populations. Multiple lines

23

of functional evidence support an ancient viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the

24

geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an

25

ancient coronavirus, or with a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as

26

coronaviruses with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian

27

populations. By learning more about our ancient viral foes, our study highlights the

28

promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future.

29

Importantly, adaptation to ancient viral epidemics in specific human populations does

30

not necessarily imply any difference in genetic susceptibility between different human

31

populations, and the current evidence points toward an overwhelming impact of

32

socioeconomic factors in the case of COVID-19.

Introduction

35

In the past 20 years, strains of the beta coronavirus genus (family Coronaviridae; Richman et

36

al., 2020) have been behind three major zoonotic outbreaks with grave impacts for human

37

populations (Ou et al., 2020). The first outbreak, commonly known as SARS-CoV (Severe Acute

38

Respiratory Syndrome), originated in China in late 2002 and eventually spread to 30 additional

39

counties where it infected more than 8,000 people and claimed nearly 800 lives (Hoffmann and

40

Kamps, 2003). Four years later, MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus)

41

affected >2,400 people and caused over 850 deaths, mostly in Saudi Arabia (World Health

42

Organization, 2019). The most recent outbreak began in late 2019 when SARS-CoV-2 – a less

43

virulent but far more contagious strain than those behind the two previous epidemics – emerged

44

in mainland China before spreading rapidly across the rest of the world, triggering an ongoing

45

pandemic (COVID-19) that so far has infected 45 million people and resulted in over one million

46

deaths worldwide (Dong et al., 2020).

47

The devastation caused by SARS-CoV-2 has inspired a worldwide research effort to develop

48

new vaccines and strategies that aim to curb its impact by determining the factors that underlie

49

its epidemiology. The resulting research has revealed that socioeconomic (e.g. access to

50

healthcare and testing facilities or exposure at work), demographic (e.g. population density and

51

age structure), and personal health factors all play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology

52

(Balogun et al., 2020; Sattar Naveed et al., 2020; Scarpone et al., 2020). Additionally, several

53

genetic loci that mediate SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity have been found in

54

contemporary European populations (Ellinghaus et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020), one of which

55

contains a genetic variant that increases SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility that likely increased in

56

frequency in the ancestors of modern Europeans after interbreeding with Neanderthals ~40,000

57

years ago (Zeberg and Pääbo, 2020). This historical admixture event has led to genetic

58

differences within and between contemporary human populations that directly impact COVID-19

59

epidemiology – the Neanderthal-derived variant haplotype is now carried by 8% of modern

60

Europeans, but at lower frequencies in African populations whose ancestors did not experience

61

this admixture event – and suggests that evolutionary analyses of human populations may help

62

reveal these genetic differences and ultimately assist in the development of novel drugs and

63

therapies to combat the negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2.

64

Throughout the evolutionary history of our species, positive natural selection has frequently

65

targeted proteins that physically interact with viruses – e.g. those involved in immunity, or used

66

by viruses to hijack the host cellular machinery (Barreiro et al., 2009; Enard et al., 2016; Sawyer

67

et al., 2005). In the ~6 million years since the ancestors of humans and chimpanzees

68

separated, selection has led to the fixation of gene variants encoding virus-interacting proteins

69

(VIPs) at three times the rate observed for other classes of genes (Enard et al., 2016; Uricchio

70

et al., 2019). Moreover, strong selection on VIPs has continued in human populations during the

71

past 50,000 years, as evidenced by VIP genes being enriched for adaptive introgressed

72

Neanderthal variants and also selective sweep signals (i.e. selection that drives a beneficial

73

variant to substantial frequencies in a population), particularly around VIPs that interact with

74

RNA viruses, a viral class that includes the coronaviruses (Enard and Petrov, 2018, 2020).

75

The accumulated evidence suggests that ancient RNA virus epidemics have occurred frequently

76

during the history of our species; however, we currently do not know if selection has made a

77

substantial contribution to the evolution of human genes that interact more specifically with

78

coronaviruses.

79

Accordingly, here we investigate whether ancient coronavirus epidemics have driven past

80

adaptation within and across modern human populations, by examining if selection signals are

81

enriched within a set of 420 VIPs that interact with coronaviruses (denoted CoV-VIPs; Table S1)

82

across 26 worldwide human populations from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 Genomes

83

Project Consortium, 2015). These CoV-VIPs comprise 332 SARS-CoV-2 VIPs that were

84

recently identified by high-throughput mass spectrometry (Gordon et al., 2020) and an additional

85

88 proteins that were manually curated from the coronavirus literature (e.g. SARS-CoV-1,

86

MERS, HCoV-NL63, etc; Table S1; Enard and Petrov, 2018), and form part of a larger set of

87

5,291 previously published VIPs (SI; Table S1) from multiple viruses known to infect humans

88

(Enard and Petrov, 2018). Our focus upon host adaptation at VIPs is motivated by evidence

89

indicating that these protein interactions are the central mechanism that viruses use to hijack

90

the host cellular machinery, as shown by the strong focus of virologists on these interactions

91

(Enard and Petrov, 2018). Accordingly, VIPs are much more likely to have functional impacts on

92

viruses than proteins not known to interact with viruses (see SI: Host adaptation is expected at

93

VIPs). Our enrichment-based approach is expected to be particularly powerful if the ancestors

94

of one or more of the 26 modern human populations were exposed to epidemics driven by

95

coronavirus-like viruses that resulted in selection upon multiple CoV-VIPs (see Discussion). An

96

alternative that we cannot exclude however is that a different type of virus that happens to use

97

similar VIPs as coronaviruses might instead create an enrichment in adaptation signals at CoV-

98

VIPs.

99

Our analyses of CoV-VIPs find a strong enrichment in sweep signals in these proteins across

100

multiple East Asian populations, which is absent from other human populations. This suggests

101

that an ancient coronavirus epidemic (or another virus using similar VIPs) drove an adaptive

102

response in the ancestors of East Asians, which is in agreement with the current geographic

103

range of the major known animal reservoirs of coronaviruses (Wong et al., 2019). Further, by

104

leveraging ancestral recombination graph approaches (Speidel et al., 2019; Stern et al., 2019)

105

we find that amongst the putatively selected CoV-VIPs, 42 first may have come under selection

106

around 900 generations (~25,000 years, most likely 20,000 years ago or more) ago and exhibit

107

a coordinated adaptive response that lasted until around 200 generations (~5,000 years) ago.

108

By drawing upon other publicly available datasets, we show that the CoV-VIP genes are

109

enriched for anti- and proviral effects and variants that affect COVID-19 etiology in the modern

110

European British population (https://grasp.nhlbi.nih.gov/Covid19GWASResults.aspx). We

111

nevertheless do not investigate in which particular direction, as we cannot expect the British

112

population to be representative of East Asian populations in that respect. We further show that

113

the inferred underlying causal mutations are situated near to regulatory variants active in lungs

114

and other tissues negatively impacted by COVID-19. Taken together, these independent lines of

115

evidence provide support for an ancient coronavirus (or another virus that was using similar

116

interactions) epidemic that emerged more than 20,000 years ago in the ancestors of

117

contemporary East Asian populations, whose genetic signature remains apparent in the

118

genomes of the present-day populations now living in this region.

119

Results

120

Signatures of adaptation to an ancient epidemic

121

Viruses have exerted strong selective pressures on the ancestors of modern humans (Enard

122

and Petrov, 2020; Uricchio et al., 2019). Accordingly, we use two population genetic statistical

123

tests that are sensitive to such genetic signatures (i.e. selective sweeps) – nSL (Ferrer-Admetlla

124

et al., 2014) and iHS (Voight et al., 2006) – and which are able to detect genomic regions

125

impacted by strong selection across a wide range of parameters (e.g. different starting and end

126

frequencies of the selected allele). Both statistics also have the advantage of being insensitive

127

to background selection (Enard et al., 2014; Schrider, 2020), thereby reducing the potential

128

impact of false positives in our analyses.

129

After scanning each of the 26 populations for signals of selection, we apply an enrichment test

130

that was previously used to detect enriched selection signals in RNA VIPs in human populations

131

(Enard and Petrov, 2020). Briefly, for each population and selection statistic, we rank all genes

132

based on the average selection statistic score observed in genomic windows ranging from 50kb

133

to 2Mb (Methods). Different windows sizes are used because smaller windows tend to be more

134

sensitive to weaker sweeps, whereas larger windows tend to be more sensitive to stronger

135

sweeps (Enard and Petrov, 2020; Methods). After ranking the gene scores, we estimate an

136

enrichment curve (Figure 1) for gene sets ranging from the top 10 to 10,000 ranked loci

137

(Methods). The significance of the whole enrichment curve is then calculated using a genome

138

block-randomization approach that accounts for the genomic clustering of neighboring CoV-

139

VIPs, and provides an unbiased false positive risk for the whole enrichment curve (FPR) by re-

140

running the entire enrichment analysis pipeline on block-randomized genomes (Enard and

141

Petrov, 2020; Methods). For our control gene set, we use protein-coding genes situated at least

142

500kb from CoV-VIPs to avoid overlapping the same sweep signals. Additionally, genes in the

143

control sets are chosen to have similar characteristics as the CoV-VIPs (e.g. similar

144

recombination rates, density of coding and regulatory sequences, percentage of immune genes,

145

percentage of genes that interact with bacteria; see Methods for the complete list of factors) to

146

ensure that any detected enrichment is virus-specific rather than due to a confounding factor

147

(Enard and Petrov, 2020). Choosing controls far away and that match multiple potential

148

confounding factors has the effect of shrinking the pool of potential control genes, which can

149

affect the variance and also the representativity of this pool as a null control. The possible

150

impacts of the size of the control pool are however fully taken into account in the FPR estimated

151

with block-randomized genomes (Enard and Petrov, 2020; Methods). Finally, we also exclude

152

the possibility that functions other than viral interactions might explain our results by running a

153

Gene Ontology analysis (Gene Ontology Consortium, 2015; SI; Tables S2, S3 and Figure S1).

154

Applying this approach to each of the 26 human populations from the 1,000 genomes dataset,

155

we find a very strong enrichment of sweep signals in CoV-VIPs across all top-ranked gene set

156

sizes that is specific to the five East Asian populations (whole enrichment curve for nSL and iHS

157

combined FPR=2.10-4; Figures 1 & S2; Methods). No enrichment is observed for populations

158

from other continental regions, including in neighboring South Asia (whole enrichment curve for

159

nSL and iHS combined FPR>0.05 in all cases; Figures 1 & S2). Further, no enrichment is

160

detected for VIP sets for 17 other viruses in East Asian populations (whole enrichment curve for

161

nSL and iHS separately or combined, P>0.05 in all cases; Figures S3 & S4). Taken together,

162

these results suggest that coronaviruses, or another type of viruses that used similar

163

interactions with human hosts, have driven ancient epidemics in ancient human populations that

164

are ancestral to modern East Asians. This enrichment is unlikely to have been caused by any

165

other virus represented in our set of 5,291 VIPs, but we still cannot exclude that a currently

166

unknown type of virus that happened to use similar VIPs as coronaviruses could have been

167

involved instead (Table S1). The enrichment is most substantial for the top-ranked gene sets

168

ranging between the top 10 and top 1,000 loci (Figure 1; whole enrichment curve FPR=3.10-6 for

169

nSL, FPR=4.10-3 for iHS, FPR=6.10-5 for iHS and nSL combined), and is particularly strong for

170

the top 200 loci in large windows (1 Mb) where a four-fold enrichment is observed for both nSL

171

and iHS statistics (pertaining to between 10 to 13 selected CoV-VIPs amongst the top 200

ranked genes; Table S4). This suggests that strong selection targeted multiple CoV-VIPs in the

173

common ancestors of modern East Asian populations. That the selected haplotype structures

174

are detected by both the iHS and nSL methods suggests that they are unlikely to have occurred

175

prior to 30,000 years ago, as both nSL and iHS have little power to detect adaptive events

arising before this time point in human evolution (Sabeti et al., 2006)

195

An ancient epidemic in the ancestors of East Asians starting more than 20,000 years ago

196

To further test the existence of an ancient viral epidemic in the ancestors of East Asians, we use

197

a recent ancestral recombination graph (ARG)-based method, Relate (Speidel et al., 2019), to

198

infer the timing and trajectories of selected loci for the CoV-VIPs. If the selective pressure

199

responsible for the multiple independent selection events at CoV-VIPs was relatively sudden as

200

expect from a new epidemic, then these selection events should have started independently

201

around the same time. By estimating ARGs at variants distributed across the entire genome,

202

Relate can reconstruct coalescent events across time and detect genomic regions impacted by

203

positive selection, while explicitly controlling for historical variation in population demography.

204

To approximate the start time of selection, Relate estimates the first historical time point that a

205

putatively selected variant had an observable frequency unlikely to be equal to zero (Methods).

206

We use this approximation as the likely starting time of selection, although we note that this

207

method does not account for selection on standing variants that had non-zero frequencies at the

208

onset of selection (Methods). Additionally, we use the iSAFE software – which enables the

209

localization of selected mutations (Akbari et al., 2018) – along with a curated set of regulatory

210

variants (expression QTLs; eQTLs) from the eGTEx Project (2017) to help identify the likely

211

causal mutations in the selected CoV-VIP genes. There is good evidence that the majority of

212

adaptive mutations in the human genome are regulatory mutations (Enard et al., 2014;

213

Kudaravalli et al., 2009; Nédélec et al., 2016; Quach et al., 2016) and, accordingly, we find that

214

iSAFE peaks are significantly closer to GTEx eQTLs proximal to CoV-VIP genes than expected

215

by chance (iSAFE peak proximity test, P<10-9; Methods). Therefore, for each CoV-VIP gene, we

216

choose a variant with the lowest Relate p-value (<10-3; Methods) that is situated at or close to a

217

GTEx eQTL associated with the focal gene to estimate the likely starting time of selection for

218

that gene (Methods; Figure S5).

219

Using this approach, we observe 42 CoV-VIPs (Table S5 and Figure S5) with selection starting

220

times clustered around a peak 870 generations ago (~200 generations wide, potentially due to

221

noise in our estimates; Figure 2). While this amounts to about four times more selected CoV-

222

VIP genes than were detected using either nSL or iHS (both detected around ten CoV-VIPs

223

amongst the top 200 ranked genes; Table S4) this is not unexpected as Relate has more power

224

to detect selection events than nSL and iHS when the beneficial allele is at intermediate

225

frequencies at the point of measurement (typically <60%; Figure 3; Enard and Petrov, 2020;

226

Ferrer-Admetlla et al., 2014; Voight et al., 2006). The relatively tight temporal clustering of

227

starting times forms a highly significant peak (peak significance test P=2.3.10-4; Figure 2) when

8

228

comparing the observed clustering of CoV-VIPs start times with the distribution of inferred start

229

times for randomly sampled sets of genes (Methods). Note that this peak significance test is

230

gene clustering-aware (Methods). Further, this significance test is not biased by the fact that

231

CoV-VIPs are enriched for sweep signals, as the test remains highly significant (P=1.10-4) when

232

using random control sets with comparable high-scoring nSL statistics (Methods). This suggests

233

that the tight temporal clustering of selection events is a specific feature of the CoV-VIPs, rather

234

than a confounding aspect of any gene set similarly enriched for sweeps.

Figure 2. Timing of selection at CoV-VIPs
The figure shows the distribution of selection start times at CoV-VIPs (pink distribution)
compared to the distribution of selection start times at all loci in the genome (blue distribution).
Details on how the two distributions are compared by the peak significance test, and how the
selection start times are estimated with Relate, are provided in Methods.

242

The genes with clustered selection starting times around 900 generations ago are enriched in

243

strong nSL signals, as shown by running the peak significance test using only CoV-VIPs and

244

controls with strong nSL signals (Figure S6). Conversely, the peak disappears when restricting

245

this test to weaker nSL signals (P=0.53 when using the lowest 50% of nSL statistics; Methods).

246

Importantly, our estimates of the timing of selection are not biased by our use of methods that

247

rely on selected variants not being fixed in the population at the time of genome sampling (i.e.

248

Relate). When rerunning our analytical pipeline focusing only on strong candidate loci according

249

to Tajima’s D (Tajima, 1989), a statistic developed to detect recently completed sweeps (i.e.

250

fixed mutations), we observe the same clustering of selection events starting around 900

251

generations ago (Figure S7). Further, the remaining 382 CoV-VIPs that are not part of this

252

temporal cluster around 900 generations ago are not more likely to have significant Tajima’s D

253

values than controls (whole enrichment curve P=0.07). Consequently, our results are consistent

254

with the emergence of a viral epidemic ~900 generations, or ~25,000 years (900 generations *

255

28 years per generation; Moorjani et al., 2016), ago that drove a burst of strong positive

256

selection in the ancestors of East Asians, which may represent a genetic record of a multi-

257

generational viral epidemic amongst the 26 human populations tested here.

258

Although selective pressures other than a coronavirus or another unknown type of virus with

259

similar host interactions might also contribute to these patterns, we note that the signal is

260

restricted specifically at CoV-VIPs and none of 17 other viruses that we tested exhibit the same

261

temporal clustering ~900 generations ago in East Asia (peak significance test P>0.05 in all

262

cases; Methods). Further, this test remained highly significant when retesting the temporal

263

clustering of CoV-VIPs using only other RNA VIPs as the control set (P=4.10-4; Table S1),

264

consistent with the clustered selection signals being a coordinated adaptive response to a

265

coronavirus or another virus using similar host interactions.

ancestors of East Asians, we use CLUES (Stern et al., 2019) to infer allele frequency

270

trajectories and selection coefficients for the inferred beneficial mutations proximal to the 42

271

CoV-VIP genes with selection starting 900 generations ago according to Relate (Figure 3).

272

CLUES uses the temporal variation in population size and coalescence rates inferred by Relate

273

to reconstruct frequency trajectories while taking demographic fluctuations into account. Our

274

observation of sweep signals at 42 CoV-VIP genes in the ancestors of East Asians suggests

275

that the putative underlying viral epidemic likely spanned many generations (i.e. the time

276

needed for selection to drive initially rare alleles to intermediate/high frequencies). Accordingly,

277

we anticipate that selection was probably strongest when the naive host population was first

278

infected by the virus, before gradually waning as the host population adapted to the viral

279

pressure (Hayward and Sella, 2019). Similarly, a decrease in the virulence of the virus over

280

time, a phenomenon that has been reported during the long term bouts of host-virus coevolution

281

(Best and Kerr, 2000), would also result in the gradual decrement of selection coefficients

282

across time. Hence, for each of the 42 CoV-VIPs predicted to have started coming under

283

selection ~900 generations ago, we use CLUES to estimate the selection coefficient in two

284

successive time-intervals (between 1,000 and 500 generations ago, and from 500 generations

285

ago to the present), predicting that selection would be stronger in the oldest interval. We note

286

that a 500 generations interval was reported as the approximate timespan that CLUES provides

287

reliable estimates for humans (Stern et al., 2019); using smaller generations intervals, we would

288

run the risk of getting overly noisy selection coefficient estimates based on too few coalescent

289

events. However, 500 generations intervals are not adequate to obtain reasonable estimates of

290

the precise duration of the selective pressure (Stern et al., 2019), so we do not attempt to

291

estimate this parameter here, and we simply try to compare the two time periods with each

292

other. Also, because CLUES uses a computationally intensive algorithm when following the

293

recommendations of Stern et al. (2020), we base our estimates on only two of the five East

294

Asian populations (i.e. Dai and Beijing Han Chinese; Figure 3A, B and 3C, D, respectively).

295

CLUES infers frequency trajectories that are more complex than a simple, clear, abrupt jump in

296

frequency 900 generations ago. Instead, the estimated frequency trajectories (Figure 3A,B,C,D)

297

suggest that 900 generations ago is the approximate time when the bulk of the selected variants

298

reached a frequency of a few percent or more, and approximately when there is an acceleration

299

in the frequency increase (Figure 3B, D). This might correspond to the transition between the

300

establishment and exponential phases of the sweeps, and might imply that the selective

301

pressure is older than 900 generations. The initially flatter, slower increases in frequency,

302

lasting sometimes up to 600 generations ago for some variants, are compatible with either co-

303

dominant or recessive alleles, and likely exclude dominant alleles that would start increasing in

304

frequency more abruptly. Interestingly, this would be in good agreement with the rarity of

305

dominant eQTLs in GTEx, if selected variants were indeed regulatory (GTEx Project, 2017).

306

Although the flat, slow starts of frequency increases make it hard to pinpoint when selection

307

started exactly, the vast majority of the selected alleles appear to have reached 5% or higher

308

frequencies by 600 generations, thus making it highly unlikely that the selective pressure would

309

have started 600 or less generations ago. Frequency trajectories estimated in the Yoruba

310

African population (Figure 4A) or the British European population (Figure 4B) also show very

311

low frequencies 900 generations ago. The selected variants in East Asia are found nowadays at

312

very low frequencies especially in Africa (Table S6). This implies that they are substantially

313

older than when selection started in East Asia, which may then be described as selection on low

314

frequency standing variation. Intriguingly, some variants rise in frequency (up to 40% frequency

315

at most) in Europe mostly after 800 generations ago. A small number of variants in Africa

316

increase in frequency (up to 30% frequency at most) after 600 generations ago.

317

The selected mutations are estimated to have continually increased in frequency in East Asia

318

until ~200 generations (approximately 5,000 years) ago, after which they remained relatively

319

stable (Figure 3A, C). Accordingly, CLUES estimates very high selection coefficients in the

320

interval between 1,000 and 500 generations ago (Dai average s = 0.034, Beijing Han average s

321

= 0.042; Figure 5A, B), but much weaker selection coefficients from 500 generations ago up to

322

the present (Dai average s = 0.002, Beijing Han average s = 0.003; Figure 5A, B). These

323

patterns are consistent with the appearance of a strong selective pressure that triggered a

324

coordinated adaptive response across multiple independent loci, which waned through time as

325

the host population adapted to the viral pressure and/or as the virus became less virulent.

Selected CoV-VIPs are enriched for antiviral and proviral factors

353

To further clarify that an ancient viral epidemic caused the strong burst of selection we observe

354

in the ancestors of East Asians, and not another ecological pressure acting on the same set of

355

genes, we test if the 42 selected CoV-VIPs are enriched for genes with antiviral or proviral

356

effects relative to other CoV-VIPs (i.e. loci that are known to have a detrimental or beneficial

357

effect on the virus, respectively). Because the relevant literature for coronaviruses is currently

358

limited – which also applies to the relatively recent SARS-CoV-2 virus – we extend our set of

359

anti- and proviral loci beyond those associated with coronaviruses to include loci reported for

360

diverse viruses with high confidence from the general virology literature (see SI: Host adaptation

361

is expected at VIPs; Table S1). We find that 21 (50%) of the 42 CoV-VIPs that came under

362

selection ~900 generations ago have high-confidence anti- or proviral effects (vs. 29% for all

363

420 CoV-VIPs), a significant inflation in anti- and proviral effects (hypergeometric test P=6.10-4)

364

that further supports our claim that the underlying selective pressure was most likely a viral

365

epidemic. This overlap of antiviral and proviral effects between different viruses also implies that

366

an unknown virus that happened to use similar VIPs as coronaviruses could have indeed been

367

responsible.

368

Selected mutations lie near regulatory variants active in SARS-CoV-2 affected tissues

369

Coronavirus infections in humans are known to have pathological consequences for specific

370

bodily tissues, whereby we investigate if the genes targeted by selection in the ancestors of

371

East Asians are also enriched for regulatory functions in similar tissues. In light of our finding

372

that many putative causal mutations in CoV-VIPs were proximal to eQTLs, we investigate

373

whether selected mutations are situated closer to eQTLs for a given tissue than expected by

374

chance, as this would indicate that the tissue was negatively impacted by the virus (prompting

375

the adaptive response). Note that the GTEx eQTLs we use are not specific to a single tissue

376

(eQTLs are rarely so in general), and are shared between tissues. However, each tissue still

377

has its own specific combination of eQTLs, thus making the results at each tissue not

378

completely redundant. Briefly, we estimate a proximity-based metric that quantifies the distance

379

between the location of the causal mutation estimated by iSAFE and the tissue-specific eQTLs

380

for the 42 loci that likely started coming under selection ~900 generations ago, and compare

381

this to the same distances observed amongst randomly sampled sets of CoV-VIPs (Figure 6;

382

Methods).

383

Using this approach, we find that GTEx lung eQTLs lie closer to predicted causal mutations

384

amongst the 42 putative selected loci than for any other tissue (P=3.10-5; Figure 6). Several

385

additional tissues known to be negatively affected by coronavirus – blood and arteries (Bao et

386

al., 2020; Grosse et al., 2020), adipose tissue (Michalakis and Ilias, 2020) and the digestive

387

tract (Elmunzer et al., 2020) – also exhibit closer proximities between putative causal loci and

388

tissue-specific eQTLs than expected by chance (Figure 6). Interestingly, the spleen shows no

389

tendency for eQTLs to lie closer to selected loci than expected around 900 generations ago

390

compared to other evolutionary times, perhaps because the spleen is replete with multiple types

of immune cells that might be more prone to more regular adaptation in response to diverse

392

pathogens over time, and less prone to adaptive bursts restricted over time in response to a

393

specific pathogen (Quintana-Murci, 2019). Note that tissues with more eQTLs tend to have

394

more significant p-values. For example skeletal muscle has a lower proximity ratio than stomach

395

but also a lower p-value due to the higher statistical power provided by more eQTLs. Our results

indicate that the tissues impacted in the inferred viral epidemic in ancestors of East Asians

397

match those pathologically affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection in contemporary populations,

398

providing further evidence that this ancient infection might have been a coronavirus or another

type of virus that used similar host interactions.

413

Coronavirus VIPs are enriched for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 severity loci

414

Our results indicate that many of the selected CoV-VIPs now sit at intermediate to high

415

frequencies in modern East Asian populations. Accordingly, we anticipate that these

416

segregating loci should make a measurable contribution to the inter-individual variation in

417

SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and (COVID-19) severity amongst contemporary populations in East

418

Asia, and predict that such loci would be readily detectable in a reasonably-powered genome

419

wide association study (GWAS) investigating these traits in East Asian populations. While such

420

a scan has yet to be reported for a large East Asian cohort, two GWASs were recently released

421

that used sizable British cohorts to investigate SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility (1,454 cases and

422

7,032 controls; henceforth called the susceptibility GWAS) and severity (325 cases [deaths]

423

versus 1,129 positive controls; henceforth called the severity GWAS) (data from the UK

424

Biobank; Sudlow et al., 2015; https://grasp.nhlbi.nih.gov/Covid19GWASResults.aspx). Because

425

we use a different population than the ones where we found selection, we only ask, as a form of

426

functional validation of a viral pressure, if there is an overlap between the selected loci in East

427

Asia and stronger COVID-19 GWAS hits in the UK Biobank cohort. We do not look at all at the

428

directionality or the size of effects, as it is dubious that those would be transposable between

429

populations. This also means that we make no claim at all here about any decrease or increase

430

of virus susceptibility in any given human population compared to others. Furthermore, we use

431

the UK-Biobank cohort instead of the complete COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative meta-GWAS

432

data (https://www.covid19hg.org/; The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, 2020), to avoid

433

population stratification to the best extent possible (a legitimate concern with a trait clearly

434

affected by environmental factors).

435

While we are unable to precisely identify the causal variants for the selected CoV-VIP genes

436

observed in the ancestors of East Asians – nor would these variants necessarily occur as

437

outliers in a GWAS conducted on the British population – we note that it is possible that other

438

variants in the same CoV-VIP genes may also produce variation in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility

439

and severity amongst modern British individuals.

440

By contrasting variants in CoV-VIPs against those in random sets of genes, we find that variants

441

in CoV-VIPs have significantly lower p-values for both the susceptibility GWAS and severity

442

GWAS than expected (simple permutation test P<10-9 for both GWAS tests; Methods). More

443

importantly, the 42 CoV-VIPs from the selection event starting ~900 generations ago have even

444

lower GWAS p-values compared to other CoV-VIPs (P=0.0015 for susceptibility GWAS and

445

P=0.023 for severity GWAS; Methods). This result indicates that the selected genes inferred in

446

our study might contribute to individual variation in COVID-19 etiology in modern human

447

populations in the UK, providing further evidence that a coronavirus or another virus with similar

448

host interactions may have been the selection pressure behind the adaptive response we

449

observe in the ancestors of East Asians. Notably, the strongest GWAS hits identified by the

450

COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (listed at https://www.covid19hg.org/publications/) do not

451

overlap with the 42 CoV-VIPs selected in East Asia. We note however that we do not

452

necessarily expect the strongest GWAS hits in Europe to be strong hits in other populations. In

453

addition, although adaptation implies a functional genetic effect, a genetic effect does not

454

necessarily mean it has adaptive potential. The lack of overlap with the strongest COVID-19

455

Host Genetics Initiative hits is therefore not necessarily very surprising. It also does not take

456

away the fact that we found an enrichment in stronger GWAS hits on average at CoV-VIPs and

457

especially at selected CoV-VIPs.

458

Selected CoV-VIP genes include multiple known drug targets

459

Our analyses suggest that the 42 CoV-VIPs identified as putative targets of an ancient

460

coronavirus (or another virus using similar host interactions) epidemic might play a functional

461

role in SARS-CoV-2 etiology in modern human populations. We find that four of these genes

462

(SMAD3, IMPDH2, PPIB, GPX1) are targets of eleven drugs being currently used or

463

investigated in clinical trials to mitigate COVID-19 symptoms (Methods). While this number is

464

not higher than expected when compared to other CoV-VIPs (hypergeometric test P>0.05), we

465

note that most of the 42 genes identified here have yet to be the focus of clinical trials for SARS-

466

CoV-2-related drugs. In addition to the four selected CoV-VIP genes targeted by coronavirus-

467

specific drugs, five additional selected CoV-VIPs are targeted by multiple drugs to treat a variety

468

of non-coronavirus pathologies (Table S7). This raises the possibility that such drugs could be

469

repurposed for therapeutic use in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Indeed, an additional six

470

of the 42 selected CoV-VIPs have been identified by (Finan et al., 2017) as part of the

471

“druggable genome” (Table S7).

Discussion

473

By scanning 26 diverse human populations from five continental regions for evidence of strong

474

selection acting on genes that interact with coronavirus strains (CoV-VIPs), we identified a set of

475

42 CoV-VIPs exhibiting a coordinated adaptive response that likely emerged more than 20,000

476

years ago (Figure 2). This pattern was unique to the ancestors of East Asian populations (as

477

classified by the 1,000 Genomes, including South East Asia with the Kinh in Vietnam), being

478

absent from any of the 21 non East-Asian human populations tested here. By using ARG

479

methods to reconstruct the trajectories of selected alleles, we show that this selection pressure

480

produced a strong response across the 42 CoV-VIP genes that gradually waned and resulted in

481

the selected loci plateauing at intermediate frequencies. Further, we demonstrate that this

482

adaptive response is likely the outcome of a multigenerational viral epidemic, as attested by the

483

clustering of putatively selected loci around variants that regulate tissues known to exhibit

484

COVID-19-related pathologies, and the enrichment of variants associated with SARS-CoV-2

485

susceptibility and severity, as well as anti- and proviral functions, amongst the 42 CoV-VIP

486

genes selected starting around 900 generations ago.

487

An important limitation of our study is that some of our analyses rely upon comparative datasets

488

that were generated in contemporary human populations that have different ancestries than the

489

East Asian populations where the selected CoV-VIP genes were detected. In particular, both of

490

the eQTL and GWAS datasets come from large studies that are primarily focused on

491

contemporary populations from Europe, and none of the five European populations in our study

492

exhibit the selection signals observed in the genomes of East Asians. Accordingly, more direct

493

confirmation of the causal role of 42 CoV-VIP genes in COVID-19 etiology will require the

494

appropriate GWAS to be conducted in East Asian populations. The detection of genetic

495

associations amongst the 42 CoV-VIPs in a GWAS on contemporary East Asians would provide

496

further evidence that one or more coronaviruses, or another virus using similar interactions,

497

comprised the selection pressure that drove the observed adaptive response. Moreover, a high-

498

powered GWAS in East Asian populations would be required to identify the loci that currently

499

impact individual variation in COVID-19 etiology in East Asian individuals. Because of these

500

limitations, and because it would be extremely difficult to control for all the other factors that

501

differ across the world (including socioeconomic factors), our results do not represent evidence

502

for any difference in either increased or decreased genetic susceptibility in any human

503

population.

Insights into ancient viral epidemics from modern human genomes

505

A particularly salient feature of the adaptive response observed for the 42 CoV-VIPs is that

506

selection appears to be acting continuously over a ~20,000 years period, with the caveat that

507

the start of selection is complex to pinpoint as shown by the analysis of the selected alleles

508

frequency trajectories (Figure 3). The activity of a viral pressure over such an extensive time

509

period is not consistent with epidemics that started in recorded human history, which tend to be

510

circumscribed to a few generations. A possible hypothesis is that the viral pressure remained

511

present throughout the 20,000 year period, but was only initially strong enough to qualify as a

512

full-blown pandemic in the commonly understood sense, before becoming less severe over time

513

as a consequence of host adaptation and/or a reduction in virulence. As this manuscript was in

514

the final stages of preparation, the first host-virus interactomes were published for SARS-CoV-1

515

and MERS-CoV, which exhibit an extensive overlap with the SARS-CoV-2 interactome used in

516

the present study (Gordon et al., 2020). This suggests that coronaviruses share a broad set of

517

host proteins that they interact with, which should also apply to ancient coronaviruses. These

518

patterns are consistent with one or more coronaviruses driving selection events in East Asian

519

prehistory that produced the signals that we report here. That said, and as already mentioned,

520

we cannot exclude that another, currently unknown type of viruses might have been

521

responsible, that used the same interactions as coronaviruses with human proteins. The

522

cumulated evidence in this study still clearly points towards an ancient viral selective pressure.

523

Further validation of the historical trajectories of the causal mutations at selected genes is still

524

needed, including more finely resolved temporal and geographic patterns that could be derived

525

from ancient DNA sampled from across East Asia that span the human occupation of this

526

region; however, the requisite ancient samples are lacking at the moment. Nonetheless, we

527

note the geographic origin of several modern outbreaks of coronaviruses in East Asia, point to

528

East Asia being a likely location where these ancient populations came into contact with the

529

virus. Given that multiple recently recorded coronavirus outbreaks have been traced to

530

zoonoses (direct or indirect with other animal intermediates) from East Asian bats (Wong et al.,

531

2019), our results suggest that East Asia might have also been a natural range for coronavirus

532

reservoir species during the last 25,000 years.

533

Applied evolutionary medicine: using evolutionary information to combat COVID-19

534

The net result of the ancient selection patterns on the CoV-VIPs in ancient human populations is

535

the creation of genetic differences amongst individuals now living in East Asia, and between

536

East Asians and populations distributed across the rest of the world. As we demonstrate in this

537

study, this evolutionary genetic information can be exploited by statistical analyses to identify

538

loci that are potentially involved in the epidemiology of modern diseases – COVID-19 in the

539

present case. Such evolutionary information may ultimately assist in the development of future

540

drugs and therapies, by complementing information obtained from more traditional

541

epidemiological and biomedical research. For example, a recent study focusing on TMPRSS2 –

542

a gene encoding for a transmembrane protein that plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection –

543

found that East Asian populations carry two protein coding variant that are correlated with low

544

fatality rate for COVID-19 cases (Jeon et al., 2020). While such studies provide high quality

545

information on a specific gene, the evolutionary approach adopted here is able to leverage

546

evolutionary information embedded in modern genomes to identify candidate genomic regions

547

of interest. This is similar to the information provided by GWAS – i.e. lists of variants or genes

548

that are potentially associated with a particular trait or disease – though we note that the

549

information provided by evolutionary analyses comes with an added understanding about the

550

historical processes that created the underlying population genetic patterns.

551

The current limitation shared by population genomic approaches such as GWAS and the

552

evolutionary analyses presented here, is that they identify statistical associations, rather than

553

causal links, between genomic regions and traits, thereby necessitating additional research to

554

confirm causality. In addition to the various forms of empirical information that we provide here,

555

further evidence of causal relationships between the CoV-VIPs and COVID-19 etiology could be

556

obtained by examining which viral proteins the selected CoV-VIPs interact with, thus

557

establishing the specific viral functions that are affected. As a preliminary observation, we find

558

that the 35 of the 42 selected SARS-CoV-2 VIPs tend to interact with more viral proteins than

559

expected by chance (13 instead of six expected, see SI). Such information will help establish

560

genetic causality and will also improve our understanding of how hosts adapt in response to

561

viruses.

562

The ultimate confirmation of causality requires functional validation that the genes interact with

563

the virus, or that drugs targeting these genes have a knock-on impact for the virus. Notably,

564

several CoV-VIP genes are existing drug targets showing the functional importance of these

565

particular loci (Table S7), several of which are currently being investigated or used to treat

566

severe cases in the current COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be established if the other genes

567

we have identified in this study might also help guide drug repurposing efforts and provide a

568

basis for future drug and therapeutic development to combat COVID-19 and related

569

pathologies. It also remains to be established if population-specific past adaptation, and the

570

underlying selected changes at those genes, could imply different drug efficacies in different

571

human populations.

572

Conclusion

573

By leveraging the evolutionary information contained in publicly available human genomic

574

datasets, we were able to infer ancient viral epidemics impacting the ancestors of contemporary

575

East Asian populations, which initially arose likely more than 20,000 years ago, resulting in

576

coordinated adaptive changes across 42 genes. Importantly, our evolutionary genomic analyses

577

have identified several new candidate genes that might benefit current efforts to combat COVID-

578

19, either by providing novel drug targets or by repurposing currently available drugs that target

579

these candidate genes (Tables S4 & S6). More broadly, our findings highlight the utility of

580

thinking about the possible contribution of evolutionary genomic approaches into standard

581

medical research protocols. Indeed, by revealing the identity of our ancient pathogenic foes,

582

evolutionary genomic methods may ultimately improve our ability to predict – and thus prevent –

583

the epidemics of the future.

608

Ranking of sweep signals at protein-coding genes and varying window sizes

609

To detect sweep enrichments at CoV-VIPs, we first order, separately in each of the 26 1,000

610

Genomes populations, human Ensembl (Cunningham et al., 2019) (version 83) protein-coding

611

genes according to the intensity of the sweep signals at each gene. As a proxy for the intensity

612

of these signals, we use the average of either iHS or nSL across all the SNPs with iHS or nSL

613

values within a window of fixed size, centered at the genomic center of genes, halfway between

614

the most upstream transcription start site and the most downstream transcription end site. We

615

then rank the genes according to the average iHS or nSL (more precisely their absolute values)

616

in these windows. We get six rankings for six different fixed window sizes: 50kb, 100kb, 200kb,

617

500kb, 1,000kb and 2,000kb. We do this to account for the variable size of sweeps of different

618

strengths. We then estimate the sweep enrichment at CoV-VIPs compared to controls over all

619

these different window sizes considered together, or at specific sizes, as described below and in

620

Enard & Petrov (Enard and Petrov, 2020).

621

Estimating the whole ranking curve enrichment at CoV-VIPs and its statistical

622

significance

623

To estimate a sweep enrichment in a set of genes, a typical approach is to use the outlier

624

approach to select, for example, the top 1% of genes with the most extreme signals. Here we

625

use a previously described approach to estimate a sweep enrichment while relaxing the

626

requirement to identify a single top set of genes. Instead of, for example, only estimating an

627

enrichment in the top 100 genes with the strongest sweep signals, we estimate the enrichment

628

over a wide range of top X genes, where X is allowed to vary from the top 10,000 to the top 10

629

with many intermediate values. This creates an enrichment curve as in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows

630

the estimated relative fold enrichments at CoV-VIPs compared to controls, from the top 1,000 to

631

the top 10 nSL. The statistical significance of the whole enrichment curve can then be estimated

632

by using block-randomized genomes, as described in Enard & Petrov (Enard and Petrov, 2020).

633

In brief, block-randomized genomes make it possible to generate a large number of random

634

whole enrichment curves while maintaining the same level of clustering of genes in the same

635

candidate sweeps as in the real genome, which effectively controls for gene clustering.

636

Comparing the real whole enrichment curve to the random ones then makes it possible to

637

estimate an unbiased false-positive risk (also known as False Discovery Rate in the context of

638

multiple testing) for the observed whole enrichment curve at CoV-VIPs. A single false positive

639

risk can be estimated for not just one curve but by summing over multiple curves combined,

640

thus making it possible to estimate a single false positive risk over any arbitrary numbers of rank

641

thresholds, window sizes, summary statistics, and populations. For instance, we estimate the

642

false-positive enrichment risk of P=2.10-4 at CoV-VIPs for rank threshold from the top 10,000 to

643

top 10, over six window sizes, for the five East Asian populations in the 1,000 Genomes data,

644

and for both nSL and iHS, all considered together at once. This makes our approach more

645

versatile and sensitive to selection signals ranging from a few very strong sweeps, to many,

646

more moderately polygenic hitchhiking signals. The entire pipeline to estimate false-positive

647

risks with block-randomized genomes is available at

648

https://github.com/DavidPierreEnard/Gene_Set_Enrichment_Pipeline (Enard and Petrov, 2020).

649

Building sets of controls matching for confounding factors

650

To estimate a sweep enrichment at CoV-VIPs, we compare CoV-VIPs with random control sets

651

of genes selected far enough (>500kb) from CoV-VIPs that they are unlikely to overlap the

652

same large sweeps. We do not compare CoV-VIPs with completely random sets of control

653

genes. Instead, we use a previously described bootstrap test to build random control sets of

654

genes that match CoV-VIPs for a number of potential confounding factors that might explain a

655

sweep enrichment, rather than interactions with viruses. The bootstrap test has been described

656

in detail (Enard and Petrov, 2020), and is available at

657

https://github.com/DavidPierreEnard/Gene_Set_Enrichment_Pipeline.

658

We include 11 different potential confounding factors in the bootstrap test:

659

- average GTEx expression in 53 GTEx V6 tissues.

660

- GTEx expression in lymphocytes.

661

- GTEx expression in testis.

662

- the number of protein-protein interactions from the Intact database, curated by Luisi et al.

663

(Luisi et al., 2015).

664

- the Ensembl (v83) coding sequence density in a 50kb window centered on each gene.

665

- the density of conserved segments identified by PhastCons (Siepel et al., 2005)

666

(http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/phastCons46way/).

667

- the density of regulatory elements, estimated by the density of Encode DNase I V3 Clusters

668

(http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeRegDnaseClustered/)

669

in a 50kb window centered on each gene.

670

- the recombination rate in a 200kb window centered on each gene (Hinch et al., 2011).

671

- the GC content in a 50kb window centered on each gene.

677

Estimating adaptation start times at specific genes with Relate

678

As times of emergence of adaptive mutations, we use the publicly available estimates from

679

Relate (https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/). Relate estimates mutation emergence times while

680

controlling for fluctuations of population size over time, based on the coalescence rates it

681

reconstructs after inferring ancestral recombination graphs at the scale of the whole genome

682

(Speidel et al., 2019). Relate provides two times of emergence of mutations, one low estimate

683

(less generations ago), and one high estimate (more generations ago). The low time estimate

684

corresponds to the time when Relate estimates an elevated probability that the frequency of the

685

mutation is different from zero. The high time estimate corresponds to the time when Relate

686

estimates that the probability is not too small that the frequency of the mutation is different from

687

zero. For our purpose of estimating when selection started, the low time estimate is the best

688

suited, because it provides an estimate of when the frequency of a selected mutation was

689

already high enough to distinguish from zero, for those mutations where selection started from a

690

very low frequency. For cases where selection started with standing genetic variants that were

691

already distinguishable from zero, the Relate low time estimates for the emergence of mutations

692

do not provide a good proxy for when selection actually started. Thus, if we were able to

693

estimate when selection started for standing genetic variants, we might be able to observe an

694

even stronger peak than the one we see when just relying on those variants where selection

695

started from low frequencies.

696

Using the low Relate time estimates is also justified due to the fact that the sweep establishment

697

phase can take very variable amounts of time before the start of the sweep exponential phase.

698

During the establishment phase, selected alleles are still mostly governed by drift which makes

699

pinpointing the actual starting time of selection difficult. In this context, the low Relate time

700

estimates provide an estimate of the time when the selected alleles were no longer at very low

701

frequencies not statistically different from zero, and closer to entering the exponential phase,

702

which provides a more certain time estimate for when selection started for certain.

703

An important step is then to choose at each CoV-VIP locus, and all the other control loci, which

704

Relate mutation to use to get a single time estimate for each locus. Note that here we make an

705

assumption that each locus has experienced only one single adaptive event. Given our finding

706

that iSAFE peaks at CoV-VIPs are much closer to GTEx V8 eQTLs than expected by chance, it

707

is likely that the selected adaptive mutations are regulatory mutations at, or close to annotated

708

eQTLs for a specific gene. They are not necessarily exactly located at eQTLs, because current

709

eQTLs annotations may still be incomplete, and in our case we use eQTLs identified in GTEx

710

V8 using mostly European individuals, even though we analyse selection signals in East Asian

711

populations. Because of these limitations, we use the Relate estimated time at the mutation

712

where Relate estimates the lowest positive selection p-value within 50kb windows centered on

713

eQTLs. We also only consider variants with a minor allele frequency greater than 20%, given

714

the signals detected by iHS and nSL that only have some power to detect incomplete sweeps

715

above 20% frequencies (Ferrer-Admetlla et al., 2014; Voight et al., 2006). This also excludes a

716

potential risk of confounding by low frequency neutral or weakly deleterious variants, that can

717

show selection-like patterns when their only way to escape removal early on is through a

718

chance, rapid frequency increase that can look like selection. The Relate selection test is based

719

on faster than expected coalescence rates given the population size at any given time, and its

720

results are publicly available at https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/. Note that the mutation with

721

the lowest Relate p-value does not always overlap with an iSAFE peak (Figure S5), which is not

722

entirely surprising if the haplotype signals exploited by both Relate and iSAFE partly

723

deteriorated due to recombination since the time selection at CoV-VIPs was strong (Figures 3

724

and 5). Both of these methods are indeed designed to locate the selected variant right after, or

725

during, active selection.

726

Because we work with five different East Asian populations, we more specifically select the

727

variant with the lowest Relate selection test p-value on average across all the five East Asian

728

populations. Then, we also use the corresponding average low Relate mutation time estimate

729

across the five East Asian populations. We do not attempt to estimate the selection time and p-

730

value by considering all 1,000 Genomes East Asian individuals tested together by Relate,

731

because then the Relate selection test is at a greater risk of being confounded by population

732

structure. Finally, we only consider CoV-VIPs and other control genes with an average Relate

733

selection test p-value lower than 10-3, to make sure that we indeed use estimated times at

734

selected variants.

735

The peak significance test

736

To test if the peak of Relate time estimates around 900 generations ago at CoV-VIPs (Figure 2)

737

is expected simply by chance or not, we designed a peak significance test. The test compares

738

the peak at CoV-VIPs, with the top peaks obtained when repeatedly randomly sampling sets of

739

genes. We first identify the most prominent peak at CoV-VIPs by visual inspection of the pink

740

distribution of Relate times for CoV-VIPs compared to the blue distribution of Relate times for all

741

protein-coding genes with an estimated Relate time (Figure 2). To build these distributions, top

742

Relate selected mutations shared between multiple neighboring genes (CoV-VIPs or controls)

743

are counted only once, to avoid a confounding effect of gene clustering (152 selected variants at

744

CoV-VIPs, 1771 selected variants for all protein coding genes). The peak around 900

745

generations ago (870 generations more exactly) spans approximately 200 generations, where

746

the pink distribution is clearly above the blue one. We then use a 200 generations-wide window,

747

sliding every generation from 0 to 6,000 generations to verify the peak more rigorously. Sliding

748

one generation after another, each time we count the difference between the number of Relate

749

selected variants at CoV-VIPs that fall in the sliding 200 generations window, and the number of

750

Relate selected variants at all other genes that are not CoV-VIPs, weighted by the percentage

751

of variants found at CoV-VIPs, to correct for the different size of the two sets of variants. Using

752

this sliding window approach, the top of the peak is found at 870 generations, with a difference

753

of 19.5 additional Relate selected variants between 770 and 970 (870 plus or minus 100) at

754

CoV-VIPs compared to the null expectation.

755

We then repeat the sliding of a 200 generations window to identify the maximum peak and

756

measure the same difference, but this time for random sets of Relate selected variants of the

757

same size (152 selected variants out of the 1,771 selected variants). To estimate p-values, we

758

then compare the actual observed difference with the distribution of differences generated with

759

one million random samples.

760

As mentioned in the Results, one potential issue is that we run the peak significance test after

761

we already know that CoV-VIPs are enriched for iHS and nSL top sweeps, and especially

762

enriched for nSL top sweeps. This enrichment may skew the null expectation for the distribution

763

of Relate times at CoV-VIPs. In other words, there is a risk that any set of genes with the same

764

sweep enrichment might exhibit the same peak as CoV-VIP. As a result, comparing CoV-VIPs

765

with randomly chosen non-CoV-VIPs may not be appropriate. To test this, we repeat the peak

766

significance test, but this time comparing the peak at CoV-VIPs with the peaks at random sets

767

of non-CoV-VIPs that we build to have the same distribution of nSL ranks as CoV-VIPs. To do

768

this, we define nSL bins between ranks 1 and the highest rank with a rank step of 100 between

769

each bin, and we count how many Relate selected variants fall in each bin (each gene has one

770

nSL rank and one Relate selected variant). To build the random set, we then fill each of the 100

771

bins with the same number of random non-CoV-VIPs, as long as their nSL rank falls within that

772

bin. We use the average nSL rank over the five East Asian populations, and the lower

773

population-averaged rank of either 1 Mb or 2Mb window sizes (where we observe the strongest

774

enrichment at CoV-VIPs, see Results). The results of the peak significance test are unchanged

775

when using the matching nSL distribution (peak significance test P=1.10-4 vs. P=2.3.10-4

776

without matching nSL distribution).

777

In further agreement with the fact that the sweep enrichment does not confound the peak

778

significance test, the peak at CoV-VIPs stands out more when repeating the peak significance

779

test using a smaller nSL top rank limit (Figure S6). In this case, we compare sets of CoV-VIPs

780

and sets of controls both enriched in stronger sweep signals. Thus, if stronger sweep signals at

781

CoV-VIPs biased the peak significance test, we would expect the peak to fade away when

782

comparing only CoV-VIPs and controls both with stronger nSL signals. Conversely, we observe

783

that half of the CoV-VIPs with the weaker nSL signals (population-averaged nSL rank higher

784

than 7,200 for both 1Mb and 2Mb windows) do not show a significant peak (peak significance

785

test P=0.53).

786

The iSAFE peaks/eQTL proximity test

787

Adaptation in the human genome was likely mostly regulatory adaptation through gene

788

expression changes (Enard et al., 2014; Kudaravalli et al., 2009; Nédélec et al., 2016; Quach et

789

al., 2016). To test if positive selection at CoV-VIPs likely involved regulatory changes, we ask

790

whether the signals of adaptation around CoV-VIPs are localized closer than expected by

791

chance to GTEx eQTLs that affect the expression of CoV-VIPs in present human populations.

792

Indeed, the genomic regions at or close to CoV-VIP GTEx eQTLs are likely enriched for CoV-

793

VIP regulatory elements, and therefore the most likely place to find CoV-VIP-related adaptations

794

in the genome. To localize where adaptation occurred, we use the iSAFE method that was

795

specifically designed for this purpose (Akbari et al., 2018). iSAFE scans the genome and

796

estimates a score that increases together with proximity to the actual selected mutation. The

797

higher the score, the higher the odds that the scored variant is itself the selected one, or close

798

to the selected one. An important caveat is that iSAFE is designed to localize where selection

799

happened right after it happened, or as selection is still ongoing. In our case, we have evidence

31

800

that selection was strong at CoV-VIPs only more than 500 generations (~14,000 years) ago,

801

and then much weaker more recently (Figure 5). This could be an issue, because we expect

802

that recombination events that occurred after the strong selection might have deteriorated the

803

iSAFE signal that relies on haplotype structure. This is because recombination mixes together

804

the haplotypes that hitchhiked with the selected mutation, with those that did not. In line with

805

this, we often do not observe simple, clean iSAFE score peaks, but instead, iSAFE score

806

plateaus and more rugged peaks (Figure S5). For this reason, we designed an approach to not

807

only identify the top of simple iSAFE peaks, but also more rugged peaks or plateaus. First, to

808

measure iSAFE scores, we combine all the haplotypes from the five East Asian populations

809

together as input, since we found that the selection signal at CoV-VIPs is common to all these

810

populations (iSAFE parameters: --IgnoreGaps --MaxRegionSize 250000000 --window 300 --

811

step 100 --MaxFreq .95 --MaxRank 15). We then use a 500kb window sliding every 10kb to

812

identify the highest local iSAFE value in the 500kb window (Figure S8). Once we have the

813

highest local iSAFE value and coordinate, we define a broader iSAFE peak as the region both

814

upstream and downstream where the iSAFE values are still within 80% of the maximum value

815

(Figure S8). This way, we can better annotate iSAFE plateaus and rugged peaks, and take into

816

account the fact that they can span more than just a narrow local maximum (Figure S5).

817

Once the local iSAFE peaks are identified, we can ask how close GTEx eQTLs are to these

818

peaks compared to random expectations. We first measure the distance of each CoV-VIP GTEx

819

eQTL to the closest iSAFE peak. To avoid redundancy, we merge eQTLs closer than 1kb to

820

each other into one test eQTL at the closest, lower multiple of 1,000 genomic coordinates (for

821

example 3,230 and 3,950 would both become 3,000). We then measure the average of the log

822

of the distance between all CoV-VIPs and their closest iSAFE peak. We use the log (base 10) of

823

the distance, because it matters if the eQTL/iSAFE peak distance is 100 bases instead of

824

200kb, but it does not really matter if the distance is 200kb or 600kb, because the iSAFE peak

825

at 300kb is likely not related to the eQTL more than the peak at 600kb. Once we have the

826

average of log-distances, we compare it to its random expected distribution. To get this random

827

distribution, we measure the log-distance between each CoV-VIP eQTL and the iSAFE peaks,

828

but after shifting the iSAFE scores left or right by a random value between 1Mb and 2Mb (Figure

829

S8; less, or no shift at all if this falls within telomeres or centromeres). We shift by at least 1Mb

830

to make sure that we do not rebuild the original overlap of iSAFE peaks with eQTLs again and

831

again (some iSAFE peaks, or more precisely rugged peaks and plateaus can be wide and

832

include several hundred kilobases; see Figure S5). The random shifting effectively breaks the

32

833

relationship between eQTLs and iSAFE peaks, while maintaining the same overall eQTL and

834

peak structure (and thus variance for the test). The random log-distance distribution then

835

provides an overall random average log-distance to compare the observed average long-

836

distance with, as well as estimate a p-value.

837

Then, to more specifically ask if lung eQTLs at CoV-VIPs or the eqTLs of other specific tissues

838

are closer to iSAFE peaks than expected by chance, we can do the same but only using the

839

eQTLs of that specific tissue. The analysis represented in figure 6 is however more complicated

840

than just testing if CoV-VIP eQTLs for a specific tissue are closer to iSAFE peaks than expected

841

by chance by randomly sliding iSAFE values. Instead, what we ask is whether the 42 peak-VIPs

842

have eQTLs for a given tissue that are even closer to iSAFE peaks than the eQTLs of all CoV-

843

VIPs in general. To test this, for example with lung eQTLs, we first estimate how close lung

844

eQTLs are to iSAFE peaks at peak-VIPs, compared to random expectations, by measuring the

845

difference between the observed and the average random log-distance, just as described

846

before. We then count the number of peak-VIPs with lung eQTLs (19 out of 25 peak-VIPs with

847

GTEx eQTLs), and we randomly select the same number of any CoV-VIP (which may randomly

848

include peak-VIPs) as long as the random set of CoV-VIPs has the same number of lung eQTLs

849

(plus or minus 10%) as the set of peak VIPs with lung eQTLs (the same gene can have multiple

850

eQTLs for one tissue). We make sure that the tested and the random sets have similar numbers

851

of genes and eQTLs so that the test has the appropriate null variance. We then measure the

852

difference between the observed log-distance, and the randomly expected average log-distance

853

for the random set of CoV-VIPs, exactly the same way we did before for the actual set of peak-

854

VIPs. We then measure the ratio of the observed difference in log-distance between peak-VIPs

855

and the random expectation after many random shiftings (1,000), divided by the average of the

856

same difference measured over many random sets of CoV-VIPs. The final ratio tells us how

857

much closer lung eQTLs are to iSAFE peaks at peak-VIPs compared to CoV-VIPs in general,

858

and still takes the specific eQTLs and iSAFE peak structures at each locus into account, since

859

we compare differences in log-distances expected while preserving the same eQTL and iSAFE

860

peak structure (see above the description of the random coordinate shifting). One important last

861

detail about the test is that because we already found that the 50% of loci with the lowest nSL

862

signals do not show a peak of selection at CoV-VIPs around 900 generations ago (see Results),

863

we do not use these loci in this test since any iSAFE peak there is much more likely to represent

864

random noise, not actual selection locations, and thus likely to dilute genuine signals. Using this

865

test, we find that lung and other tissues’ eQTLs at peak-VIPs are much closer to iSAFE peaks

866

than they are at CoV-VIPs in general. This test thus specifically tells that adaptation happened

867

closer to lung eQTLs, specifically around 900 generations ago compared to other evolutionary

868

times. By estimating the same ratio for 24 other tissues with at least 10 peak-VIPs with the

869

specific tested tissue eQTLs, we can finally rank each tissue for its more pronounced

870

involvement in adaptation ~900 generations ago, as done in figure 6. It is particularly interesting

871

in this respect that the tissue with least evidence for being more involved in adaptation at that

872

time more than other evolutionary times is spleen. Spleen indeed likely represents a good

873

negative control as a tissue strongly enriched in immune cell types and likely to have evolved

874

adaptively for most of evolution.

875

UK Biobank GWAS analysis

876

To compare the UK Biobank GWAS p-values at different loci, we assigned one p-value for each

877

gene, either CoV-VIPs, peak-VIPs or other genes, even though each gene locus can have many

878

variants with associated GWAS p-values. To assign just one single GWAS p-value to each

879

gene, we selected the variant with the lowest p-value at or very close (<1kb) to GTEx eQTLs for

880

a specific gene, in line with the fact that GWAS hits tend to overlap eQTLs (Hormozdiari et al.,

881

2016), and to remain consistent with the rest of our manuscript. We then compared the average

882

p-value between different sets of genes using classic permutations (one billion iterations).

883

Drug targets identification

884

We queried the databases DGIdb (Cotto et al., 2017), and PanDrugs (Piñeiro-Yáñez et al.,

885

2018) for drugs targeting CoV-VIPs and peak-VIPs. For hits from PanDrugs we limited the

886

results to only genes that are in direct interaction with the designated drug. Drugs targeting

887

peak-VIPs are presented in Table S7. In addition, we present a list of peak-VIPs that are not

888

currently drug targets, but have been previously identified in (Finan et al., 2017) as viable drug

889

targets (druggable genome).
