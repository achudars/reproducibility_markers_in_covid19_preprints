Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs 1, 2 and 3) are thought to restrict

30

numerous viral pathogens including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-

31

CoVs). However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudovirus infection studies of

32

cells that overexpress IFITMs. Here, we verified that artificial overexpression of IFITMs

33

blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strikingly, however, endogenous IFITM expression was

34

essential for efficient infection of genuine SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. Our results

35

indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interacts with IFITMs and hijacks them for

36

efficient viral entry. IFITM proteins were expressed and further induced by interferons in

37

human lung, gut, heart and brain cells. Intriguingly, IFITM-derived peptides and targeting

38

antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human lung cells, cardiomyocytes

39

and gut organoids. Our results show that IFITM proteins are important cofactors for SARS-

40

CoV-2 infection of human cell types representing in vivo targets for viral transmission,

41

dissemination and pathogenesis and suitable targets for therapeutic approaches.

INTRODUCTION

43

SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Originating

44

from China in late 2019, the virus has infected more than 76 million people around the globe

45

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). While SARS-CoV-2 spreads more efficiently than

46

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the previously emerging causative agents of severe acute

47

respiratory syndromes (SARS), it shows a lower case-fatality rate (~2 to 5%), compared to

48

~10% and almost 40%, respectively1–3. The reasons for this efficient spread and the

49

mechanisms underlying the development of severe COVID-19 are incompletely understood

50

but the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to evade or counteract innate immune mechanisms may play a

51

key role 4.

52

Here, we focused on innate immune effectors that are thought to target the first essential step

53

of SARS-CoV-2 replication: entry into its target cells. A prominent family of interferon (IFN)

54

stimulated genes (ISGs) known to inhibit fusion between the viral and cellular membranes are

55

interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins5,6. The three best characterised members

56

of the IFITM family are IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM37–10. They contain different sorting

57

motifs and IFITM1 is mainly localised at the plasma membrane, while IFITM2 and 3 are found

58

inside the cell on endo-lysosomal membranes7. Thus, IFITM proteins may act at different sites

59

of viral entry and it has been reported that they restrict multiple classes of enveloped viral

60

pathogens including Influenza A viruses, Flaviviruses, Rhabdoviruses, Bunyaviruses and

61

human immunodeficiency viruses6,11. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying the antiviral

62

activity of IFITMs are not fully understood. However, recent reports suggest that they modulate

63

membrane rigidity and curvature to prevent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes12–14.

64

It has also been reported that IFITM proteins inhibit human coronaviruses including SARS-

65

CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 as well as MERS-CoV11,15. However, most results were obtained

66

using Spike containing viral pseudoparticles and cell lines overexpressing the IFITM proteins

67

and frequently also the viral ACE2 receptor. Here, we confirmed and expanded previous results

showing that IFITM proteins block SARS-CoV-2 entry under such artificial experimental

69

conditions. In striking contrast, however, endogenous IFTIM proteins were essential for

70

efficient infection and replication of genuine SARS-CoV-2 in various types of human cells.

71

We found that IFITM proteins are expressed in human cell types involved in virus transmission,

72

dissemination to various organs, and development of severe COVID-19. In further support of

73

an important role of IFITM proteins as entry cofactors of SARS-CoV-2, IFITM-derived

74

peptides and targeting antibodies efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung,

75

heart and gut cells. Our unexpected finding that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks human IFITM proteins

76

for efficient infection helps to explain the rapid spread of this pandemic viral pathogen.

78

Results

79

Overexpressed IFITMs block and endogenous IFITMs boost SARS-CoV-2 infection. It

80

has been reported that overexpression of IFITM proteins prevents entry of viral particles

81

pseudotyped with the Spike (S) proteins of SARS- and MERS-CoVs9,11,15. In agreement with

82

these previous findings, we found that IFITM1, IFITM2 and (less efficiently) IFITM3 dose-

83

dependently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry of Vesicular-Stomatitis-Virus

84

pseudoparticles (VSVpp) into transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a, b).

85

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated infection by IFITM proteins was confirmed using

86

lentiviral pseudoparticles (LVpp, Extended Data Fig. 1c). In contrast, IFITMs did not

87

significantly affect VSV-G-dependent entry (Extended Data Fig. 1d). To examine the impact

88

of endogenous IFITM expression on S-mediated VSVpp infection, we performed siRNA

89

knock-down (KD) studies in the human epithelial lung cancer cell line Calu-3, which expresses

90

ACE216 and increased levels of all three IFITM proteins upon IFN treatment (Extended Data

91

Fig. 2a). On average, silencing of IFITM expression (Extended Data Fig. 2b) enhanced VSVpp

92

infection mediated by SARS-CoV S proteins about 3- to 7-fold (Fig. 1b). To determine whether

93

overexpression of IFITMs also affects genuine SARS-CoV-2 replication, we infected

94

HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 alone or together with individual IFITM proteins. In

95

agreement with the inhibitory effects on S containing VSVpp and LVpp, IFITM1 and IFITM2

96

prevented viral RNA production almost entirely, while IFITM3 achieved ~5-fold inhibition

97

(Fig. 1c).

98

To approximate the in vivo situation, we also examined the role of endogenous IFITM

99

expression on genuine SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells. In striking contrast to the

100

results obtained with pseudovirions and/or IFITM overexpression, silencing of endogenous

101

IFITM expression in Calu-3 cells strongly impaired viral RNA production (Fig. 1d, Extended

102

Data Fig. 2c-e). On average, IFITM2 reduced viral RNA yields by ~20-fold in the absence and

103

by~68-fold in the presence of IFN-β. Consequently, the amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2

104

particles in the cell culture supernatant was reduced by several orders of magnitude upon

105

silencing of IFITM2 and to a lesser extent also by depletion of IFITM1 and IFITM3 (Fig. 1e).

106

Titration analyses showed that IFITMs do not promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in transfected

107

HEK239T cells over a broad range of expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 3). Thus, the

108

opposing effects of transient and endogenous IFITM expression were not just due to different

109

expression levels.

110
111

IFITMs enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human lung cells. To confirm that the

112

requirement of endogenous IFITM expression for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication is not

113

limited to Calu-3 cells, we silenced IFITM proteins in primary small airway epithelial cells

114

(SAEC) isolated from normal human lung tissues. Western blot analyses showed that SAEC

115

cells express all three IFITM proteins and type I or II IFN treatment enhanced the expression

116

levels ~2-5-fold (Fig. 2a). siRNA-mediated silencing strongly reduced the expression of IFITM

117

proteins (Fig. 2b) and was associated with ~40- to 50-fold lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

118

production in the presence of IFN-β (Fig. 2c). Silencing of IFITM1 also clearly reduced viral

119

RNA yields in the absence of IFN treatment (Fig. 2c). Altogether, IFITM1 was more critical

120

for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in SAEC cells than in Calu-3 cells (Figs. 1d, 2c). It is

121

thought that IFITM1 is mainly found at the cell surface, while IFITM2 is preferentially

122

localized in early endosomes6,7. SARS-CoV-2 may enter cells at their surface as well as in

123

endosomes17. Thus, together with differences in the expression levels of specific IFITM

124

proteins, cell-type-dependent differences in the major sites of viral fusion may explain

125

differences in the relative dependency of SARS-CoV-2 on endogenous IFITM1 or IFITM2

126

expression. In contrast to the results obtained in Calu-3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2e), IFN-β

127

enhanced rather than inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in SAEC cells (Fig. 2c). While this

128

finding came as surprise, it is reminiscent of previous data showing that IFN treatment

129

promotes infection by human coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Notably, this CoV was proposed to

130

hijack IFITM3 for efficient entry18. Taken together, our results show that endogenous

131

expression of IFITM proteins promotes SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human lung cells,

132

especially in the presence of IFN.

133
134

Endogenous IFITMs promote an early step of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address the

135

mechanisms underlying these opposing effects of IFITMs, we examined the effect of IFITM

136

proteins on SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated fusion under various conditions. To analyse the impact

137

of IFITMs on S-mediated fusion between virions and target cells, we used HIV-1 particles

138

containing β-lactamase-Vpr fusions as previously described19, except that the virions contained

139

the SARS-CoV-2 S instead of the HIV-1 Env protein. In agreement with the documented role

140

of IFITMs as inhibitors of viral fusion12,14, transient overexpression of all three IFITM proteins

141

blocked fusion of SARS-CoV-2 S HIVpp19 with ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells (Extended

142

Data Fig. 4a). Consistent with recent data20, results from a split-GFP assay showed that

143

artificial overexpression of IFITMs also inhibits HEK293T cell-to-cell fusion mediated by the

144

SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the ACE2 receptor (Extended Data Fig. 4b). To analyse the impact

145

of endogenous IFITM expression on genuine SARS-CoV-2 entry, we determined the levels of

146

viral RNA in the cells at different time points after infection of Calu-3 cells. Already at 6 h

147

post-infection, depletion of IFITMs 1, 2 and 3 reduced the levels of viral RNA in the cells about

148

3-, 22- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 3a). At 24 h post-infection, silencing of IFITM2

149

expression decreased intracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels by 182.5-fold and extracellular

150

viral RNA yield by 65.7-fold (Fig. 3a). These results support that in striking contrast to the

151

overexpressed proteins, endogenous IFITM expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2

152

entry into human lung cells.

153
154

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike interacts with IFITM proteins. It is thought that the broad-

155

spectrum antiviral activity of IFITM proteins does not involve specific interactions with viral

156

proteins but effects on the properties of cellular membranes5,7,21. To assess whether the ability

157

of SARS-CoV-2 to utilize IFITMs for efficient infection of human lung cells may instead

158

involve specific interactions between the viral S protein and IFITMs, we performed proximity

159

ligation assays (PLA; Extended Data Fig. 5)22. The result revealed higher number of foci for S

160

and IFITM2 compared to IFITM1 and 3 in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells (Fig. 3b),

161

indicating close proximity of these two proteins. In accordance with the relevance of IFITM1

162

for SARS-CoV-2 replication in this cell type (Fig. 2c), high levels of PLA signals were detected

163

for S and IFITM1 in infected SAEC cells (Fig. 3b). Assessing integral membrane protein-

164

protein interactions using the mammalian-membrane two-hybrid (MaMTH) assay23 provided

165

further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S interacts with IFITM proteins (Fig. 2d, Extended Data

166

Fig. 6). Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein co-immunoprecipitated IFITM2 and, to a lesser

167

extent, IFITM1 and IFITM3 (Fig. 2e). Altogether, several independent lines of evidence

168

support that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human IFITM proteins.

172

receptor. Knockdown of IFITM2 and, to a lesser extent, IFITM3 enhanced the number of

173

S/ACE2 PLA foci after infection of Calu-3 cells with genuine SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4a). The

174

number of S/ACE2 foci rapidly declined (Fig. 4b) and S/RAB5A signals strongly increased

175

(Fig. 4c) after switching SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cell cultures from ice to 37oC, most

176

likely indicating S-mediated virion fusion in endosomes. The magnitude of these effects was

177

reduced upon silencing of IFITM2 expression (Fig. 4d) and endogenous IFITM expression

178

usually decreased the number of S molecules that are in close proximity to the ACE2 receptor.

179

It is tempting to speculate that IFITMs reduce the number of S/ACE2 signals by accelerating

180

virion fusion and hence the disappearance of signals. However, further studies are required to

181

elucidate the details of the underlying mechanism(s).

182
183

IFITMs are targets for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our discovery that IFITMs

184

serve as cofactors for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that they might represent

185

targets for viral inhibition. To address this, we examined the effect of antibodies targeting the

186

N-terminal region of the three IFITM proteins (Fig. 5a) on SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3

187

cells. Indeed, antibodies against the N-terminal region of IFITM2 or recognizing all three

188

IFITM proteins inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells up to 50-fold, while

189

antibodies against IFITM1 or IFITM3 had negligible inhibitory effects (Fig. 5b). Since the

190

membrane topology of IFITMs proteins is under debate7, we verified by flow cytometry

191

analyses that the N-terminal region of IFITMs is accessible to antibody binding (Extended Data

192

Fig. 7). Further analyses showed that peptides corresponding to the N-proximal region of

193

IFITM2 that is recognized by inhibitory antibodies also efficiently impair SARS-CoV-2

194

replication (Fig. 5c). In contrast, the corresponding IFITM3-derived peptide, which differs in

195

four of the 23 residues from the IFITM2-derived peptide, and a scrambled control peptide of

196

the same length and amino acid composition had little if any effect on viral RNA yields.

197

Notably, incubation of SARS-CoV-2 virions with the peptides prior to infection had no

198

inhibitory effect (Extended Data Fig. 8). Thus, similarly to other inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2

199

infection24,25 the IFITM2-derived peptides might target a region in the viral S protein that only

200

becomes accessible during the entry process.

201
202

IFITM-derived

203

cardiomyocytes against SARS-CoV-2. To better assess the potential relevance of IFITMs for

204

viral spread and pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we analysed their

205

expression in various cell types. We found that IFITM proteins are efficiently expressed in

206

primary human lung bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, neuronal cells, and intestinal organoids

207

derived from pluripotent stem cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a-c). These cell types and organoids

208

represent the sites of SARS-CoV-2 entry and subsequent spread, i.e. the lung and the

209

gastrointestinal tract26–28, and the potential targets responsible for neurological manifestations

210

of COVID-1929. Confocal microcopy analyses confirmed efficient induction of IFITM

211

expression by IFN-β (Fig. 6a). NHBE cells and cultures of neuronal cells did not support

212

efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication precluding meaningful inhibition analyses. Gut organoids,

213

however, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 replication27 and treatment with the IFITM2-derived

214

peptide or an antibody targeting the N-terminus of IFITMs strongly reduced viral RNA

215

production (Fig. 6b). Independent infection experiments confirmed that both agents

216

significantly reduce viral N protein expression and cytopathic effects in gut organoids (Fig.

217

6c). Following up on recent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 causes cardiovascular disease30, we

218

investigated viral replication in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. In agreement with

219

published data31, beating cardiomyocytes were highly susceptible to viral replication (Fig. 6d).

220

All three IFITM proteins were expressed in cardiomyocytes and further induced by virus

221

infection (Fig. 6e). On average, treatment of cardiomyocytes with the IFITM2- or 3-derived

222

peptides reduced the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 replication by ~10- and 5-fold, respectively

223

(Fig. 6f). In addition, treatment with these peptides suppressed or prevented disruptive effects

224

of virus infection on the ability of cardiomyocytes to beat in culture. Thus, IFITMs can be

225

targeted to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells from various human organs, including the

226

lung, gut and heart.

227
228

Discussion

229

The present study demonstrates that endogenous expression of IFITMs is required for efficient

230

replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. In addition, we show that IFITMs can be

231

targeted to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung, gut and heart cells. These findings

232

came as surprise since IFITMs have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and,

233

very recently, SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated infection11,15,32. Confirming and expanding these

234

previous studies, we show that artificial overexpression of IFITM proteins in HEK293T cells

235

prevents S-mediated VSVpp and HIVpp fusion as well as genuine SARS-CoV-2 entry.

236

However, exactly the opposite was observed for genuine SARS-CoV-2 upon manipulation of

237

endogenous IFITM expression in human lung cells: silencing of all three IFITM proteins

238

reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry. Our results provide novel and highly unexpected insights into the

239

role of IFITM proteins in the spread and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that these

240

supposedly antiviral factors are hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 as cofactors for efficient entry.

241

While wildtype IFITM proteins have generally been described as inhibitors of SARS and

242

MERS coronaviruses (Ref) specific point mutations may convert IFITM3 from an inhibitor to

243

an enhancer Spike-mediated pseudoparticle transduction33. It has been reported that

244

overexpression of IFITM3 promotes infection by hCoV-OC43, one of the causative agents of

245

common colds18. However, IFITM3 was least relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the

246

present study. Thus, although both human coronaviruses may highjack IFITMs for efficient

247

infection they show distinct preferences for specific IFITM proteins. It is under debate whether

248

SARS-CoV-2 mainly fuses at the cell surface or in endosomes and cell-type-specific

249

differences may explain why IFITM2 plays a key role in Calu-3 cells, while IFITM1 is at least

250

as important in SAEC cells. Most importantly, our results clearly demonstrate that IFITM

251

proteins act as critical cofactors for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection under the most

252

physiological conditions.

253

We currently do not yet understand why overexpressed and endogenous IFITM proteins

254

have opposite effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, artificial overexpression may

255

change the topology, localisation and endocytic activity of proteins and it has been reported

256

that specific mutations in IFITM3 affecting these features may convert IFITM3 from an

257

inhibitor to an enhancer of coronavirus infection9,34. The antiviral activity of IFITMs is very

258

broad and does not involve interactions with specific viral glycoproteins6,7. In contrast, the

259

ability of SARS-CoV-2 to hijack IFITMs for efficient entry seems to involve specific

260

interactions between the N-terminal region of IFITMs and the viral S protein (outlined in

261

Extended Data Fig. 10).

262

IFITMs are strongly induced during the innate immune response in SARS-CoV-2-infected

263

individuals35,36. Thus, utilization of IFITMs as infection cofactors may promote SARS-CoV-2

264

invasion of the lower respiratory tract as well as spread to secondary organs especially under

265

inflammatory conditions. Further studies are required but efficient expression in neurons and

266

cardiomyocytes suggest that IFITMs may play a role in the well documented neuronal and

267

cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ref). Perhaps most

268

intriguingly, we show that IFITM-derived peptides and antibodies against the N-terminal

269

region of IFITM2 efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Targeting cellular IFITM

270

proteins as a therapeutic approach should reduce the risk of viral resistance and be well

271

tolerated since these factors are mainly known for their antiviral activity and may not exert

272

critical physiological functions.

Co-immunoprecipitation SARS-CoV-2 Spike and IFITMs. HEK293Ts were transfected

541

using PEI with 0.5 μg pCG-SARS CoV2 Spike-V5 and 0.5 μg of pCG IFITM1, IFITM2 or

542

IFITM3. 24 h later, samples were lysed with IP lysis buffer (50 mM, Tris pH8, 150 mM NaCl,

543

1 % NP40, protease inhibitor) for 10 min on ice. Lysed samples were centrifuged and incubated

544

for 3 h with Pierce Protein A/G Magnetic beads (88802) which were pre-incubated over night

545

with V5 antibody (Cell signaling E9H80; 5 μg of primary antibody per 10 μl of beads per

546

MaMTH assay. Human IFITM proteins and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were cloned into

548

MaMTH N-term tagged Prey and C-term tagged Bait vectors respectively using Gateway

549

cloning technology (ThermoFisher). Correctness of recombined insertions was confirmed by

550

Sanger sequencing (Eurofins). The Mammalian Membrane Two-Hybrid (MaMTH) Assay has

551

been performed as previously described23,44. HEK293T B0166 Gaussia luciferase reporter cells

552

were co-transfected in 96-well plates with 25 ng SARS-CoV-2 protein Bait and 25 ng IFITM

553

or control protein Prey MaMTH vectors in triplicates using PEI transfection reagent. Gal4

554

(transcription factor) as well as EGFR Bait with SHC1 Prey served as positive controls,

555

whereas SARS-CoV-2 Bait proteins with Pex7 Prey were used as negative controls. The

556

supernatants were harvested 2 days post-transfection and the released Gaussia reporter was

558

measured 1 s after injecting 20 mM coelenterazine substrate using an Orion microplate

559

luminometer. To determine the level of protein interaction, Gaussia values were normalized to

560

Pex7 Prey negative control for each Bait. To determine Bait and Prey protein expression levels,

561

HEK293T B0166 transfected and treated in the same manner were harvested two days post-

562

transfection and lysed in Co-IP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, 0.10%

563

NP40, 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM NaF, protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche)

564

and reduced in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol by boiling at 95°C for 10 min. Proteins were

565

separated in 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gradient acrylamide gels (Invitrogen), blotted onto

566
