ABSTRACT
The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
mediates host cell entry by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and is
considered the major target for drug and vaccine development. We previously built fullyglycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both
open and closed conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) and different templates for
the stalk region. In this work, multiple µs-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were
performed to provide deeper insight into the structure and dynamics of S protein, and glycan
functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent
joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify
multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of RBD, and demonstrate that the
exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis
instead of a commonly-used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the
impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and
antibody. Overall, our observations offer structural and dynamic insight into SARS-CoV-2 S
protein and potentialize for guiding the design of effective antiviral therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a tremendous threat to global public health.
It caused over 35 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths as of October, 2020.
Due to unavailability of antiviral medicines or approved vaccines, the current treatment strategy
is supportive care to relieve symptoms and isolation of infected individuals to reduce
transmission, which has placed a huge burden on the public healthcare system and led to
massive social and economic distress.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome1. The
spike (S) protein anchored in the viral envelope is a class I fusion protein that mediates
receptor binding and host cell entry by interacting with human angiotensin converting enzyme2 (ACE2)2-4, and it is also the target of a variety of neutralizing antibodies5-8. S protein is a
homo-trimer and each monomer has two subunits (S1 and S2) separated by a cleavage site
that is recognized by host proteases9. A number of recently published structural studies using
cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided a good understanding of the S protein
structure at near-atomic resolution4, 10-12. The S1 subunit responsible for receptor binding is
composed of the signal peptide (SP), N terminal domain (NTD), and receptor binding domain
(RBD), and the S2 subunit responsible for membrane fusion is composed of the fusion peptide
(FP), two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic
domain (CP). The three RBDs on the top of S protein head are conformationally variable. In
closed conformations, all three RBDs lay flat with the receptor binding motif occluded by the
RBDs on the neighboring monomers. In open conformations, one or multiple RBDs lift up and
expose the receptor binding motif(s).
Although the cryo-EM structures of S protein have provided crucial information about its overall
structure, highly flexible protein regions such as loops and stalk still remain unresolved.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides molecular-level insight into the underlying
mechanisms of biological functions that are difficult to elucidate only with experiments.
Recently, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and MD simulation have been used to explore
the conformational variability of S protein stalk that gives the head orientational freedom and
allows S protein to scan the host cell surface13, 14. However, it still remains unclear what
structural freedoms in the stalk portion are determinant to the overall shape of S protein and
its orientation, and how they affect the binding to ACE2. In addition, MD simulation along with
accessible surface area (ASA) calculations have been used to estimate the impact of glycan
shielding on the exposure of antibody epitopes15. Mutations of two glycosylation sites have
been performed to study the role of two N-linked glycans in stabilizing an RBD open
conformation16. Further investigation is still required to evaluate whether the ASA difference
between glycosylated and non-glycosylated structures truly reflect the impact of glycan
shielding on antibody binding, and whether glycans have more functional roles than stabilizing
the open-state RBD.
In this work, we present all-atom MD simulations of fully-glycosylated full-length S protein in a
viral bilayer, and multiple µs-long trajectories were generated for RBD in open and closed
states and S stalk built from different models. We also performed multiple µs-long simulations
of non-glycosylated S head-only systems. Our results provide deeper insight into functional
roles of glycans that provide not only shielding for immune evasion, but also contribute to the
trimer stability and transition of RBD open and close states. Moreover, our simulations give
insight into essential structural roles of highly flexible stalk conformations in S protein binding
to ACE2.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Model structures of fully-glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein
An illustrative snapshot of a fully-glycosylated full-length S protein structure in a viral
membrane is shown in Figure 1. When there are many missing residues and domains, the

initial models for MD simulations need to be carefully built and validated against available
experimental data. We have built the models using GALAXY protein modeling suite17-19 for
missing residues and domains, ISOLDE20 for refining initial models against experimental
density maps, and CHARMM-GUI Glycan Modeler21-23 and Membrane Builder24-26 for glycan
and membrane building. The head of S trimer was built based on cryo-EM structures (PDB ids:
6VSB4 and 6VXX12). All three chains of 6VXX have RBD in a closed conformation. One chain
of 6VSB (A chain) has RBD in an open conformation and the other two chains have RBD in a
closed conformation. Two models were selected for each of HR2 linker, HR2-TM, and CP,
resulting in a total of 16 structures after the domain by domain assembly. The glycan
sequences selected for 22 N-linked and 1 O-linked glycosylation sites of each monomer were
based on the mass spectrometry data27, 28. The detailed model generation is described in
reference29. The model name follows the model numbers used for HR2 linker, HR2-TM, and
CP structures. For example, “6VSB_1_2_1” represents a model based on 6VSB with HR2
linker model 1 (M1), HR2-TM model 2 (M2), and CP model 1 (M1). All 16 S protein simulation
systems and trajectories are available in CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 archive
(http://www.charmm-gui.org/docs/archive/covid19).

We have performed 1.25-µs all-atom MD simulation of each of 16 models (i.e., a total of 20
µs) each containing about 2.3 million atoms (see Methods). Conformational Analysis Tools
(CAT, http://www.md-simulations.de/CAT/) were used for high-throughput analysis of all

simulation trajectories. The root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) time series in Figure S1
show that the head region of S protein (residue 1-1140) remains stable during the simulations
with RMSD of 4 to 5 Å in most systems. The stalk region, however, exhibits highly flexible
motions at the HR2 linker and HR2-TM (see Movies S1-2), which is consistent with S protein
structures observed in cryo-ET13. To further understand the flexible stalk motion, bending
characteristics of the two linker regions, defined as θ1 and θ2 (Figure 2A), were quantified.
Figure 2B shows the distributions of θ1 and θ2 for each model. Both M1 and M2 of θ1 show
similar angle distributions centered at 150º (±15º) and 155º (±12º), respectively. The HR2-TM
region, however, exhibited different bending motions. The M1 of HR2-TM shows a narrow
distribution centered at 172º (±4º), whereas the M2 of HR2-TM shows a wide distribution
centered at 155º (±14º). Twisting motions were also dependent on the HR2-TM model (Figure
S5A). While both M1 and M2 of HR2-linker show similar twist angle distributions (𝜙) centered
at 66º (±46º) and 68º (±49º), respectively, the M1 of HR2-TM shows a narrow distribution
centered at 99º (±18º) and the M2 of HR2-TM shows a wide distribution centered at 98º (±71º).
These bending and twisting characteristics are consistent with the secondary structure
analysis. The secondary structures of HR2 linker M1 and M2 models are mostly in coil
conformations during the simulation although local folding and unfolding occur in both models
(Figure S2). The secondary structure of initial HR2-TM M1 model mainly consists of helical
structures that are mostly retained during the simulation time. On the other hand, the
secondary structure of M2 initially modeled with turn and bend shows low helicity in the range
of L1200-K1215 (Figure S3). This indicates that the flexible motions of HR2-TM linker are
strongly influenced by the secondary structure and initial model (within the current simulation
time). Although the secondary structures of CP domains are different in between two models,
they have no significant effect on the motions of stalk (Figure S4). To further characterize the
bending motions, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated for all combinations of
HR2 linker and HR2-TM models (Figure S5B). The r values of all cases range from -0.16 to
0.13, indicating that there is no correlation between bending motions of HR2 linker and HR2TM and thus each linker acts as an independent hinge.

Although 16 x 1.25-μs MD simulations were performed, it does not cover all possible
configurations of S protein especially with such flexible two linkers. To increase sampling,
utilizing the independent θ1 and θ2 characteristics, S protein orientation was resampled based
on three regions: head-HR1, HR1-HR2, and HR2-TM. First, 30 HR2-TM conformations were
randomly extracted from each trajectory (excluding HR2-TM M1 models), and their TM domain

was superimposed to the TM domain of the initial model to resample HR2 domain motion.
Second, 30 HR1-HR2 conformations were randomly extracted and superimposed to each of
the resampled HR2 domains. Finally, 30 head-HR1 conformations were randomly extracted
and superimposed to the resampled HR1 domains. In summary, 27,000 configurations of S
protein on a viral membrane were generated. Figure 2C shows the tilt angle of resampled
configurations of S protein using M1 and M2 for HR2 linker and only M2 for HR-TM. The S
protein can tilt by up to 90º towards the membrane and tilt angles around 48º are most probable.
This tilt angle distribution agrees well with the experimental observation11, 13. However, if M1
was used for HR2-TM, the tilt angle distribution of S protein becomes narrow (Figure S6). This
indicates that both M1 and M2 of HR2 linker are reliable models, but for the HR2-TM, M2 is
more appropriate to represent S protein configurations. To further understand the contribution
of each independent hinge motion on the tilt angle, S protein was resampled separately with
HR2-TM only and with HR1-HR2 only. In both cases, the resampled S protein shows a narrow
angle distribution compared to the experimental observation (Figure 2C), indicating that both
linkers are necessary for full tilting motions of S protein observed in experiment.
Flexibility of stalk may facilitate S protein binding to ACE2
To explore the effect of flexible stalk motion on ACE2 binding, we performed structural
alignment of S protein to ACE2. The RBD in complex with full-length human ACE2 in the
presence of neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 (PDB: 6M1710) was used for alignment. Fully
independent bending and twisting motions of two stalk linkers allow us to increase the number
of S protein samples. 125 head-HR1, HR1-HR2, and HR2-TM-CP conformations were
separately extracted from each trajectory with 10-ns interval. Each RBD of head-HR1
conformations was first superimposed to the RBD-ACE2-B0AT1 complex. Then, the HR1-HR2
conformations were superimposed to each of HR1 from the previous step. Finally, the HR2TM-CP conformations were superimposed to each of HR2 from the previous step. Figure 3A
shows one of the most probable configurations of S protein-ACE2 complex. The tilting angle
(θ) is defined in Figure 2, and the distance (d) is defined by an arc length between the centers
of mass (COMs) of two TM domains. As shown in Figure 3B, d ranges from 240 Å to 350 Å
and θ ranges from 30º to 60º. At the most probable configuration, d and θ are about 290 Å and
46º, respectively. Note that there is approximately one S protein per 1,000 nm2 (316 Å × 316
Å ) on the viral surface14. This sparse distribution of S protein suggests that receptor binding
can be promoted by enough space to have orientational degrees of freedom for RBD.
Moreover, it is reported that the most probable tilting angle of prefusion state is about 40º ~
50º11, 13 (also see Figure 2). This tilting angle appears to maximize the accessibility of the
receptor binding motif to ACE2 (when the RBD is in an open conformation), which could
account for the high infection rate of SARS-CoV-2.

Glycans influence RBD and NTD motions and contribute to S trimer stability
To explore RBD and NTD motions, we measured two structural features (Figure 4A): RBDNTD distance (d) defined by the minimum distance between RBD and NTD, and RBD
orientation angle (θ) defined by two points at each end of RBD and the third point on the center
axis of S trimer. One RBD (in both open and closed states) forms a U-shaped pocket with the
NTD in the same monomer, which is occupied by the neighboring RBD in a closed state.
Therefore, d estimates the RBD-NTD pocket size and θ estimates the extent of RBD opening.
The time series of d and θ in 6VSB and 6VXX are shown in Figures 4B and S7, respectively.
In cryo-EM structures available in the PDB, θ in the open-state RBD ranges from 134° to 153°,
and θ in the close-state RBD ranges from 88° to 93°. The trajectories of fully-glycosylated
models completely cover the RBD orientation angles observed in cryo-EM structures, and
explore a wider range of conformational space. In particular, θ of 6VSB_A ranges from 120°
to 170°, indicating that the open-state RBD is much more flexible than the closed-state RBD,
and it is consistent with the RMSD and root-mean-square-fluctuation (RMSF) results shown in
Figure S1. For both 6VSB_A and 6VSB_C, the simulations cover the NTD-RBD distances
observed in the PDB cryo-EM structures. In 6VSB_B, the pocket formed by NTD and RBD
(chain B) is empty due to the opening of neighboring RBD (chain A), and consequently, the
NTD moved close to RBD.
To investigate the impact of glycans on the transition between RBD open and closed states,
we built and simulated non-glycosylated head-only systems (3 replicates for 6VSB and 6VXX)
by removing all N-/O-linked glycans and truncating the stalk. It is worth noting that the RBD in
non-glycosylated 6VSB_A started to close at the very beginning of trajectories in all three
replicas (Figure 4B). In the trajectory (colored in brown), θ decreases to 110°, which is about
in the middle of open and closed states, and in the trajectory (colored in purple), the RBD
reverted to opening at around 0.25 μs. Since the transition between RBD open and closed
states is a complicated process involving the motions of multiple domains and attached glycans,
it may require much longer simulation time to capture the conformation in which the geometries
of both protein and glycan satisfy the requirement for the transition to occur. Nonetheless,
dramatic transitions from RBD open to more closed states in non-glycosylated 6VSB_A
indicates that the RBD open state is unstable when the glycans are removed. This implies that

glycosylation has critical roles in the viral entry as the RBD needs to be open in order to interact
with ACE2.

Figure 4. Motions of RBD and NTD in fully-glycosylated systems and non-glycosylated
systems. (A) Illustration of NTD-RBD distance (d) and RBD orientation angle (θ). (B) The time
series of d and θ in three chains of 6VSB. d is defined by the minimum distance between RBD
(N334 to P527) and NTD (C15 to S305). θ is defined by three points corresponding to the (i)
COM of L452 and L492, (ii) COM of N334, and (iii) COM of S1030. The ranges of d and θ
observed in available PDB S protein structures are shaded by gray regions.
We identified three N-glycans that have important roles in the conformational change of RBD.
They are attached to N165 and N234 on NTD and N343 on RBD, respectively. When RBD is
open (6VSB_A), N165 and N234 glycans on the NTD of neighboring chain (6VSB_B) are both
located below the open-state RBD (Figure 5A), which holds the open-state RBD. Although
both are near the open-state RBD, only N165 glycan has frequent contacts with RBD (>85%
of snapshots) (Figure 5C), and N234 glycan interacts with the open-state RBD occasionally
(<5% of snapshots), which is different from the findings from Casalino et al’s study16. Such a
difference could attribute to the initial models and simulation lengths. When RBD is closed (all
except 6VSB_A), the RBD forms a sandwich-like arrangement with two glycans. N165 glycan
is located above the RBD and N234 glycan is located below the RBD (Figure 5B). Both
glycans frequently interact with the closed-state RBD (Figure 5C), which makes transition to
an open conformation hard. The glycan attached to N343 on RBD orients toward the solvent
and hardly interacts with other domains when RBD is open (6VSB_A) (Figure 5D). When an
RBD is closed (6VSB_B) but the neighboring RBD (6VSB_A) is open, N343 glycan orients
toward the pocket between NTD and RBD and interacts with N165 glycan, which makes open
to closed state transition of neighboring RBD difficult. When RBD is closed (all expect 6VSB_A
and 6VSB_B) and the neighboring RBD is also closed, N343 glycan makes extensive
interactions with the neighboring RBD (Figure 5E), which contributes to the stability of both
RBDs in closed conformation The atom contacts between RBD N343 glycan and neighboring
RBD exist in more than 95% of snapshots when both RBDs are closed (Figure 5F). Given that
RBD is shown to constantly transit between open and closed states in experiment, we propose
that glycans serve as a clutch that temporarily holds the RBD in an open or closed
conformation, which modulates the lifetime of both open and closed states.

In addition, we calculated the accessible surface area (ASA) reduced due to formation of S
trimer. For example, the ASA reduction for chain A was calculated by SA + SBC - SABC, where
SA, SBC, and SABC are the ASA of chain A, chains BC-only complex, and chains ABC complex
(i.e., S trimer), respectively. The ASA reduction due to trimer formation was split into the portion
from protein only and the portion involving glycans. The trimer interface interactions involving
glycans is about 30% when the entire S1 subunit is considered, and it increases to about 40%
when only RBD and NTD are considered (Figure S8). This suggests that glycans makes
significant contributions to the stability of S trimer, which is different to the common belief that
protein-protein interactions are the only dominating factor to the stability of a protein multimer.
The impact of glycan shielding on antibody binding is overestimated
Viruses evolve to minimize the immunogenicity by coating the exposed viral proteins with nonimmunogenic or weakly-immunogenic glycans. It is commonly believed that the glycans on
viral envelope shield viruses from host immune system. To get an impression of such glycan
shielding, we aligned the S head in each trajectory snapshot and the glycan distributions are
shown in Figure 6A. Most glycans are very flexible and they move around in a wide range of
space, which covers most of the trimer surface. However, the role of glycan is not limited to
shielding. During the past decade, many glycan-dependent HIV neutralizing antibodies have
been discovered and extensively studied, which target both envelope protein and glycans31-33.

In the cryo-EM structure of S trimer in complex with S309 antibody (PDB ids: 6WPS and
6WPT34), S309 interacts with the glycan attached to N343.
To explore the role of glycans in antibody binding, we used TM-align35 to superimpose the RBD
in RBD-antibody complex structures in the PDB onto the RBD in each simulation snapshot,
and calculated the number of glycan heavy atoms that have clashes with the antibodies
(NCLASH, Figure S9). In this work, we discuss four RBD-targeting antibodies, namely B38,
CR3022, H11-D4, and S309 (Figure 6A). The epitopes of B38 and CR3022 are irrelevant to
glycans. B38 binds to the same region of RBD as ACE2 does. This epitope is fully exposed in
the open-state RBD, but when the RBD is closed, B38 epitope is masked by the neighboring
RBD in either open or closed state (Figure S10A). The epitope of CR3022 is in the inner
surface of RBD, and it is only accessible when all three RBD are open (Figure S10B).
The epitope of H11-D4 is next to the epitope of B38, and it is also fully exposed when RBD is
open. When RBD is closed, the glycans attached to N165 and N343 on the neighboring chain
are located near this epitope (Figures 6B and S10C). As shown in the distribution of NCLASH
with H11-D4 (Figure 6C), N343 glycan rarely interferes with the antibody, but N165 glycan has
high probabilities to make severe clashes with the antibody when RBD is closed. For
comparison, we also aligned a nanobody to the RBD in each simulation snapshot. Though
N165 glycan still frequently makes clashes with the nanobody, the frequency of severe clashes
is much lower (Figure S11) and thus there is a chance a nanobody can bind to this epitope as
shown in PDB id 6Z43.
The epitope of S309 is surrounded by four glycans. Two of them are attached to N331 and
N343 on the same RBD, and the other two are attached to N122 and N165 on the neighboring
NTD (Figures 6D and S10D). The distributions of NCLASH with S309 are shown in Figure 6E.
N165 and N331 glycans rarely interfere with S309 antibody in both open- and closed-state
RBD. N343 glycan has minor clashes with the antibody in most snapshots, and such minor
clashes are not sufficient to block antibody binding, as these clashes can be easily removed
with small changes in glycan conformation and orientation. The antibody-glycan interactions
can also contribute to the antibody binding, which is observed in the cryo-EM structures. In
more than half of all snapshots, N122 glycan has severe clashes with the antibody when RBD
is open, but it moves away from the superposition of antibody in the remaining snapshots. This
suggests that S309 epitope in the open state RBD is blocked by N122 glycan in more than half
of the simulation time, but it is still accessible to the antibody.

As a comparison, we calculated the ASA of S309 and H11-D4 epitopes using a probe radius
of 7.2 Å that is commonly used to approximate the size of hypervariable loops of antibody, and
compared the epitope ASA with and without glycans (Figure S12). For H11-D4, we observed
significant decreases of the epitope ASA in all chains except 6VSB_A and 6VSB_C, which is
generally consistent with the frequency of clashes between glycans and antibodies. However,
for S309, the epitope ASA decreases significantly in all chains when glycans are present. This
is contradictory to the result that only N343 glycans occasionally have only slight clashes with
the superimposed antibody when the RBD is close (all except 6VSB_A). In addition, the PDB
structures of S trimer in complex with S309 shows that N343 glycan interacts with the antibody.
In the calculation of ASA, a point on the surface is considered inaccessible even if the probe
sphere has a very tiny clash with the molecule. However, the shape of antibody is not a sphere
and it can have narrow shaped regions that extends deep into the pocket in the epitope. A
glycan like the one attached to N343 can reduce the epitope ASA even though it may contribute

to antibody binding. Therefore, in some cases, simple comparison of protein ASA with and
without glycans is likely to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding.
CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we present multiple µs-long all-atom MD simulations of fully-glycosylated fulllength S protein in a viral membrane. Our MD simulations reveal the overall shape of S protein
and its orientation on the membrane surface are determined by highly flexible stalk composed
of two independent joints. Importantly, S protein models from our simulation allow us to predict
possible configurations of S protein-ACE2-B0AT1 complex with allowable orientations and
distances between two S proteins on the membrane surface. The simulation here also provides
insight into how glycans influence the open/closed state change of RBD and the antibody
binding to RBD epitopes. We identify glycans attached to multiple glycosylation sites that
stabilize the open and/or closed states of RBD by making a high energetic barrier between the
open-closed transition. The simulation of non-glycosylated systems shows that the open-state
RBD becomes unstable when glycans are removed and the transition to close state occurred
at the early stage of simulation. By aligning RBD-antibody complex structures to the simulation
trajectories, we reveal that the impact of glycan shielding is overestimated by a simple ASA
analysis. More importantly, the glycan does not only serve as shielding for immune evasion,
but it can also contribute to antibody binding. Our work sheds light on the full structure and
dynamics of S protein and we hope our work to be useful for development of vaccines and
antiviral drugs.
METHODS
In this study, the CHARMM36(m) force field was used for proteins36, lipids37, 38, and
carbohydrates39-41. TIP3P water model42 was utilized along with 0.15 M KCl solution. The total
number of atoms is 2,343,394 (6VSB_1_1_1: 668,899 water molecules, 2,128 K+, and 1,857
Cl-); see CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 Archive (http://www.charmm-gui.org/docs/archive/covid19)
for other system information. The van der Waals interactions were smoothly switched off over
10–12 Å by a force-based switching function43 and the long-range electrostatic interactions
were calculated by the particle-mesh Ewald method44 with a mesh size of ~1 Å.
All simulations were performed using the inputs generated by CHARMM-GUI45 and
GROMACS 2018.646 for both equilibration and production with LINCS algorithm47.
Temperature was maintained using a Nosé-Hoover temperature coupling method48, 49 with a 𝜏t
of 1 ps, for pressure coupling (1 bar), semi-isotropic Parrinello-Rahman method50, 51 with a 𝜏p
of 5 ps and compressibility of 4.5 x 10-5 bar-1 was used. During equilibration run, NVT (constant
particle number, volume, and temperature) dynamics was first applied with a 1-fs time step for
250 ps. Subsequently, the NPT (constant particle number, pressure, and temperature)
ensemble was applied with a 1-fs time step (for 2 ns) and with a 2-fs time step (for 18 ns).
During the equilibration, positional and dihedral restraint potentials were applied, and their
force constants were gradually reduced. Production run was performed with a 4-fs time-step
using the hydrogen mass repartitioning technique52 without any restraint potential. Each
system ran about 20 ns / day with 1,024 CPU cores on NURION in the Korea Institute of
Science and Technology Information.
