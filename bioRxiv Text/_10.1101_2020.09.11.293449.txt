ABSTRACT
Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate
host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate
host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to
the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory.
Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to
invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of
SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)
and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from
mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on
the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of
animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding
affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones,
which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at
the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential
intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it
proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses
that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.

Introduction
Identification of the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is important for combating the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic [1, 2]. It has become well accepted that SARS-CoV-2 was likely to
originate naturally from bats soon after its outbreak, built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 shares a
96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with the bat coronavirus (CoV) RaTG13 isolated from
Rhinolophus affinis [3] and that natural insertions were identified at the S1/S2 cleavage site of the
Spike (S) protein of RmYN02-CoV isolated from Rhinolophus malayanus [4]. However, it
remains unknown how the related CoV was transmitted from bats to humans.
In vitro experiments suggest that RaTG13 also binds to human ACE2 (hACE2) and can use
hACE2 as an entry receptor [5]; thus, it could be possible that a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, e.g.
RaTG13 or RaTG13-like CoV, infected humans and evolved during human-to-human
transmission [6]. However, recent experiments show that the binding efficiency of RaTG13 to
hACE2 is quite low [7], probably due to the lack of critical hACE2-binding residues. Besides, no
evidence has shown that RaTG13 can directly infect humans in nature.
It is widely believed that the novel CoV was transmitted from its natural host to humans via
some intermediate host, during which a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 acquired the critical ACE2
binding residues and/or furin cleavage site [6]. This point of view is supported in part by the fact
that pangolin-CoV isolated from Manis javanica shares almost identical key ACE2-binding
residues with SARS-CoV-2 [8-11]. However, it is controversial whether pangolins are the
intermediate host [9, 10] or natural host [8, 11], or whether they are a host [12, 13]. Phylogenetic
analyses show that some pangolin-CoVs are genetically related to SARS-CoV-2 but do not
sufficiently support SARS-CoV-2 emerging directly from these pangolin-CoVs [14]. Obtaining
related viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive approach to identify the
zoonotic origin of a virus [6]. For instance, the full-length genome sequences of viruses isolated
from palm civets and camels are 99.8% and 99.9% identical to human SARS-CoV and MERSCoV [15, 16], respectively, thus consolidating that civets are the intermediate host for SARS-CoV
and camels for MERS-CoV. In contrast, RaTG13 shares a genome identity of 96.2% with SARSCoV-2 [3], and pangolin-CoVs only 85-93% [8-11, 13], which is not high enough to justify that
bats or pangolins are a direct zoonotic host of SARS-CoV-2.
Early studies assumed that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with the Huanan
Seafood and Wildlife Market, where one or more animals sold there may be the direct zoonotic
source [1, 3, 8]. However, this point of view was challenged by the report that the first case of
infection was suggested not to be related to the market [17, 18]. Therefore, strategies to trace back
the origin of SARS-CoV-2 should not be limited to the animals sold in the market, but should also
include a wide range of wild animals outside the market. Theoretically, all kinds of animals that
may have close contact with humans should be investigated, but this would be extremely laborious
as well as time- and money-consuming.
ACE2 recognition by SARS-CoV-2 is an important determinant of viral infectivity and host
range [5, 19]. It has been reported that many animals can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [20-28]. In
this work, we computationally examined the ACE2 usage of SARS-CoV-2 for 285 vertebrates by
modeling the binding energy between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD)
and host ACE2. The binding data correlate well with the reported experimental studies, perfectly
distinguishing the effective ACE2 receptors from the less effective ones. Our results reveal that

many mammals could serve as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. This work presents a fast and
reliable computational approach to screen potential animal hosts for further experimental analyses.

Results
A computational pipeline for ACE2 usage analysis
Since SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 to invade host cells, ACE2 usage is considered to be an
important determinant of infectivity and host range [5, 29]. To examine the ACE2 usage by SARSCoV-2, we developed a pipeline to model the binding energy between S-RBD and host ACE2 (Fig.
1). We hypothesized that an effective ACE2 receptor should exhibit a low binding energy (or
equivalently, a high affinity) while a poor receptor should have a high binding energy. A total of
321 ACE2 orthologs were collected from NCBI, and 285 of them were analyzed in detail after
discarding 36 defective sequences (see Methods and Supporting Information Tables S1, S2, and
S3). Homologous structure models were built by Modeller [30] using the crystal structure of the
hACE2/S-RBD complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) [31] as a template. Each initial complex model was then
optimized using FASPR [32] and EvoEF2 [33] to generate structure ensembles for binding energy
calculation (see Methods). The ACE2 that achieved a binding energy below a given cutoff was
suggested to be an effective receptor for SARS-CoV-2. During structure modeling and binding
energy calculation, the N-glycosylation on ACE2 and S-RBD was ignored because current
methods are not well adapted for modeling glycosylated amino acids.

Binding energy assessment and correlation with experimentally determined ACE2
usage information
The length of 285 ACE2 protein sequences range from 431 to 872 amino acids (Supporting
Information Table S3), where most ACE2 sequences are composed of about 800 amino acids
(Supporting Information Fig. S1a). Five ACE2 sequences are partial (Bison bison bison,
Thamnophis sirtalis, Haliaeetus albicilla, Fulmarus glacialis, and Panthera tigris altaica), but
there are no missing interface residues according to sequence analysis. The ACE2 orthologs share
a sequence identity of ≥55% with hACE2 (Supporting Information Fig. S1b), indicating that ACE2
proteins are conserved. Therefore, reliable structure models can be built by homology modeling.
Based on the experimental structure of the hACE2/S-RBD complex, 20 residues (Q24, T27, F28,
D30, K31, H34, E35, E37, D38, Y41, Q42, L79, M82, Y83, N330, K353, G354, D355, R357, and
R393) are present at the interface of hACE2 within 4 Å of S-RBD [31]. Among the ACE2
orthologs, the sequence identities of the 20 interface residues to hACE2 range from 30% to 100%
(Supporting Information Fig. S1c), while the sequence identities for the five key interface residues
(K31, E35, D38, M82, and K353), which were regarded as important elements to determine host
range [29], vary from 0 to 100% (Supporting Information Fig. S1d).
The binding energy for 285 ACE2 proteins ranged from -56.21 to -33.30 EvoEF2 energy units
(EEU) (Supporting Information Table S4), where a lower energy represents a stronger binding
affinity, which may correspond to a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. However, one the one
hand, it was unknown how trustable the energy values were. On the other hand, given a binding
energy, it was not easy to understand whether or not an ACE2 was suggested to be an effective
receptor. To address such issues, we compared the calculated binding energy with the experimental
ACE2 usage data. Table 1 summarizes the reported infection cases in nature, and the infection

studies in vivo and in vitro. Infection in nature represents that an infected case takes place naturally
and has been confirmed by experiments such as quantitative real-time PCR [34]. In vivo infection
means that the caged experimental animals can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [20, 24], while in
vitro infection signifies that ACE2-expressing cells (e.g. HeLa cells transiently expressing ACE2)
are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection [3]. The discrepancy may exist between in vivo, in vitro,
and natural infections due to different experimental settings. For instance, it was reported that
SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs and pigs in vivo [20], but it was shown that ACE2 of dogs
and pigs could be effectively used for viral entry in vitro [3, 35]. Moreover, pet dogs were reported
to be infected naturally by their owners with COVID-19 [23]. In this situation, an animal’s ACE2
protein was regarded as an effective receptor to SARS-CoV-2 if any kind of experimental evidence
holds.
The calculated binding energy correlated well with the experimentally determined ACE2
usage data; the ACE2 proteins that can be more effectively used by SARS-CoV-2 achieved a
relatively lower binding energy (Table 1). A binding energy cutoff of -47 EEU was able to
discriminate the more efficient ACE2 receptors from the less efficient ones (Table 1), with the
maximum Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of one (Supporting Information Fig. S2).
Among all the experimental species, apes (Sumatran orangutan, western gorilla, silvery gibbon,
and chimpanzee) and Old-World monkeys (olive baboon, crab-eating macaque, gelada, rhesus
macaque, golden snub-nosed monkey, and Ugandan red colobus) and humans achieved the lowest
binding energy ranging from -56.21 to -54.79 EEU (Table 1). Besides, a few rodents (golden
hamster, Chinese hamster, jerboa, white-footed mouse, and Arctic ground squirrel) and carnivores
(sea lion, tiger, puma, leopard, seal, ferret, dog, cat, lynx, and bear) also achieved a relatively low
binding energy varying from -53.84 to -50.62 EEU (Table 1). Three New-World monkeys
(marmoset, black-capped squirrel monkey, and tufted capuchin), rats, mice, ducks, and chickens
achieved a higher binding energy score (>-47 EEU), consistent with the reports that these animals
were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [3, 20, 35, 36].

Binding energy-based intermediate host range prediction
Based on the calculated binding energy and experimental data, we mapped the ACE2 usage
effectiveness for all the 285 species (Fig. 2). Fish (including Actinopterygii, Chondrichthyes, and
Sarcopterygii), amphibians, reptiles, and birds were predicted to have a relatively high binding
energy (>-47 EEU), suggesting ACE2 of these species may be less permissive to SARS-CoV-2
binding. Mammals showed the broadest binding energy distribution, from -56.21 to -38.67 EEU
(Fig. 2 and Supporting Information Table S4). 97 non-human mammals achieved a binding energy
below -47 EEU; that is, besides the experimentally-validated species, another 49 species were also
predicted to have an effective ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2 and Supporting Information
Table S4). These results suggest that mammals rather than other species are likely to be the main
source of SARS-CoV-2 and hence they should be the major focus. This finding is also consistent
with previous studies [7, 20, 35, 37-41], but a more quantitative measurement was given here. Our
findings also refute isolated reports claiming that non-mammal vertebrates such as reptiles could
be the intermediate host [42, 43].
The binding energy calculation did not consider the impact of possible N-glycosylation of
ACE2 and Spike. Although no N-glycosylation site is present at the interface of the hACE2/SRBD complex [31], some ACE2 variants may have N-glycosylation sites at the interface region,
which may prevent their binding to S-RBD due to steric hindrance. Thus, the analysis of interface

N-glycosylation may help refine the list of effective ACE2 receptors classified by binding energy.
N-glycosylation of asparagines occurs predominantly at the NX(T/S) motif, where X is any amino
acid except proline. However, not all N-X-(T/S) sequons are glycosylated, so the motif alone may
not be sufficient to discriminate between glycosylated and non-glycosylated asparagines. We tried
three
predictors,
NGlycPred
[44],
N-GlyDE
[45],
and
NetNGlyc
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/), to predict N-glycosylation on hACE2. None of them
could accurately predict all the experimentally identified N-glycosylation sites (Supporting
Information Table S5). All seven NX(T/S) motifs are glycosylated in the experimentally
determined structure (PDB ID: 6M17) [46], indicating that ACE2 is highly N-glycosylated. To
avoid the omission of potential glycosylation sites, we systematically examined all of the NX(S/T)
motifs for the 285 ACE2 proteins and manually checked if any N-glycosylation sites were present
at the interface.
64 out of the 285 ACE2 proteins were found to have one or more interface glycosylation sites,
including 22 fish, one amphibian, 27 birds, seven mammals, and seven reptiles (Supporting
Information Table S6). Since many mammals are likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2 and
Supporting Information Table S4), we examined the seven mammals and mapped the putative
interface N-glycosylation sites into their structure models. Interestingly, none of the effective
ACE2 receptors in Table 1 has an interface N-glycosylation site. The seven mammals were the
Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), small Madagascar hedgehog (Echinops telfairi),
western European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), aardvark (Orycteropus afer), big brown bat
(Eptesicus fuscus), star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata), and greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum), where their binding energies were -40.97, -44.99, -38.67, -48.79, -46.46, -45.56,
and -44.47 EEU, respectively. Following the binding energy criterion, aardvark’s ACE2 was
predicted to an effective receptor, but it may be ineffective due to glycosylation. The shrew had
two interface glycosylation sites, N23 and N41, which form hydrogen bonds with N487 and Y449,
respectively (Fig. 3a); the aardvark had only one interface glycosylation site at N38, forming two
hydrogen bonds with Y449 and Q498 (Fig. 3b). Since these asparagine residues could form direct
contact with S-RBD, their glycosylation may hinder the binding of the two proteins (i.e. ACE2
and Spike).
Following the binding energy calculation and interface N-glycosylation site analysis, 96 nonhuman ACE2 proteins were suggested to be effectively utilized by SARS-CoV-2; half of them
have been confirmed by experiments (Table 1) and the other half is summarized in Table 2.
Therefore, compared with the original list of 285 animals, our method considerably narrowed the
host range. The predicted potential zoonotic animals are distributed widely, including pets,
domestic, agricultural, and zoological animals that may have close contact with humans (Tables 1
and 2).

Case studies
We then analyzed several ACE2 proteins to show molecular details about why they may or
may not be effectively used by SARS-CoV-2 as an entry receptor. The first case is a New-World
monkey, marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is of extremely low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
both in vivo and in vitro [28, 35]. The marmoset achieved a high binding score of -46.81 EEU.
Compared with hACE2, there were four residue substitutions in the marmoset ACE2, i.e. Y41H,
Q42E, M82T, and G354Q (Table 3). In hACE2, Y41 could form hydrogen bonds with T500 in the
RBD; Q42 could form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of G446 and another hydrogen

bond with Y449 where the NE2 atom of Q42 acts as the donor and the OH atom of Y446 as the
acceptor (Fig. 4a, left). The substitution of Y41 into histidine not only results in a reduced van der
Waals packing energy but also disrupts the favorable hydrogen bond with T500; mutation of Q42
into glutamic acid destroys the two hydrogen bonds with G446 and Y449; moreover, the M82T
substitution could lead to a reduced packing interaction with F486 due to the smaller side-chain
(Fig. 4a, right). The loss of three hydrogen bonds and the weakened van der Waals forces result in
the poor binding energy. As reported, the double mutant H41Y/E42Q made the variant marmoset
receptor more permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection [35]. Besides the New-World monkeys, we
found that the ACE2 proteins of four bats (i.e. Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis brandtii, Myotis davidii,
and Myotis lucifugus) also have the Y41H/Q42E substitution (Supporting Information Table S7);
interestingly, they were also predicted to be less effective with a binding score of >-47 EEU.
The second case is Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica), which has been suggested as a
potential intermediate host in a few studies [9, 10]. Pangolin ACE2 shared an identity of 84.8%,
65%, and 60% with hACE2 for all, interface, and the key residues, respectively (Supporting
Information Table S4). Although pangolin ACE2 had seven residues mutated compared with
hACE2, i.e. Q24E, D30E, H34S, D38E, L79I, M82N, and G354H, it still achieved a relatively low
binding energy of -51.73 EEU (Table 3). In the hACE2/S-RBD complex, Q24 forms a hydrogen
bond with N487, and D38 forms a hydrogen bond with Y449; D30 forms a salt bridge with K417;
L79 and M82 form favorable van der Waals contacts with F486 (Fig. 4b, left). In the pangolinACE2/S-RBD complex, favorable interactions are also extensively formed. E38 could form two
hydrogen bonds with Q498 and Y449; E30 and E24 could form a hydrogen bond with K417 and
N487, respectively; S34 could form a hydrogen bond with Y453 though it has a reduced van der
Waals interaction due to the small size compared with H34; I79 and N82 could also form favorable
packing interactions with F486 (Fig. 4b, right). Therefore, although pangolin ACE2 achieved a
higher binding score than hACE2, probably due to worse contacting geometries, the extensive
favorable interactions demonstrate that pangolin ACE2 can still be an effective receptor to SARSCoV-2. Thus, the binding analysis and molecular details supported Malayan pangolin as a possible
intermediate host.
The third case is turtles (Chrysemys picta, Chelonia mydas, and Pelodiscus sinensis), which
have been suggested as a potential intermediate host by Liu et al [43]. They argued that turtles
have two important residues (Y41 and K353) in their ACE2 that are identical to those in hACE2
and that turtles in the markets were more common than pangolins [43]. Although it may be true
that Y41 and K353 play an important role in binding S-RBD, it is, however, not a unique feature
in the ACE2 of turtles and humans. As shown, many mammals have Y41 and K353 in their ACE2
proteins (Supporting Information Table S7). Besides, the first reported case of infection was
suggested not to be associated with the market [17]. Therefore, their rules for screening
intermediate hosts were not persuasive. The ACE2 protein of these turtles has ten amino acid
substitutions compared with hACE2 (Table 3). C. picta and C. mydas have identical interface
residues in their ACE2 proteins. P. sinensis has two different interface residues (E31 and Q35)
compared with C. picta and C. mydas (Table 3). In C. picta, only E24 could form a hydrogen bond
with N487 (Fig. 4c, right), while the other mutations resulted in a substantial loss of favorable
hydrogen bonds and salt bridges compared with those in the hACE2/S-RBD (Fig. 4c, left).
Expectedly, the three turtles (i.e. C. picta, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) achieved a poor binding score
of -43.61, -42.23, and -40.68 EEU, respectively. Therefore, structure modeling did not support
turtles as intermediate hosts.

Discussion
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of SARSCoV-2 remains elusive. Many animals have been reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in nature
or the laboratory, suggesting a possibly wide host range for this novel coronavirus. Currently, the
number of animals that have been experimentally tested is very small compared to the huge number
of animal species. Previous studies suggested that receptor recognition is an important determinant
of host range [5, 19, 29]. Therefore, we proposed a computational pipeline for identifying the
intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between host ACE2 and the
viral S-RBD.

The reasonability of ignoring TMPRSS2
It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and the serine protease
TMPRSS2 [47]. However, we did not consider the role of TMPRSS2 for host prediction, due to
the following reasons. First, TMPRSS2’s role for priming spike may be replaced by some other
proteases like cathepsin B and L [48]. Second, different from ACE2 which is used as a binding
receptor only, TMPRSS2 cleaves Spike through chemical catalysis. Thus, to quantify the impact
of TMPRSS2, its catalytic activity for cleavage needs to be predicted; this is, however, an
impossible task to achieve at present, as almost all protease cleavage predictors were trained to
predict cleavage sites for one known protease of one species [49]. Third, TMPRSS2 proteases from
different species may be similarly efficient. This is supported in part by the fact that wild-type
mice are insusceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while transgenic mice that express hACE2 can be infected
[50], suggesting that mouse TMPRSS2 may be sufficiently efficient at cleaving Spike. Besides, a
recent study showed that computational modeling failed to distinguish the binding capability of
TMPRSS2 from different animals [41]. As a result, we believe that it may be reasonable to ignore
TMPRSS2 for host prediction.

ACE2 Sequence analysis alone is not accurate enough for host identification
Built on the fact that hACE2 is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, many previous studies
only performed sequence analyses and used the sequence identity between animal ACE2 proteins
and hACE2 to predict intermediate hosts [38, 43, 51], as it is believed that the ACE2 proteins that
are similar to hACE2 may also be susceptible [6, 29]. We calculated the MCCs for distinguishing
experimentally determined effective ACE2 receptors from the less effective ones listed in Table 1
using sequence identity. The maximum MCCs were 0.51,0.73, and 0.53 with the optimum
sequence identity cutoff of 66%-78%, 61%~65%, and ≤60% in terms of all, interface, and key
residues, respectively (Supporting Information Fig. S3), which were much lower than that
achieved by the classification via binding energy assessment (Supporting Information Fig. S2).
Four New-World monkeys (Sapajus apella, Aotus nancymaae, Saimiri boliviensis, and Callithrix
jacchus) share a relatively high sequence identity of >92%, 80%, and 80% with hACE2 in terms
of all, interface, and key residues, respectively (Supporting Information Tables S4 and S7).
Following the optimum sequence identity cutoffs, the ACE2 proteins of these New-World
monkeys were predicted to be very effective receptors. However, in vivo infection studies showed
C. jacchus was not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [28]; in vitro experiments also suggested that the
ACE2 proteins of S. apella, S. boliviensis, and C. jacchus cannot be used by SARS-CoV-2 [35].

In contrast, dogs, cats, and ferrets, which have a much lower sequence identity to hACE2 than the
new-world monkeys (Supporting Information Table S4), can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in
nature and/or in vivo [20-24]. These results suggest that an ACE2 protein with a higher sequence
identity to hACE2 is not necessarily an effective receptor, whereas those with a lower identity is
not necessarily a poor one. Therefore, sequence identity between hACE2 and animal ACE2 may
not be a good descriptor for host identification.

Binding energy is a better descriptor for host prediction
As indicated by the high MCC achieved (Supporting Information Fig. S2), structure-based
binding energy assessment was more accurate than sequence identity for distinguishing
experimentally confirmed species, provided that high-quality structure models were used.
Critically, the structure models are very likely to be very reliable given the high sequence similarity
between hACE2 and the ACE2 orthologs and the application of advanced structure modeling tools
[30, 32].
Moreover, we argued that it is critical to model binding energy using structure ensembles rather
than a single model. We found that the binding scores that were calculated for different models of
the same ACE2/S-RBD complex fluctuated considerably (Supporting Information Fig. S4). The
maximum MCC of the classification by the binding energy derived from the first model was only
about 0.63 (Supporting Information Fig. S5), suggesting a single model was not sufficiently
accurate for the classification even if a perfect scoring function is available. To circumvent the
randomness of binding energy from a single model, we evaluated a large ensemble of structure
models (e.g. 500 models in this work) for each complex and took the lowest binding score as the
binding energy for ACE2 usage analysis. With a proper threshold (i.e. -47 EEU), the binding
energy calculated in this way correlated well with experimental data, perfectly distinguishing the
experimentally determined effective ACE2 receptors from the less effective ones with the

Identification and screening of potential zoonotic origins
The most definitive strategy to identify the direct zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 is to isolate
related viruses from animal sources [6]. Unlike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, whose direct
zoonotic origins were identified to be civets [15] and camels [16], respectively, soon after their
outbreak, the clue for SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive as the first reported case of infection was
suggested not to be associated with the Huanan Seafood and Wildlife Market [17, 18]. As a result,
a large number of animals have to be sampled to isolate viral strains that are highly similar to
SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. >99% genome identity); this is a formidable task that would require extensive
effort. In this regard, our work presents a fast, yet reliable approach for screening potential animals
for further analysis.
Our result suggests that many mammals are likely to be potential intermediate hosts of SARSCoV-2, which is consistent with a few recent studies [35, 37, 52]. Here, the ACE2 proteins of 285
species were assessed because their sequences were of good quality. In reality, there are more
animals whose ACE2 proteins have not been sequenced yet. Thus, although 96 mammals in this
study were predicted to have an effective ACE2 receptor capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 Spike,
it does not necessarily mean that the real intermediate host must be one of them. The list may be
further screened by considering the living environment of animals. For instance, some mammals

like whales and dolphins live in the water, and therefore the chance for them to transmit bat viruses
to humans may be extremely low, considering that bats are terrestrial animals.

Conclusion
The direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of SARS-CoV-2 that caused the COVID-19
pandemic remains elusive. In this work, we developed a computational pipeline to facilitate the
identification of potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity
between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain and the ACE2 protein of host animals.
The effectiveness of this method was verified by its performance on perfectly distinguishing the
experimentally determined effective ACE2 receptors from the less effective ones with a maximum
Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of one. Although the sequence identity-based descriptors
have been widely used for predicting intermediate hosts, our results showed that their performance
for discriminating between effective and less effective receptors was much worse than the bindingaffinity based approach proposed here by achieving a maximum MCC of 0.73. Our results reveal
that SARS-CoV-2 may have a broad host range and a few mammals, especially some primates,
rodents, and carnivores, rather than the non-mammal animals could be potential hosts of SARSCoV-2. Besides, as a supplementarity of our previous pangolin coronavirus genome assembly
studies, the detailed structural modeling here also supported pangolins as a possible intermediate
host with molecular-level insights. Since these animals are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV2, continuous monitoring of viral circulation in these animals is very important for disease control
and wildlife protection efforts.

Materials and methods
Collection and examination of ACE2 orthologs
A list of ACE2 orthologs from 318 vertebrate species was downloaded from the NCBI website
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59272/ortholog/?scope=7742). Besides these, we also
considered the ACE2 orthologs from three mammals that are not included in this list, namely, palm
civets, raccoon dogs, and Chinese rufous horseshoe bats, as civets and raccoon dogs were
suggested to be intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV [15]. Additionally, it was shown that the ACE2
proteins of civets and horseshoe bats can also be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for viral entry in celllevel experiments [3].
Among the 321 ACE2 orthologs, 30 sequences had one or more amino acids that were either
nonstandard or incorrectly parsed, i.e. annotated as ‘X’, and thus these ACE2 orthologs were
excluded from the detailed analysis (Supporting Information Table S1). Moreover, sequence
alignment analysis (see below) showed that the ACE2 proteins of six species had five or more
missing S-RBD binding residues (Supporting Information Table S2), i.e. Acanthisitta chloris
(protein accession ID: XP_009082150.1), Apteryx mantelli mantelli (XP_013805736.1), Salmo
salar (XP_014062928.1), Rhinopithecus bieti (XP_017744069.1), Leptonychotes weddellii
(XP_030886750.1), and Petromyzon marinus (XP_032835032.1). Subsequent binding analysis
(see below) showed that these ACE2 receptors had a much higher binding energy (and thus a lower
binding capability) than the others (Supporting Information Table S2), partly because of the

incomplete binding interface. Therefore, we cannot suggest whether these animals are susceptible
to SARS-CoV-2 based on the defective information.
The remaining 285 ACE2 orthologs are summarized in Supporting Information Table S3,
including 134 mammals (Mammalia), 57 birds (Aves), 69 fish (Actinopterygii (66),
Chondrichthyes (2), and Sarcopterygii (1)), 20 reptiles (Reptilia), and five amphibians (Amphibia).
The protein ID, scientific classification (Class and Species), and common name are provided for
easy retrieval.

Sequence analyses
291 ACE2 sequences, including the six ACE2 proteins with missing S-RBD binding residues
in Supporting Information Table S2, were subjected to multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
analysis using Clustal Omega [53] with default parameters. Pairwise sequence identities between
the full-length sequence of hACE2 (accession ID: NP_001358344.1) and the other ACE2
sequences were calculated based on the MSAs. Besides the full-length sequence identities, the
sequence identities for the 20 interface residues [31] and five critical S-RBD binding residues [29]
were also calculated from the MSAs. The results for these three types of sequence identities are
shown in Supporting Information Table S4.

Structure modeling
It should be mentioned that in reality, the ACE2 receptors of some animals may not bind to
S-RBD. However, to quantitatively compare the capability of different ACE2 receptors to bind to
S-RBD, we first constructed initial ACE2/S-RBD complex models through homology modeling,
assuming that all the ACE2 receptors could bind to S-RBD, and then computed the binding
energies between the two partners.
Pairwise sequence alignments between hACE2 and the other ACE2 orthologs were extracted
from the MSAs and trimmed accordingly, as hACE2 was not full-length in the template complex
(PDB ID: 6m0j) [31]. The trimming should not affect binding analysis because it was shown that
the protein-protein interface is unabridged in the experimentally determined hACE2/S-RBD
complex structures [5, 31, 54]. We utilized Modeller v9.24 [30] to build the initial putative
complex models. Each model was first optimized with the variable target function method (VTFM)
with conjugate gradients (CG) using parameters library_schedule = autosched.slow and
max_var_iterations = 300, and then refined using molecular dynamics (MD) with simulated
annealing (SA) using parameter settings md_level = refine.slow. The whole cycle was repeated
two times and was not stopped unless the objective function was >1e6 (parameter settings:
repeat_optimization = 2 and max_molpdf = 1e6). For each ACE2/S-RBD pair, 100 initial
Modeller complex models were constructed.

Binding energy calculation
Before binding energy calculation, each Modeller complex model was first repacked using
FASPR [32] to eliminate rotamer outliers and then the interface residue side-chain conformations
were thoroughly refined (both for ACE2 and S-RBD) using the EvoEF2 force field in conjunction
with a simulated annealing Monte Carlo (SAMC) optimization procedure [33, 55], which was also
utilized for anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptide design [56]. During the side-chain refinement process, both

the ACE2 and S-RBD sequences were kept fixed, while the different rotameric side-chain
conformations were sampled. Since a stochastic SAMC optimization procedure was used,
obtaining the global energy minimum may not always be guaranteed. Therefore, the optimization
of the interface residues was performed five times independently to generate five refined lowenergy models. Hence, for each ACE2/S-RBD pair, 500 final models were generated and scored
using EvoEF2 [33]. The minimum binding interaction score achieved among all 500 complex
models was regarded as the binding energy.

Fig. 1. A computational pipeline for ACE2 usage analysis. 321 ACE2 orthologs are downloaded
from NCBI. The crystal structure of the hACE2/S-RBD complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) was used as a
template for homology modeling. For each ACE2/S-RBD pair, 100 initial Modeller complex
models were constructed and repacked by FASPR, and then five models were generated by
EvoEF2/SAMC remodeling for each FASPR model. The binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) was set to
be -47 EvoEF2 energy units.
Fig. 2. Mapping the calculated binding energy to 285 vertebrates. The ACE2 proteins are
categorized by their animal Class (Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Aves, Chondrichthyes, Mammalia,
Reptilia, and Sarcopterygii) and ranked by the binding energy from low to high in each Class. The
ACE2 proteins that are experimentally shown to be effective or less effective to SARS-CoV-2 are
shown in squares and triangles, respectively, while the others are shown in circles. Susceptible and
insusceptible animals are highlighted in black and gray, respectively.
Fig. 3. Putative N-glycosylation sites at the interface of two example ACE2/S-RBD complex
structures. (a) Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus); and (b) Aardvark (Orycteropus afer).
ACE2 and S-RBD are shown in green and cyan cartoons, respectively. The potential interface Nglycosylation motifs are shown with the asparagine residues highlighted in spheres.
Fig. 4. Comparison of the mutated interface between hACE2/S-RBD and animal-ACE2/S-RBD.
(a) hACE2/S-RBD versus marmoset-ACE2/S-RBD; (b) hACE2/S-RBD versus pangolin-ACE2/SRBD; and (c) hACE2/S-RBD versus turtle-ACE2/S-RBD. Residues in ACE2 and S-RBD are
shown in magenta and yellow, respectively. Hydrogen bonds are shown in green dashed-lines.
