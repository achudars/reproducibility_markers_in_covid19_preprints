Abstract

15

The coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2, has posed serious

16

threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt

17

development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we firstly verified that

18

SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high

19

membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1)

20

sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased α-helicity

21

and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2

22

(HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed

23

IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S

24

protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the

25

SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR)

26

of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid

27

motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have

28

provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the

29

design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.

Introduction

34

In late December of 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, China. The

35

pathogen was soon identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV) (1-3), which was initially termed

36

2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the disease was named COVID-19

37

(2019 Coronavirus Disease). Because 2019-nCoV shares a high sequence identity to the

38

previously emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and the same cell

39

receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for infection, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2

40

by the Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of

41

Viruses (ICTV). As of 26 March 2020, a total of 416,686 confirmed COVID-19 cases,

42

including

43

(www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). The pandemic has posed

44

serious threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the urgent

45

development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.

46

CoVs, a large group of enveloped viruses with a single positive-stranded RNA genome,

47

are genetically classified into four genera: α-, β-, γ-, and δ-CoVs (4, 5). The previously known

48

six CoVs that cause human disease include two α-CoVs (NL63; 229E) and four β-CoVs

49

(OC43; HKU1; SARS-CoV; MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-CoV genus and

50

represents the seventh human CoV. Like other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 use a glycosylated,

51

homotrimeric class I fusion spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells (6-8). The S protein

52

comprises of S1 and S2 subunits and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation. The S1

53

subunit, which contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) capable of functional folding

54

independently, is responsible for virus binding to the cell surface receptor. A recent study

55

suggested that ACE2-binding affinity of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is up to 20-fold higher

56

than that of SARS-CoV, which may contribute to the significantly increased infectivity and

57

transmissibility (6). The receptor-binding deem to trigger large conformational changes in the

58

S complex, which destabilize the prefusion trimer resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and

59

activate the fusogenic activity of the S2 subunit (9-11). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the sequence

60

structure of S2 contains an N-terminal fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad

61

repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane region (TM), and cytoplasmic tail (CT). During the fusion

62

process, the FP is exposed and inserts into the target cell membrane, leading S2 in a

63

prehairpin intermediate that bridges the viral and cell membranes; then, three HR1 segments

64

self-assemble a trimeric coiled-coil and three HR2 segments fold into the grooves on the

65

surface of the HR1 inner core, thereby resulting a six-helical bundle (6-HB) structure that

66

drives the two membranes in close apposition for fusion.

67

Peptides derived from the HR1 and HR2 sequences of the class I viral fusion proteins

68

have been demonstrated to possess antiviral activity through binding to the prehairpin

69

intermediate thus blocking the formation of viral 6-HB core (12). Such are indeed the cases

70

for emerging CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (10, 13-15). In response to the

71

outbreak of SARS-CoV, a group of HR2-based peptides that could effectively inhibit viral

72

infection were developed (10, 15-18). Recently, a pan-CoV fusion inhibitor, designated EK1,

73

was created, which showed inhibitory activities against diverse HCoVs, including SARS-CoV,

74

MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 (19). However, the previously

75

reported fusion inhibitor peptides often display low antiviral activities, with a 50% inhibitory

76

concentration (IC50) at macromolar (μM) range. In the past decade, we have dedicated our

77

efforts to develop viral fusion inhibitors with improved pharmaceutical profiles, generating a

78

group of lipopeptides with extremely potent antiviral activity (20-25). To fighting the

79

COVID-19 pandemic, here we have applied our expertise to develop fusion inhibitors against

80

SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that different from that of SARS-CoV, the S protein of

81

SARS-CoV-2 has a high cell fusion activity; then, we designed and characterized several

82

lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitors with highly potent activities in inhibiting both

83

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

Results

86

SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor and its S protein displays high fusion activity

87

In the earlier time point, we would like to experimentally verify whether SARS-CoV-2 uses

88

human ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry, thus we generated its S protein pseudotyped

89

lentiviral particles. The SARS-CoV and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) pseudoviruses

90

were also prepared for comparison. As shown in Fig. 2A, all of three pseudoviruses

91

efficiently infected 293T cells that stably overexpress ACE2 (293T/ACE2); however, the

92

infectivity SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV dramatically decreased in 239T cells which express

93

a low level of endogenous ACE2. As a virus control, VSV-G pesudovirus entered 239T cells

94

even more efficiently relative its infectivity in 293T/ACE2 cells.

95

We further compared the fusion activity of viral S protein in 293T and 293T/ACE2 cells

96

by applying a DSP-based cell-cell fusion assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, both the S proteins of

97

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV displayed a weak fusion activity in 293T cells, but they

98

showed significantly increased capacities to mediate cell fusion with 293T/ACE2 cells. These

99

results demonstrated that overexpression of ACE2 can promote the cell entry of both the

100

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as the S protein-mediated cell-cell

101

fusion activity, verifying the functionality of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2.

102

In both the 239T and 293T/ACE2 target cells, we observed that the S protein of

103

SARS-CoV-2 had a significantly increased fusion activity than the S protein of SARS-CoV.

104

Therefore, we further compared the fusion activities of viral S proteins at different time points.

105

As shown in Fig. 2C and 2D, the SARS-CoV S protein exhibited had no appreciable fusion

106

activity until the effector cells and target cells were cocultured for five or six hours; in sharp

107

contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein mediated a rapid and robust cell fusion reaction, as

108

indicated by its fusion kinetic curves especially in 293T/ACE2 cells.

109

Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 might possess an enhanced HR1-HR2

110

interaction

111

Similar to many class I fusion proteins, the interaction between the HR1 and HR2 domains of

112

the CoV fusion protein S2 critically determines viral membrane fusion activity. Comparing to

113

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a HR1 sequence with nine amino acid substitutions, and of

114

them eight are located within the HR1 core site; whereas, two viruses share a fully identical

115

HR2 sequence (Fig. 3A). In order to explore the mechanism underlying the highly active

116

fusion activity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we synthesized two peptides corresponding to

117

the HR1 sequence and their secondary structures were determined by circular dichroism (CD)

118

spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3B, the HR1 peptide derived from SARS-CoV-2, designated

119

SARS2NP, showed a typical α-helical conformation with the helix contents of 66%, whereas

120

the HR1 peptide from SARS-CoV, designated SARS1NP, had α-helical contents of 41%. The

121

thermal stability of the two peptides was further measured. As shown in Fig. 3C, SARS2NP

122

and SARS1NP exhibited their melting temperature (Tm) values of 48 and 40oC, respectively.

123

Furthermore, we synthesized a peptide containing the HR2 sequence, termed IPB01, and its

124

interactions with the two HR1 peptides were analyzed by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig.

125

3D and E, both the SARS2NP and SARS1NP interacted with IPB01 to form complexes with

126

typical α-helical structures, having the Tm values of 75 and 68 oC, respectively. In comparison,

127

the complex formed by SARS2NP and IPB01 was much more stable than the complex

128

between the SARS1NP and IPB01 peptides. Taken together, these results suggested that

129

SARS-CoV-2 might evolve an increased interaction between the HR1 and HR2 domains in

130

the S2 fusion protein thus critically determining its high fusogenic activity.

131

Cholesterylated peptide exhibits greatly increased α-helical stability and target-binding

132

affinity

133

Emerging studies demonstrate that lipid conjugation is a viable strategy to design

134

peptide-based viral fusion inhibitors with enhanced antiviral activity and in vivo stability. The

135

resulting lipopeptides are considered to interact preferentially with the viral and cell

136

membranes, thus raising the local concentration of the inhibitors at the site where viral fusion

137

occurs (20-25). According to our previous experiences, here we modified the HR2 peptide

138

IBP01 by adding a cholesterol group to its C-terminal, resulting in a lipopeptide termed

139

IPB02, as illustrated in Fig. 1B. We first applied CD spectroscopy to determine the structural

140

properties of the inhibitors in the absence or presence of a target mimic HR1 peptide. As

141

shown in Fig. 4A and 4B, the unconjugated IPB01 alone was largely in a random structure

142

and its Tm value could not be defined. By contrast, the lipopeptide IPB02 displayed markedly

143

increased helix contents with a Tm of 65 oC. Next, we assessed the helical binding stability of

144

the inhibitors with the two target mimic peptides, SARS2NP and SARS1NP. As shown in Fig.

145

4C to 4F, the lipopeptide-based complexes had sharply increased thermostabilities compared

146

to the complexes formed by the template peptides. Specifically, the IPB02 and SARS2NP

147

complex showed a Tm of 89oC, which was 14oC higher than the IPB01 and SARS2NP

148

complex (75oC); the IPB02 and SARS1NP complex also had a Tm of 89oC, indicating a 21oC

149

increase relative to the IPB0-based complex (68oC). Here the CD results demonstrated that

150

the cholesterol conjugated peptide IPB02 possesses significantly increased α-helical

151

thermostability and target-binding affinity.

152

We also visualized the formed complexes by a native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis

153

(PAGE) method. As shown in Fig. 5, the positively charged SARS2NP and SARS1NP might

154

migrate up and off the gel thus no bands appeared, whereas IPB01 and IPB02 showed specific

155

bands because they carried net negative charges. When a HR1 peptide and an inhibitor were

156

mixed, new bands corresponding to the binding complexes emerged at the upper positions of

157

the gel, which verified the between interactions.

158

IPB02 is a highly potent fusion inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV

159

We next sought to determine the antiviral functions of the IPB01 and IPB02 peptides. Firstly,

160

their inhibitory activities on S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion were examined by the

161

DSP-based cell fusion assay as described above. As shown in Fig. 6A and Table 1, both of

162

IPB01 and IPB02 potently inhibited the cell fusion mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2,

163

with mean IC50 values of 0.022 and 0.025 μM, respectively. Then, we conducted the

164

single-cycle infection assay to measure the inhibitory activities of the peptides on
8

165

pseudoviruses. Surprisingly, the unconjugated peptide IPB01 showed very weak or marginal

166

activities in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 6B) and SARS-CoV (Fig. 6C) pseudoviruses;

167

however, the lipopeptide IPB02 inhibited the two viruses with IC50 at 0.08 and 0.251μM,

168

respectively (Table 1). As expected, IPB01 and IPB02 had no inhibitory activity against a

169

control virus (VSV-G), indicating their antiviral specificities. Therefore, we conclude that

170

IPB02 is a highly potent fusion inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

171

Structural and functional characterization of lipopeptide inhibitors

172

In light of the high binding and inhibitory activities with IPB02, we next focused on

173

characterizing its structure-activity relationship (SAR). To this end, a panel of new

174

lipopeptides was generated by sequence truncation or extension, and their antiviral capacities

175

were examined. As shown in Table 1, IPB03 and IPB04, which had an N-terminal amino acid

176

truncation, still maintained a very high potency in inhibiting the cell fusion activity of the

177

SARS-CoV-2 S protein, but they exhibited an obviously reduced activity to block the cell

178

entry activity of both the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses. A further N-terminal

179

truncation, as indicated by IPB05 and IPB06, would result in the inhibitors inactive at a high

180

concentration. By adding six amino acids of the membrane proximal external sequence

181

(MPES) to the C-terminal of IPB05, the resulting peptide IPB07 regained the antiviral activity,

182

demonstrating the importance of MPES in the design of such CoV fusion inhibitors.

183

Differently, IPB08 was a C-terminally truncated inhibitor with IPB02 as a template, but its

184

antiviral function was markedly impaired, underscoring the roles of C-terminal residues in

185

IPB02. On the basis of the results above, it was expected that IPB09 with two terminal

186

truncations was antivirally inactive. Indeed, the CD data suggested that both the N- and
9

187

C-terminal sequences contributed critically to the binding of the inhibitors (Table 1). By

188

comparing IPB03 and IPB04, it revealed that three amino acids (Ile-Asn-Ala) in the

189

N-terminal of IPB03 reversely impaired the inhibitor binding.

191

Discussion

192

In 2002，SARS-CoV suddenly emerged in Guangzhou, China, and its subsequent global

193

spread was associated with 8096 cases and 774 deaths. To fight against SARS-CoV, we took

194

immediate actions with multiple research projects and achieved significant findings. First, we

195

identified several viral antigens suitable for the development of diagnostic tools (26-28);

196

second, we proposed for the first time that the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) can

197

serve as an ideal subunit vaccine for emerging CoVs (29-40); third, we also reported the first

198

peptide-based SARS-CoV fusion inhibitor with potential therapeutic and preventive efficacies

199

(10).

200

To fight against the current pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, we sprang

201

into action to develop effective therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we focused on

202

developing viral fusion inhibitor peptides with a potent and broad antiviral activity. Firstly,

203

our experiments verified that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses human

204

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry and infection; however,

205

the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has much higher activity to mediate cell-cell fusion. By

206

analyzing the secondary structure and thermostability with CD spectroscopy, we found that

207

the HR1 peptide derived from the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 displays much higher

208

α-helicity and thermostability than the HR1 peptide from the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV.

209

Consistently, both the α-helical contents and melting temperature of the SARS-CoV-2 HR1

210

peptide complexed with a HR2-derived peptide are higher than that of the SARS-CoV HR1

211

peptide-based complex, suggesting a more strong interaction between the HR1 and HR2 sites

212

for SARS-CoV-2 over that of SARS-CoV. According to our experiences in designing of

213

lipopeptide fusion inhibitor against HIV, we modified the HR2 sequence-derived peptide

214

IPB01 with a cholesterol group, resulting in the lipopeptide IPB02 with highly potent

215

activities in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as the S

216

protein-mediated cell-cell fusion activity. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship (SAR)

217

of the HR2 sequence-based fusion inhibitors were characterized by applying a panel of

218

truncated lipopeptides, which certified the roles of both the N-and C-terminal amino acid

219

sequences in the design of a potent inhibitor against emerging CoVs. Combined, these data

220

provide important information for understanding the fusion mechanism of emerging CoVs

221

and for the development of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.

222

Cell entry of CoVs depends on binding of the viral S proteins to cellular receptors and on

223

S protein priming by host cell proteases (41-44). Previous studies demonstrated that

224

SARS-CoV enters into targeting cells mainly via an endosome membrane fusion pathway

225

where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L)

226

and activated (45). However, SARS-CoV also employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2

227

for S protein priming, and especially, TMPRSS2 but not CatB/L is essential for viral entry

228

into primary target cells and for viral spread in the infected host (43, 46-48). It was also found

229

that introducing a furin-recognition site between the S1 and S2 subunits could significantly

230

increase the ability of SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection

231

(49). Differently, SARS-CoV-2 induces typical syncytium formation in infected cells,

232

suggesting that it mainly utilizes a plasma membrane fusion pathway for cell entry. Sequence

233

analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, although

234

its roles in S protein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle need to be characterized.

235

One can speculate that furin-mediated precleavage at the S1/S2 site in infected cells might

236

promote subsequent TMPRSS2- dependent cell entry, the case for MERS-CoV (50, 51). A

237

recent study found that SARS-CoV-2 employs TMPRSS2 for S protein priming and a

238

TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use can block entry (52). For most viruses, the

239

plasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosome membrane fusion

240

pathway because the latter is prone to activating the host antiviral immunity (53, 54). In this

241

study, we have not only verified ACE2 as a cell receptor but also demonstrated that the

242

SARS-CoV-2 S protein evolves a significantly increased fusogenic activity relative to the S

243

protein of SARS-CoV. Although our studies have also shown that the HR1 mutations in the

244

S2 protein can greatly enhance the HR1-HR2 interaction thus might be a crucial factor to

245

determine the fusion activity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, other players in the fusion

246

pathways may contribute in coordination with that. We also observed that the HR2-derived

247

inhibitors were more effective in inhibiting the S protein-mediated cell fusion than their

248

inhibitions on pseudoviruses, implying that SARS-CoV-2 might also adopt the endosome

249

entry pathway. Indeed, it was recently found that cathepsin L is required for the cell entry of

250

SARS-CoV-2 and teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, can specifically inhibit the entry (55,

251

56).

252

Drug repurposing represents as a viable drug discovery strategy from existing drugs with

253

knowledge on safety profile, side effects, posology and drug interactions, which could shorten

254

the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In the emergency of the

255

COVID-19 pandemic, a group of nonspecific antiviral drugs, including interferon (IFN),

256

lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, remdesivir (GS-5734), and favipiravir (T-705) were quickly

257

screened with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and they have been used to treat infected patients

258

(57, 58). Very recently, a clinical study suggested that combination of hydroxychloroquine

259

and azithromycin would provide synergistic effects in treated COVID-19 patients (59).

260

Nonetheless, development of specific drugs for emerging coronaviruses, including

261

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, is highly required and has perspective for the long run. We

262

believe that the newly developed lipopeptide IPB02 represents an ideal candidate for future

263

optimization development.

Peptide synthesis

267

Peptides were synthesized on rink amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin using a

268

standard solid-phase 9-flurorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) protocol as described previously

269

(20). Lipopeptides were produced by conjugating cholesterol succinate monoester to the

270

C-terminal lysine residue. All peptides were N-terminally acetylated and C-terminally

271

amidated, and they were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography

272

(HPLC) to more than 95% homogeneity and characterized with mass spectrometry.

273

Single-cycle infection assay

274

Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) on 293T cells

275

or 293T cells stably expressing human ACE2 (293T/ACE2) was determined by a single-cycle

276

infection assay as described previously (60). To produce pseudoviruses, HEK293T cells were

277

cotransfected with a backbone plasmid (pNL4-3.luc.RE) that encodes an Env-defective,

278

luciferase reporter-expressing HIV-1 genome and a plasmid expressing the S protein of

279

SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV or the G protein of VSV. Cell culture supernatants containing the

280

released virions were harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtrated and stored at -80oC. To

281

measure the inhibitory activity of peptide inhibitors, pseudoviruses were mixed with an equal

282

volume of a serially 3-fold diluted peptide and incubated at 37 oC for 30 min. The mixture was

283

then added to 293T/ACE2 cells at a density of 104 cells/100 μl per plate well. After cultured

284

at 37 oC for 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in reporter lysis buffer, and luciferase

285

activity was measured using luciferase assay reagents and a luminescence counter (Promega,

286

Madison, WI, USA). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated as the final cell

287

culture concentration of an inhibitor that caused a 50% reduction in relative luminescence

288

units (RLU) compared to the level of the virus control subtracted from that of the cell control.

289

Cell-cell fusion assay

290

A dual split-protein (DSP)-based fusion cell-cell assay was used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 or

291

SARS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion activity and the inhibitory activity of peptides

292

as described previously (60). Briefly, a total of 1.5×104 293T cells (effector cells) were seeded

293

in a 96-well plate and 1.5×105/mL of 293T or 293T/ACE2 cells (target cells) were seeded in a

294

10-cm culture dish, and then incubated at 37oC. On the next day, effector cells were

295

cotransfected with a S protein-expressing and a DSP1-7 plasmid, target cells were transfected

296

with a DSP8-11 plasmid, and then the cells were incubated at 37oC. After 24 h, the effector

297

cells were added with a serially 3-fold diluted peptide and incubated for 1 h; the target cells

298

were resuspended at 3×105/mL in prewarmed culture medium that contains EnduRen live cell

299

substrate (Promega) at a final concentration of 17 ng/ml and incubated for 30 min. Then,

300

3×104 of target cells were then transferred to the effector cells and the mixed cells were spun

301

down to maximize cell-cell contact. After incubation for 2 h, luciferase activity was measured

302

and IC50 values were calculated as described above.

303

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy

304

The secondary structure and thermal stability of peptides or peptide complexes were

305

determined by CD spectroscopy as described previously (60). Briefly, a peptide was dissolved

306

in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) with a final concentration of 10 μM and incubated

307

at 37 oC for 30 min. CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco spectropolarimeter (model J-815)

308

using a 1 nm bandwidth with a 1 nm step resolution from 195 to 270 nm at room temperature.

309

Spectra were corrected by subtracting a solvent blank, and α-helical content was calculated

310

from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity [θ] at 222 nm, with a value of

311

-33,000 deg cm2 dmol-1 corresponding to 100% helix. Thermal denaturation was conducted

312

by monitoring the ellipticity change at 222 nm from 20 to 98oC at a rate of 2oC/min, and

313

melting temperature (Tm) was defined as the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition.

314

Native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE)

315

N-PAGE was performed to determine the interaction between a SARS-CoV2 or SARS-CoV S

316

protein HR1-derived peptide and a HR2-derived peptide as described previously (61). Briefly,

317

a HR1 peptide was mixed with a HR2 peptide at a final concentration of 40 μM and incubated

318

at 37oC for 30 min. The mixture was added with Tris–glycine native sample buffer at a ratio

319

of 1 : 1 and then loaded onto a 10 x 1.0-mm Tris-glycine gel (20%) at 25 μl/well. Gel

electrophoresis was done with 100V constant voltage at 4 oC for 3 h. The gel was then stained

321

with Coomassie blue and imaged with a Bio-Rad imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules,

322

California, USA).
