Abstract
The spread of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been
growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of
the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study
the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host.
Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the
virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into
the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from
different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the

binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative
jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current
virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with
previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion
that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by
SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive
accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493
and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human
ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show
from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues
to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of
eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the
complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them
is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as nCoV-19) has been
associated with the recent epidemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome
[2]. Recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor
on the surface of the host cell using spike proteins, and explored the binary
interaction of these two partners [8, 23]. In this work, we focused our
analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main subjects: (1)
The architecture of the spike protein interface and whether its evolution in
many isolates supports an increase in affinity toward the ACE2 receptor;
(2) How the affinity of SARS-COV-2-RBD and SARS-CoV-RBD toward
different ACE2 homologous proteins from different species is dictated by a
divergent interface sequences (3); A comparison of the interaction hotspots
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; and finally, (4) whether any of the
studied ACE2 variants may show a different binding property compared to
the reference allele. To tackle these questions we used multi-scale modelling
approaches in combination with sequence and phylogenetic analysis.

locally aligning the protein from SARS-CoV-2 with all possible ORFs from 33
the translated genomes. ACE2 orthologous sequences from Human (Uniprot 34
sequence Q9BYF1), Masked palm civet (NCBI protein AAX63775.1 from 35
Paguma larvata), Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (NCBI protein AGZ48803.1 36

the N-Glycosylation sites was made for all studied ACE2 sequences using
NetNGlyc server (https://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/). For
the genome comparison, we selected the best site model based on lowest
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) calculated using model selection
tool implemented in MEGA 6 software [16]. The General Time Reversible
(GTR) model was chosen as the best fitting model for nucleotide substitution
with discrete Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories. For the
RBD sequences, the best substitution model for maximum likelihood (ML)
calculation was selected using a model selection tool implemented on MEGA
6 software based on the lowest BIC score. Therefore, the WAG model [20]
using a discrete Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories has been
selected.
Phylogenetic trees were generated using a ML method in MEGA 6. The
consistency of the topology, for the RBD sequences, was assessed using a
bootstrap method with 1000 replicates. The resulting phylogenetic tree
was edited with iTOL [9].

Homology based protein-protein docking and bind- 67
ing energy scores estimation

The co-crystal structure of the spike protein of SARS-CoV complexed
to human-civet chimeric receptor ACE2 was solved at 3 Å of resolution
(PDB code 3SCL). We used this structure as a template to build the
complex of spike protein from different virus isolates with the human ACE2
protein (Uniprot sequence Q9BYF1). The template sequences of the ligand
(spike protein) and the receptor (ACE2) were aligned locally with the
target sequences using the program Water from the EMBOSS package [12].
Modeller version 9.22 [14] was then used to predict the complex model of
each spike protein with the ACE2 using a slow refining protocol. For each
model, we generated ten conformers from which we selected the model with
the best DOPE score [15].
To calculate the binding energy scores we used, PRODIGY server [22],
MM-GBSA method implemented in the HawkDock server [19] and FoldX5
[3]. The contribution of each amino acid in protein partners was calculated

BuildModel module of FoldX5. Because it is more adapted to predict the
effect of punctual variations of amino acids, we used DynaMut at this stage
of analysis [13].

Flexibility analysis

We ran a protocol to simulate the spike RBD fluctuation of SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV using the standalone program CABS-flex (version 0.9.14) [7].
Three replicates of the simulation with different seeds were conducted using
a temperature value of 1.4 (dimensionless value related to the physical
temperature). The protein backbone was kept fully flexible and the number
of the Monte Carlo cycles was set to 100.

Results

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of the different RBD sequences revealed two well
supported clades. Clade 1 includes Rm1 isolate, Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
Bat-SL-CoVZXC21. These three isolates are closely related to SARS-CoV-2
as revealed by the phylogenetic tree constructed from the entire genome
(Figure 1A). Clade 2 includes SARS-CoV-2, RatG13, SZ16, ZS-C, WIV16,
MA15, and SARS-CoV-Sino1-11 isolates (Figure 1A). SARS-CoV-2 and
RatG13 sequences are the closest to the common ancestor of this clade.
The exact tree topology is reproduced when we used only the RBD segment
corresponding to the interface residues with hACE2. This is a linear
sequence spanning from residue N481 to N501 in SARS-CoV-2.
Multiple sequence alignment showed that the interface segment of SARSCoV-2 shares higher similarity to sequences from clade 2 (Figure 1B).
However, we noticed that S494, Q498 and P499 are exclusively similar
to their equivalent amino acids in sequences from clade 1. SARS-CoV-2
interface sequence is closely related to RaTG13 sequence, isolated from
Rhinolophus affinis bat.

To investigate whether the interface of the spike protein isolate evolves
by increasing the affinity toward the ACE2 receptor in the final host, we
predicted the interaction models of the envelope anchored spike protein (SP)
from several clinically relevant coronavirus isolates with hACE2 receptor
(PDB files for the complexes are listed in Supplementary Materials 1). The
construction of the complex applies a comparative-based approach that uses
a template structure in which both partners (ligand and receptor) are closely
related to those in the target system respectively. In our study, we only
modeled the interaction of the RBD which was shown to be implicated in the

of the modeled spike proteins as well as those of any of the orthologous
ACE2 sequences (Human, civet, bat, pig, rat, chicken and snake) do not fall
below 63% toward their respective templates. At such values of sequence
identities it is expected that the template and the target complexes share
the same binding mode [6].

Analysis of the interaction energy scores of hACE2 130
with other virus isolates

We calculated the binding energy scores of the RBD from different virus
isolates interacting with hACE2 (Figure 2b). All three methods used
for the calculation are in agreement that RBDs from bat-SL-CoVZC45,
bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and Rm1 show the worst energy scores. While the
binding energy score falls in the boundary limit of the incertitude margin for
PRODIGY calculation (section 2, Supplementary material 2), the differences
in the scores calculated by FoldX and MM-GBSA are not. Therefore we
consider that such differences in energies compared to SARS-CoV-2 are
consistent between the three methods. Except for FoldX, the affinity is
predicted to be more favorable for RBD from SARS-CoV-2 compared to
SARS-CoV. However, MM-GBSA only marginally discriminates between
the two values.

To investigate the tendency of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to interact
with different orthologous forms of ACE2, we analysed the divergence in
their respective interacting surfaces. We have also mapped the putative
glycosylation sites that overlap with the interface with RBD. Overall, the
binding energy scores are similar between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
considering the estimation of error for each method. Variances are more
important for the calculations made by FoldX and although of different
formalism, MM-GBSA and PRODIGY scores are relatively in agreement.

that putative glycosylation sites overlap significantly with RBD interaction
in Snake, Rat and Bat forms (section 3, Supplementary data 2).The docking
also shows that key residues of RBD SARS-CoV-2 tend to interact with
conserved residues on ACE2 (Figure 3, Supplementary data 2) (residues
36-53 in hACE2) which can explain the similar values of energy scores.

Decomposition of the interaction energy

MM-GBSA allowed us to assign the contribution of each amino acid in
the interface with hACE2, in the binding energy score. We conducted this
analysis using both sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 (Figure 3A)
and the Sino1-11 SARS-CoV (Figure 3B) isolates. Residues F486, Y489,
Q493, G496, T500 and N501 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD forming the hotspots of
the interface with hACE2 protein were investigated (we only consider values
> 1 or < 1 kcal/mol to ignore the effect due to the thermal fluctuation).
All these amino acids form three patches of interaction spread along the
linear interface segment (Figure 3C): two from the N and C termini and one
central. T500 establishes two hydrogen bonds using its side and main chains
with Y41 and N330 of hACE2. N501 forms another hydrogen bond with
ACE2 residue K353 buried within the interface. On the other hand, SARSCoV RBD interface contains five residues (Figure 3D), L473, Y476, Y485,
T487 and T488 corresponding to the equivalent hotspot residues of RBD
from SARS-CoV-2 F487, Y490, G497, T501 and N502. Therefore, Q493 as
a hotspot amino acid is specific to SARS-CoV-2 interface. The equivalent
residue N480 in SARS-CoV only shows a non-significant contribution of
0.18 kcal/mol.
The similarity matrix analysis was conducted to assess the divergence of
the interaction interface of RBDs qualitatively, i.e. the specific set of residues
implicated in the interaction with ACE2, and quantity, i.e. the contribution
of each residue in the binding energy score. The similarity matrix was
calculated from free energy decomposition of interface residues of RBDs
from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in complex with ACE2 orthologous
and reported as a network representation (Figure 3E and Figure 1 and
2 in Supplementary Materials 2). We noticed the existence of densely
interconnected edges involving all the protein-protein complexes for SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV except those involving ACE2 from Sus scrofa and
Rattus norvegicus. Complexes involving the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 show less
intrinsic similarity compared to RBD of SARS-CoV. However, similarity
scores tend to be uniform in the group involving ACE2 from human, civet,
dog, bat, snake, and chicken. The complex including hACE2 does not seem
to diverge from the rest of the members of the SARS-CoV-2 group such as
the case of Sus scrofa and Rattus norvegicus.

Flexibility analysis

Sequence analysis and the visual inspection of RBD/hACE2 complex might
reflect the substitution of P499 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD as a form of adaptation
toward a better affinity with the receptor. In order to further investigate
its role, we performed a flexibility analysis using a reference structure
(SARS-CoV-2 RBD containing P499) and an in silico mutated form P499T,
a residue found in SARS-CoV and most of the clade 2. Our results show
that the mutation caused a significant decrease in stability for nine residues
of the interface corresponding to segment 482-491 (Figure 3F). Indeed, the
RMSF variability per amino acid for this sequence increases compared to
the reference structure.

208

A total of eight variants of hACE2 that map to the interaction surface
are described in the gnomAD database (Figure 4A). All these variants are
rare (Table 1) and mostly found in European non-Finnish and African
populations. Considering both the enthalpy (ddG) and the vibrational
entropy in our calculation (ddS), we found no significant changes (> 1 or
< 1 kcal/mol) in neither the folding energy of the complex (Figure 4B) nor
the interaction energy of the protein-protein partners (Figure 4C).

Discussion

Since the Covid-2019 outbreak, several milestone papers have been published
to examine the particularity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its putative
interaction with ACE2 as a receptor [21]. In the current study, we focused
our analysis on the interface segments of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD interacting
with ACE2 from different species by estimating interaction energy profiles.
We have studied the effect of eight variants of ACE2 in order to detect
polymorphisms that may increase or decrease virulence in the host. Our
results showed that if ACE2 is the only route for the infection in humans,
variants interacting physically with RBD are not likely to disrupt the
formation of the complex and would have a marginal effect on the affinity.

Therefore, it is unlikely that any form of resistance to the virus, related to
the ACE2 gene, exists. However, this analysis merits to be investigated in
depth in different ethnic groups for a better assessment of the contribution
of genetic variability in host-pathogen interaction.
The similar values of binding energy scores with different ACE2 orthologues suggest that the ability of binding to different ACE2 orthologous is

preserved in many species either for SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV. Therefore,
the transition to the zoonotic form is trivial if that depends only on ACE2
as the primary route to the infection in both the intermediate and the
final host. However, we know that such a process is very complex since it
requires many protein-protein interactions to acquire the specific capacity
of infecting and replicating in the host cells [18]. Consequently, it makes
sense to assume that many other types of receptors or co-receptors may
be critical to determine the capacity of crossing the species barrier. This
has been already suggested for SARS-CoV [1] and similarly, SARS-CoV-2
may show the same feature. Moreover, our results show that the significant
overlap of glycosylation sites with the protein-protein interface implies a
likely interaction of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors with receptors other than
ACE2. Finally, recent transcriptomic profiling has suggested the possibility

of multiple route infections via the interaction of many human receptors
for SARS-CoV-2 [11].
Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of the different isolates included in
this study is consistent with previous works that place the Wuhan-Hu-1
isolate close to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 isolates [10, 17]
within the Betacoronavirus genus. The use of RBD sequences, however,
places the virus in a clade that comprises SARS-CoV related homologs
including isolates from Bat and Civet. The clade swapping as seen in
figure 1A, seems also to occur for RaTG13 and Rm1 isolated from bat. This
is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably
affect the topology of the tree. However, The significant divergence in
the interfaces segments as a key molecular element contributing to the
determination of the tree topology has driven our work toward studying
their impact on the interaction with hACE2. The binding of the spike
glycoprotein to ACE2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity. In the
case where the RBD evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of Bat-SLCoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, we expected a decrease of the binding
energy scores through the evolution process following incremental changes in
the RBD. In such a scenario, we presume that there are other intermediary
forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy
score to reach a level where the pathogen can infect humans with high
affinity toward hACE2. On the other hand, our results show that the
binding energy score and the interface sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD are
closer to SARS-CoV related isolates (either from Human or other species).
Therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that might
have occurred between SARS-CoV and an ancestral form of the current
SARS-CoV-2 virus might be also possible. This will allow for the virus to
acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hACE2. The
recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested
by Wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis [4]. Thereafter, incremental
changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a
better affinity toward the receptor. One of these changes may involve P499
residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the
interface segment and has a distant effect. Moreover, the decomposition
of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in

SARS-CoV-2 have their equivalent in SARS-CoV including N501. Contrary
to what Wan et al [17] have stated, the single mutation N501T does not
seem to enhance the affinity. Rather, the residue Q493 might be responsible
for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the Van der Waals
by the longer polar side chain of asparagine. Indeed, when we made the
same analysis while mutating Q493 to N493, the favorable contribution
decreases from -2.55 kcal/mol to a non significant value of -0.01 kcal/mol,
thus supporting our claim.
No major divergence of the interaction interface of SARS-CoV-2 RBD
with hACE2 was noticed from the similarity matrix analysis. This suggests
that the molecular elements required for the binding with the receptor might
also be involved in the interaction with other orthologous forms of ACE2
and that these elements are not optimized specifically for the human form.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the interface of RBD from SARS-CoV-2 is a
result of human intervention via genetic engineering aiming to increase the
affinity toward ACE2. For example, residue E484 contributes unfavorably
to the binding energy with 2.24 kcal/mol due to an electrostatic repulsion
with E75 from hACE2. This residue is an apparent choice for engineering
a protein-protein complex with high affinity by substituting E484 with a
polar residue. It is, however, noteworthy that the lesser homogeneity of the
nodes of SARS-CoV-2 group, in comparison to SARS-CoV, may suggest
a higher tolerance for the mutation of the new virus which would allow
it to cross the species barrier more easily and to efficiently optimize the
interaction in the host.
