ABSTRACT
Reliable serological tests are required to determine the prevalence of antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 antigens and to characterise immunity to the disease in order to address key
knowledge gaps in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative suspension array
technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of
rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput,
miniaturization, cost-efficacy and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays to
detect IgM, IgA and IgG to a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S),
nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) protein constructs. The assays were optimized to
minimize processing time and maximize signal to noise ratio. We evaluated the performance
of the assays using 128 plasmas obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic (negative
controls) and 115 plasmas from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of
whom 8 were asymptomatic, 58 had mild symptoms and 49 were hospitalized. Pre-existing
IgG antibodies recognizing N, M and S2 proteins were detected in negative controls
suggestive of cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. The best performing antibody
isotype/antigen signatures had specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 94.94% at ≥14 days
since the onset of symptoms and 96.08% at ≥21 days since the onset of symptoms, with
AUC of 0.992 and 0.999, respectively. Combining multiple antibody markers as assessed by
qSAT assays has the highest efficiency, breadth and versatility to accurately detect low-level
antibody responses for obtaining reliable data on prevalence of exposure to novel pathogens
in a population. Our assays will allow gaining insights into antibody correlates of immunity
required for vaccine development to combat pandemics like the COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
In a globalized world where emerging infectious diseases of broad distribution can put at
stake the health and economy of millions of people, there is a need for versatile and reliable
serological tools that can be readily applicable (i) to determine the seroprevalence of
antibodies against any new pathogen and, more importantly, (ii) to characterise immunity to
the disease at the individual and community levels. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic
caused by SARS-CoV-2, one of the main priorities since the beginning of the epidemics in
China by the end of 2019 (1) was to ascertain the percentage of the population that had been
exposed to the virus, considering that a considerable number of people could have been
asymptomatic (2)(3). The lack of sensitive and specific serological tests early in the COVID19 pandemic delayed the precise estimation of the burden of infection for the rational
implementation of public health measures to control viral spread (4). Furthermore,
immunological assays that can measure a high breadth of antibody types and specificities
are needed to dissect which are the naturally acquired protective responses and identify
correlates of immunity (5). Additionally, when a vaccine becomes available, such assays
would be valuable to evaluate immunogenicity of candidate vaccines and monitor duration of
immunity at the population level (6).
Common tools for antibody studies are (i) rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) as point of care (POC)
devices that usually measure either total immunoglobulins or IgG and IgM, qualitatively (7),
(ii) traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (8) that can quantify different
isotypes and subclasses of antibodies against single antigens at a time, and that require
certain previous expertise, personnel and equipment, and (iii) chemiluminescent assays
(CLIA), widely used in clinical practice, faster and with higher throughput than ELISA (9). The
performance characteristics of the commercial kits available in the early months of the
COVID-19 pandemic were questionable (10), while external evaluations validating their
reliability and accuracy were not published. A number of in-house ELISA assays have also
been developed in hospital and research laboratories (11), but they have the limitations that
(i) a relatively large amount of sample is required, (ii) the large surface area of the individual

microplate wells and the hydrophobic binding of capture antibody can lead to non-specific
binding and increased background, and (iii) most ELISAs rely upon enzyme-mediated
amplification of signal in order to achieve reasonable sensitivity (12).
An alternative technique that offers the benefits of ELISA but also a larger dynamic range of
antibody quantification and higher sensitivity (12)(13) is based on the xMAP Luminex®
platform (www.luminexcorp.com/bibliography). Secondary antibodies are labelled with
fluorescent phycoerythrin (PE) directly or with biotin that mediates binding to streptavidin-Rphycoerythrin (SAPE), which does not depend on an additional reaction. The technique has
the added value of higher throughput (up to 384-well plate format), increased flexibility, and
lower cost with the same workflow as ELISA, particularly if using magnetic MagPlex®
microspheres. Paramagnetic beads allow for automation of workflow and better
reproducibility compared to the previous generation of MicroPlex® microspheres. Since the
beads have the capture antigen immobilized on their much smaller surface area compared to
a 96-well microplate well, reduced sample volumes are required and non-specific binding is
diminished (14). Furthermore, a chief advantage over ELISA is the multiplex nature of the
assay that allows measuring antibodies to different antigens simultaneously. This increases
the probabilities to detect a positive antibody response due to the heterogeneity of the
human response and therefore it has a higher sensitivity relevant for identifying seropositive
individuals. The Luminex technology, capable of measuring simultaneously antibodies
against 50 (MAGPIX®), 80 (Luminex 100/200®) and up to 500 different antigens
(FlexMap3D®), makes it an invaluable tool for antigen and epitope screening. Finally, its
versatility to set up adapted antigen panels makes Luminex an excellent platform to ensure
better preparedness for faster response to future emerging diseases and pandemics.
Here we report on the establishment and validation of three quantitative suspension array
technology (qSAT) assays to measure IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against eight SARS-CoV2 antigens, based on the adaptation of previous in-house protocols that measured antibodies
to other infectious diseases, including malaria (15)(16)(17)(18). Due to the need to process a
large amount of samples with the minimal time and cost during a pandemic like the COVID-

19, we optimized several conditions to reduce the duration of the assays and report them
here for the three main isotypes that have proved useful for seroprevalence studies (19).

METHODS

Samples
Positive samples were 115 plasmas from individuals with a confirmed past/current diagnosis
of COVID-19. One hundred and eleven had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real time
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Fifty-five were recruited in a
study of health care workers in Hospital Clínic in Barcelona, most of them with mild
symptoms, 1 of them hospitalized and 6 without symptoms, all rRT-PCR positive (19). Fiftyseven were COVID-19 patients recruited at the Clínica Universidad de Navarra in Pamplona
(Spain), of which 48 had severe symptoms and were hospitalized and 9 had mild symptoms
(one clinically diagnosed with positive radiology and serology, and negative rRT-PCR); 3
were asymptomatic health workers with positive diagnosis confirmed by four serological tests
but no rRT-PCR data. Time since onset of symptoms ranged from 0 to 46 days. Positive
samples were used individually or as pools of up to 20 samples depending on the tests. For
optimization tests, only a subset of samples were used. Negative controls were plasmas from
128 healthy European donors collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and were used
individually. Numbers of positive and negative samples were in line with protocol
recommendations from the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND).
Ethics. Samples analyzed in this study received ethical clearance for immunological
evaluation and/or inclusion as controls in immunoassays, and the protocols and informed
consent forms were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at HCB (Refs. CEIC7455 and HCB/2020/0336) or Universidad de Navarra (Ref. UN/2020/067) prior to study
implementation.

Antigens

The Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the
leading vaccine candidate target, was selected as the primary antigen to develop the initial
qSAT assay because (i) S is one of the most immunogenic surface proteins together with the
nucleocapsid protein (N) (20) (ii) RBD is the fragment of the virus that mediates binding to
the host receptor ACE2 in the lung cells (21) (iii) antibodies to RBD correlate with neutralizing
antibodies (20)(22) that could be associated with protection based on studies of other
coronaviruses and animal models (23–26), and (iv) an ELISA based on this same protein has
received FDA approval for COVID-19 serology (11). The RBD was from the Krammer lab
(Mount Sinai, New York, USA) (11) and the S antigen was produced in-house using Chinese
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells transiently-transfected with the Krammer plasmid followed by
purification of the recombinant protein from 4-day culture supernatants using nickel affinity
chromatography. The multiplex antigen panel was completed with commercial S1 (GenScript
Biotech, Netherlands) and S2 (Sino Biologicals, Germany) proteins, and in-house produced
nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli codon optimized
versions of full-length N and M antigens were cloned at ISGlobal into a pET22b expression
vector, fusing an in-frame C-terminal 6xHis-tag. Recombinant N and M proteins were
expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 by pET22b-N and pET22b-M transformation and induction
with 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when OD600 reached 0.6-0.8,
followed by 5 h incubation at 37ºC or 25ºC, respectively. Bacterial pellets were resuspended
in binding buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.2
mg/mL Lysozyme, 20 µg/mL DNAse, 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM MgCl2, and lysed by sonication.
Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm and proteins purified by affinity chromatography
using a Ni2+ column (1 mL GE Healthcare HisTrap HP) and imidazole gradient elution in an
AKTA Start protein purification system. M and N proteins were concentrated and buffer
changed to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using Microcon-10 KDa centrifugal filter units
(Millipore). For N-terminal (residues from 43 to 180) and C-terminal fragments (residues from
250 to 360) of N, two constructs were designed at CRG depending on secondary structure
predictions. The encoding sequences were synthesized and inserted into a plasmid pETM14

with the N-terminal 6xHis-tag under the control of a T7 promoter, and recombinant plasmids
transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 competent cells. Briefly, E. coli containing the plasmid was
grown and the protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG 0.2 mM for 16 h at 18°C.
Pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer A (Tris 20 mM, 250mM NaCl, 10mM Imidazole)
supplemented with 0.5% Triton-X100 Substitute (Sigma) and complete mini EDTA-free
protease (Roche), sonicated, and centrifuged (30 min, 4°C, 30000 g). The N-terminal, and
the C-terminal recombinant proteins containing a N-terminal 6xHis-tag were purified from the
resulting supernatant using Hitrap Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden)
according to the manufacturer instructions. After washing with Buffer A, the antigen was
eluted using linear gradient with buffer B (Buffer A supplemented with 500 mM Imidazol). The
fractions of interest were dialyzed against PBS 1x and concentrated by Vivaspin 5 KD
(Millipore, France). The antigens produced were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
protein assay kit (Pierce) and their purity controlled by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

Antigen coupling to microspheres
Different test concentrations of protein antigens were coupled to magnetic MAGPLEX 6.5 µm
COOH-microspheres from Luminex Corporation (Austin, TX) in reactions of a maximum of
625,000 beads, at 10,000 beads/µl (15). First, beads were washed twice with 62.5 µl of
distilled water using a magnetic separator (Life Technologies, 12321d), and resuspended in
80 µl of activation buffer, 100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate (Sigma, S2554), pH 6.2. To
activate the beads for cross-linking to proteins, 10 µl of 50 mg/mL sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 24525) and 50 µL of 50 mg/mL 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimidehydrochloride (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22981) were
simultaneously added to the reaction tubes, mixed and incubated at room temperature (RT)
for 20 min in a rotatory shaker and protected from light. Next, beads were washed twice with
62.5 µl 50 mM morpholineethane sulfonic acid (MES) (Sigma, M1317) pH 5.0, in a 10,000
beads/ µl concentration. After beads activation, antigen were added to the reaction tubes at

three different concentrations (10, 30 and 50 µg/mL) and left at 4ºC overnight (ON) on a
rotatory shaker protected from light. On the following day, coupled-beads were brought to RT
for 20 min in agitation, and blocked by incubating them with 62.5 µl PBS (Sigma) + 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA, Biowest) + 0.05% sodium azide (Sigma, S8032) (PBS-BN) in
agitation during 30 min at RT and protected from light. Beads were washed twice with PBSBN using the magnetic separator. To determine the percentage recovery of beads after the
coupling procedure, coupled beads were resuspended in 62.5 µL PBS-BN and counted on a
Guava PCA desktop cytometer (Guava Technologies, Automated cell counter, PC550IGC4C/0746-2747). In all washing and resuspension steps, beads were softly vortexed and
sonicated for 30 sec. Antigen-coupled beads were validated by incubating them with serial
dilutions of anti-histidine-Biotin antibody for antigens with a histidine-tag (Abcam, ab27025).
To choose an appropriate coupling concentration, IgG and IgM levels were measured in 11
serial dilutions 3-fold of a pool of 20 positive samples and titration curves compared for each
protein. Coupled beads were stored multiplexed at 2000 beads/µL PBS-BN at 4°C and
protected from light until use.

Incubation of samples with antigen-coupled microspheres
We compared the performance of the assays when a subset of positive and negative plasma
samples were incubated at different dilutions with the antigen-beads for 1 h or 2 h at RT in
relation to our previous protocol ON at 4ºC. Antigen-coupled beads, initially including RBD
singleplex, were added to a 96-well µClear® flat bottom plate (Greiner Bio-One, 655096) at
2000 beads/well in a volume of 90 µL/well PBS-BN. Next, individual positive plasma samples
(range of dilutions tested from 1/100 to 1/5000) and individual negative controls (at the same
dilutions as the positive samples), were added per plate in a final volume of 100 µl per well.
Two blank control wells with beads in PBS-BN were set up in each plate to control for
background signal. Plates were incubated on a microplate shaker at 600 rpm and protected
from light, and then washed three times with 200 µl/well of PBS-Tween20 0.05%, using a
magnetic manual washer (Millipore, 43-285). For more accurate IgM measurements, we

tested whether diluting samples 1:10 with GullSORB™ IgG Inactivation Reagent (Meridian
Bioscience™) prior to testing for IgM levels could reduce high responses observed in some
negative samples (27). Additionally, we tested the levels of RBD and S antibodies obtained
at different plasma dilutions when incubated in a multiplex panel with additional antigenbeads including S1, S2, M and N constructs, compared to those obtained in singleplex, to
check for potential interferences. Finally, since viral proteins have diverse immunogenicity,
definitive plasma dilutions were established with titration experiments in individual positive
and negative samples once the final multiplex antigen panel and all assay conditions had
been selected.

Secondary antibody incubation and plate reading
We compared the performance of the assays when using biotinylated secondary antibodies
followed by SAPE, versus secondary antibodies conjugated directly to PE, and at different
incubation times (45 versus 30 min). In all cases, each new lot of secondary antibody was
titrated for selecting the optimal concentration. For the first option, 100 µL of biotinylated
secondary antibody diluted in PBS-BN (anti-human IgG, B1140, 1/1250; anti-human IgM,
B1265, 1/1000; or anti-human IgA, SAB3701227, 1/500; Sigma) were added to all wells and
incubated for 45 min at 600 rpm at RT and protected from light. Plates were washed three
times, and 100 µL of SAPE (Sigma, 42250) diluted 1:1000 in PBS-BN were added and
incubated during 30 min at 600 rpm, RT and protected from light. For the second option, 100
µL of PE-secondary antibody diluted in PBS-BN (goat anti-human IgG, GTIG-001, 1/400;
goat anti-human IgM, GTIM-001, 1/200; or goat anti-human IgA, GTIA-001, 1/200; Moss,
MD, USA) were added to all wells and incubated for 45 or 30 min at 600 rpm at RT and
protected from light.
Plates were washed three times, beads resuspended in 100 µl of PBS-BN, and data
acquired using a Luminex® 100/200 analyzer with 70 µl of acquisition volume per well, DD
gat 5000-25000 settings, and high PMT option. Plates could also be kept ON at 4ºC,
protected from light, and read the next day. At least 50 beads were acquired per antigen and

sample. Crude median fluorescent intensities (MFI) were exported using the xPONENT
software. Seropositivity threshold (cutoff) for optimization tests was calculated as 10 to the
mean plus 3 standard deviations of log10-transformed MFIs of the negative controls for each
antibody isotype and antigen.

Performance of the SARS-Cov-2 qSAT assays
The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, their corresponding area under the
curve (AUC), and the specificity and sensitivity of the IgM, IgA and IgG assays, were
established testing all 115 positive samples from participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2
infection, regardless of symptoms information and at different periods since the onset of
symptoms (7, 14, 21 and 28), and 128 negative samples. For IgM, IgA and IgG assays the
multiplex panel including RBD, S, S1, S2, M and N antigen constructs was used, following
the same procedures as indicated above and after selecting the optimal assay conditions.

Data analysis
ROC curves and AUC, sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the predicted
values estimated by supervised machine learning Random Forest (RF) algorithm models
with all pre-pandemic negative controls and COVID-19 positive controls. IgM, IgA and IgG
MFIs to the different antigens or their combinations were the predictors, and the outcome
was SARS-CoV-2 positivity or negativity. Antibody/antigen variables that did not discriminate
between positive samples from negative controls were excluded from the analysis. Then the
antibody/antigen variables were further down-selected using an RF algorithm including all
negative and positive controls (N=243) or all negative controls plus positive controls
corresponding to each different period since onset of symptoms: ≥7 days (N=221), ≥14 days
(N=207), ≥21 days (N=179), ≥28 days (N=155). The importance of the variables was ranked
according to the Mean Decrease Accuracy and the Mean Decrease Gini. Next, different RFs
were built exploring all possible variable combinations at the different periods based on the
selected variables per period: all samples (top 12 markers), ≥7 days (top 12 markers), ≥14

days (top 10 markers), ≥21 days (top 10 markers) and ≥28 days (top 11 markers). For each
model, we calculated the AUC and selected three seropositivity cutoffs aiming at specificities
of i) 100%, ii) ≥ 99% and <100%, and iii) ≥ 98% and <99%, and obtained the corresponding
sensitivity. Models with 100% specificity and the highest sensitivities were selected for ROC
curve representations. The analysis was carried out using the statistical software R studio
version R-3.5.1 (28) (packages used: randomForest (29) and pROC (30)).

RESULTS
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected participants whose plasma samples have been
used in the study, with regards to age, sex, days since rRT-PCR diagnosis and days since
onset of symptoms, are included in Table S1.

Selection of optimal concentration for protein coupling to microspheres
The optimal amount of protein to be coupled to beads depended on the antigen and needs to
be tested with each new lot. Among the concentrations tested (10, 30 or 50 µg/mL protein),
titration curves did not usually change substantially, in which case the lower concentration
was chosen for the subsequent experiments. An illustrative example is shown for which the
medium concentration was slightly superior when tested for IgG and IgM and thus selected
(Figure S1).

Optimization of sample incubation conditions
Duration of incubation. To establish the optimal range of plasma dilutions for the
measurement of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies to our primary SARS-CoV-2 antigen (RBD), we
initially tested positive and negative samples at four concentrations (1/100, 1/500, 1/2000,
1/5000) in singleplex (Figure 1). We found 1/200 to 1/500 to be in the adequate dilution
range for the subsequent assay optimization experiments. Our original standard operating
procedures (SOP) established for large seroepidemiological and vaccine studies using
Plasmodium falciparum antigens were based on ON incubations at 4ºC (16). For the COVID-

19 serology, we prioritized having faster assays and thus compared the performance of ON
incubations at 4ºC versus shorter times at RT. We tested that the range of dilutions was still
adequate when reducing the incubation time (Figure 2A) and compared antibody levels and
number of seropositive samples incubating ON at 4ºC versus 2 h RT at 1/500 (Figure 2B).
Although the MFI readings in positive samples generally diminished with shorter times, the
MFI readings in the negative samples also reduced, i.e. the signal to noise ratio was the
same or sometimes better, maintaining or increasing the overall proportion of seropositive
among the positive samples and thus the sensitivity. Based on these data, we adopted the 2
h incubation time for an initial COVID-19 seroprevalence study (19). We subsequently tested
shorter incubations more extensively and found that 1 h was non-inferior to 2 h incubation
(Figure 2C) and thus 1 h was selected for the optimized SOP.
Reduction of background in IgM assay. Treatment with GullSORB™ reduced or did not
change the MFI signal, depending on the sample, antigen and dilution (Figure S2A). This
additional incubation generally increased the signal to noise ratio and thus sensitivity and
number of seropositive IgM responses among the positive controls, particularly at the lower
dilutions, therefore the GullSORB™ incubation was adopted for this assay (Figure S2B). IgM
reactivity in negative controls was lower against S-based antigens than against M- or Nbased antigens and thus GullSORB™ treatment benefited the signal to noise ratio the most
in these later proteins.
Singleplex versus multiplex antigen testing. Multiplexing the antigens (8-plex panel) did not
significantly decrease the MFI antibody levels to RBD or S compared to singleplex testing
(Figure 3A) neither for any of the other antigens (Figure S3A). Interestingly, there was no
evidence of any interference between RBD, S, S1 or S2 antigens despite sharing epitopes
within the same multiplex panel. A number of negative pre-pandemic samples had preexisting antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 proteins for certain isotypes and dilutions
(Figure S3A): IgG to S1, S2, M and N constructs, and IgA to S1 and N-term & C-term of N.
Furthermore, testing plasmas against multiple antigens increased the sensitivity of the assay
since some individuals who were seronegative or low responders to RBD, responded with

higher antibodies to S (Figure 3B). Once the multiplex antigen panel was established, a set
of positive and negative samples were tested at different dilution(s) covering the diverse
immunogenicity of the proteins, and 1/500 and 1/3500 were selected for the assay
performance evaluation (Figures 3C and S3B).

Optimization of secondary antibodies
Secondary antibodies conjugated to PE performed as well as a two-step secondary antibody
conjugated to biotin followed by SAPE incubation (Figure 4). The PE-antibody reagent that
resulted in a shorter assay was selected as the preferred option. Finally, 30 min incubation
was non-inferior to 45 min incubation (Figure S4).

Sensitivity and specificity of the qSAT assays
We sought for the combination of Ig and antigen responses that yielded the highest
specificity (primarily), sensitivity and AUC to detect seropositive responses. For RBD and S,
IgG and IgA at 1/500 dilution, and IgM responses at 1/3500, gave higher percentages of
seropositive responses among the positive controls and thus were selected for the
calculations; for N constructs, IgG and IgA performed better at 1/3500 except for N C-term in
which IgG was better at 1/500. Antibodies to M, S1 (IgG & IgA) and N N-term (IgM) did not
discern well positive from negative responses and were not included in the RF models. The
contribution of each antibody/antigen variable was ranked according to an RF algorithm at
different periods since onset of symptoms (Figure S5) and the top 10-12 variables were
selected. We performed RF for all the combination of variables and assessed the sensitivity
of each combination at three different seropositivity thresholds aiming at specificities of
100%, 99% and 98%. The specificity of the qSAT assays in samples from participants with
SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnosis with ≥14 days since the onset of symptoms (n=207) was up
to 100% with sensitivity up to 94.94%, and AUC up to 0.992, for the best combinations of Ig
isotypes/antigens. The top 5 performing antibody signatures for three different seropositivity
thresholds targeting specificities of 100%, 99% and 98% are shown in Table 1, and their

ROC are shown in Figure 5. In samples from participants with ≥21 days since the onset of
symptoms (n=179), the specificity was up to 100% and the sensitivity up to 96.08%, with
AUC up to 0.999 for the best combinations of Ig isotypes/antigens (Table 2, Figure 5). In
samples from all participants regardless of time since symptoms onset (n=243), the
specificity was up to 100% and the sensitivity up to 82.61%, depending on the combinations
of Ig isotypes/antigens, with AUC up to 0.918 for the best combinations (Table S2, Figure 5).
The performance of the qSAT assays to predict positivity was clearly superior using
combinations of multiple Ig isotypes/antigens to using single isotype/antigen markers (Figure
5). Higher sensitivities were obtained when specificities were set to 98% or 99% (Tables 1, 2
& S2), reaching 100% for samples ≥21 or ≥28 days since the onset of symptoms.

DISCUSSION
We developed three novel multiplex immunoassays for quantifying IgM, IgA and IgG to eight
SARS-CoV-2 protein constructs and evaluated by machine learning classification algorithms
the performance of several isotype/antigen combinations to detect any positive antibody
response to infection, obtaining specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 94.94% (≥14 days
since symptoms onset) or 96.08% (≥21 days since symptoms onset), and very high
predictability (AUC ≥0.99). Our qSAT assays, based on the xMAP technology, provide the
best precision, accuracy and widest range of detection compared to classical qualitative
(RDT) or quantitative (ELISA) assays.
For any given test, there is usually a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. To evaluate
the performance of the assays here, we prioritized specificity over sensitivity for the
implications that false positives may pose at a personal level and the impact that specificity
has in seroprevalence studies. Particularly when prevalence of infection is low, the positive
predictive value of a test strongly relies on a high specificity. For example, in a scenario of
5% prevalence and 95% sensitivity, the positive predictive value of the test decreases from
100% to 50%, with a reduction in specificity from 100% to 95%. However, other seropositivity
thresholds can be used to have a balanced specificity/sensitivity or to maximise sensitivity.

A time period after the onset of symptoms is usually established for these analyses, because
antibodies take an average 4-14 days since infection to be produced and detected
depending on the isotype and test (IgM 5-12 days, IgA 5-12 days, IgG 4-14 days)
(31)(32)(33)(34)(35)(36). Thus, it is not necessarily expected to detect antibodies in
individuals who are acutely infected and diagnosed around the time of plasma collection.
Accordingly, when considering all samples, which included 13 and 14 individuals with less
than 6 and 14 days since onset of symptoms, respectively, sensitivity was lower (up to
82.61%) at specificities of 100%. However, we detected IgM or IgA as early as 2 days, and
IgG as early as 1 day, from onset of symptoms. In fact, since samples were collected in the
early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is expected that IgM and IgA, which are induced
upon primary infection earlier than IgG, could contribute to a higher sensitivity of detection.
Most of the best signatures identified included IgM and IgA besides IgG, regardless of the
time period since onset of symptoms, also beyond 28 days. However, over time, the only
antibodies that would be expected to remain in blood are IgG due to the decay of IgM and
IgA, e.g. IgM levels may become undetectable by the fifth week after symptoms onset (37).
Therefore, with longer days since infection, the serological assays to detect maintenance of
antibodies could focus on IgG detection.
The superior performance of the qSAT assays is partly based on direct fluorescence
detection as opposed to colorimetric detection mediated by an enzyme. Also, antigens are
covalently coupled to beads as opposed to passive coating of the ELISA plates, leading to a
higher density of antigen per surface area and less antigen wash off during the assay. The
higher background of ELISA microplates is related to the fact that they have a much larger
surface area than the combined area of 2500 microspheres, which is more prone to the
binding of non-specific antibodies if blocking is not performed correctly (14). The sensitivities
and specificities of other SARS-CoV-2 serological assays externally validated with >100
positive and >100 negative samples (as recommended by FIND protocols), some of them
approved by the USA FDA, are summarized in Table S3 (38)(39).

While Luminex assays generally have high correlation to ELISAs in singleplex (R2 ~0.9) (13),
it is important that the assays perform equally well in multiplex format, with no interference
noted between antigens, even if they had overlapping epitopes. A key value of multiplexing is
that it allows to capture a wider breadth of responses and this is needed because some
individuals may not respond to one antigen (e.g. RBD) but may do so to other antigens (e.g.
S or N proteins) (40)(41)(42). Here, we substantially increased the sensitivity of the assay
when combining isotypes/antigens compared to using only one isotype/antigen. The addition
of N was more beneficial to detect seropositive responses when the onset of symptoms was
recent, as this antigen is the most abundant and immunogenic and specific antibodies
appear to be elicited earlier (43). In contrast, combinations of S antigens seemed to be
sufficient to detect seropositive responses with longer periods since the onset of symptoms.
An added advantage of multiplexing is the reduced usage of sample volume, resources and
time, if antibodies to several antigens are to be evaluated. The possibility to perform
miniaturized assays in small amounts of blood is very attractive in paediatric studies, in large
field surveys where fingerpick may be more logistically feasible, and to test special tissues of
interest including mucosal fluids.
Those combined advantages have a direct impact on the cost-efficacy of the qSAT assay,
that is overall cheaper than RDT or ELISA assays. The cost of the xMAP assay can be less
than one-fifth of the least expensive commercial ELISA and less than one-sixteenth of the
most expensive commercial kit. Cost is reduced because there is less protein used due to
the smaller surface area and less amounts of other materials and reagents. We reduced the
dilutions of plasma and titrated the secondary antibody to use the minimal amounts of
samples and reagents, without compromising sensitivity. The economy of scale will improve
further when the assays are adapted to high throughput FlexMap3D 384-well plate format but
they are also easily adaptable to the bench top MagPix 96-well format that is more affordable
and easy to maintain even in remote laboratory settings.
Interestingly, positive antibody responses to M, S1, S2 and N antigen constructs were
detected in samples collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. The presence of such

antibodies has been interpreted as cross-reactivity with antigens of coronaviruses causing
the common cold (10)(44)(45). Indeed, higher sequence homology at the protein level
between SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses has been reported for N (particularly N-terminal
and central regions), M and S2 (10)(46)(47). Pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have
been recently reported and also attributed to cross-reactivity to human coronaviruses
previously encountered (48)(49). The multiplex nature of the assay will allow to test this
hypothesis in the future with the addition of antigens to related coronaviruses 229E, HKU1,
NL63 and OC43 in the same assay panel, by comparing the patterns of antibody reactivity, in
order to address the significance of this in immunity to COVID-19.
Here, antibody responses to M were very marginal and did not contribute to higher assay
sensitivity and this could partly be because the purity of the protein was not high. However,
this antigen may be valuable in studies establishing the antibody correlates of protection
since at present the targets of immunity have not been elucidated. It is possible that, in
addition to neutralizing antibodies directed to the RBD region of S, antibodies of other
specificities with non-neutralizing functions, for example Fc-mediated opsonisation and
phagocytosis, could be relevant in protection. In fact, T cell responses to epitopes located on
M have been detected at high frequencies (48), and it is possible that antibodies to this or
other less immunogenic antigens may also have a role in protection in some individuals. In
our study, the addition of S1 from a commercial supplier did not have any added value but for
future versions of the assay we will test S1 from different sources, as this subunit is expected
to not cross-react with other beta-coronaviruses and be specific for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics
(11)(46).
The assays performances were excellent but further testing needs to be performed with
longer periods of time since onset of symptoms, although we do expect to maintain high
specificity and sensitivity albeit antibody signatures would be different and based on IgG
only. Future studies will include additional positive samples of asymptomatic individuals, who
probably have lower antibody levels than mild or severe cases and are rarely included in the
validation of commercial kits. In addition, it will be interesting to include negative controls

reacting with other coronaviruses or other infections (e.g. malaria) and pathologies known to
induce polyclonal responses or rheumatoid factor, which may increase background
responses.
In conclusion, we developed 100% specific and fast assays	  with possibly one of the best
diagnostic characteristics reported in the published literature to assess seroprevalence of
COVID-19. Considering their high sensitivity, these qSAT assays would be suited to identify
individuals with levels of antibodies below the lower limit of detection of RDT or the lower
limit of quantification of ELISA, such as asymptomatic children or immunosuppressed
individuals, or long-term decaying antibodies (50). In addition this approach would be
particularly suited to identify hyper immune donors with very high levels of antibodies and the
largest antigenic breadth for immunotherapy. The assays are highly versatile, being easily
adaptable to quantify other antibody IgG and IgA subclasses and avidity with the use of
chaotropic agents, and even functional activity like binding inhibition to the virus receptor
ACE2. The multiplex capabilities make them also ideal for sizeable peptide screenings to
accelerate epitope mapping and selection for identifying fine-specificity of immune correlates
of protection for vaccine development, and would also be applicable in vaccine evaluation
when the first candidates reach larger-scale phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.
