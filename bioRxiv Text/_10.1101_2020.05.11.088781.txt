Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 across the world has posed unprecedented and global challenges on multiple
fronts. Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral
RNA-polymerases. Using the bioinformatics and structural modeling approach, we modeled the structure
of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity
with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminal regions. Incidentally, compared to
spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences.
Using homology modeling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated proton
channel. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in
the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds. Additionally, two distinct “core” structures
were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the
channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral proton channeling activity which may play a critical role
in viral infection. In addition, it provides a structural basis and additional avenues for LAV development
and generating therapeutic interventions against the virus.
Significance Statement
Structural modeling of the novel SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E-protein) demonstrating its possible
proton channeling activity
Introduction
The COVID-19 (CoronaVIrus Disease 2019) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and has taken the form of a worldwide pandemic in the last
few months (1). To date, this disease has affected nearly 4 million people, resulting in nearly 300
thousand deaths disrupting social and economic structures of nearly 190 nations across the globe with
numbers still on the rise (2, 3).
Coronavirus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the class of
β-coronaviruses of the family ​Coronaviridae​, and affected humans causing different forms of mild
common cold. Coronaviruses like hCoV-OC43, HKU, and 229E have been responsible for these diseases
(4). The emergence of human coronaviruses in the 21st century with enhanced pathogenicity was seen in
the case of SARS-CoV-1 mediated infection in 2002, reporting almost 8000 detected cases worldwide
and a mortality rate of 10 %. This was followed by MERS-CoV mediated near-pandemic in 2012 infecting
almost 2500 people worldwide with a mortality rate of 36% (5). The ongoing novel SARS-CoV-2
pandemic, on the other hand, has a lower fatality rate in comparison with the previous coronavirus
outbreaks, but a higher human-to-human contagion efficiency than the previous ones (6). This has led to
the spread of this infection worldwide, across continents, affecting millions.
Coronaviruses have four main structural proteins- (i) Nucleocapsid protein (N), (ii) Spike protein
(S), (iii) Membrane protein (M), and (iv) Envelope protein (E). The E protein is the smallest of all the
structural proteins of 8-12 kDa and is involved in a wide spectrum of functional repertoire (7). It comprises
of three domains: (i) short hydrophilic N-terminus domain consisting of 7-12 amino acids, (ii) hydrophobic
transmembrane domain which is around 25 amino acids long, and (iii) long hydrophilic C terminal (8–10).
The hydrophobic transmembrane domain oligomerizes to form pentameric ion channels in the ERGIC
(ER-Golgi Intermediate compartment) membrane having low or no ion selectivity (11–13). A β-coil-β motif
present in the C terminal of E protein contains a conserved proline residue (14) which is indispensable for
its localization in the ER-Golgi complex (15). Previous studies show that the last 4-5 residues of
SARS-CoV E protein form a PDZ-binding motif, deletion of which resulted in revertant mutants and
reversal of its pathogenicity (16, 17). This, interestingly, points to a potential target for the development of
live attenuated vaccines (LAVs): generating certain mutations in the E protein while keeping the
PDZ-binding motif intact (7). During the viral replication cycle, the virus incorporates a small proportion of
the viral E protein expressed within the infected host, into the virion particles (18). The larger proportion of

E protein is localized at the sites of mammalian intracellular trafficking, the ER-Golgi network and the
ERGIC (19). This localization in the intracellular trafficking components of the host cell helps in the
assembly of viral structure and budding (19). Coronaviruses lacking the E protein produced virion
particles with crippled maturation and were incompetent in forming new virion particles (20–24). The role
of the E protein as a non-specific ion channel on the ER- Golgi membrane of the host cell has also been
suggested (12, 13, 19). Recent studies have shed light on a large number of host-pathogen
protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and identified two classes of small molecules - mRNA translation
inhibitors and Sigma factor 1 and 2 receptor regulators, which showed antiviral activity (5) against novel
SARS-CoV-2.
While there are no ​antiviral drugs or effective vaccines against COVID-19 on the market; we
leverage the existing knowledge of viral channel proteins and structural modeling to explain a putative
mechanism involving E protein in SARS-CoV-2 related infection. ​The development of therapeutic
approaches is being hindered due to the lack of understanding of molecular mechanisms and molecular
players responsible for this novel viral infection (5). The possibility of E protein being a vaccine candidate
has already been explored with the MERS-CoV; certain mutations towards the C-terminal end combined
with mutations in the NS1 protein resulted in a stable vaccine against the virus, overcoming the
pathogenesis of the revertant mutants (16). Since CoV E-protein forms pentameric non-selective ion
channels in the membrane (11–13), we modeled the SARS-CoV-2 E protein using the SARS-CoV-1 NMR
structure (10) as the template. M2 viroporin of Influenza A virus has been reported to function as a proton
channel with a water-hopping mechanism in a conformational dependent manner (25). Similarly, we
identified key amino acid residues lining the inner luminal side of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein, and
subsequent water docking models suggest that the pentameric structure is able to form dynamic closed
and open states. While it calls for detailed studies, the E-protein presents a potential target for the
development of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) and other therapeutic strategies to curb the COVID-19
pandemic.
Results
Coronavirus E-proteins are conserved and have lower mutability compared to spike proteins
A BLASTp search run resulted in 54 sequences of E-proteins from different origins (​Fig. 1a​). E protein of
SARS-CoV-2 isolated in April (Accession number: QII57162.1) was used as the search reference. Some
E-proteins specific to bat (HKU3-7), human SARS 2018, bat SARS_RsSHC014, bat BtRI-BetaCoV,
human SARS-CoV-1 and human SARS-CoV-2 (Accession number: QII57162.1) show a high degree of
conservation in their amino acid composition (​Fig. 1b​). In comparison, we also looked at the conservation
of amino acids for the spike proteins (​Suppl. Fig. 1a​), M-proteins (​Suppl. Fig. 1b​) and protein 7a (​Suppl.
Fig. 1c​). The candidate E-proteins from different origins were closely associated when we plotted the
evolutionary distance (​Suppl. Fig. 1d​). All the selected sequences of Spike proteins, M proteins,
E-proteins, and protein 7a were selected based on a 90-100% sequence identity​. ​The amino acid
composition indicated that the E-proteins have a larger proportion of Leucine (LEU) and Valine (VAL)
compared to either the Spike or the M-proteins (​Fig. 1c i-iii​). Of particular interest was the increased
disparity index among spike proteins compared to the E-proteins (​Fig. 1d i-ii).​ The value of the disparity
index close to 1 (red) indicated larger differences in amino acid composition bias than expected only out
of chance probability and evolutionary divergence (26). Using the amino acid composition, we calculated
the probability of accumulating mutation for a particular residue as a proxy of mutability. We found that
leucine (LEU, 0.189 ± 0.132), valine (VAL, 0.25 ± 0.13) and serine (SER, 0.461 ± 0.091) (​Fig. 1e;
indicated by $$) of the E proteins have lower than 50% chance of mutability compared to spike proteins
(LEU (0.626 ± 0.004), VAL (0.652 ± 0.004) and SER (0.632 ± 0.006)) (​Fig. 1e​). Given the role of E
proteins in viral infection (19), we think that E-proteins present to us a relatively stable viral protein that
demands greater investigation to elucidate its mechanistic insights and features.

Homology modeling of SARS-CoV-2 E protein, validation and bottleneck measurements
We designed a template-based pentameric structural model of the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 with the
NMR structure of E protein from SARS-CoV-1 (PDB ID: 5X29; (10)) as the template (​Fig. 2​a​). The
putative pentameric models of the E-protein have been obtained from GalaxyWEB server ​(​Fig. 2​b-i, side
view, Fig. 2d-i, top view​) and SWISS-MODEL ​(​Fig. 2​b-ii-side view, Fig. 2d-ii-top view​). Based on
homology modeling, we obtained 16 different structural models from both the GalaxyWEB ​(​Suppl. Fig.
2a-p​) and SWISS-MODEL ​(​Suppl. Fig. 3a-p​). The model obtained from GalaxyWEB spanned the entire
protein (1-75) but the five residues (PDLLV) in the C-terminal end of the protein were removed which
reduces the structural flexibility of that region improving the MolProbity parameters. The model obtained
from SWISS-MODEL spanned from 8-65 residues similar to the NMR structure. All the models from both
these protocols and the template structures were validated using MolProbity. The GalaxyWEB models
were chosen based on the following observations: (i) they spanned a longer region of the protein ​(Fig.
2g-i, ii) and (ii) they had better validation scores (Clash score and MolProbity score). The final structural
model (​Fig. 2​b-i) ​was chosen depending on the structural validation parameters obtained from MolProbity
(Fig. 2h-green​). We refer to the structural model used here for further characterization as “​E-put​”. The
bottleneck radius of the template structure ​(​4.2​Å; Fig. 2e and the models obtained from GalaxyWEB
(​3.4​Å; ​Fig. 2f-i) ​and SWISS-MODEL ​(​3.4​Å; ​Fig. 2f-ii) were calculated using the centroid formed by the
triangular orientation of the PHE 26 residues (​ Fig. 2h; ​refer to ​Methods​).
In silico structural analysis of ​E-put showing water docking and putative lining residues important
for its functionality as a proton channel forming H-bonds with water
The pore volume of the ​E-put protein was calculated using the CASTp server clearly showing a
discontinuous channel in the luminal surface of the pore consisting of Pocket 1 and Pocket 2 ​(Fig. 3a).
The lining residues were LEU 37, ILE 33, VAL 29, PHE 26, ALA 22, LEU 19, LEU 18, ASN 15, GLU 8,
VAL 5 and PHE 4 ​(Fig. 3b-i). ​The luminal surface of the pore is shown according to its hydrophobicity
content ​(Fig. 3b-ii). ​The presence of pockets lined by charged, aromatic and hydrophobic residues
suggested that the pentamer could possibly form continuous water chains for proton channeling (25). To
gain an insight into this hypothesis, we docked ​in silico water molecules with the ​E-put protein using
SWISS-DOCK. The presence of water molecules docked in the N-terminal end was observed ​(Fig. 3c).
The distances of the marked residues (LEU 37, ALA 36, ILE 33, ASN 15 and GLU 8) from their nearest
water molecules showed that ASN 15 and GLU 8 lie in the range of hydrogen bonding limit (<2.5 Å; ​Fig.
3d). ​As expected, the distance of LEU 37, ALA 36, ILE 33 from the nearest water molecules lie beyond
the hydrogen bond limit and also short-range interactions limit (>3.8 Å; ​Fig. 3d).
The structural orientation of the ASN 15 and GLU 8 of the ​E-put protein made these residues ideal
candidates for water docking ​(Fig. 3e-i-ii, left, side view, Suppl. Fig. 4a-i-ii, top view). The distance
from a dimer water molecule docked in the luminal side of the pore to the carbonyl group of the amide
side chain of ASN 15 and the charged carboxyl group of the side chain of GLU 8 was 2.03Å and 1.94Å
respectively ​(Fig. 3e-i-ii, right). ​Both​ ​were seen to be perfectly within conventional H-bonding limits.
The structural orientation of LEU 18 and ALA 22 along with their side chains formed the ‘central core’
(Pocket 1) of the ​E-put protein ​(Fig. 3f, left, side view, Fig. 3f, right, top view, Suppl. Fig. 4b, top
view). The LEU 37, ALA 36 and ILE 33 residues along with their side chains formed the ‘hydrophobic
funnel’ (Pocket 2) of the ​E-put protein ​(Fig. 3g, left, side view, Suppl. Fig. 4c, top view). The distance
from a trimer of water molecules docked in the luminal side of the pore to the hydrophobic side chains of
the comprising residues was much higher than H-bonding limit (2.5 Å) and short-range interactions limit
(3.8 Å) ​(Fig. 3g, right; ​LEU 37- 5.39 Å, ALA 36- 5.33 Å, ILE 33- 5.91 Å​). ​This ​shows that water
molecules can access the interior of the hydrophobic funnel without any unfavorable interactions or steric
clashes.
The structural orientation of PHE 26 and their side chains formed the bottleneck of the ​E-put protein,
which can potentially limit the conduction of water or ions through the channel (​Fig. 3h, left, side view,

Fig 3d, right, top view​). The structural orientation of PHE 4 forming the gate of the ​E-put protein, the
conformation of which could determine the putative closed (​Fig. 3i, left, side view, Fig 3i, right, top
view​) and open states (​Suppl. Fig. 4d, left, side view, Fig Suppl. Fig. 4d, right, top view​).
Simultaneously, we analyzed the model obtained from SWISS-MODEL ​(Fig 2-b-ii, d-ii). CASTp pocket
analysis clearly showed the discontinuous channel in the luminal surface of the pore consisting of Pocket
1 and Pocket 2 ​(Fig. 4a)​, and the lining residues ​(Fig. 4b-i). ​The hydrophobicity content is similarly visible
on the luminal surface ​(Fig. 4b-ii). ​We docked ​in silico water molecules with the SWISS-MODEL protein
using SWISS-DOCK ( ​Fig. 4c)​. Similar to E-put shown above, the distances of ASN 15, and GLU 8 from
their nearest water molecules showed that they lie in the range of hydrogen bonding limit (<2.5 Å; ​Fig.
4d-i, ii)​, ​while LEU 37, ALA 36, ILE 33 lie beyond the hydrogen bond limit and also short-range
interactions limit (>3.8 Å; ​Fig. 4e​). The distance from a dimer water molecule to the carbonyl group of
ASN 15 and the charged carboxyl group of GLU 8 was 1.95 Å and 1.88 Å respectively ​(Fig. 4f​). ​The
PHE 26 and their side chains formed the bottleneck of the SWISS-MODEL protein (​Fig. 4-g​).
The modeled ​E-put protein from GalaxyWeb (Fig 2-b-i) and SWISS-MODEL (2-b-ii) was superimposed
using Pymol which yielded an RMS (RMSF) of 3.865 (​Fig. 4-h​-i, side view, Fig. 4-h-ii, top view). ​In
addition, we superimposed the ​E-put o
​ btained from the GalaxyWeb and SWISS-MODEL with the
reported NMR CoV-1 E protein structure (​Suppl. Fig. 5a, b: i (top view), ii (side view)​. Ramachandran
plot of the ​E-put o
​ btained from ​the GalaxyWeb and SWISS-MODEL showed that most of the favored
residues of both the models fall in the alpha-helical region (​Fig. 4-i,j​).
Docking of ​E-put​ with lipid molecules: Ceramide and phosphatidylcholine
Ceramide and phosphatidylcholine contribute to the maximum percentage of lipid composition in the
ER-Golgi network and ERGIC complex of the mammalian cells including humans. Ceramide (​Fig. 5a​) and
phosphatidylcholine (​Fig. 5d​) were docked to ​E-put protein using CHIMERA and Autodock Vina (​Fig. 5b,
e ​respectively; refer to ​Methods)​ . The RMSD values for both the cases were zero, validating the quality
check of the lipid-bound structure of ​E-put​. The distances of the terminal guanidino group of the side
chain of ARG 38 with the phosphoryl group of the charged headgroup of ceramide ​(​2.32 Å; ​Fig. 5c​) and
the carbonyl group of the charged headgroup of phosphatidylcholine ​(​2.29 Å, ​Fig. 5f) ​were calculated.
The distances fall within the covalent or strong hydrogen bond limit (​Fig. 5g​). This concludes that the
E-put protein docks to the lipid components of the ER-Golgi network and ERGIC complex effectively
either by covalent or strong hydrogen bond formation.
In silico s
​ tructural analysis of ​E-put shows a putative conformation-dependent proton channeling
mechanism.
The mechanism of proton transport through the M2 channel of influenza A virus ​via the formation of
well-ordered clusters of water molecules has already been reported (25). This protein undergoes a
pH-dependent conformational change between its closed and open state ((25); ​Fig. 6a​). Based on the M2
channel mechanism and our findings, we propose that ​E-put protein undergoes conformational changes:
(1) Closed discontinuous state (​Fig. 2b-i, 6b-i, top- lateral view, bottom- cross-section​) to (2)
Continuous channel state 1 (​Fig. 6b-ii top- lateral view, bottom- cross-section; Suppl. Fig. 2h​) to (3)
Continuous channel state 2 (​Fig. 6b-iii, top- lateral view, bottom- cross-section; Suppl. Fig. 2j​) and
back to Closed discontinuous state (​Fig. 2B-i, 6b-iv, top- lateral view, bottom- cross-section​). The
pore volumes of all the putative states of ​E-put respectively (​Fig. 6c​) showed an increase in pore volume
during the transition from the closed discontinuous state (​Fig. 6c-i​) to continuous channel states 1 and 2
(​Fig. 6c-ii-iii​). The volume finally decreases when the conformation returns back to the closed
discontinuous state (​Fig. 6c-iv). The water docking phenomena performed in SWISS-DOCK with all the
three putative conformational states further validates this hypothesis (​Suppl. Fig. 6a- i-iii​). As a molecular
mechanism of how these physical states might be achieved, the orientations of the bottleneck residue
PHE 26 in all the three states were analyzed: (1) Closed discontinuous state (​Fig. 6e-i, side view, Suppl.
Fig. 6b-i-iii​) (2) Continuous channel state 1 (​Fig. 6e-ii, side view, Suppl. Fig. 6c-i-iii) ​(3) Continuous
channel state 2 (​Fig. 6e-iii, side view, Suppl. Fig. 6d-i-iii​). We observe a particular recurring change in

the PHE 26 orientation during the putative conformational changes from discontinuous closed to the
continuous open state and back to the closed discontinuous state (​Fig. 6e-iv, side view, Suppl. Fig.
6b-iii). ​On the other hand, the orientation of the PHE 4 residue across the three conformations ​acts as a
gate regulating the putative closed and open states of E-put ​(​Suppl. Fig. 6e​). The conformational
changes during its transition from the putative closed to open states in the ​E-put protein could be a
biophysical mechanism of regulation of the pore, resembling that of influenza A M2 viroporin (25).
Discussion
Structural determination of proteins using NMR spectroscopy provided a set of models of the E protein
from SARS-CoV-1 (Pdb id: 5X29) having the minimum energies (​Supp. ​Fig. 6-a-i​, side view, Fig. 6-a-ii,
top view​). Homology modeling of E-put using this template provided us with many structural models of
the protein. Some of them upon proper structural refinement, represent functionally relevant structures
despite having a higher Clash score or MolProbity score. The higher scores signify that the particular
model is in a higher energy state correlative with functional intermediates of the protein during the viral
progression.
We show that the E protein of novel SARS-CoV-2 might assemble on the ER-Golgi network and ERGIC
complex of human cells as pentamers similar to previous reports in other coronavirus mediated diseases
like SARS-CoV-1 and MERS (19). We have identified various component residues of the pentameric E
protein lining its luminal surface which might take part in various molecular events during its
conformational changes and corresponding functionalities. The ARG 38 seems to act as the hook of the
protein anchoring it to the mammalian ER-Golgi membrane. The orientation of the residues of the
hydrophobic funnel (LEU 37, ALA 36, ILE 33) enables water molecules to travel inside the funnel without
any critical steric clashes. This is evident from the large distances of their side chains from the docked
water molecule, which is beyond the H-bonding limit and short-range interactions limit as well.
The ​E-put protein has a bottleneck located at the midway of the pore and mediated by PHE 26. The
bottleneck is followed by a hydrophobic pocket which we call the central core, lined by ALA 22 and LEU
18. ASN 15 and GLU 8 are the polar/charged residues present below the central pore which are at
H-bond forming distance from water molecules inside the luminal surface of the pore. The N-terminal end
of the ​E-put protein has a gate-like region mediated by PHE 4. The proposed intermediate structures of
the ​E-put which were two of the 16 GalaxyWEB outputs, had MolProbity and Clash score in the following
order: Closed discontinuous state < Continuous Channel state 1 > Continuous Channel state 2 > Closed
discontinuous state. The Continuous Channel state 1 and 2 have less stability and possibly higher energy
states than the closed discontinuous state. This change of conformation of ​E-put protein is mediated by
the PHE 26 at the bottleneck region which changes its orientation during the transition to the
intermediates and PHE 4 which attains closed and open conformations during respective intermediates.
The change in pore volume among the conformations also aligns with our hypothesis of intermediate
states regulating the ​E-put protein. All these ​in silico findings show that the ​E-put protein may act as a
proton channel. The movement of the protons is mediated by the formation of continuous chains of water
clusters ​via a water-hopping mechanism partly similar to the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus as
reported by Acharya et al., 2010 (25).
In order to gain an understanding of the E protein of novel SARS-CoV-2, we resorted to an ​in-silico
approach. It is to be noted that the protein is highly hydrophobic and has a transmembrane domain which
increases the difficulty of protein purification and crystallographic studies. However, they can be easily
targeted for site-directed mutagenesis or deletion of a functional domain. LAV is a vaccine strategy that
takes advantage of the existing virulence of the virus but consists of one or more mutations or deletion of
specific regions of the protein resulting in the loss of its pathogenic activity. As a result, the host is able to
generate immunological memory to eliminate existing viruses and provide future protection. A possible

strategy could be the deletion of the transmembrane domain (12-37) of the ​E-put protein, keeping the
ER-Golgi targeting sequence in the C-terminal intact, which might lead to attenuation of the virus.
Secondly, site-directed mutagenesis of the residues like ASN 15 and GLU 8 could also eliminate its
channeling activity. In addition, mutation of PHE 4 and PHE 26 can render rigidity to the structure
affecting its ability to change its conformation during its functionality.
During the recent MERS near-pandemic in and around 2012, a LAV was developed with a MERS
coronavirus having truncation near the C-terminal end without disturbing the PDZ-binding motif and some
mutations in the NS1 protein of the virus. Keeping that in mind, our study gives a structural insight into the
mechanism of action of the novel SARS-CoV-2 E protein as a conformation-dependent proton channel.
This presents a potential target for LAV development and other therapeutic strategies using inhibitors.
Methods
Multiple sequence alignment:
In order to assess the conservation among candidate coronavirus E-proteins, we performed a
protein-protein BLAST (BLASTp: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) with the E protein of SARS-CoV-2
isolated from Shanghai in April (accession number in QII57162.1). Using a 90-100% sequence identity as
filters, we aligned the resulting sequences using the online alignment tool Clustal Omega (27) and MegaX
(28). Both the software enables high fidelity multiple protein sequence alignment. Jalview
(​www.jalview.org​) was used for visualizing the sequence alignment, conservation score, quality of
alignment and consensus residue for each position. The same methods were undertaken for spike
proteins (100 sequences), M proteins (54 sequences) and protein 7a (30 sequences).
Disparity score and mutability:
Estimates of evolutionary divergence are shown for the different E-proteins isolated from different sources
(bat (HKU3-7), human SARS 2018, bat SARS_RsSHC014, BtRI-BetaCoV, SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 (accession number: QII57162.1)). Analyses were conducted using the Poisson correction
model. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). The
disparity index is a measure of heterogeneity among sites (26) and was calculated from MegaX (28).
Briefly, the disparity index uses a Monte-Carlo procedure to test homogeneity among the input
sequences. Values greater than 0 indicate the larger differences in amino acid composition biases than
expected, based on the evolutionary divergence between sequences and by chance alone.
Frequencies of different amino acids were calculated across the aligned sequences. Mutability was
defined as the probability of an amino acid to be non-consistent across the sequence and was calculated
as follows:
p(M ) = 1 − AA(%)/21
where AA: amino acid composition in percentage and 21 indicates the total amino acid residue space.
The same analytical methods for spike proteins were performed. All data is represented as mean ± SD.
Homology modeling of the E-protein:
The structure of the envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was modeled ​with a template-based homology
modeling approach using the NMR structure of E protein from SARS-CoV-1 (PDB id: 5X29;(10))​. The
full-length pentameric model of the E protein was generated using the following steps:

Another pentameric model of the E protein was generated using the same template ​(PDB id: 5X29) ​using
the SWISS-MODEL (30, 31)​. The structures obtained from these modeling servers were validated by
scores obtained from the MolProbity (32, 33). The structures were chosen by comparing predominantly
the different parameters like percentage of Ramachandran favored and unfavoured residues, percentage
of favored and unfavored rotamers, MolProbity score, and Clash Score, validating the quality of the
modeled protein.
Structure visualizations:
The structural visualizations of the different models were performed using PYMOL. In addition, we used
UCSF-CHIMERA (34) for detailed visualization of residues in the structure and for representation
throughout the paper. UCSF-CHIMERA has been referred to as CHIMERA throughout the article.
Important amino acid residues lining the inner lumen of the pentameric E-put protein were identified. Of
particular interest was the PHE 26 where we defined the bottleneck region and this was used to calculate
the pore radius for different conformations. The radius of the bottleneck region of the ​E-put protein was
calculated with the centroid of the triangle formed by the different orientations of PHE 26 in closed or
open conformation. The distance from the vertices of the triangle thus formed from the centroid was then
used to calculate the effective radius.
For a scalene triangle having side lengths of a,b and c units, the length of the medians are defined as m​a​,
m​b​ and m​c​ units on the respective sides as mentioned in the subscript. The length of the medians are:
√ 2 2 2
ma = 2b +22c −a
mb =
mc =

√2a2 + 2c2 −b2
2

√2a2 + 2b2 −c2
2

All the medians meet at a point inside the triangle, called the centroid. The distances of the three vertices
from the centroid are equal to two-thirds of the length of the median passing through the respective
vertices. The distances of each of the vertices from the centroid are considered as the pore radii of the
protein in three different directions. The average value of all these radii is calculated as the effective pore
radius of the protein.
Pore volume and topology estimation:
The pore volume of the protein in its different conformational states is determined using CASTp
(Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins;(35)). In order to account for the presence and
impact of the modeled pentameric ​E-put protein, we estimated the presence of surface pockets, internal
cavities, and cross channels using the CASTp server. Briefly, CASTp uses a computational geometry
approach to measure area and volume and to identify topological imprints on the protein. The lining
residues are annotated from the UniProt database and mapped along with the cavity. The cavities with
the two maximum molecular surface area and volume were selected. The molecular surface is colored by
its hydrophobicity index. These values are determined by the Kyte-Doolittle scale of hydrophobicity with
appropriate colors ranging from blue for the most hydrophilic to orange-red for the most hydrophobic
pockets. The Ramachandran plots of the protein are plotted using Zeus ​software
(​http://www.al-nasir.com/portfolio/​; Source: ​https://www.rcsb.org/pages/thirdparty/molecular_graphics​)
.
Water molecule interactions in different conformations:
The docking of the water molecules to the ​E-put​ structure was performed in SWISS-DOCK (36).

Algorithm: EADock DSS (37) blind docking algorithm is used by SWISS-DOCK and CHARMM (38) force
fields are used to create a rank of favorable energies. The most favorable clusters are then used to
generate the solvation model.
Input files: The modeled protein structure (​E-put)​ and ligand (water) were uploaded in the PDB and Mol2
formats respectively. The water molecule (Pubchem ID: CID 962) was imported in CHIMERA in .sdf
format and converted to .mol2 format. The SWISS-DOCK server uses CHARMM topology, parameters,
and coordinates for determining ​Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF) and Van der Waals interactions
from the ligand to predict the docking sites on the protein structure.
Lipid interaction using Autodock VINA:
Phosphatidylcholine (Pubchem ID: CID ​6441487​) and ceramide (Pubchem ID: CID 5702612) are the
main lipid components of the ER-Golgi network and ERGIC of mammals including humans. ​E-put has
been docked to both the lipid molecules by the following steps:
A. Preparation of lipid molecules in OpenBabel which is an online interface for the preparation of
chemical molecules (39).
B. Energy minimization of the modeled structure in CHIMERA using the following steps:
a. Fast process: Steepest descent minimization to remove the critical steric clashes which are highly
unfavorable to the protein structure globally.
b. Slow process: Conjugate gradient minimization to remove remaining clashes and other steric
discrepancies in the protein structure to reach an energy minimum for that structure.
c. The energies are reported in kJ/mol in the Reply Log (34).
C. The minimized structure is visualized in CHIMERA and docked to the two lipid molecules using the
following steps:
a. The search space for the docking algorithm to run is defined by a three-dimensional box with
appropriate axes’ lengths which encompasses our region of interest in the protein structure.
b. Docking of the lipid molecules to the E protein in the search space described previously is carried
out using Autodock Vina which uses the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm as
an Iterated Local search global optimizer method, to speed up its ​optimization procedures (40).
D. The docked conformations of the protein with the lipid molecules were visualized using CHIMERA
and the RMSD values of the docking events analyzed by Vina, are represented by CHIMERA in a
Reply Log of Autodock Vina (34, 40).
