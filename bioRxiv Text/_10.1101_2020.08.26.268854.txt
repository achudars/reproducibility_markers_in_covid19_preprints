Abstract

2

SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and shutdown economies around the world.

3

Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin

4

cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may

5

be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we

6

generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site (ΔPRRA) in the spike protein.

7

This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells. The

8

mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.

9

In contrast, the ΔPRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and

10

had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the

11

ΔPRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge.

12

reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies

13

against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently

14

reduced PRNT50 titers. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage

15

site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, these findings illustrate

16

the importance of this insertion in evaluating neutralization and other downstream SARS-CoV-2

17

assays.

18

Importance

19

As COVID-19 has impacted the world, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 replicates and causes

20

virulence offers potential pathways to disrupt its disease. By removing the furin cleavage site,

21

we demonstrate the importance of this insertion to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis.

22

In addition, the findings with Vero cells indicate the likelihood of cell culture adaptations in virus

23

stocks that can influence reagent generation and interpretation of a wide range of data including

24

neutralization and drug efficacy. Overall, our work highlights the importance of this key motif in

25

SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.

Importantly, plaque

Introduction

27

The rapid emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at the

28

end of 2019 ushered in a pandemic that has led to over 24 million cases and over 800,000

29

deaths 1,2. The novel coronavirus, like its predecessors severe acute respiratory syndrome

30

coronavirus SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV induces

31

potentially severe respiratory disease including fever, breathing difficulty, bilateral lung

32

infiltration, and in many cases, death 3,4. While SARS-CoV-2 shares a similar genomic structure

33

and protein homology with SARS-CoV, its ability to spread asymptomatically and cause a range

34

of mild to severe disease distinguishes it from the earlier pandemic CoV 5. In exploring the

35

differences, attention has been paid to the spike (S) protein, a key glycoprotein responsible for

36

receptor binding and entry into the cell. Following receptor recognition, the S protein is

37

subsequently cleaved at two sites, S1/S2 and the S2’ site to facilitate virus entry into a cell.

38

Initial structural work has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has greater affinity for the ACE2 receptor

39

than the original SARS-CoV 6,7. In addition, changes in the N-terminal domain in addition to the

40

receptor-binding domain indicate potential differences in attachment that may drive changes to

41

transmission or virulence 8. However, the majority of attention has focused on a potentially

42

critical insertion of a furin cleavage site upstream of the S1 cleavage site in spike 9. Absent in

43

other group 2B CoVs, the four additional amino acids (PRRA) form the classic RXXR motif

44

cleaved by many serine proteases when added to the conserved R found at the SARS-CoV-2

45

S1 cleavage site (PRRAR) 10. Notably, furin cleavage sites have been observed in other

46

virulent pathogens like HIV, avian influenza strains (H5 and H7) as well as Ebola 11. In fact, furin

47

cleavage sites are found in a number of other CoV family members including MERS-CoV,

48

HKU1-Cov, and OC43-CoV 12,13; given the range of disease associated with these CoV strains,

49

the furin cleavage site does not necessarily predetermine virulence. However, given its

50

absence in other group 2B CoVs and the major differences in disease compared to SARS-CoV,

51

a better understanding of the role of the furin cleavage site during SARS-CoV-2 infection is

52

needed.

53

In this manuscript, we utilized a reverse genetic system to generate a SARS-CoV-2

54

mutant that lacked the furin cleavage site insertion 14. The mutant, ΔPRRA, had augmented

55

replication and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells relative to wild type (WT) SARS-CoV-2. It also

56

had reduced spike processing as compared to the WT virus. In contrast, the ΔPRRA mutant

57

was attenuated in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had altered S protein

58

processing as compared to Vero cells. In vivo, the ΔPRRA mutant had attenuated disease in

59

hamsters despite robust, and sometimes augmented viral replication. Importantly, prior

60

infection with the ΔPRRA mutant protected hamsters from subsequent rechallenge with WT

61

SARS-CoV-2. Finally, neutralization assays that used the ΔPRRA mutant had lower PRNT50

62

values with both COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding

63

domain (RBD). Together, the results indicate a critical role for the furin cleavage site in SARS-

64

CoV-2 infection and potential complications in interpreting research related to this virus

65

infection.

Results

68

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is >75% conserved in amino acid sequence across the group

69

2B CoV family with the majority of the differences occurring in the N-terminal domain and

70

receptor-binding domain in the S1 portion (S. Fig. 1A). The insertion of a furin cleavage site

71

(PRRA) upstream of the S1 cleavage site distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from other group 2B CoV

72

sequences including SARS-CoV and RATG13, the closest bat-derived CoV sequence (S. Fig.

73

1B). To evaluate the impact of the furin cleavage site insertion, we generated a mutant virus

74

lacking the PRRA motif using our SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetic system (Fig. 1A)

75

the SARS-CoV S protein structure, the insertion occurs in an exterior loop of the SARS-CoV-2

76

spike below the spike globular head and away from the receptor binding domain (Fig. 1B)

77

Using homology modeling based on the SARS-CoV S protein structure, we found the PRRA

78

insertion in an extended loop (cyan). Deletion of PRRA insertion is predicted to shorten the

79

loop, but importantly, not disrupt the overall structure of the spike protein. Following

80

electroporation, we were able to recover the SARS-CoV-2

81

roughly equivalent to the wild-type (WT) virus. Surprisingly, the SARS-CoV-2

82

virus produced a larger plaque size on Vero E6 cells than WT virus, suggesting potential

83

changes in viral replication and spread in the absence of the furin cleavage site insertion (S.

augmented replication in Vero E6 cells.

95

We next evaluated spike processing of the

ΔPRRA mutant relative to WT SARS-CoV-2

96

as well as the original SARS-CoV. Vero E6 cells were infected at an MOI of ~0.1 for 24 h and

97

purified virions were isolated from supernatants using ultracentrifugation and a sucrose cushion.

98

The pelleted virus was subsequently examined for spike and nucleocapsid (N) protein levels by

99

western blotting. Following SARS-CoV infection, the majority of the spike protein was observed

100

in its full-length form (98.6%) (Fig. 1D, S. Fig. 2A), consistent with the absence of processing.

101

In contrast, the WT SARS-CoV-2 virions had a significant reduction in full-length spike protein

102

(40.4%). Instead, the most abundant form of the spike protein was the S1/S2 cleavage product

(59.6%). Finally, the

levels of viral N protein, these results illustrate the differences in processing between SARS-

107

driven primarily by the furin cleavage site following infection of Vero E6 cells.

113

nearly 90% of the viral population based on both RT-PCR distinguishing the two viruses.

114

Similarly, a 90:10 WT to mutant input ratio resulted in ~65% of the viral sequences

115

corresponding with the mutant virus, illustrating the advantage of the furin site deletion after only

indicate that even without the furin cleavage site, there is significant processing of the SARS-

CoV-2 spike. The results suggest that while the furin cleavage site is key in SARS-CoV-2 spike

mNeonGreen (mNG) reporter in open reading frame 7 and subsequently compared

204

neutralization results to the WT SARS-CoV-2 mNG reporter assay as previously described

205

(Fig. 3A). Examining seventeen COVID-19 human sera samples, we found nearly uniform

206

reduction in PRNT50 values against the

207

(Fig. 3B). The lower PRNT50 values were observed in sera whether the samples were from low,

208

intermediate, or high neutralizing COVID19 patients (Fig. 3C-E) and averaged a 2.3-fold

209

reduction across the 17 human sera. The consistency in the reduction suggested several

210

possibilities: One is that virions themselves are altered in the conformation of the spike on the

211

surface. In this situation, the processing or loss of spikes may permit access to more cryptic

212

sites on the spike S2 or other regions allowing the WT virus to be more easily neutralized by

213

non-receptor binding domain antibodies. A second possibility is that the loss of the furin

214

cleavage site leaves more intact spike molecules on the virion surface requiring more antibodies

215

to neutralize the ΔPRRA mutant than WT SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we examined

Discussion

224

The loss of the furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike has a major impact on infection and

225

pathogenesis. Using a reverse genetic system for the SARS-CoV-2 WA1 isolate, we generated

226

a mutant virus that deleted the four amino acid insertion (ΔPRRA).

227

cleavage site resulted in reduced infection in Calu3 respiratory cells and ablated disease in the

228

hamster pathogenesis model of SARS-CoV-2. Despite attenuated disease on initial infection,

229

the ΔPRRA infected hamsters were protected from subsequent challenge with WT SARS-CoV-2

230

indicating induction of robust immunity. Together, the results highlight the importance of the

231

furin cleavage site insertion to SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.

251

S1/S2 indicating that most spike on the virion surface have been cleaved. Notably, the spike

252

processing is distinct in Calu3 2B4 respiratory cells. While SARS-CoV virions remain uncleaved

253

with little S1/S2 cleavage product, WT SARS-CoV-2 has increased processing from full-length

254

to the S1/S2 cleavage product than what was observed in Vero E6 cells. Surprisingly,

255

in Calu3 cells also had a shift toward the S1/S2 fragment which is absent in Vero E6 cells. The

results indicate that while the majority of the spike cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the

mild disease was observed in one of the WT SARS-coV-2 infected hamsters, the

infected hamsters showed no evidence of disease. However, low viral loads were observed in
