Summary of the idea
Our idea is focused on the development of “monoclonal-type” plastic antibodies based on
Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) able to selectively bind a portion of the novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to block its function and, thus, the infection process. Molecular
Imprinting, indeed, represents a very promising and attractive technology for the synthesis of MIPs
characterized by specific recognition abilities for a target molecule. Given these characteristics, MIPs
can be considered tailor-made synthetic antibodies obtained by a templating process.
In the present study, the developed imprinted polymeric nanoparticles were characterized in terms of
particles size and distribution by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and the imprinting effect and
selectivity were investigated by performing binding experiments using the receptor-binding domain
(RBD) of the novel coronavirus and the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein, respectively. Finally, the
hemocompatibility of the prepared MIP-based plastic antibodies was also evaluated.

Main Text
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the
subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronavirdiae, and characterized by a RNA genome ranging from
26 to 32 kilobases (Chan et al., 2020; Su et al., 2016). On the basis of their host specificity, these
CoVs can be classified into four main genera such as Alphacoronavirus (αCoV), Betacoronavirus
(βCoV), Deltacoronavirus (δCoV) and Gammacoronavirus (γCoV) (Snijder et al., 2006).
Coronaviruses have been identified in birds and mammals such as bats, mice, cats and dogs (Fehr and
Perlman, 2015; Lu et al., 2020), but this kind of viruses is able to infect both animals and humans.
Human CoVs, indeed, were first characterized in the 1960s and are associated with respiratory
infections (Paraskevis et al., 2020). In December 2019, several cases of patients affected by viral
pneumonia were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and a novel coronavirus (SARSCoV-2, initially called 2019-nCoV) able to infect humans was identified and detected in these
patients.
The genome analysis of the novel coronavirus revealed that it belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus
of the genus Betacoronavirus and it is closely related (88% identity) to two bat-SARS-like
coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) with which it forms a distinct lineage (Lu
et al., 2020; Pradhan et al., 2020). On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is divergent from SARS-CoV
(about 79% similarity) and MERS-CoV (about 50% similarity) (Lu et al., 2020). The genome of
SARS-CoV-2 encodes different proteins such as the spike protein, the envelope protein, the
membrane protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. The coronavirus spike protein is a surface protein
that mediates host recognition and attachment. It consists of two functional subunits: the S1 subunit,
which contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) responsible for host cell receptor recognizing and
binding, and the S2 subunit, which is involved in the viral and host membranes fusion. These two
processes, which represent the initial steps in the coronavirus infection cycle,

are crucial in

determining host specificity, tissue tropism and transmission capacity (Lu et al., 2015; Wang et al.,
2016). Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21,

its RBD structure presents a high homology to that of SARS-CoV, which uses angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host cell receptor (Li et al., 2005). Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong
to the -genus and, in a recent study (Wan et al., 2020), it is reported that the overall sequence
similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV spike proteins are around 76%-78% for the whole
protein and around 73%-76% for the RBD. Moreover, Xu X. et al. (Xu et al., 2020) have found that
the novel coronavirus spike protein has a relevant binding affinity to human ACE2 and, thus, this
virus can interact with this entry receptor causing the infection of human respiratory epithelial cells.
Therefore, the spike protein, which is involved in viral recognition and binding to human ACE2 (Lei
et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) playing a key role also in human-to-human
transmission of this novel coronavirus, represents the common and primary target for the
development of antibodies, vaccines and therapeutic agents.
In this context, our idea is to develop “monoclonal-type” plastic antibodies based on Molecularly
Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) for the selective recognition and binding of the RBD of the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the aim to block the function of its spike protein (Figure 1.).

This kind of polymeric matrices is synthesized by polymerizing functional and crosslinking
monomers around the template (Parisi et al., 2014; Parisi et al., 2020a). The selective recognition
abilities of the imprinted polymers are due to the formation of a complex between the target analyte
and the selected functional monomers during the pre-polymerization step. Therefore, the choice of
the monomers represents a crucial point in the preparation of effective MIPs and it is based on their
ability to establish interactions with the functional groups of the template molecule in a covalent or
non-covalent way. Three main approaches, indeed, can be used to synthesize this kind of polymers
depending on the nature of the interactions occurring between the template molecule and the chosen
functional monomers during both pre-polymerization and binding steps (Parisi et al., 2020b; Puoci et
al., 2010). In the covalent one, template and functional monomers are covalently bound during the
pre-polymerization phase and, after the polymerization reaction, the analyte is extracted from the
polymeric matrix by chemical cleavage of the covalent bonds. Then, the same covalent interactions
are re-formed during the rebinding. The semi-covalent approach involves the formation of covalent
interactions during the polymerization process and non-covalent interactions in the rebinding process.
Finally, the non-covalent approach is based on the formation of non-covalent interactions, including
hydrogen bonds and electrostatic, π-π and hydrophobic interactions, between template and monomers
during the polymerization process and the subsequent recognition phase. This method is widely
employed due to several advantages such as the simple experimental procedure and the large variety
of appropriate functional monomers. In the present study, the last imprinting approach was chosen
for the MIPs-based antibodies preparation due to the nature of the template-monomers interactions,
which are similar to those found in biological systems. Once the polymerization reaction has taken
place, the template is extracted leading to a porous crosslinked polymeric matrix containing binding
holes fitting size, shape and functionalities of the target compound.
Plastic antibodies made from tailor-made polymeric imprinted nanoparticles represent an alternative
to the traditional antibodies, which require an expensive production procedure and are often
unreliable due to their restricted stability (Refaat et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019). Being synthetic

materials, MIPs are robust, physically and chemically stable in a wide range of conditions, including
temperature and pH, and more easily available due to a low-cost, reproducible and relatively fast and
easy preparation compared to the biological counterpart (Piloto et al., 2018; Wubulikasimu et al.,
2019). Therefore, this kind of materials combines the robustness of polymers with the selectivity of
natural receptors (Capriotti et al., 2020) and could find applications in several fields, including
separation, catalysis and drug delivery, as sensors, synthetic biomimetic receptors and recognition
elements in bioanalytical assays (Pan et al., 2018). Moreover, imprinted polymers are characterized
by significant versatility. These polymeric materials, indeed, can be designed and engineered
according to their specific application developing polymers with magnetic and/or fluorescent
properties.
Synthetic polymeric antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was produced according to the Molecular
Imprinting Technology (MIT) and a Non-Imprinted Polymer (NIP) was also prepared following the
same experimental procedure adopted for the imprinted nanoparticles, but in the absence of the novel
coronavirus RBD. For this purpose, the non-covalent imprinting approach was adopted and
biocompatible functional and crosslinking monomers were chosen.
Particles size and distribution were investigated by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer
nano ZS DLS (Malvern Instrument, Malvern, UK). For sample preparation, 25 μL of a polymeric
nanoparticles suspension in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 10 -3 M) at pH 7.4 were added to 3 mL
of PBS and sonicated for 30 seconds. The performed DLS analysis highlighted a mean diameter equal
to 80.3 ± 6.2 nm and a polydispersity index (PI) of 0.287 indicating a narrow size distribution (Figure
2.). The dimensionless polydispersity index, indeed, was used as a measure of the size distribution
and a value below 0.3 is indicative of a homogeneous population of particles.

Figure 2. Characterization of Molecularly Imprinted Nanoparticles: DLS analysis.

In order to investigate both recognition properties and selectivity of the prepared imprinted
nanoparticles, binding studies were carried out in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7.4. The
imprinting effect was evaluated by binding experiments in which amounts of imprinted and nonimprinted nanoparticles were incubated with a standard solution of the SARS-CoV-2 receptorbinding domain. SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis was used to quantify the interaction of MIP with the
novel coronavirus RBD and the obtained results (Figure 3. and Table 1.) highlighted the capability
of the imprinted polymer to recognize and bind a higher amount of the target molecule compared to
the corresponding non-imprinted one.

The same experimental conditions were adopted to perform selectivity studies, which involved a
standard solution of a molecule structurally similar to the 2019-nCoV RBD such as the RBD of
SARS-CoV spike protein. The obtained results showed no significant differences between MIP and
NIP nanoparticles (Table 1.) in the interaction with SARS-CoV RBD confirming the specific and
selective abilities of the imprinted polymer. These MIP properties, indeed, are due to the presence of
selective molecular recognition holes that are complementary to the target template in terms of size,
shape and functional groups. The choice of functional monomer plays a key role in the imprinting
process to ensure the formation of selective binding sites within the polymeric matrix. In this work,
the employed functional monomer was chosen in the aim to promote also hydrophobic interactions
with the receptor-binding domain of the novel coronavirus. Therefore, the interactions established
between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the synthesized imprinted polymeric nanoparticles are not
affected by pH changes.
The developed MIP-based plastic antibodies were designed for intravenous administration and,
therefore, have to provide a suitable hemocompatibility, which is a key requirement for a successful
system that comes in contact with the bloodstream. In order to evaluate the hemocompatibility of the
prepared imprinted nanoparticles, hemolysis tests were performed using an isotonic phosphate buffer
solution and pure water as negative and positive controls, respectively. A polymeric material is
considered not-hemolytic if the hemolysis percentage is below 5% (Contreras-García et al., 2011;
Panikkar et al., 1997). The performed hemolysis assay revealed that the synthesized imprinted
nanoparticles induced 3.9% hemolysis, thus, the observed hemolytic potential is within satisfactory
limits indicating a good hemocompatibility without causing erythrocyte damage.
In conclusion, Molecular Imprinting Technology was adopted as synthetic strategy to prepared
molecularly imprinted nanoparticles able to selectively recognize and bind the spike protein receptorbinding domain of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The reported preliminary results suggested
the potential use of this biocompatible polymeric material as MIP-based “monoclonal-type” plastic
antibodies devoted to block the function of the virus spike protein. Given these characteristics, the

developed nanoparticles could be potentially used as free-drug therapeutics in the treatment of 2019nCoV infection. Moreover, when loaded with antiviral agents, these nanoparticles could act as a
powerful multimodal system combining their ability to block the virus spike protein with the targeted
delivery of the loaded drug. In addition, the same nanoparticles can be further engineered to become
an immunoprotective vaccine or a MIP-based sensor for diagnostic purpose.
