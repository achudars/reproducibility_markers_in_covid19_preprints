Abstract
b-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that include the
severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV2 (SARS-CoV2). While much is known regarding
their cellular entry and replication pathways, their mode of egress remains uncertain;
however, this is assumed to be via the biosynthetic secretory pathway by analogy to other
enveloped viruses. Using imaging methodologies in combination with virus-specific
reporters, we demonstrate that b-Coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for egress
from cells. This pathway is regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b; thus, virus
egress is insensitive to inhibitors of the biosynthetic secretory pathway. Coronavirus
infection results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation and
disruption of antigen presentation pathways. This coronavirus-induced exploitation of
lysosomes provides insights into the cellular and immunological abnormalities observed
in patients and suggests new therapeutic modalities.

Introduction
b-Coronaviruses are positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that comprise one of
the 4 genera of the Coronaviridae family of viruses. b-Coronaviruses infect humans and
other mammals with infections resulting in a range of diseases with considerable
morbidity and mortality. In late 2019, one member, the SARS - CoV2, originating in bats,
spread to humans and caused a world-wide ongoing pandemic that up to now has killed
over 4 million people (Lu et al., 2020).
The ability of these viruses to infect many different cell types including those of the
pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, gastrointestinal, central nervous and immune
systems results in complex multi-organ disease manifestations that can vary from
individual to individual (Puelles et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). Especially with regards
to the immune system, the virus appears to deregulate the traditional innate and adaptive
immune responses to pathogens (Vardhana and Wolchok 2020). Currently there is no
cure, the antiviral treatment options are few (Williamson et al., 2020) and it is far from
clear if there can even be a lasting immune response generated to infection by natural
means or through vaccine administration (Long et al., 2020).
One of the major reasons for lack of anti-viral therapies is the paucity of knowledge
regarding the b-Coronavirus-host cell interface. Once the viral envelope fuses with the
plasma membrane and/or endosome membranes, and the ~30kB viral RNA genome is
released into the cytosol, it becomes translated into non-structural and structural proteins.
The non-structural proteins assemble on ER-derived membranes and replicate the viral
RNA (Snijder et al., 2006; Snijder et al., 2020). While some amount of molecular detail is
known regarding coronavirus attachment to the cell, receptor binding, envelope fusion
and replication, very little is known regarding how the newly assembled coronaviruses
exit the cells and spread to others (Fung et al., 2019).
It is largely accepted that the egress pathway for all b-Coronaviruses starts with
the newly synthesized viral genomic RNA molecules coated with viral N proteins budding
into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate
compartment (ERGIC) (McBride et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 2011;Perrier et al., 2019). This
results in the viral genomic materials getting enveloped with host membranes containing
the viral M, E and S (i.e. spike) structural transmembrane proteins (de Haan et al., 1998;

Siu et al., 2008; Ruch et al., 2012). Once in the ER/ERGIC lumen, the viruses traffic to
the Golgi apparatus and Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) for glycosylation and other posttranslational modifications (Oostra et al., 2006; Fung et al., 2018). But after the
Golgi/TGN, it has been assumed that coronaviruses use vesicles of the biosynthetic
secretory pathway to track to the plasma membrane and egress, similar to other
enveloped RNA viruses, such as such as hepatitis C, dengue, and West Nile (Ravindran
et al., 2016; Robinson et al., 2018).
Here we investigated the egress pathway of b-Coronaviruses and found that rather
xthan the biosynthetic secretory pathway, these viruses use an atypical lysosome-based,
Arl8-dependent exocytic pathway for release into the extracellular environment. We show
that GRP78/BIP an ER-chaperone, that facilitates coronavirus infectivity (Chu et al., 2018;
Ha et al., 2020), is co-released with b-coronaviruses through lysosome exocytosis. As a
consequence of viral exploitation of lysosomes, we demonstrate that lysosomes are
deacidified and lysosomal proteases are inactive. Significantly we show that this
perturbation of lysosome physiology impacts functional consequences on the host cell,
including disruption of antigen presentation pathways.
Results
b-Coronaviruses exit cells independently of the biosynthetic secretory pathway.

We began investigating the mechanism of b-Coronavirus egress using mouse
hepatitis virus (MHV), as it is the prototype of the family that can be studied under BSL-2
conditions, with intranasal MHV infections in mice inducing pathogenesis similar to SARS,
including acute pneumonia, lung injury as well as hepatic and neurological disease (De
Albuquerque et al., 2006; Khanolkar et al., 2007; Channappanavar et al., 2016). First,
we tested whether MHV used post-Golgi vesicles of the secretory pathway to egress by
blocking this pathway with the drug Brefeldin A (BFA) (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989;
Miller et al., 1992). We minimized any secondary indirect effects of BFA on viral entry or
replication by treating infected cells with BFA between 8- and 14-hour post-inoculation (hr
pi) i.e., at the peak virus release (Figure 1A, black line). HeLa-ATCC cells stably
expressing murine CEACAM1 (HeLa-mCC1a) were pulsed with virus and at 8hr pi, the
culture media was replaced with fresh media with or without BFA (5µgr/ml). After 6hr of

incubation (i.e. 14hr pi), both the extracellular media and cell lysates were collected, and
their respective viral genome contents were quantified by qPCR. Remarkably, the
quantity of virus released in the presence of BFA during egress was almost identical to
that in its absence (Figure 1B, black bars) and its infectivity when passaged to new cells
was unaffected (Figure S1A). On the other hand, the secretion of Gaussia Luciferase, a
transfected reporter that relies on post-Golgi secretory vesicles to be released (Tannous
et al., 2009), was completely blocked when BFA was present during infection (Figure 1B,
pink bars). These data indicated that the secretory pathway is not essential for viral
egress.
We then investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of MHV during infection. The
M protein is the most abundant protein in the envelope of b-Coronaviruses and drives
virus assembly, membrane curvature and budding into the ER/ERGIC by oligomerizing
with itself and with viral RNA, N, E and S proteins (de Haan et al., 2005; Ruch et al.,
2012). Immunolabeling cells at peak egress (12hr pi) with the J1.3 monoclonal anti-M
antibody (Stohlman et al., 1982; Narayanan et al., 2000), and subsequent
immunoelectron microscopy revealed antibody labeling to be concentrated 3-fold more
on the envelopes of viral particles than on membranes elsewhere (ER, ERGIC, Golgi etc.)
(Figures S1B and S1C). While we cannot exclude that J1.3 does not recognize any free
M proteins, this indicated that the antibody detected M within the context of assembled
particles. In addition, consistent with recognition of assembled virus particles, MHV (M
J1.3)

antibody labeling colocalized with E and S envelope proteins throughout infection

(Figures 1C and S1D).
We pulsed cells with MHV, fixed at different post-inoculation time intervals, and
co-stained with the MHV (M

J1.3)

antibody and antibodies against various host organelle

resident proteins. At 6hr pi, consistent with previous reports showing newly synthesized
viruses trafficking to the TGN at the early stages of infection (Machamer et al., 2013),
MHV (M J1.3) labeling was perinuclear (Figure 1C, 6hr pi) and colocalized with Golgin 97
and TGN46 by immunofluorescence (Figures S1E and S1F, 6hr pi). Immunogold labeled
virus particles could also be observed within ERGIC and Golgi/TGN stacks (Figure S1G).
However, after 9hr pi, the MHV (M J1.3) labeling was no longer concentrated at the
Golgi/TGN (even though these organelles were still present and intact [Figures S1E, S1F

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.25.192310; this version posted July 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

and S1H]). Instead it was concentrated in puncta dispersed across the cytoplasm (Figure
1C, 9 and 12hr pi). These puncta appeared to be lysosomes or lysosome-like organelles
as they contained lysosomal transmembrane proteins LAMP1 (Figure 1D, 9 and 12hrpi),
LAMP2 (not shown), the lysosomal lumenal enzyme cathepsin D (Figure S1I) and the
lysosomal small GTPase Rab7 (Bucci et al., 2000) (Figure 1E). Significantly,
immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the M J1.3 labeling reported viral particles in the
lysosomes (and not aggregates of M protein or free M protein) (Figure 1E, white arrows).
This localization was also not due to reuptake of newly released virus particles as
endocytosis was significantly inhibited at this time (Figures S1J and S1K). Furthermore,
in SARS-CoV2 infected Vero E6 cells, M labeling could also be detected within lysosomes
(Figure 1F). Quantification of MHV-infected HeLa-mCC1a or primary mouse
macrophages revealed that ~60% and ~75% respectively of lysosomes contained virus
at 12hr pi (Figures 1G and 1H).
b-Coronaviruses and GRP78/BIP are co-released during infection.

We next investigated if any host proteins co-trafficked with MHV to lysosomes
during the window of egress. The Golgi resident protein mannosidase II, the TGN resident
proteins TGN46 and Golgin 97 (Figures S1E-S1H) all remained perinuclear and the
mannose-6 phosphate receptor which traffics between TGN and late endosomes (Brown
et al., 1986) did not colocalize with MHV in puncta (Figure S2). However, the KDELReceptor, an ER/Golgi cycling-transmembrane protein that is critical for retrieving
escaped ER resident proteins from the Golgi apparatus and the soluble ER luminal
chaperone GRP78/BIP (Munro and Pelham 1987) were both found to localize with
LAMP1 and MHV during peak virus egress (Figures 2A-2D). Moreover, similar to MHV,
GRP78/BIP was released into the extracellular media during this time and its release was
not due to cell lysis as actin was undetectable in the extracellular medium (Figure 2E).
Notably BIP release, much like MHV, was insensitive to BFA treatment (Figures 2F).
Together these data demonstrated that during the time of egress, MHV along with
GRP78/BIP, get transferred to lysosomal organelles and released from cells through a
route bypassing the BFA sensitive, Golgi/TGN to plasma membrane, biosynthetic
secretory pathway.

b-Coronaviruses and GRP78/BIP use an Arl8b dependent lysosome-exocytic

pathway for egress.
Lysosome exocytosis is a known BFA-insensitive pathway whereby lysosomes
traffic to the cell periphery and fuse with the plasma membrane to release their luminal
contents (Laulagnier et al., 2011). We conjectured that MHV may be exploiting this route
for egress. In support, we found that plasma membrane LAMP1 levels were ~2.5 fold
higher in infected cells (Figures 3A and 3B) and cell surface lysosome fusion events
(monitored by TIRF imaging of ectopically expressed pHluorin-LAMP1-mCherry) were
~3-fold enhanced (Figure 3C). Furthermore, immunoelectron micrographs of MHVinfected cells showed numerous Rab7-positive lysosomes containing MHV particles at
the plasma membrane with some in the process of fusion (Figure 3D, black arrows).
We then investigated the role of Arl8b, as a small Ras-like GTPase that localizes
exclusively to lysosomes (Xu et al., 2014; Khatter et al., 2015; Michelet et al., 2015;
Michelet et al., 2018; Boda et al., 2019) and regulates lysosome movement to the plasma
membrane and exocytosis (Michelet et al., 2015). We treated cells with small interfering
RNAs (siRNA) targeting Arl8b and obtained ~50% down regulation of Arl8b in cells
(Figures S3A and S3B). Arl8b siRNA treated cells decreased viral release by ~30-fold
compared to non-target siRNA-treated cells and RNA replication was unaffected (Figure
3E). Moreover, Arl8b depletion resulted in >50% decrease in extracellular BIP levels
(Figure 3F), confirming that both MHV and GRP78/BIP utilize Arl8b-dependent lysosome
exocytic pathways for egress during infection.
Lysosomes are deacidified and lysosomal enzymes are inactive in b-Coronavirus
infected cells.
We then assessed the functional consequences of b-coronavirus infection in terms
of lysosome function, including SARS-CoV-2 alongside MHV. We used Lysotracker-Red
DND99, cell permeable weak base dye that accumulates highly selectively in acidified
lysosomes (Sanman et al., 2016). Indeed, labeling cells with the dye prior to fixing with
aldehydes and staining with anti-LAMP1 antibodies (without detergents) reveals complete
localization of the dye fluorescence to lysosomes (Figure S4). HeLa-mCC1a cells and

primary mouse macrophages infected with MHV for 12hrs and Vero E6 cells infected with
SARS-CoV2 for up to 24hrs were labeled with Lysotracker Red DND99 and aldehyde
fixed before imaging. We observed a stark decrease in both the acidity of lysosomes and
the number of acidified lysosomes in b-Coronavirus infected cells compared to mockinfected cells (Figures 4A-4C). Using the quantifiable live-cell pH dye, Lysosensor Green
DND-189, we determined that the mean lysosomal pH in MHV-infected cells was 5.7 with
a range between 5.0 to 6.4; whereas in mock-infected cells it was pH 4.7 with range
between 4.2 to 5.2 (Figures 4D).
Lysosomal enzymes are optimized for this organelles’ highly acidic pH and even
small increases of pH can be sufficient to block protease activity (Sanman et al., 2016;
Lie et al., 2019). Given our observation of deacidified lysosomes, we quantified in situ
lysosomal enzyme activity using self-quenched enzymatic substrates that are taken up
by endocytosis, targeted to lysosomes and turn fluorescent upon enzymatic activity
(Humphries et al., 2012). As endocytic uptake at peak viral egress was decreased in
HeLa-mCC1a cells (Figures S1J and S1K), we accounted for this by co-incubating cells
with a pH-insensitive fluorophore-coupled dextran, which was endocytosed into
lysosomes along with substrate. Mean fluorescence intensity of substrate was quantified
in lysosomes with similar mean dextran fluorescence intensity in mock and MHV-infected
cells. These measurements revealed that consistent with the observed increased
lysosomal pH in MHV-infected cells, lysosome enzyme activities were reduced by ~40%
relative to mock-infected cells (Figure 4E).
Lysosome-dependent antigen cross-presentation pathways are disrupted in bCoronavirus infected cells.
Finally, we investigated the functional consequences of b-coronaviral infection in
terms of antigen processing. Myeloid cells rely on active lysosomal degradation of
proteins to produce short peptides that are loaded and presented on class I MHC of cells
(Trombetta and Mellman 2005). We exposed bone-marrow derived primary macrophages
to extracellular chicken Ovalbumin (OVA1-385 protein) or to an Ovalbumin-derived class I
MHC-restricted oligopeptide (OVA257-264 peptide) with or without MHV infection (Figure
5A and 5B). First, we measured the endocytosis of fluorescent OVA1-385 protein by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.25.192310; this version posted July 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

macrophages and found that it was not significantly affected by MHV infection (Figure
5C). Then we measured the amount of OVA antigen being presented by macrophages
using the H-2Kb/ OVA257-264-responsive OT-1 TCR transgenic T cells (Figure 5D). We
found that coronaviral infection made macrophages induce stronger T cell activation when
presenting OVA257-264 peptide, but weaker T cell activation was measured when crosspresenting OVA1-385 protein (Figure 5D). Such result points out how disrupted lysosomal
functions in infected cells alter antigen cross-presentation from protein while possibly
boosting presentation from peptide (e.g. by enhancing open conformers of MHC on the
surface of cells through increased delivery through lysosome exocytosis)
We further tested whether coronavirus infection induces the presentation of open
conformers of MHC in human cells. Specifically, open conformers of HLA-F could stem
from lysosomal dysfunction, serve as activating ligands for NK cells and determine innate
immune responses (Goodridge et al., 2013; Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016). We infected
HeLa-mCC1a cells with MHV. At 12hr pi we added KIR3DL1-ITAM Jurkat reporter cells
(Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016) and measured their ERK phosphorylation after 15min by flow
cytometry (Figure 5E and 5F). In parallel, we used acid-stripping to open up MHC
conformers. We found that MHV infected cells triggered the open-HLA-F-responding
Jurkat cells more efficiently, while acid-stripping of cells induced similar (enhanced)
response with or without infection (Figure 5G). This demonstrated that b-coronaviral
infection resulted in enhanced levels of open conformers of HLA-F, another functional
immunologically relevant consequence of altered lysosomal activity and cellular stress.
Discussion
Since the 1960’s, intact coronaviruses have been reported in lysosomes at late
stages of infection (Ducatelle and Hoorens 1984) but the significance of these
observations remained unknown in terms of viral dynamics. Here we demonstrated that
coronaviruses egress from infected cells by tracking a singular path through lysosomes
and then to the surface. This is unlike other enveloped RNA viruses whose egress tracks
with either the biosynthetic secretory pathway or with direct budding from the plasma
membrane.

It remains to be determined if coronavirus trafficking to lysosomes takes place
from the Golgi/TGN (a BFA insensitive path (Strous et al., 1993) or from the ER/ERGIC,
the latter after retrograde transport back from the Golgi/TGN. Many Golgi and TGN
resident proteins, including mannosidase II, Golgin 97, TGN46 and M6PR were absent
from the virus-containing lysosomes. In contrast, the KDEL sequence containing
chaperone GRP78/BIP, along with the KDEL-receptor were both present. GRP78/BIP
facilitates MERS and SARS infectivity (Chu et al., 2018) and has been shown to bind the
S protein of SARS-CoV2 (Ha et al., 2020). It was assumed that GRP78/BIP-coronavirus
interaction takes place outside the cell (Ha et al., 2020), but our findings here indicate
that it is likely taking place already within the host cell during viral egress, since
GRP78/BIP is colocalized with coronaviruses in lysosomes and its release to the
extracellular environment is Arl8b dependent. Thus, the viruses released maybe primed
for best infectivity by being released in complex with GRP78/BIP.
Lysosomal proteolytic enzyme activities are central to many critical cellular
processes including autophagy, cell motility, cholesterol metabolism, release of cell killing
enzymes by T-cells, pathogen degradation by macrophages and self/non-self antigen
presentation by all cells. Lysosome acidification is required for lysosomal enzymatic
activities and even a small increase in pH is sufficient to inhibit these enzymes and stop
their critical biological functions. We have found that lysosomes are significantly
deacidified in coronavirus infected cells and consistent with this measured a significant
reduction in lysosomal enzyme activity. The underlying molecular mechanism for the
deacidification remains to be investigated but it has been noted that when lysosomes are
overwhelmed with cargo - such as they would be in coronavirus infected cells- lysosome
deacidification can take place (Ballabio and Bonifacino 2020). In addition, the envelope
protein E has been shown to be capable of forming ion channels when ectopically
expressed in cells and this may be sufficient to perturb lysosomal proton pumping
activities (Ruch and Machamer 2012).
Additionally, our findings indicated that the altered lysosomal function of
coronavirus-infected cells resulted in perturbation of antigen presentation and altered
immune responses. The flurry of studies triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has
pointed out how unusual and problematic immune responses against coronaviruses can

be (Vardhana and Wolchok 2020). Indeed, clinicians as well as basic immunologists have
difficulties reconciling observations (e.g. the delayed and erratic macrophage-driven
cytokine release syndrome and the severe lymphopenia of CD4+ T and NK lymphocytes)
with our current knowledge of immune responses against viruses or cancers (Vardhana
and Wolchok 2020). Our findings on the cellular biology of coronavirus and their functional
consequence in terms of altered antigen presentation may open new research avenues
e.g. focusing on NK cell response against coronavirus-infected cells. The relevance of
KIR3DS1-expressing NK cells in delaying the progression to AIDS in HIV-1-infected
patients (Martin et al., 2002) or exacerbating the severity of H1N1 infections points
(Arando-Romo et al., 2012) out how our findings of increased presentation of open
conformers of HLA-F (a known ligand for activating KIR3DS1 and inhibiting KIR3DL1
receptors) could have both positive or negative impact on immune responses against
coronavirus infection (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016).
Finally, coronavirus egress through lysosomal tracking may perturb another innate
immune response. Coronaviruses may have evolved to use this egress pathway in order
to not only disrupt antigen presentation but also to disrupt endo-lysosomal Toll-like
receptor signaling -e.g TLR3 and their binding to double-stranded RNAs, which requires
acidification (De Bouteiller et al., 2005). Further studies will need to focus on the impact
of such alteration of TLR signaling on inflammatory responses (e.g. cytokine release)
triggered by coronavirus infection.
To conclude, our findings open up new avenues to mitigate coronavirus infections,
by targeting regulators of lysosomal trafficking such as Arl8b, by reversing deacidification
and by enhancing immune cells geared to detect lysosomal malfunction.

fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with DPBS (Corning).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells were fixed in 3.7% PFA/PBS for 10min; blocked in PBS/10%FBS. All primary and
secondary antibody incubations were carried out in PBS/10%FBS supplemented with
saponin at 0.2% for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in PBS and mounted
with Fluoromount-G (Invitrogen). For surface LAMP1 staining, cells were chilled on ice
for 20 minutes and incubated on ice with anti-LAMP1 antibody in PBS for 30 minutes.
After rinses with chilled PBS, cells were kept on ice and incubated with secondary

antibody in PBS for 30 minutes. Cells were rinsed with chilled PBS, fixed, mounted and
imaged.
Light Microscopy
All microscopy and image acquisition were performed on the LSM780 confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss USA) with a 63X/1.4NA oil objective. Live cells were imaged on
a heated stage. Zen software (Carl Zeiss USA) and Image J (NIH) were used for all image
analysis.
Immunoelectron Microscopy
Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 1 x PHEM buffer for 90
min. Cryo-sectioning and immunolabelling were performed as described elsewhere
(1,2). In brief, ultrathin sections (50–70 nm) from gelatin-embedded and frozen cell pellets
were obtained using an FC7/UC7-ultramicrotome (Leica, Vienna, Austria). Immunogold
labelling was carried out on thawed sections with anti-GFP (2.5 mg/ml, rabbit, Rockland,
600-401-215) and anti-M (1:50, mouse) antibodies. Mouse primary antibodies were
detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin Gs (0.5 mg/ml). All samples
were incubated with 5 or 10 nm protein A gold (1:50, UMC Utrecht University, Utrecht,
Netherlands), as described (1), and stained/embedded in 4% uranyl acetate/2%
methylcellulose mixture (ratio 1:9) (3,4).Sections were examined with a JEM-1200EX
(JEOL USA) transmission electron microscope (accelerating voltage 80 keV) equipped
with a bottom-mounted AMT 6 megapixel digital camera (Advanced Microscopy
Techniques Corp).
RT-PCR Analysis
Cell lysates and supernatants were obtained from specific time points of virus infection
and lysed using RNA lysis buffer provided in the RNA isolation kit (Quick-RNA Microprep
Kit, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, Catalog No. R1051). RNA isolation was performed as
per the manufacturer’s instructions and cDNA was prepared using Thermo Scientific
Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA,
Catalog No. FERK1642). RT-PCR was performed using iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green

Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA, Catalog No. 1725124) in Roche LightCycler 96 system
(Roche, Product No. 05815916001). The thermal cycling conditions were composed of a
pre-incubation step of 95ºC for 90 sec followed by 40 cycles at 95ºC for 10s, 54ºC for 10s
and 72ºC for 10s. The samples were run in duplicate for each data point for an

siRNA treatment
Arl8b and Non-Target siRNA (Horizon Therapeutics) were transfected with Dharmafect 1
(Horizon Therapeutics) and incubated for up to 72 hrs. They were pulsed with MHV for
4hrs, before washing off the virus and switching to serum free media. At 12hr pi,
intracellular and extracellular virus was quantified by qPCR. For intracellular RNA levels,
cells were lysed with RNA lysis buffer (Zymo Research); for intracellular protein level
quantifications cells were scraped and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen) containing
protease inhibitors. Both intracellular and extracellular proteins were TCA precipitated,
acetone washed and suspended in Laemmli gel loading buffer before SDSPAGE/Western analysis.
Lysosomal Enzyme Activity
Mock and MHV-infected cells were incubated with Alexa 555 10kD dextran (1mg/ml) and
proprietary Lysosome-Specific Self-Quenched Substrate (Abcam Cat No. ab234622) at
manufacturers recommended dosage for 1 hour before they were fixed with 4%
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were mounted with
Fluoromount G (Invitrogen) containing DAPI and imaged with Zeiss LSM780 Confocal
Laser Scanning microscope. Images were analyzed using Zen Blue software. Mean
fluorescence intensities (MFI) of substrate colocalizing with dextran was measured from
each group.

Lysosensor Green pH measurements
Mock and MHV-infected cells were incubated with Lysosensor Green DND199
(ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. Step A: cells were
imaged with 488nm laser excitation. Step B: cells were then treated sequentially with
potassium buffers of known pH containing 10µM Nigericin; images collected using the
same settings as earlier to generate a standard pH curve. Subsequently this standard
curve generated in step B was used to convert the fluorescence values collected in step
A to pH values.
Antigen cross-presentation by infected macrophages
Bone-marrow derived macrophages were prepared from femoral aspirates cultured for 7
days in complete RPMI medium with 1nM M-CSF in Fluoroethyl polymer culture bags
(Origen). 2.104 cells were harvested and plated on plastic (96-flat-well plate), let to adhere
for 2hr, then exposed to MHV (or not) for 24 hr. Macrophages were then pulsed with
SIINFEKL peptides or with chicken ovalbumin at varied concentrations for 2 hr, then
washed with complete RPMI. C57Bl6 Rag1-/- OT-1 TCR Transgenic mouse splenocytes
were then harvested, cleared of their red blood cells by ACK lysis, added and spun onto
macrophages (105 cells per well), and incubated for 6 hr. Cell cultures were then
harvested using a 15-min trypsin-versene treatment, washed and antibody-stained for
flow cytometry (see panel below) with DAPI added just before acquisition. Cells were
analyzed using a 5-laser FORTESSA flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) as well as singlestained compensatory UltraComp ebeads (Invitrogen). Data were compensated and
processed using FlowJo (TreeStar) and a custom-written Python pipeline (python.org).
The level of antigen presentation was quantified using the percentage of live activated T
cells (itself estimated as % CD69+ amongst FSCintDAPI-Va2+ cells).

Endocytosis by infected primary macrophages
Chicken ovalbumin was fluorescently labeled with the Alexa647 dye using a
bioconjugation kit (ThermoFisher). Bone-marrow derived macrophages were prepared as
described in the previous paragraph. 2.104 cells were harvested, and plated on plastic
(96-flat-well plate), let to adhere for 2hr, then exposed to MHV (or not) for 24 hr.
Macrophages were then pulsed with varying concentrations of fluorescently-labeled
chicken ovalbumin for 2 hr, harvested with a 15-min exposure to a solution of trypsinversene-EDTA mixture (Lonza), washed with FACS buffer and immediately analyzed by
flow cytometry.
Upregulation of HLA-F open conformers upon MHV infection
HeLa-mCC1a cells were plated and infected (or not) with MHV for 24 hr. Cells were lifted
up using a trypsin-versene solution, washed with PBS, incubated for 1min at room
temperature with a 0.1M solution of Glycine in PBS (pH adjusted to 2.4) for acid stripping,
or with PBS for control, then washed with complete RPMI twice. KIR3DL1-reporter Jurkat
cells (5) were cultured in complete RPMI and harvested by aspiration. 5.104 HeLa cells
were washed with Jurkat cell culture medium then resuspended with 5.104 Jurkat cells,
spun at 100g for 15s and incubated at 37°C for 15min (some wells received only Jurkat
cells or Jurkat cells and 1µMol of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for negative and
positive controls, respectively). Cells were then immediately resuspended with ice-cold
2% PFA for 15 min, permeabilized with ice-cold 90% Methanol for 15 min, washed with
FACS buffer and stained for phospho-ERK (E10 clone, Cell Signaling Technology) and
anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals). A more detailed protocol
can be found in Vogel et al., (6). Cells were analyzed using a 5-laser FORTESSA flow
cytometer (BD Bioscience). Data were processed using FlowJo (TreeStar) and a customwritten Python pipeline (python.org). The levels of open HLA-F conformers were
quantified by monitoring Jurkat cell activation (itself estimated geometric mean of
phosphor-ERK staining in FSCint Jurkat cells).
