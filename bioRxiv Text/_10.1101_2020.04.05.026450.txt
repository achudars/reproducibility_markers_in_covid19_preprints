Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 poses an immediate, major threat to public health across the globe. Here we report an indepth molecular analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary origins of the enhanced pathogenicity of SARSCoV-2 and other coronaviruses that are severe human pathogens. Using integrated comparative
genomics and machine learning techniques, we identify key genomic features that differentiate SARSCoV-2 and the viruses behind the two previous deadly coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
from less pathogenic coronaviruses. These features include enhancement of the nuclear localization
signals in the nucleocapsid protein and distinct inserts in the spike glycoprotein that appear to be
associated with high case fatality rate of these coronaviruses as well as the host switch from animals to
humans. The identified features could be crucial elements of coronavirus pathogenicity and possible
targets for diagnostics, prognostication and interventions.

The emergence of novel SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the respiratory disease COVID19, triggered a global pandemic that has led to an unprecedented worldwide public health emergency1.
Since it was first reported in December 2019 and as of April 7, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over a
million individuals worldwide, and has led to an estimated 82,000 deaths, with its associated morbidity
and mortality rates continuously rising2. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the Coronaviridae family
known to infect humans3. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, two other members of this family, are the causative
agents of recent outbreaks, accountable, respectively, for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS,
2002-2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, began in 2012) outbreaks3,4, and are
associated with high case fatality rates (CFR, 9% and 36%, respectively). The novel SARS-CoV-2 can also
cause severe disease and is appreciably more infectious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, but with a lower
associated CFR4. By contrast, the other coronaviruses infecting humans, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoVOC43, and HCoV-229E, are endemic and cause mild symptoms, accounting for 15-29% of common
colds3. The three coronaviruses that can cause severe diseases (hereafter high-CFR CoV) originated in
zoonotic transmissions from animal hosts to humans. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have bat reservoirs, and
were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts (likely civets and camels, respectively)4.
Similarly, the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 is a bat coronavirus (Fig. 1a), but the specific route of
transmission from bats to humans remains unclear. These repeated, independent zoonotic
transmissions and the high associated pathogenicity call for an in-depth investigation of the genomic
features that contribute to coronaviruses pathogenicity and transmission, to better understand the
molecular mechanisms of the high-CFR CoV pathogenicity, and thus to be better prepared for any future
coronavirus outbreaks, and potentially contribute to the development of interventions.

Results
Detection of diagnostic features of high-CFR coronaviruses
In this work, we developed an approach combining advanced machine learning methods with wellestablished genome comparison techniques, to identify the potential genomic determinants of
pathogenicity of the high-CFR CoV strains (Fig. 1b). Coronaviruses have positive-sense RNA genomes
consisting of 6 conserved proteins, along with additional strain-specific accessory proteins5. The
conserved proteins are the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that encompass multiple protein domains
involved in various aspects of coronavirus genome replication, spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E),
membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N, Fig. 1c). To detect potential genomic
determinants of pathogenicity, we aligned the full genomes of all human coronaviruses (Supplementary
File 1) and used support vector machines (SVM) to detect high-confidence genomic features that are
predictive of the high CFR (see Methods for details). In total, our method identified 11 regions of
nucleotide alignments that were reliably predictive of the high CFR of coronaviruses (Fig. 1c,
Supplementary Table 1). Two proteins were significantly enriched with these predictive regions, the
nucleocapsid protein and the spike glycoprotein (p-values: 4e-16 and 0.036, respectively, Fig. 1d). Only
four of the diagnostic regions detected in the nucleotide alignment corresponded to observable
differences in the protein alignments as well, with three located in the nucleocapsid protein and one in
the spike protein (Fig. 1e).

Enhancement of nuclear localization signals in the nucleocapsid protein

Exploring the regions identified within the nucleocapsid that predict the high CFR of CoV, we found that
these deletions and insertions result in substantial enhancement of motifs that determine nuclear
localization6, specifically, in high-CFR CoV (Supplementary Figure 1a). The deletions, insertions and
substitutions in the N proteins of the high-CFR CoV map to two monopartite nuclear localization signals
(NLS), one bipartite NLS and a nuclear export signal (NES, Fig. 2a,b). In the course of the evolution of
coronaviruses, these nuclear localization and export signals grow markedly stronger in the clades that
include the high-CFR viruses and their relatives from animals (primarily, bats), as demonstrated by the
increasing positive charge of the amino acids comprising the NLS, a known marker of NLS strength7 (Fig.
2a). In the clade that includes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the accumulation of positive charges was
observed in the monopartite NLS, the bipartite NLS and the NES, whereas in the clade including MERSCoV, positive charges accumulated primarily in the first of the two monopartite NLS (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Table 2). In all cases, the enhancement of these signals is a gradual, significant trend thatt
accompanied coronavirus evolution concomitantly with the emergence of more pathogenic strains
(empirical p-value < 0.001, Fig. 2a,c). The charge of the complete nucleocapsid protein gradually evolves
towards greater positive values due, specifically, to the formation of the NLS, as demonstrated by
sequence permutation analysis (Fig. 2a, see Methods for details), which implies a key role for these
motifs in the function of the nucleocapsid including likely contribution to virus pathogenicity. The

accumulation of positive charges resulting in strengthening of the NLS, which correlates with the
growing CFR of coronaviruses (Fig. 2c), implies that the localization pattern of the nucleocapsid proteins
of high-CFR strains differs from that of the low-CFR strains and might contribute the increased
pathogenicity of the high-CFR strains. Localization of the nucleocapsid protein to the nuclei, and
h
specifically, to the nucleoli, has been previously reported in coronaviruses8 and has been associated with
increased pathogenicity in a porcine coronavirus model9–11. The presence of both NLS and NES raises an
uncertainty as to the precise effect of these motifs on the nucleocapsid protein localization, and the
reports are indeed somewhat contradictory6,9,12. Nevertheless, the striking extent of the changes in the
NLS of the high-CFR strains (Fig. 2c) suggests that localization of the nucleocapsid protein is an importantt
determinant of coronavirus pathogenicity.

significant between any two groups, supporting a gradual increase of the charge.

A unique insertion upstream of the heptad repeat region of the spike glycoprotein in high-CFR CoV
We next investigated the diagnostic feature identified within the spike glycoprotein. The SARS-CoV-2
spike protein binds ACE2, the host cell receptor of SARS-CoV-213, with a 10-20 fold greater affinity
compared to SARS-CoV, and contains a polybasic furin cleavage site resulting from a unique insert to
SARS-CoV-2 that could enhance infectivity4. The spike protein consists of multiple domains13 (Fig 3a),
including two heptad repeat regions that are crucial to infection14. During membrane fusion, the heptad
repeats fold into a 6-helical bundle that forms the stable fusion core which facilitates the insertion of the
hydrophobic fusion peptide into the host membrane and brings the viral and host membranes into
proximity as required for fusion15–17. The spike protein fusion peptide is located upstream of the first
heptad repeat18,19 (HR1), with a long connecting region between the fusion peptide and HR1 that adopts
an α-helical structure. Our analysis revealed a 4 amino acid insertion in the connecting region in all highCFR viruses but not in any of the low-CFR ones, with the MERS and SARS clades apparently acquiring this
insertion independently as supported by the unrelated insert sequences (Fig 3b, Supplementary Figure
1b). The insertion increases the length and flexibility of the connecting region as confirmed by the
examination of the spike glycoprotein structure of SARS-CoV (Fig. 3d), and therefore, is likely to affect
the fusion process although the specific contribution of this insert to pathogenicity remains to be
studied experimentally.

Unique inserts associated with zoonotic jumps to humans in the spike glycoprotein
Finally, we sought to identify genomic features that might be associated with the repeated jumping of
coronaviruses across the species barriers to humans, specifically, in the case of the high-CFR strains. To
this end, we aligned the genomes of all coronaviruses from different hosts (Supplementary File 2) and
selected, for each human-infecting strain of the high-CFR CoV, the closest non-human infecting relatives
(see Methods for details). Within each such set of human high-CFR CoV and their animal ancestors, we
searched for genomic insertions or deletions that occurred in the most proximal strains before the
zoonotic jump to humans. This analysis identified independent insertions in each of the three groups of
viruses all of which were located within the spike glycoprotein, specifically, in the receptor binding
domain, within the subdomain that binds ACE213,20 (the receptor binding motif, RBM) in the cases of
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and DPP4 in the case of MERS-CoV21 (Fig. 3c,d).
The insertions occur in slightly different locations within the RBM structure, with a single insert in the
SARS clade and two distinct inserts in the MERS clade, and showed no sequence similarity between the
three high-CFR groups, suggesting independent evolutionary events. The two insertions in MERS clade
correspond to two loops connecting the distal β-strand of an extended β-sheet structure, whereas the
insert in the SARS clade corresponds to a single long loop embedded within a short, unstable β-sheet.
Despite the lack of an overall similarity, in each case, the inserted segments contained a proline-cysteine
(PC) amino acid doublet (Fig. 3c,e and Supplementary Figure 2). In both high-CFR CoV clades, the
cysteines in the insert form disulfide bonds with other cysteines in the RBM although the locations of
the partner cysteines are different, i.e. proximal, within the loop containing the insert in SARS, and

distal, within the RBM β-sheet in MERS (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Figure 2). These different locations
of the disulfide bridges result in distinct RBM conformations (Fig. 3e) corresponding to the different
receptor specificities in human cells. In both SARS and MERS, the insert directly interacts with the
respective receptors but the specifics of the interactions differ, with a salt bridge (D510 with R317) and a
hydrophobic interaction (P515 with V341) in the case of MERS, and a hydrophobic interaction patch in
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 each, involving L472 and F486, respectively. The flexibility added to the RBM
by these inserts could allow the spike to be more malleable in binding to a receptor, allowing for
zoonotic transmission. Furthermore, the SARS inserts that are located within a short, unstable β-sheet
provide more flexibility than the MERS inserts which are within longer, more rigid β-sheets, potentially
contributing to MERS-CoV never fully adapting to human-to-human transmission4. The phenylalanine in
SARS-CoV-2 provides a larger hydrophobic surface to interact with 3 residues of ACE2 (M82, L79 and
Y83) whereas in SARS-CoV the leucine interacts with 2 residues (M82 and L79). The SARS-CoV-2 insert
also engages in an extra charge interaction with ACE2 (E484 with K31) and multiple hydrogen bonds (Fig.
3d). The larger hydrophobic surface and the additional interactions could, in part, underlie the higher
binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV13. Thus, the independent insertions in the
RBM of the spike protein are highly likely to contribute to or even enable the zoonotic transmission of
the high-CFR CoV strains to humans and might also contribute to their high CFR.

SARS-CoV-2 has led to the most devastating pandemic since the 1918 Spanish flu, prompting an urgent
need to elucidate the evolutionary history and genomic features that led to the increased pathogenicity
and rampant spread of this virus as well as those coronaviruses that caused previous deadly outbreaks.
A better understanding of viral pathogenicity and zoonotic transmission is crucial for prediction and
prevention of future outbreaks. Here, using an integrated approach that included machine-learning and
comparative genomics, we identified three previously undetected likely determinants of pathogenicity
and zoonotic transmission. The enhancement of the NLS in the high-CFR CoV nucleocapsids implies an
important role of the subcellular localization of the nucleocapsid protein in the CoV pathogenicity.
Strikingly, insertions in the spike protein appear to have been acquired independently by the SARS and
MERS clades of the high-CFR CoV, in both the domain involved in virus-cell fusion and the domain
mediating receptor recognition. These insertions, most likely, enhance the pathogenicity of high-CFR
viruses and contribute to their ability to zoonotically transmit to humans. All these features are shared
by the high-CFR CoV and their animal (in particular, bat) infecting relatives in the same clade, which is
compatible with the possibility of future zoonotic transmission of additional highly pathogenic strains to
humans. The predictions made through this analysis unveil critical features in the mechanism of SARSCoV-2 virulence and evolutionary history, are amenable to straightforward experimental validation and
could serve as predictors of strains pathogenic to humans.

Methods
Data

The complete nucleotide sequences of 3001 coronavirus genomes were obtained from NCBI
(Supplementary File 2). Of these, 944 genomes belong to viruses that infect humans, including both
viruses with low case fatality rates (CFR), NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1, and those with high CFR, namely,
MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The protein sequences that are encoded in the genomes of all
human coronaviruses and closely related viruses from animals were obtained from NCBI, including the
two polyproteins (1ab and 1a), spike glycoprotein, envelope, membrane glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein.

Identification of genomic determinants of high-CFR coronaviruses

To identify genomic determinants of coronaviruses associated with high CFR, comparative genome
analysis was combined with machine learning techniques. First, the 944 human coronavirus genomes
were aligned using Mafft22 v7.407 . Then, we identified high confidence alignment blocks within the
multiple sequence alignment (MSA), which were defined as regions longer than 15 bp, containing less
than 10% of gaps in each position. We searched for regions containing deletions or insertions that
separate high-CFR from low-CFR viruses and are surrounded by high confidence alignment blocks
because these are most likely to contain relevant differences within conserved genomic regions. To this
end, the aligned sequences were recoded such that each nucleotide was coded as ‘1’ and each gap as
‘0’. We then applied Support Vector Machines (using the Python library scikit-learn23 with a linear Kernel
function) to a 5bp sliding window in the identified high-confidence alignment regions, with a leave-oneout cross validation (where all samples of one of the 7 coronaviruses were left out in each round of the
cross validation, for a total of 7 rounds). Finally, we selected regions that predicted the high-CFR viruses
with high confidence (greater than 80% accuracy) for further evaluation.
From the 11 regions identified, 4 were in the polyprotein 1AB, 3 in the spike glycoprotein, 1 in the
membrane glycoprotein and 3 in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. To evaluate the significance of these
finding, we computed a hyper-geometric enrichment P-value, using the sizes of the identified regions
and the lengths of the coding regions of each protein within the MSA. We found that the nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein was most enriched with genomic differences that predict CFR (P-value = 4e-16),
followed by the Spike glycoprotein (P-value = 0.036) and that the polyprotein 1AB and membrane
glycoprotein were not significantly enriched with such differences. We further examined the effects of
this set of genomic differences on the resulting protein sequences, and found that only 4 of the 11
differences identified were reflected in the protein alignment, of which 3 occurred in the nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein and one in the spike glycoprotein.

Non-human proximal coronavirus strains

To compile a list of human and proximal non-human coronavirus strains, we first constructed a multiple
sequence alignment of all 3001 collected strains using Mafft v7.407. From that alignment, we build a
phylogenetic tree using FastTree24 2.1.10 with the “-nt” parameter, and extracted the distances
between leaves of each strain from each of the reference genomes of the 7 human coronaviruses
(Supplementary File 3). We then extracted the proximal strains of each human coronavirus, which were
within a distance less than 1.0 to one of the human coronaviruses. To obtain a unique set of strains, we
removed highly similar strains by randomly sampling one strain from each group of strains with more
than 98% pairwise sequence identity (the resulting strains are provided in Supplementary File 4).

Amino acid charge calculations

To evaluate the strength of the identified NLS and NES motifs within the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein,
we calculated the amino acid cumulative charge within the alignment region of each motif, and of the
complete protein, for each of the selected human and proximal non-human coronavirus strains
(Supplementary File 4). The charge of each region was evaluated by the number of positively charged
amino acids (lysine and arginine) minus the number of negatively charged amino acids in that region
(aspartic acid and glutamic acid). To evaluate the significance of the association between CFR and the
charge of specific motifs within the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, we first calculated the rank-sum Pvalue comparing the charges of regions in high-CFR versus low-CFR strains. Then, we applied a
permutation test, by counting the fraction of similarly or more significant charge differentials values
between high-CFR and low-CFR viruses within 1,000 randomly selected motifs with similar length from
the alignment of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein.

Genomic determinants of the interspecies jump

To identify genomic determinants that discriminate high-CFR viruses that made the zoonotic
transmission to humans, we used the nucleotide MSA of MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and the
selected proximal non-human coronaviruses of each of these.
We searched regions that maximize the following function:

∏:

,   

࢑ :  

࢐

࢑

࢐ ࢎ

   
 

Where ࢐ ࢎ  

 is a position within the encoded MSA (‘1’ for a nucleotide and ‘0’ for a gap), and  is the set of strains
selected for either MERS, SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2.  is the distance of non-human strain  from the
human strain of group ,  is position  of non-human strain , and  is position  of the human strain
in group .
Thus, this function aims to find, for each position, within each of the three groups of strains, the nonhuman strain  with the minimal distance from the human strain, such that all non-human strains that
are more distant are more different than the human strain in that position (i.e. a genomic change that
occurred as close as possible to the human strain). We searched for regions in which over 50% of the
strains in the alignment differed from the human strain, and for which the differing strains were
explicitly the most distant from human. We identified only one such location, across all three high-CFR
virus groups.
