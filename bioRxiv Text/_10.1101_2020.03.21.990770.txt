Abstract

31

The pandemic caused by emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents a

32

serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and

33

therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding

34

between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the

35

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report

36

on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal

37

antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected

38

individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light

39

chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In

40

samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence

41

of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated

42

impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-

43

CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by

44

competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the

45

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from

46

either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity

47

to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found.

48

These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific

49

while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and

50

neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further

51

investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies

52

identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic

53

SARS-CoV-2 interventions.

Introduction

56

The source of the recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in

57

Wuhan, China is a novel pathogenic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2

58

pathogenesis and rapid international transmission poses a serious global

59

health emergency 5-9. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus family and

60

shares substantial genetic and functional similarity with other pathogenic

61

human betacoronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

62

Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

63

(MERS-CoV) 2-4,10,11. The virus is believed to have originated in bats, although

64

the source and animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 remain uncertain 2-4,10-12. No

65

SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccine are currently available but several

66

antiviral drugs including remdesivir are being investigated clinically.

67

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes an envelope homotrimeric Spike glycoprotein (S) to

68

interact with cellular receptor ACE2

69

cascade of cell membrane fusion events for viral entry. Each S protomer

70

consists of two subunits: a globular S1 domain at the N-terminal region, and the

71

membrane-proximal S2 and transmembrane domains. Determinants of host

72

range and cellular tropism are found in the RBD within the S1 domain, while

73

mediators of membrane fusion have been identified within the S2 domain 15,16.

74

We and others have recently determined the high-resolution structure of SARS-

75

CoV-2 RBD bound to the N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2

76

overall ACE2-binding mechanism is virtually the same between SARS-CoV-2

77

and SARS-CoV RBDs, indicating convergent ACE2-binding evolution between

78

these two viruses

79

interaction would block SARS-CoV-2 entry into the target cell. Indeed, a few

80

such disruptive agents targeted to ACE2 have been shown to inhibit SARS-

81

CoV infection 23,24. However, given the important physiological roles of ACE2 in

82

vivo 25, these agents may have undesired side effects. Anti-RBD antibodies, on

83

the other hand, are therefore more favorable. Furthermore, SARS-CoV or

84

MERS-CoV RBD-based vaccine studies in experimental animals have also

85

shown strong polyclonal antibody responses that inhibit viral entry

able to effectively block SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here, we report on the isolation

88

and characterization of 206 RBD-specific mAbs derived from single B cells of

89

eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Using bioinformatic and biologic

90

characterization, we identified several mAbs with potent neutralizing activity

91

against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, no cross-activity between

92

RBDs from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV was found, suggesting that the RBD-

93

based antibody response is viral species-specific. The potent neutralizing

94

antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and

therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.

Results

97

Plasma and B cell responses specific to SARS-CoV-2. We collected

98

cross-sectional

99

SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects during the early outbreak in Shenzhen (Table

100

S1). Samples were named by patient number and either A, B, or C depending

101

on collection sequence. Six patients (P#1 through P#4, P#8, and P#16) had

102

Wuhan travel history and the remaining two (P#5 and P#22) had direct contact

103

with those from Wuhan. P#1 through P#5 is a family cluster with the first

104

documented case of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in

105

Shenzhen 5. All subjects recovered and were discharged from the hospital

106

except for P#1 who succumbed to disease despite intensive intervention. To

107

analyze antibody binding, serial plasma dilutions were applied to enzyme-linked

108

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates coated with either recombinant RBD or

109

trimeric Spike derived from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV or

110

recombinant NP from SARS-CoV-2. Binding activity was visualized using

111

anti-human IgG secondary antibodies at an optical density (OD) of 450nm.

112

Varying degrees of binding were found across individuals and among samples

113

from the same individual. Samples from P#1, P#2, P#5, and P#16

114

demonstrated higher binding to both SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NP than the rest

115

(Figure 1A). Three sequential plasma samples collected from P#2 over nine

116

days during early infection showed similar binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and

117

NP and remained relative stable over the course of the infection. To our surprise,

was detected (Figure 1A), despite strong recognition by the positive control

120

antibodies (data not shown). However, strong cross-reactivity was detected

121

against trimeric Spikes from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in both ELISA (Figure

122

1B) and cell-surface staining (Figure S1). All samples except P#4A

123

demonstrated significant levels of cross-binding to SARS-CoV trimeric Spike

124

while only those from P#1, P#2 and P#4B cross recognized MERS-CoV trimeric

125

Spike (Figure 1B). None of the plasma samples were reactive to HIV-1

126

envelope trimer derived from strain BG505 27. The same plasma samples were

127

also evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing the Spike proteins of

128

either SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV. Consistent with the antibody

129

binding results, varying degrees of neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2

130

were found across individuals (Figure 1C). However, cross-neutralizing against

131

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is rather minimal as all plasma samples tested,

132

including healthy control plasma, had negligible levels of neutralization (Figure

133

1C). No detectable neutralization was found for any plasma sample against the

134

pseudovirus control bearing the HIV-1 envelope MG04 (Figure 1C). Taken

135

together, these results suggest that RBDs from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and

136

MERS-CoV are likely to be immunologically distinct despite substantial

137

sequence and structural similarities

138

contribute to the observed cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

Flow cytometry with a range of gating strategies was used to study

141

SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell responses and identity B cells recognizing

142

fluorescent-labeled RBD probes (Figure 1D and Figure S2). As shown in Figure

143

1E, the RBD-specific B cells constitute about 0.005-0.065% among the total B

144

cell population and 0.023-0.329% among the memory subpopulations. The

145

number of RBD-specific B cells are relatively higher in P#2, P#5, P#16, and

146

P#22 (Figure 1E), which appeared to correlate well with binding activity of

147

corresponding plasma samples to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and trimeric Spike protein

148

(Figure 1A and 1B). However, sample P#1A demonstrated the lowest RBD-

149

specific B cell response despite high-level plasma binding. As P#1 was the only

150

patient succumb to disease, it is uncertain whether this dichotomy of high

151

plasma binding activity and low levels of RBD-specific B cells is a surrogate

marker of rapid disease progression. This phenomenon needs study in a larger

153

population of samples.

154
155

Single B cell antibody cloning and heavy chain repertoire analyses. We

156

further isolated RBD-binding B cells into single cell suspension for cloning and

157

evaluation of the mAb response (Figure 1D and Figure S2). Immunoglobulin

158

heavy and light chains were amplified by RT-PCR using nested primers. The

159

amplified products were cloned into linear expression cassettes to produce full

160

IgG1 antibodies as previously described

161

varied from 10 to 106 among the subjects and each clone has been differentially

162

represented (Figure S3). Individual IgGs were produced by transfection of

163

linear expression cassettes and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD reactivity by

164

ELISA. On average, fifty-eight percent of the antibody clones were reactive,

165

although great variability was found among different individuals (Figure S3).

166

Out of 358 antibodies, we obtained 206 that bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with

167

165 distinct sequences (Table S2). These 206 antibodies demonstrated

168

significant differences in binding activity. For example, a large number of

169

antibodies from samples P#2B, P#2C, P#4A, P4#B, P#5A, P#16A, and P#22A

170

had OD 450 values well over 4.0, while none of those from sample P#1A

171

exceeded 4.0. There were too few antibodies from P#3A and P#8A to make

172

meaningful evaluations (Figure S3). Furthermore, samples from different study

173

subjects also demonstrated substantial differences in heavy chain variable

174

gene (VH) usage (Figure 2A). For instance, P#1 samples are dominated by

175

VH3-53, 3-13, and 1-69 which constituted approximately 21.4%, 14.3%, and

176

14.3% of the entire VH repertoire, respectively. Samples from P#2 and P#5 are

177

more diverse in distribution and frequency of their VH usage. However, no

178

single or group of VH families stood out among study subjects, suggesting

179

patients have immunologically distinct responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

180

This hypothesis is supported by the phylogenetic analysis of all 206 VH

181

sequences superimposed with their corresponding binding activities as

182

presented in Figure 2B. The high-binding clusters (light orange circle: 80% of

183

clusters with OD 450 > 3) were widely distributed across multiple heavy chain

28,29

. The number of B cell clones

184

families. In fact, majority of the high-binding antibodies were derived by clonal

185

expansion of specific VH families in P#2, P#4, and P#5. Similarly, the middle-

186

(60-80% of clusters with OD 450 > 3) and low- (< 60% cluster with OD 450 > 3)

187

binding clusters were also widely distributed and each consisted of

188

disproportionally represented VH gene families.

189

Broad diversity and clonal expansion of antibodies in the repertoire. As

190

P#2 showed a large number of RBD-binding antibodies and was the only

191

patient with three sequential blood samples, we conducted more detailed

192

characterization of P#2 antibodies. Among a total of 69 antibodies from P#2,

193

the majority (59%) were scattered across various branches and the remaining

194

(41%) were clonally expanded into three major clusters (Figure 3A). Antibodies

195

from the three time points (A, B, C) do not appear to group together but rather

196

interdigitate among themselves, suggesting they are highly related during early

197

infection. Three clones were significantly enriched and each constituted

198

between 12-14% of the entire tested repertoire (Figure 3A). Their heavy-chain

199

variable regions belong to the VH1-2*06, VH3-48*02, and VH3-9*01 families.

200

The corresponding light-chain kappa (Igk) belongs to 2-40*01/2D-40*01, 3-

201

20*01, and light-chain lambda (Igl) to 2-14*02 with the respective joining

202

segment kappa 4 (Jk4), Jk5 and joining segment lambda 1 (Jl1) (Table S2).

203

More importantly, these clonally expanded antibodies were identified in all three

204

samples indicating that they are strongly selected for during infection. When

205

comparing their representation within each cluster, VH1-2*06 and VH3-9*01

206

appeared to increase from approximately 33 to 45%, whereas VH3-48*02

207

decreased from 33 to 9% over the three time points, although the number of

208

clones was too small for statistical significance. Interestingly, the somatic

209

hypermutation (SHM) or germline divergence for VH1-2*06 was 0% and this

210

cluster persisted during the study period. However, the SHM for VH3-48*02

211

reached as high as 9.6% and for VH3-9*01 reached 3.8% compared to the

212

overall average of 2.2% ± 3.3 % among the 69 VH sequences. Furthermore,

213

the CDR3 length for VH1-2*06, VH3-48*02, and VH3-9*01 was 19aa, 16aa,

214

and 23aa, respectively, compared with the overall average of 16 ± 4aa among

215

the 69 VH sequences. Close examination of the longest CDR3 from the

216

VH3-9*01 cluster revealed richness in tyrosine, indicating potential hydrogen

217

bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the surrounding residues. These

218

results shed light on the clonal expansion and broad diversity of RBD-specific

219

antibodies during early infection and their potential role in controlling SARS-

220

CoV-2 infection.

221
222

Binding and neutralizing properties of selected antibodies. We selected 13

223

of the 69 P#2 antibodies sequences based on their representation and

224

distribution on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3A, starred). Five P#1A antibody

225

clones were used as controls. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with SARS-

226

CoV-2 RBD showed that P#2 antibodies had dissociation constants (Kd)

227

ranging from 10-8 to 10-9 M while those from P#1 ranged from not detectable to

228

10-9 M (Table 1 and Figure S4). SHM did not appear to correlate with Kd; some

229

germline clones with 0% divergence in both VH and VL genes (P2A-1A10, P2B-

230

2G4, P2C-1A3, and P2C-1E1) had Kd values comparable to clones with higher

231

levels of SHM. The Kd of representative clones (P2A-1A8, P2A-1A10, and P2A-

232

1B3) from the three clonally expanded clusters fell into a similar range,

233

suggesting that their expansion may not be driven by affinity maturation. Next,

234

we measured each antibody for competition with ACE2 for binding to the SARS-

235

CoV-2 RBD. Specifically, the RBD was covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor

236

chip and first saturated by antibody and then flowed through with soluble ACE2.

237

Competing capacity of each antibody was measured as percent reduction in

238

ACE2 binding with the RBD (Table 1 and Figure S5). As shown in Table 1, the

239

evaluated antibodies demonstrated various competing capacity with ACE2. The

240

most powerful were P2C-1F11 and P2B-2F6, which reduced ACE2 binding

241

about 99.2% and 98.5%, respectively. Two of the three representative

242

antibodies from the clonal expanded clusters (P2A-1A10 and P2A-1B3) had

243

slightly over 80% and 90% reduction, respectively. The third representative

244

(P2A-1A8) only showed 57% reduction. Many antibodies had only limited

245

competing power with ACE2 despite impressive Kd values, suggesting binding

246

affinity is not predictive of ACE2 competing capacity. Control antibodies from

247

P#1 demonstrated even lower competing power with ACE2. Surprisingly, none

248

of the antibodies tested demonstrated cross-binding with SARS-CoV and

249

MERS-CoV RBD except P1A-1C7 (Kd=4.85μM), for which only limited cross

250

reactivity with SARS-CoV RBD was detected (Figure S4).

251

We next studied antibody neutralizing activities against pseudoviruses

252

bearing the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with the competing

253

capacity findings, neutralizing activity varied considerably with IC50 values

254

ranging from 0.03 to > 50 μg/ml (Figure 4B, 4A and Table 1). P2C-1F11 and

255

P2B-2F6 were the most potent, followed by P2C-1A3 and P2C-1C10. Overall,

256

ACE2 competing capacity correlated well with the neutralizing activities,

257

although this correlation was not exact in some instances. Notably, no cross-

258

neutralization was found either against pseudoviruses bearing the Spike of

259

SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (data not shown) nor with cell-surface staining of

260

trimeric SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Spike (Figure S6). Furthermore, we

261

selected P2C-1F11, P2B-2F6, and P2C-1A3 for neutralizing activity analyses

262

against live SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with their respective pseudovirus assay

263

findings, P2C-1F11 and P2B-2F6 demonstrated potent neutralization activity

264

while that of P2C-1A3 was somewhat lower, although it needs to be noted that

265

CPE assay is not particularly quantitative (Figure 4C). Lastly, we determined

266

whether these antibodies compete for similar epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2

267

RBD. We selected a total of six antibodies with ACE2 competitive capacities of

268

at least 70% and analyzed them in a pairwise competition fashion using SPR.

269

As shown in Table 2 and Figure S7, variable degrees of competition were found

270

among the pairs of antibodies. P2C-1A3, for instance, was competitive against

271

all antibodies tested with reduction capacity ranging from 52 to 76. P2C-1F11,

272

on the other hand, was less competitive with other antibodies and in particular,

273

only minimally competitive with P2C-1C10. P2B-2F6, another potent

274

neutralizing antibody, was broadly competitive with all antibodies tested. These

275

results indicate that the antibodies analyzed recognized both overlapping and

276

distinct epitopes. Different mAbs may therefore exert their neutralizing activity

277

through different mechanisms.

278

characterization indicates that these antibodies are derived from broad and

diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains. Each individual appears to

have unique pattern of distribution in the antibody repertoire without apparent

antibody family. Some clones were identified only once whereas others

289

underwent high degrees of clonal expansion. Some clones were virtually

290

identical to their germline ancestors while others became more divergent during

291

the infection period. The CDR3 length also varied among the different clones.

292

These differences at the genetic levels corresponded with their binding and

293

neutralizing activities. Binding affinity (Kd) fell in the range of 10-8 to 10-9 M,

294

equivalent to many antibodies identified during acute infections

30-32

but
33-35

295

significantly lower than those identified during chronic HIV-1 infections

.

296

However, binding affinity alone does not predict neutralizing activity.

297

Competition with the receptor ACE2 governs antibody potency, although some

298

degree of discrepancy does exist. In particular, the most potent antibodies,

299

P2C-1F11 and P2B-2F6, out-competed ACE2 with close to 100% efficiency,

300

indicating that blocking the RBD and ACE2 interaction is a useful surrogate for

301

antibody neutralization. Among the antibodies tested, substantial variations in

302

competition for similar RBD epitopes or regions were also found. The most

303

potent antibody, P2C-1F11, did not seem target the same epitope as the

304

relatively moderate antibody P2C-1C10. Thus, these two antibodies could be

305

combined for synergistic antiviral effect. As we continue to screen more

306

antibodies from P#2 and other study subjects, more potent and diverse

307

antibodies are expected to be identified. These antibodies will serve as the best

308

candidates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention

309

against COVID-19 infection.

310

Most surprising in this study was the absence of antibody cross-reactivity

311

with RBDs from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Based on the sequential and

312

structural similarities of RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we predicted

313

some degree of cross-binding and even cross-neutralization between the two

314

viruses. However, species-specific RBD responses in SARS-CoV-2 patients do

315

suggest that RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are immunologically

316

distinct. If so, antibodies and vaccines must target each viral species differently

317

in order to achieve maximum efficacy in protecting the host from infection. Our

318

finding somewhat resolves the question of why many previously isolated

319

SARS-CoV antibodies failed to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite

320

detectable levels of binding with Spike of SARS-CoV-236. The absence of cross-

321

recognition between RBDs was also apparent at the plasma level. Although

322

strong binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was identified, plasma samples from the

323

study subjects failed to demonstrate appreciable cross-reactivity with either

324

SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV RBD, highlighting the immunological distinctions

325

among the RBDs from the three viruses. However, substantial cross-reactivity

326

were found when the same plasma samples were applied to the trimeric Spike

327

proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although this was higher with the

328

former than the latter. This indicates that such cross-reactivity likely occurs in

329

regions outside the RBD. Determining whether this cross-reactive response

330

has any neutralizing or protection capacity against infection would require

331

further investigation. Finally, despite successfully isolating and characterizing a

332

large of number mAbs against SARS-CoV-2, we cannot draw any firm

333

correlation between antibody response and disease status at this time. In

334

particular, the three severe cases (P#1, P#2, and P#5) appear to have relatively

335

higher plasma binding and neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 than

336

those with relative mild symptoms. A larger number of patients must be studied

337

to elucidate the drivers and impact of associations between antibody response

338

and disease progression, which will provide pivotal reference for our antibody-

339

based intervention as well as vaccine development.

Patients and blood samples. The study enrolled a total of eight patients aged

348

10 to 66 years old infected with SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020 (Table S1). A

349

plasma sample from a healthy control was also included. Of these eight patients,

350

six (P#1 through P#4, P#8, and P#16) had Wuhan exposure history through

351

personal visit and two had direct contact with individuals from Wuhan. Four

352

subjects (P#1 through P#4) were part of a family cluster (P#1 through P#5)

353

infected while visiting Wuhan and subsequently transmitted infection to P#5

354

after returning to Shenzhen 5. All patients were hospitalized at Shenzhen Third

355

People’s Hospital, the designated city hospital for treatment of COVID-19

356

infected patients, three to nine days after symptom onset. All patients presented

357

with fever, fatigue, and dry cough and three (P#1, P#2 and P#5) developed

358

severe pneumonia. Four patients (P#1, P#2, P#5, and P#22) were 60 years or

359

older, of which three (P#1, P#2, and P#22) had underlying disease such as

360

hypertension. SARS-CoV-2 infection status was verified by RT-PCR of

361

nasopharyngeal swab and throat swab specimens. No patient had detectable

362

influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or adenovirus co-infections.

363

Chest computed tomographic scans showed varying degrees of bilateral lung

364

patchy shadows or opacity. All patients received antiviral and corticosteroid

365

treatments, recovered and were discharged except for P#1, who succumbed to

366

disease in hospital. Single (P#1, P#3, P#5, P#8, P#16, and P#22) or sequential

367

(P#2 and P#4) blood samples were collected during hospitalization and follow-

368

up visits and separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells

369

(PBMCs) by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare) centrifugation. All plasma

370

samples were heat-inactivated at 56 ºC for 1h before being stored at -80 ºC.

371

PBMCs were maintained in freezing media and stored in liquid nitrogen until

390

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 NP protein

391

(Sino Biological, Beijing) were diluted to final concentrations of 0.5 μg/ml or

392

2μg/ml, then coated onto 96-well plates and incubated at 4°C overnight.

393

Samples were washed with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and

394

blocked with blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% skim milk and 2% BSA) at RT

395

for 1h. Either serially diluted plasma samples or isolated mAbs were added the

396

plates and incubated at 37°C for 1h. Wells were then incubated with secondary

397

anti-human IgG labeled with HRP (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing) and TMB substrate

398

(Kinghawk, Beijing) and optical density (OD) was measured by a

413

and/or Streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences) to target the Strep tag of RBD, or anti-

414

his-APC and anti-his-PE antibodies (Abcam) to target the His tag of RBD. The

415

stained cells were washed and resuspended in PBS before being strained

416

through a 70μm cell mesh (BD Biosciences). RBD-specific single B cells were

417

gated as CD19+CD3-CD8-CD14-IgG+RBD+ and sorted into 96-well PCR

418

plates containing 20μl of lysis buffer (5 μl of 5 x first strand buffer, 0.5 μl of

419

RNase out, 1.25 μl of 0.1 M DTT (Invitrogen) per well and 0.0625 μl of Igepal

Single B cell PCR, cloning and expression of mAbs. The IgG heavy and

423

light chain variable genes were amplified by nested PCR and cloned into linear

424

expression cassettes or expression vectors to produce full IgG1 antibodies as

425

previously described

426

containing tag sequences were used to produce the linear Ig expression

427

cassettes by overlapping PCR. Separate primer pairs containing the specific

428

restriction enzyme cutting sites (heavy chain, 5’-AgeI/3’-SalI; kappa chain, 5’-

429

AgeI/3’-BsiWI; and lambda chain, 5’-AgeI/3’-XhoI) were used to amplify the

430

cloned PCR products. The PCR products were purified and cloned into the

431

backbone of antibody expression vectors containing the constant regions of

432

human IgG1. Overlapping PCR products of paired heavy and light chain

433

expression cassettes were co-transfected into 293T cells (ATCC) grown in 24-

434

well plates. Antigen-specific ELISA was used to detect the binding capacity of

435

transfected culture supernatants to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Monoclonal antibodies

436

were produced by transient transfection of 293F cells (Life Technologies) with

437

equal amounts of paired heavy and light chain plasmids. Antibodies in the

438

culture supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography using Protein A

A chromatography. MERS-CoV antibodies (Mab-GD33) were derived from

446

previously reported

447

antibody directly isolated from a patient targeting the CD4 binding site of

448

envelope glycoprotein 40.

449

Antibody binding kinetics, epitope mapping, and competition with

450

receptor ACE2 measured by SPR. The binding kinetics and affinity of mAbs

451

to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were analyzed by SPR (Biacore T200, GE Healthcare).

452

Specifically, purified RBDs were covalently immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip

453

via amine groups in 10mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for a final RU around

454

250. SPR assays were run at a flow rate of 30ml/min in HEPES buffer. The

455

sensograms were fit in a 1:1 binding model with BIA Evaluation software (GE

456

Healthcare). For epitope mapping, two different antibodies were sequentially

457

injected and monitored for binding activity to determine whether the two mAbs

458

recognized separate or closely-situated epitopes. To determine competition

459

with the human ACE2 peptidase domain, SARS-CoV-2 RBD was immobilized

460

to a CM5 sensor chip via amine group for a final RU around 250. Antibodies (1

461

μM) were injected onto the chip until binding steady-state was reached. ACE2

462

(2 μM), which was produced and purified as above, was then injected for 60

463

seconds. Blocking efficacy was determined by comparison of response units

464

with and without prior antibody incubation.

468

CoV and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. The cells were digested with trypsin and

469

distributed into 96 well plates for the individual staining. Cells were washed

470

twice with 200µl staining buffer (PBS with 2% heated-inactivated FBS) between

471

each following steps. The cells were stained at room temperature for 30

472

minutes in 100 μl staining buffer with 1:100 dilutions of plasma or 20 μg/ml

473

monoclonal antibodies. The cells were then stained with PE labeled anti-human

474

IgG Fc secondary antibody (Biolegend) at a 1:20 dilution in 50 μl staining buffer

475

at room temperature for 30 minutes. Finally, the cells were re-suspended and
