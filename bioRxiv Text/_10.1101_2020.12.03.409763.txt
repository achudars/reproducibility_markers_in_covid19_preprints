Running title: SARS-CoV-2 D614 and G614 spike proteins

Word count: 19281 characters

Abstract:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) exhibits two major variants based on mutations of its spike protein, i.e., the
D614 prototype and G614 variant. Although neurological symptoms have been frequently
reported in patients, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 impairs neuronal activity or
function. Here, we show that expression of both D614 and G614 spike proteins is sufficient to
induce phenotypes of impaired neuronal morphology, including defective dendritic spines and
shortened dendritic length. Using spike protein-specific monoclonal antibodies, we found that
D614 and G614 spike proteins show differential S1/S2 cleavage and cell fusion efficiency. Our
findings provide an explanation for higher transmission of the G614 variant and the neurological
manifestations observed in COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) represents an
unprecedented threat to global health and economics. Apart from developing vaccines and rapid
screening systems, it is also urgent to understand characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2 in
short hereafter) that may inform possible therapeutics for the COVID-19 pandemic.
SARS2 binds to the receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin-1
(NRP1) on host cell surfaces via its spike envelope glycoprotein, triggering membrane fusion for
viral entry (Cantuti-Castelvetri and al., 2020; Daly and al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Li, 2016; Lu et
al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). In addition to viral entry, SARS2 spike protein
also triggers fusion of host cells, giving rise to giant cells harboring multiple nuclei (also known
as syncytia) in patients (Ou et al., 2020). Since ACE2 is widely distributed in divergent cell
types, including neurons and glial cells (Chen et al., 2020b; Song et al., 2020), like SARS-CoV
(SARS in short hereafter) (Guo et al., 2008), SARS2 can infect multiple organs, including the
olfactory and central nervous systems (Baig and Sanders, 2020; Bullen et al., 2020; Butowt and
Bilinska, 2020; Ellul et al., 2020; Iadecola et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a; Li et al., 2020c; Natoli et
al., 2020; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020; Varatharaj et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a; Zubair et al.,
2020). Human brain organoid cultures have further confirmed that SARS2 is able to infect
human cortical neurons, evidenced by the presence of respective viral genomes and proteins in
neurons (Bullen et al., 2020; Mesci and al., 2020; Song et al., 2020). Studies of animal models
also support that both SARS and SARS2 can infect neurons of the rodent central nervous system
(CNS) (Natoli et al., 2020; Netland et al., 2008). SARS2 infection results in neurological
manifestations and neuropsychiatric illness in both adult and newborn patients, including loss of
olfaction and/or taste, dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, delirium/psychosis, seizures,
inflammatory CNS syndromes, and rare cases of ataxia and epilepsy (Chen et al., 2020a; Filatov
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020c; Mao et al., 2020a; Mao et al., 2020b; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020;
Paterson et al., 2020; R.W. and al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b; Zubair et al., 2020). Neurological
symptoms persist in COVID-19 long-haulers, who still have the signs of damage after recovery
from infection (Marshall, 2020; Weerahandi and al., 2020), indicating long-term impacts of
COVID-19 on the nervous system. Neuronal cell death and reduced protein levels of neuronal
markers have been reported in SARS2-infected human brain organoids (Mesci and al., 2020;

Song et al., 2020). However, it remains unclear if SARS2 influences neuronal function or
activity to cause neurological symptoms. Recent proteomic studies have analyzed protein-protein
interactions among SARS2 viral proteins and host proteins (Gordon and al., 2020) and the
phosphorylation landscape of SARS2-infected cells (Bouhaddou et al., 2020). These studies
indicate that SARS2 viral proteins interact with host proteins, thereby altering cellular status.
Mutations in SARS2 spike protein influence viral infectivity (Li et al., 2020b). In
particular, the D614G mutation of SARS2 spike resulted in a global transition of SARS2 from
the D614 prototype originally identified from Wuhan to the G614 variant that became dominant
since late May 2020 (Korber et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b). To date, it is unclear why the D614G
mutation enhances SARS2 infectivity (Becerra-Flores and Cardozo, 2020; Daniloski et al., 2020;
Korber et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). In this report, we used primary cultured neurons and
three different cell lines to investigate biochemical and cell biology properties of spike D614 and
G614 variants. We unexpectedly found that both D614 and G614 spike proteins alter neuronal
morphology. Moreover, these two spike variants have differential properties in terms of S1/S2
proteolysis and cell fusion, which may account for variant infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Results
Expression of D614 spike alters dendritic spine density and morphology of neurons
We first used cultured neurons as a model to investigate if expression of spike protein is
sufficient to alter neuronal morphology, which is highly relevant to neuronal function (Chen et
al., 2011; Zoghbi and Bear, 2012). We co-transfected HA-tagged D614 spike proteins and GFP
into cultured neurons at 13 days in vitro (DIV) and harvested neurons for immunostaining at
DIV 18, representing the stage when cultured neurons are sufficiently mature to form synapses
(Chen et al., 2017; Hung et al., 2018). GFP signals were used to outline neuronal morphology,
including dendritic spines, the subcellular structures harboring the excitatory synapses of
mammalian brain (Harris and Stevens, 1989). We found that spike protein, as revealed by HA
immunoreactivity, was widely distributed in cultured neurons, including their dendritic spines
(Fig. 1A). A quantification analysis indicated that spike protein increased dendritic spine density,
but narrowed spine heads and extended spine length (Fig. 1B, 1C), both of which are
morphological features of spines having functional defects (Hering and Sheng, 2001; Hsueh,

2012). These results indicate that expression of SARS2 spike protein likely impairs the synaptic
function of host neurons, potentially giving rise to neurological symptoms in patients.

Generation and characterization of SARS2 spike monoclonal antibodies
To further characterize SARS2 spike proteins, we used the receptor binding domain (RBD) of
SARS2 spike protein as an immunogen to generate mouse monoclonal antibodies (Fig. S1A).
Seven specific mouse monoclonal antibodies for the RBD of SARS2 spike protein were
generated, only two of which (namely SA07 and SA15) were used in this report. Our RBD
monoclonal antibodies recognized their immunogen (i.e. MBP-RBD fusion protein) as well as Cterminal HA-tagged full length (FL) spike proteins expressed in human embryonic kidney
HEK239T cells (Fig. S1B). Note that, in addition to the C-terminal HA tagging, we did not
introduce any other mutation in our SARS2 spike protein to prevent it from proteolytic process
and ER retention. Thus, these two RBD antibodies also detected a 120-kDa band that presumably
represents the S1 fragment of SARS2 spike proteins after cleavage. Notably our antibodies did
not recognize SARS spike proteins (Fig. S1B), evidencing their specificity. On the other hand,
HA and SARS-CoV S2 (CoV-S2) antibodies detected FL and S2 fragments (a protein band at
~105 kDa) of SARS2 spike (Fig. S1B). Apart from in denatured conditions, our RBD antibodies
also worked well in other applications to detect native spike protein, i.e., enzyme-linked
immunosorbent

(Fig.

(Fig.

and

immunostaining (Fig. S1E, S1F). Thus, our two newly generated RBD antibodies (SA07 and
SA15) can serve as powerful tools in multiple assays to enable investigations of the expression,
subcellular distribution, and proteolysis of SARS2 spike protein in host cells.

Differential proteolysis and cell fusion activity of D614 and G614 spike proteins
Sine the S2 fragment generated by proteolytic cleavage of furin is essential for viral entry and
cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we speculate that the D614G mutation
alters proteolytic processing of SARS2 spike protein and, consequently, enabled the change in
viral infectivity. To investigate that possibility, we used three different cell lines to express
SARS2 spike proteins, namely mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2A cells, African green monkey

kidney fibroblast-like COS-1 cells and HEK293T cells, and used immunoblotting to assess
SARS2 D614 and G614 spike variants. We first observed that the efficiency of S1/S2 proteolysis
varied among the tested cell lines (Fig. 2A-2C). The G614 variant seemed to be expressed higher
than D614 prototype in Neuro-2A cells, though this difference was not obvious in COS1 and
HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A-2C). Since FL spike proteins are synthesized at endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and then transported to Golgi apparatus for furin cleavage (de Haan et al., 2004; Follis et
al., 2006; Hasan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020), thereby generating the S1 and S2
fragments, the distinct amounts of S1 and S2 fragments in different cell lines indicates that these
cells exhibit differential ER-Golgi trafficking or furin activities. Thus, our data imply that
different cell types show differential abilities to process SARS2 spike proteins.
Intriguingly, we found that proteolysis of the G614 variant was greater than that of the
D614 prototype, as S2 fragments of G614 spike proteins were relatively more abundant than
those of D614 spike proteins in all the tested cell lines (Fig. 2A-2C). In addition, we observed
that some G614 variants (including FL, glycosylation variants and S1 fragments) migrated
slightly faster by SDS-PAGE relative to the D614 prototype (Fig. 2A-2C). Apart from being
glycosylated (Watanabe et al., 2020), spike proteins are posttranslationally modified by
phosphorylation (Bouhaddou et al., 2020), which likely contributes to the differing SDS-PAGE
mobility of the D614 and G614 variants.
Since the cleaved S2 fragment mediates membrane fusion, the higher levels of S2
fragments derived from G614 spike protein support our speculation that G614 spike protein may
present better fusion ability relative to D614 spike. To confirm that point, we investigated the
syncytium formation ability of D614 and G614 spike proteins. SARS2 spike protein and human
ACE2 were separately expressed in two different HEK293T cell cultures. GFP was cotransfected
with spike protein to monitor cell fusion. Sixty and ninety minutes after adding spike/GFPexpressing cells to human ACE2-expressing cells, the cells were fixed to monitor cell fusion.
Enlarged GFP cells possessing three or more nuclei were identified as syncytia (Fig. 2D,
arrows). For both 60- and 90-min co-culture, numbers of syncytia were higher for G614- relative
to D614-expressing cells (Fig. 2D, middle). Numbers of syncytia having ≥4 nuclei were also
noticeably higher in the group of G614-expressing cells after 90-min co-culture (Fig. 2D, right).
Both spike protein and ACE2 were required for cell fusion because neither spike protein alone
nor ACE2 alone induced cell fusion (data not shown). These results support that the G614

variant is more effective at cell fusion than the D614 prototype. Moreover, they imply that the
SARS2 G614 variant endows more effective viral entry and triggers greater cell fusion of
infected cells with neighboring non-infected cells. The fact that G614-mediated transmission is
more effective may account for the global transition from the D614 to G614 variant (Korber et
al., 2020).

Differential S1 and S2 epitope distribution of spike proteins
Next, we performed fluorescence immunostaining to further characterize spike protein
expression in host cells. Spike protein targets to the dendritic spines of neurons (Fig. 1A), which
are F-actin-enriched structures. Therefore, we investigated if spike proteins also colocalize with
F-actin in HEK293T and Neuro-2A cells. Z-series confocal imaging clearly indicated strong HA
or MYC immunoreactivities of both D614 and G614 variants in F-actin-related structures, i.e.
filopodia, lamellipodia, cell edges and stress fibers (Fig. 3A, 3B). However, SA07 antibody
revealed a mainly intracellular pattern for both D614 and G614 spike proteins in HEK293T and
Neuro-2A cells (Fig. 3C, 3D). Enrichment of spike protein variants in F-actin-positive structures
was not universal for other membrane proteins, as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was not
concentrated at filopodia or lamellipodia in HEK293T cells (Fig. S2). As spike protein contains
an ER retention signal, next we examined if the intracellular SA07-staining pattern was indeed
associated with ER. We found that SA07 immunoreactivities were considerably colocalized with
the ER marker calreticulin (Calr) in both D614- and G614-expressing HEK293T cells, though
SA07 immunoreactivity extended further to cell margins, i.e., a region lacking calreticulin (Fig.
4A, 4B, middle panel, red only). However, we found that neither MYC nor CoV-S2 antibody
presented obvious colocalization with calreticulin (Fig. 4A, 4B, upper and lower panel). Instead,
these antibodies clearly outlined cell margins and also labeled intracellular aggregates (Fig. 4A,
4B). That outcome was not specific to SARS2 spike protein because the same pattern was
observed for SARS spike protein (Fig. 4C). It was also not specific for HEK293T cells because a
similar distribution was apparent for Neuro-2A cells (Fig. 4D). Since HA, MYC and CoV-S2
antibody all detect FL and S2 fragments of spike protein and SA07 recognizes the FL and S1
fragments, these observations indicate that the subcellular distribution of the S1 and S2
fragments of spike protein differ. The S1 epitope was highly enriched at ER and the S2 epitope

tended to target to the cell surface and filopodia. The occurrence of S2 fragments alone in
filopodia may further promote the cell fusion efficiency of infected cells with neighboring cells
(Fig. 3). In the context of COVID-19 patients, this S2 distribution would also be expected to
enhance syncytia formation to impair cellular function.

Both D614 and G614 spike variants alter neuronal morphology
As the S2 fragments of both the D614 and G614 variants targeted to filopodia, we investigated if
the G614 variant also results in dendritic spine defects of cultured neurons. We co-transfected
GFP with vector control, D614 or G614 into cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV 13. Similar to
observations for the D614 prototype, the G614 variant was also widely present in neurons,
including in dendritic spines (Fig. 5A). Moreover, both the G614 and D614 variants exerted
comparable effects in terms of reducing dendritic spine density, narrowing spine heads and
extending spine length (Fig. 5B). Thus, G614 spike proteins exhibit equivalent ability to the
D614 prototype in impairing synaptic activity and morphology. Since SARS2 infects both adult
and newborn patients, we also investigated the effect of spike variants on developing neurons
(Fig. 5C, 5D). Cultured neurons were co-transfected with HA-tagged spike proteins and GFP at
DIV 3 and harvested for immunostaining at DIV 6. We found that expression of both SARS2
spike variants shortened dendritic lengths of developing neurons (Fig. 5C, 5D). Thus, both D614
and G614 spike proteins have the ability to impair neuronal morphology.

Discussion
In this report, we show that expression of SARS2 spike protein is sufficient to impair
neuronal morphology. Both the D614 and G614 spike variants cause defects in the dendritic
spines of mature neurons and reduce the dendritic length of developing neurons. Since neuronal
morphology is highly relevant to neuronal function, the morphological defects caused by SARSCoV-2 spike protein imply that infected neurons function abnormally, which is likely relevant to
the neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms presented by COVID-19 patients (Chen et al.,
2020a; Ellul et al., 2020; Filatov et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020c; Mao et al., 2020b; R.W. and al.,
2020; Varatharaj et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). Nevertheless, to confirm altered neuronal

activity upon SARS2 infection, it is imperative to perform electrophysiological recordings in the
future. Importantly, it is unclear how spike proteins control neuronal morphology. Since spike
protein distribution overlaps with that of F-actin and given that F-actin cytoskeletons are critical
regulators of neuronal morphology (Dillon and Goda, 2005; dos Remedios et al., 2003), spike
proteins may control F-actin dynamics or rearrangement via an unknown mechanism to influence
neuronal morphology. It will be intriguing to investigate the mechanism by which spike proteins
might target to F-actin and regulate F-actin dynamics.
It has been questioned if SARS2 can infect neurons by binding to ACE2 because ACE2
expression levels are low in the nervous system (Cai et al., 2020; Cooper et al., 2020). We
postulate three possible mechanisms by which SARS2 can infect neurons. First, though low,
ACE2 transcripts are still detectable in neurons (Chen et al., 2020b). Low-level ACE2 expression
may be sufficient for infection when viral titers are high. Secondly, infection may be mediated
by another spike receptor, NRP1, which is highly expressed in neurons (He and Tessier-Lavigne,
1997; Kawakami et al., 1996; Kolodkin et al., 1997). Thirdly, membrane fusion may be mediated
by digested S2 fragments (Cai et al., 2020), since such fragments are present on virion surfaces
(Cai et al., 2020) and SARS2 spike protein-expressing cells (presumably virus-infected cells in
patients). Consequently, neurons may be infected by locally high virion dosages released from
proximal infected tissues or upon fusing with neighboring infected cells. Certainly, these three
possibilities are not mutually exclusive and further investigations are required to elucidate the
detailed infection pathways of SARS2 in vivo.
Using a series of biochemical and cell biological studies, we report three differences
between D614 and G614 spike proteins. First, our results echo a previous cryo-EM study that
spike proteins are readily processed into S1 and S2 fragments in host cells (Cai et al., 2020).
S1/S2 cleavage of G614 spike is more pronounced compared to that of the D614 prototype.
Second, perhaps due to having higher amounts of S2 fragments, G614 spike protein-expressing
cells exhibited more efficient cell fusion than D614-expressing cells. Third, G614 and D614
spike proteins exhibit slightly different mobilities on SDS-PAGE gels, indicating that the D614G
mutation may influence posttranslational modifications to modulate spike protein activity. In
terms of proteolytic processing of spike variants, the conclusions of several studies are
conflicting (Daniloski et al., 2020; Hu and al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy and al., 2020). Using
pseudotyped virus bearing SARS2 spike protein, some researchers did not observe distinct

proteolytic cleavage between D614 and G614 variants. However, when producing pseudotyped
virus, the furin cleavage site and ER-retention signal of spike protein tends to be mutated or
removed in order to obtain high concentration virion titers (Ou et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy and al.,
2020). Some structural studies have also used the same strategy to generate high yields of
homogenous spike proteins (Yurkovetskiy and al., 2020). Consequently, this kind of
modification may alter spike protein properties, contributing to discrepancies among results.
Although infection mechanisms in virus-infected cells are expected to be more complex
than for expression of spike protein alone and some key conclusions should be further validated
in SARS2-infected cells, our study sheds light on the properties of SARS2 spike protein in host
cells. Our findings also provide possible explanations for why the D614G mutation enhances
infectivity and how SARS2 infection impairs neuronal function.

Recombinant protein purification and antibodies – BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli bacteria
carrying pMAL-c2x-RBD or pGEX-4T1-RBD were grown in LB media with Ampicillin. After
OD600 reached 0.5, IPTG was added into the culture to induce MBP-RBD or GST-RBD protein
expression. Bacteria were harvested after 3-h induction, and then lysed by sonication. The Triton
X-100-extracted soluble fraction was collected, and then the MBP-RBD and GST-RBD proteins
were purified by amylose resin and GST beads, respectively. Purified MBP-RBD proteins were
used to immunize BALB/c mice. Anti-SARS2-RBD mouse monoclonal antibodies (SA07 and
SA15) were generated as described previously (Chen et al., 2011). The HSP90 rabbit polyclonal
antibody was a gift from Dr. Chung Wang (Liou and Wang, 2005). The following
commercialized antibodies were also used in this study: HA (rabbit, C29F4, Cell Signaling), HA
(mouse, 16B12, abcam), Myc (mouse, 9B11, Cell Signaling), GFP (chicken, Abcam),
calretinculin (rabbit, ThermoFisher), SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 Spike S2 (mouse, 1A9,
GeneTex), anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson Lab), anti-rabbit-HRP (GE
Healthcare), and anti-mouse/rabbit/chicken-Alexa 488/555 (Invitrogen).

Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. To generate the 293T/hACE2 stably-expressed cell line, the human
ACE2 gene was amplified from the MGC human cDNA library and sub-cloned into NheI and
EcoRI sites of a lentivector provided by the RNAi core facility in Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
HEK293T cells were transduced with VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus carrying the human ACE2
gene and continuously selected with 2.5 mg/mL puromycin. Expression of human ACE2 protein
was confirmed by immunoblotting using ACE2 antibody. Mouse cortical neurons were cultured
in Neurobasal medium/DMEM (1:1) with B27 supplement and transfected using calcium
phosphate precipitation methods as described previously (Hung et al., 2018). Cotransfected GFP
was used to outline neuronal morphology. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were
performed as described previously (Chen et al., 2017).
ELISA – A Nunc 96-well microplate (Thermo Scientific) was coated with purified GST-RBD
proteins following 2-fold serial dilution starting from 200 ng/ml and incubated at 4 oC overnight.
After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, 1 ug/ml of anti-RBD antibodies (SA07 and SA15) and
GST antibody in blocking buffer were added to the wells. After incubation for 1 h, each well was
washed five times with 0.1% Tween-20 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before applying
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The plate was incubated at room temperature for another
one hour and washed as described above. Substrate solution (0.1 mg/ml 2,2'-azino-bis (3ethylbenz thiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 0.03% H2O2 in 0.1 M Citric acid pH 4.0) was
added into the wells for color development. After 10 to 20 min, the signal of each well was
detected using an ELISA reader at OD405. For all the solutions used here, the volume applied into
each well was 0.1 ml.
Cell fusion – Spike (D614)-HA or Spike (G614)-HA was co-transfected with GFP into
HEK293T cells. After 16-18 h post-transfection, the cells were detached by using 1 mM
EDTA/PBS, and then added into 293T/hACE2 cell culture. Cells were fixed after 60 and 90 min
co-culture. DAPI was used to counterstain the nuclei. Ten randomly selected non-overlapping
areas of each sample were captured using a confocal microscope (LSM 700, Zeiss) equipped
with a 20×/NA 0.8 (Plan-Apochromat) objective lens and Zen acquisition and analysis software

(Zeiss). Quantitation of fused cells was performed using ImageJ software. An enlarged GFPpositive cell with three or more nuclei was identified as a syncytium.
Immunostaining – After 24-48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Neurons were fixed at DIV6 and DIV18. Immunostaining
procedures were performed as described previously (Chen et al., 2011). Immunofluorescence
images of cultured neurons at DIV6 were visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Axioimage
M2; Zeiss) equipped with a 20×/NA 0.8 (Plan-Apochromat) objective lens and acquired using a
cooled charge-coupled device camera (Rolera EM-C2; QImaging) with Zen software (Zeiss). For
cell lines and DIV18 neurons, images were captured with a confocal microscope (LSM 700,
Zeiss) equipped with a 63×/NA 1.4 (Plan-Apochromat) objective lens and Zen acquisition and
analysis software (Zeiss). The images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe) with minimal
adjustment of brightness or contrast applied to the entire images. Quantitation of neuronal
morphology was performed using ImageJ software.
Neuronal morphometry – For dendrite analysis, total dendrite length, including primary dendrites
and all dendritic branches, was measured and the number of dendritic tips was counted. For spine
analysis, secondary dendrites of DIV18 neurons were chosen to assess spine density, the width of
spine heads, and spine length. All experiments were repeated at least three times. For each
repeat, at least 20-30 neurons were randomly picked from each group for analysis. The data
shown in this manuscript are the representative results of three independent experiments.
Statistical analysis – Statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software.
Experiments were performed blind by relabeling the samples with the assistance of other
laboratory members. For two-group experiments, an unpaired t-test was used. For experiments
with more than two groups, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni correction was applied.
For Figure 2C, two-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni correction was used. Data are
presented as the mean ± SEM.

Figures and Figure legends

Figure 1. Overexpression of SARS2 spike protein alters the density and morphology of
dendritic spines of cultured neurons. (A) Mouse cortical neurons were cotransfected with GFP
and either vector control or HA-tagged D614 spike protein at DIV13. Five days later,
immunostaining was performed to monitor GFP and HA signals. Counterstaining with DAPI was
included to label the nuclei of neurons. Red arrows point to some very tiny spine heads. Scale
bar: upper, 20 µm; lower, 5 µm. (B) Quantification of spine density, length and width. The
results represent mean plus SEM. (C) Cumulative probability of the width and length of
dendritic spines. The experiments were independently repeated three times. Only one set of
representative data is shown. The numbers of examined neurons (N) and dendrites (n) are shown
in columns. Three clearly identified dendrites of each neuron were subjected to analysis of
dendritic spine density and morphology. ***, P < 0.001.

present. HA antibody exhibited crossreactivity with protein bands of ~125 kDa in the control
group. However, SA07 antibody did not present any signal in the control group. In (C), cell
lysates of each group were collected from three different culture wells. The results of
quantification are also summarized. (D) Cell-cell fusion mediated by spike protein and hACE2.
HEK293T cells were transiently expressed with GFP and either D614 or G614 spike protein. The
cells were then detached using EDTA, and co-cultured with 293T/hACE2 cells for 60 or 90 min
at 37 oC. Enlarged GFP-positive cells possessing three or more nuclei were counted (white
arrows). “Syncytia (n>3)” represents GFP-positive cells containing at least three nuclei.
”Syncytia (n>4)” represents GFP-positive cells with four or more nuclei. Experiments were
independently repeated three times. The results represent mean plus SEM. **, P < 0.01; ***, P <
0.001. Scale bar, 50 µm.

Figure S1. Characterization of monoclonal antibodies recognizing RBD of SASR2 spike
protein. (A) Schematic domain structure of SARS2 spike protein. Spike protein can be cleaved
into S1 and S2 fragments by furin. The D614 residue is located within the S1 fragment. The
location of RBD antigens are indicated. Either HA or MYC tagging at the C-terminal of SARS2
spike protein was used in this study. The SARS S2 antibody that is labeled as CoV-S2 can
recognize the S2 region of both SARS and SARS2. Thus, the RBD, HA, MYC and CoV-S2
antibodies can be used to label full length, S1 and S2 fragments of SARS2 spike protein. TM,
transmembrane domain. (B) Immunoblotting analysis reveals the specificity of RBD monoclonal
antibodies SA07 and SA15. Purified MBP-RBD fusion protein and HEK293T lysates expressing
control vector, SARS2 and SARS spike proteins were included for testing. The results of HA and
CoV-S2 antibodies confirmed the expression of SARS and SARS2 spike proteins. HSP90
