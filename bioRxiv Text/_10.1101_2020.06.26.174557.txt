Abstract
In six of seven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients, VH
clonotypes, encoded by either immunoglobin heavy variable (IGHV)3-53 or IGHV3-66 and
immunoglobin heavy joining (IGHJ)6, were identified in IgG1, IgA1, and IgA2 subtypes, with
minimal mutations, and could be paired with diverse light chains, resulting in binding to the
SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Because most human antibodies against the
RBD neutralized the virus by inhibiting host cell entry, we selected one of these clonotypes
and demonstrated that it could potently inhibit viral replication. Interestingly, these VH
clonotypes pre-existed in six of 10 healthy individuals, predominantly as IgM isotypes, which
could explain the expeditious and stereotypic development of these clonotypes among SARSCoV-2 patients.

Main Text
Stereotypic neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that are identified in convalescent patients can be
valuable, providing critical information regarding the epitopes that should be targeted during
the development of a vaccine 1,2. Those antibodies with naïve sequences, little to no somatic
mutations, and IgM or IgD isotypes are precious 3,4 because these characteristics effectively
exclude the possibility that these nAbs evolved from pre-existing clonotypes that are reactive
to similar viruses. This critical phenomenon is referred to as original antigenic sin (OAS), and
predisposed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) enhancing the severity of viral
infections, which can sometimes be fatal, as in the case of the dengue virus vaccine 5-8.
Several groups have identified nAbs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) 9-13, and one report has suggested the possibility that stereotypic nAbs may
exist among convalescent patients 9. However, stereotypic nAbs for SARS-CoV-2 have not

yet been identified. Here, we report stereotypic nAbs for SARS-CoV-2, which were
identified by mapping nAbs onto deep immunoglobulin repertoires that were profiled from
infected patients. One of these stereotypic nAbs was perfectly naïve and was encoded by
immunoglobin heavy variable (IGHV)3-53/IGHV3-66 and immunoglobin heavy joining
(IGHJ)6. Furthermore, we also found that these exact VH clonotypes pre-exist in the majority
of the healthy population, predominantly as an IgM isotype, which immediately provoked the
hypothesis that individuals with this VH clonotype may be able to rapidly evolve potent nAbs
and experience favorable clinical features, similar to the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-1 response observed among individuals who acquire a unique VH clonotype, featuring
a very long heavy chain complementarity determining region (HCDR)3, following exposure
to syphilis infection 14.
To obtain monoclonal nAbs against SARS-CoV-2, we collected blood samples from seven
SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (patients A–G) and used them to generate human antibody
libraries. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses a spike (S) protein for receptor
binding and membrane fusion 15. This protein interacts with the cellular receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme II (ACE2) to gain entry into the host cell 16,17. A previous report
suggested that a human monoclonal antibody, which reacted with the receptor-binding
domain (RBD), within the S1 region of the S protein, could hinder the initial interaction
between the virus and the cell, effectively neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 13. We confirmed the
reactivity of the sera derived from patients against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD
proteins. Patients A and E, who presented with extensive pneumonic infiltrates, also showed
high plasma IgG levels against all recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NP), S, S1, S2,
and RBD proteins, which could be detected 11, 17, and 45 days after symptom onset in
Patient A and 23, 44, and 99 days after symptom onset in Patient E (Supplementary Table 1

and Supplementary Fig. 1). Notably, the sera samples from Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) patients cross-reacted with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, showing a
higher titer against the S2 domain, and vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2), suggesting
the potential risk for ADE. We generated four human antibody libraries, utilizing a phage
display system, based on the blood samples from Patient A, which were collected on days 17
and 45 (A_d17 and A_d45), and Patient E, which were collected on days 23 and 44 (E_d23
and E_d44). After biopanning, we successfully isolated 38 single-chain variable fragment
(scFv) clones that were reactive against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD in an enzyme
immunoassay (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). The half-maximal binding
of these scFv-human kappa light chain fragment (hCκ) fusion proteins with the coated
antigens occurred at concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 364 nM, which was compatible with
the findings of previous reports that have described human monoclonal antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 RBD 10,13. Then, we tested whether these antibody clones could inhibit the
binding between recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein and Vero E6 cells expressing the
ACE2 receptor. When incubated with 1.5 × 105 Vero E6 cells, the recombinant HIS-tagged
SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed saturated binding at 200 nM, according to flow cytometry
analysis, using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-HIS antibody. For the
analysis, recombinant S protein (200 nM) was mixed with scFv-hFc fusion proteins, at a final
concentration of either 200 nM (equimolar) or 600 nM (molar ratio of 1:3). Eleven clones (A1A1, A-1H4, A-1H12, A-2F1, A-2H4, E-2G3, E-3A12, E-3B1, E-3G9, E-3H31, and E4D12) almost completely inhibited the binding between recombinant S protein and Vero E6
cells at 600 nM, and some showed potent inhibition activity, even at 200 nM (Supplementary
Fig. 4). The neutralizing potency of these 11 clones for the inhibition of viral replication was
tested using an in vitro assay. Vero cells, in a T-25 flask, were infected with SARS-CoV-2, at

a medium tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of 2,500 and in the presence of scFv-hCκ
fusion proteins, at concentrations of 0.5, 5, or 50 µg/mL. Viral RNA concentrations in the
culture supernatant were determined 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours after infection. Nine antibodies
exhibited complete neutralizing activity, at 50 µg/mL (Supplementary Fig. 5), and two
antibodies (A-1H4 and E-3G9) showed potent neutralization, even at 5 µg/mL
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
We also performed deep profiling of the immunoglobulin (IG) repertoire in three
chronological blood samples each from patients A and E and two chronological samples from
each of the other five patients. Then, we searched for nAb clonotypes that possessed identical
VJ combinations and perfectly matched HCDR3 sequences, at the amino acid level among
the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) repertoires of Patients A and E. One and five nAb
clonotypes were successfully identified in Patients A and E, respectively (Fig. 1a). Notably,
three nAbs (A-2F1, E-3A12, and E-3B1) were encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6
(Fig. 1a). These two VH genes, IGHV3-53*01 and IGHV3-66*01, are identical at the amino
acid level, except for the H12 residue (isoleucine in IGHV3-53 and valine in IGHV3-66), and
only five nucleotide differences exist between their sequences. Furthermore, four clonotypes
were IgG1, and two clonotypes class-switched to IgA1 and IgA2 when examined 44 days after
symptom onset (Fig. 1a). These clonotypes had a very low frequency of somatic mutations
(1.03% 0.51%), which was compatible with findings regarding other nAbs in previous
reports 9,10. Then, we collected all VH sequences from the seven patients and searched the
clonotypes of 11 nAbs that were encoded by the same VH and JH genes and showed 66.6% or
higher identity in the HCDR3 sequence, at the amino acid level (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Interestingly, clonotypes that were highly homologous to the E-3B1 nAb were found among
six of seven patients, with a total of 55 sequences among the isotypes IgG1 (Patient A, B, D,

E, F, and G), IgA1 (Patient E and G), and IgA2 (Patient E) (Supplementary Table 3). These
clonotypes shared nearly identical VH sequences (92.78% 1.40% identity at the amino acid
level), with E-3B1 displaying an extremely low frequency of somatic mutations (0.77%
0.93%). Among these 55 clonotypes, 22 unique HCDR3s were identified, at the amino acid
level, and eight unique HCDR3s existed in more than one patient. To test the reactivity of
clonotypes homologous to E-3B1 against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we arbitrarily sampled
12 IGH clonotypes (Fig. 1b), containing five different HCDR3s, from the IGH repertoires of
six patients. The genes encoding these IGH clonotypes were chemically synthesized and used
to construct scFv genes, using the Vλ gene from the E-3B1 clone. Then, the reactivities of
these scFv clones were tested in an enzyme immunoassay. Three clones (E-12, A-32, and B33) reacted against the recombinant S and RBD proteins (Fig. 1b). Then, scFv libraries were
constructed, using the A-11, A-31, E-34, A,B,G-42, G-44, D-51, F-53, E-52, and A-54 genes,
and the Vκ/Vλ genes were amplified from Patients A, E, and G. Consequently, we confirmed
that all 12 IGH clonotypes were reactive against both recombinant S and RBD proteins when
paired with eight different Vκ and Vλ genes (Fig. 1b,c). Moreover, all seven patients
possessed these Vκ/Vλ clonotypes with identical VJ gene usage and perfectly matched
LCDR3 amino acid sequences (Supplementary Fig. 7). In particular, IGLV2-14/IGLJ3,
IGLV3-19/IGLJ2, and IGLV3-21/IGLJ2 were frequently used across all seven patients
(Supplementary Fig. 8 and 9). Because E-3B1 effectively inhibited the replication of SARSCoV-2 (Fig. 1d), these 55 clonotypes are likely to neutralize the virus when paired with an
optimal light chain.
Among these IGH clonotypes, A,B,G-42 was quite unique, presenting no somatic mutations
and containing an HCDR3 (DLYYYGMDV) formed by the simple joining of IGHV3-53 and
IGHJ6. This naïve VH sequence existed in the IGH repertoire of three patients (A, B, and G),

as IgG1, IgG1, or IgG1 and IgA1 subtypes, respectively (Table 1). More interestingly, the IGH
clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6 that possessed an HCDR3
(DLYYYGMDV) with zero to one somatic mutation residues could be identified within the
IGH repertoire of six of 10 healthy individuals, predominantly as an IgM isotype (Table 1),
based on publicly available IGH repertoires 18. The A,B,G-42 clonotype showed light chain
plasticity and paired with five Vκ /Vλ genes to achieve RBD binding. In particular, the Vκ
gene (2J6H) accumulated only five somatic mutations (1.4% divergence). None of the 12
clones, including A,B,G-42, reacted against the recombinant RBD proteins from either
SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 10). In our prior experiment, none of the 37
identified MERS-RBD-binding human monoclonal antibodies, from two patients, were
encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6 (Supplementary Table 4) 19. Therefore, the
presence of these stereotypic-naïve IGH clonotypes in the healthy population, and their light
chain plasticity to achieve SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding, may be unique to SARS-CoV-2,
which might provide a rapid and effective humoral response to the virus among patients who
express these clonotypes. These findings provide the majority of the population possess
germline-precursor B cells, encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6, which can actively
initiate virus neutralization upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To further elucidate the preferential use of IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6 genes during the
generation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding antibodies, we extracted 252 predicted RBDbinding clones from our biopanning data (See Methods). We previously showed that antibody
clones with binding properties can be predicted by employing next-generation sequencing
(NGS) technology and analyzing the enrichment patterns of biopanned clones 20,21. Although
the IGHJ4 gene was more prominent in the IGH repertoires of the seven patients, similar to
healthy human samples 18,22, the predicted RBD-binding clones primarily used the IGHJ6

gene (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, the predicted RBD-binding clones showed the dominant usage
of IGHV3-53/IGHJ6 and IGHV3-66/IGHJ6 pairs, which was not observed in the whole IGH
repertoires of patients (Fig. 1f).
Naïve B cells typically undergo somatic hypermutations, clonal selection, and class-switching
following antigen exposure. We examined the chronological events that occurred in all IGH
clonotypes identified in patients and those that were reactive against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
We categorized RBD-reactive clones into three groups: neutralizing antibodies (neutralize),
binding-confirmed antibodies (bind), and binding-predicted antibodies (predicted). In all
three groups, these IGH clonotypes appeared and disappeared along the disease course and
showed a low frequency of somatic mutations (Fig. 2c,d) and rapid class-switching,
especially to IgG1, IgA1, and IgA2. In the entire IGH repertoire of the patients, naïve-derived
IGH clonotypes with minimal somatic mutations (< 2.695%  0.700%) showed increased
IgG3 and IgG1 subtypes, and the proportion of IgG1 subtype was dramatically increased for a
period (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 11). Furthermore, these naïve-derived IGH
clonotypes were detected as IgA1 and IgG2 subtypes in patients A and E, as minor
populations (Fig. 2a,b), and as the IgA2 subtype in Patient E (Fig. 2b). To summarize, RBDreactive IGH clonotypes rapidly emerged and underwent class-switching, to IgG1, IgA1, and
IgA2, without experiencing many somatic mutations. However, this dramatic temporal surge
of naïve IGH clonotypes, with rapid class-switching, occurred across the entire IGH
repertoire of patients and was not confined to those reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
Because several mutations within the RBD have been identified along the course of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, worldwide 23, we examined the probability of emerging escape
mutants from the IGH repertoire induced by the wild-type virus infection. Our E-3B1, A1H4, A-2F1, A-2H4, and E-3G9 nAbs successfully bound to recombinant mutant RBD

proteins (V341I, F342L, N354D/D364Y, V367F, A435S, W436R, G476S, and V483A) in a
dose-dependent manner, with compatible reactivity against recombinant wild-type RBD
protein (Supplementary Fig. 12). Therefore, the human IGH immune repertoire may provide
effective protection against most current SARS-CoV-2 mutants.
In response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, most human IGH repertoires efficiently generated
clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6, which could be paired with diverse
light chains, for both RBD binding and virus neutralization, with few to no somatic
mutations. These clonotypes underwent swift class-switching to IgG1, IgA1, and even IgA2
subtypes. The expeditious development of these IGH clonotypes would be possible because
the naïve-stereotypic IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6 clonotypes pre-exist in the majority
of the healthy population, predominantly as an IgM isotype. In line with our findings, several
groups have previously reported potent human nAbs, composed of either IGHV3-53 or
IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6 genes, using single B cell sequencing technology 9-13. Furthermore, the
crystal structures of two IHGV3-53 neutralizing antibodies were determined which showed
that two key motifs within HCDR1 and HCDR2 encoded in the IGHV3-53 germline are
making contact with RBD 24. Therefore, the preferential use of IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and
IGHJ6 in the development of nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 appeared prominent. From these
observations, we hypothesize that the existence of this unique, naïve IGH clonotype would
provide near-immediate protection to some people exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and a very
favorable clinical course, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. In addition, the chronological
follow-up of IGH clonotypes, encoded by the IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6 genes, along
with their class-switching events, would be valuable for the development of a safe and
effective vaccine.

Methods
Human samples. Three chronological blood samples were drawn from Patients A and E.
From Patients B, C, D, F, and G, two chronological samples were obtained. All patients were
confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 by a positive reverse transcriptase-quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) result, and sample collection was performed at Seoul
National University Hospital. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were
isolated using Lymphoprep (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The PBMCs were subjected to total RNA isolation, using the
TRI Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
study involving human sample collection was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review
Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB approval number: 2004-230-1119).

Next-generation sequencing (NGS). Genes encoding VH and part of the CH1 domain were
amplified, using specific primers, as described previously 18,25. All primers used are listed in
Supplementary Table 8. Briefly, total RNA was used as a template to synthesize cDNA,
using the Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen), with specific primers
targeting the constant region (CH1 domain) of each isotype (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE) 25,
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following cDNA synthesis, 1.8 volumes of SPRI
beads (AmpureXP, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) were used to purify cDNA, which
was eluted in 40 µL water. The purified cDNA (18 µL) was subjected to second-strand
synthesis in a 25-µL reaction volume, using V gene-specific primers 18 and KAPA
Biosystems (KAPA HiFi HotStart, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The PCR conditions were as
follows: 95°C for 3 min, 98°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 5 min. Following the
second-strand synthesis, double-strand DNA (dsDNA) was purified, using SPRI beads, as

described above. VH genes were amplified using 15 µ L eluted dsDNA and 2.5 pmol of the
primers listed in Supplementary Supplementary Table 8, in a 50-μL total reaction volume
(KAPA Biosystems), using the following thermal cycling program: 95°C for 3 min; 17 cycles
of 98°C for 30 sec, 65°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min 10 sec; and 72°C for 5 min. The
number of PCR cycles was increased, from 17 to 19, for samples from Patients B (d10 and
19), C (d6), E (d23), and G (d9 and 22). PCR products were purified using SPRI beads and
eluted in 30 µL water. Genes encoding Vκ and Vλ were amplified using specific primers, as
described previously 22,26. Briefly, total RNA was used as a template to synthesize cDNA,
using the Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen), with specific primers
targeting the constant region, which are listed in Supplementary Table 8, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Following cDNA synthesis, SPRI beads were used to purify cDNA,
which was eluted in 40 µL water. Purified cDNA (18 µL) was used for the first amplification,
in a 25-µL reaction volume, using VJ gene-specific primers, which are listed in
Supplementary Table 8, and KAPA Biosystems. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95°C
for 3 min, 4 cycles of 98°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min; and 72°C for 10
min. Subsequently, DNA was purified using SPRI beads, and the Vκ and Vλ genes were
amplified using 15 µL eluted dsDNA and 2.5 pmol of the primers listed in Supplementary
Table 8, in a 50-μL total reaction volume (KAPA Biosystems). The PCR conditions were as
follows: 95°C for 3 min; 17 cycles of 98°C for 30 sec, 65°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min
10 sec; and 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were purified using SPRI beads, as described
above. For the amplification of VH from each round of biopanning (rounds 0–4), gene
fragments were amplified from phagemid DNA, using the primers listed in Supplementary
Table 8. SPRI-purified sequencing libraries were quantified with a 4200 TapeStation System

(Agilent Technologies), using a D1000 ScreenTape Assay, before performing sequencing on
an Illumina MiSeq Platform.

NGS data processing
Pre-processing of the NGS data for the IG repertoire. The raw NGS forward (R1) and
reverse (R2) reads were merged by PEAR, v0.9.10, in default setting 27. The merged reads
were q-filtered using the condition q20p95, which results in 95% of the base-pairs in a read
having Phread scores higher than 20. The location of the primers was recognized from the qfiltered reads while allowing one substitution or deletion (Supplementary Table 8). Then,
primer regions that specifically bind to the molecules were trimmed in the reads, to eliminate
the effects of primer synthesis errors. Based on the primer recognition results, unique
molecular identifier (UMI) sequences were extracted, and the reads were clustered according
to the UMI sequences. To eliminate the possibility that the same UMI sequences might be
used for different read amplifications, the clustered reads were sub-clustered, according to the
similarity of the reads (Five mismatches were allowed in each sub-cluster). The sub-clustered
reads were aligned, using a multiple sequence alignment tool, Clustal Omega, v1.2.4, in
default setting 28,29. From the aligned reads, the frequency of each nucleotide was calculated,
and a consensus sequence of each sub-cluster was defined using the frequency information.
Then, the read count of the consensus sequence was re-defined as the number of UMI subclusters that belong to the consensus sequences.

Sequence annotation, functionality filtering, and throughput adjustment. Sequence
annotation consisted of two parts, isotype annotation and VDJ annotation. For annotation, the
consensus sequence was divided into two sections, a VDJ region and a constant region, in a
15

location-based manner. For isotype annotation, the extracted constant region was aligned
with the IMGT (international immunogenetics information system) constant gene database 30.
Based on the alignment results, the isotypes of the consensus sequences were annotated.
Then, the VDJ regions of the consensus sequences were annotated, using IgBLAST, v1.8.0
31

. Among the annotation results, V/D/J genes (V/J genes for VL), CDR1/2/3 sequences, and

the number of mutations from the corresponding V genes were extracted, for further analysis.
Divergence values were defined as the number of mutations identified in the aligned V gene,
divided by the aligned length. Then, the non-functional consensus reads were defined using
the following criteria and filtered-out: 1. sequence length shorter than 250 bp; 2. existence of
stop-codon or frame-shift in the full amino acid sequence; 3. annotation failure in one or
more of the CDR1/2/3 regions; and 4. isotype annotation failure. Then, the functional
consensus reads were random-sampled, to adjust the throughput of the VH data
(Supplementary Table 5). Throughput adjustment was not conducted for VL data
(Supplementary Table 6).

Pre-processing of the biopanning NGS data. Pre-processing of the biopanning NGS data
was performed as previously reported, except for the application of the q-filtering condition
q20p95 instead of q20p100 32.

Overlapping IGH repertoire construction. To investigate the shared IGH sequences among
the patients, we defined the overlapping IGH repertoire of the patients. First, histograms for
the nearest-neighbor distances of the HCDR3 amino acid sequences were calculated for the
repertoire data. A hierarchical, distance-based analysis, which was reported previously 33,
was applied to the HCDR3 amino acid sequences, to cluster the IGH sequences at a
16

functional level. The IGH sequences for all repertoire data could be approximated into a
bimodal distribution, allowing the functionally similar IGH sequences to be extracted by
capturing the first peak of the distribution (Supplementary Fig. 13). Threshold values for each
data set were defined as the nearest-neighbor distance value of those points with a minimum
frequency between the two peaks of the distribution. Then, the minimum value among all
threshold values, 0.113871, was used to construct the overlapping IGH repertoire, which
means that 11.3871% of mismatches in the CDR3 amino acid sequence were allowed in the
overlapping IGH repertoire construction. To construct the overlapping IGH repertoire, the
repertoire data sets of all patients were merged into one data set. The IGH sequences in the
merged data set were then clustered, using the following conditions: 1. the same V and J gene
usage; and 2. mismatch smaller than 11.3871% among the CDR3 amino acid sequences.
Subsequently, clusters containing IGH sequences from more than one patient were included
in the overlapping IGH repertoire data set.

Extraction of binding-predicted clones. From each round of biopanning (rounds 0, 2, 3, and
4), the VH genes were amplified and subjected to NGS analysis, using the MiSeq platform, as
described previously 21. Binding-predicted clones from biopanning were defined by
employing frequency the values of the NGS data from four libraries, A_d17, A_d45, E_d23,
and E_d44, at each round of biopanning. The enrichment of clones primarily occurred during
the second round of biopanning, based on the input/output virus titer values for each round of
biopanning and the frequencies of the clones in the NGS data (Supplementary Fig. 14). Then,
the frequency information in the NGS data sets for biopanning rounds 0, 2, 3, and 4 was
subject to principal component analysis (PCA), for dimension reduction. Accordingly,
principal component (PC)1 and PC2, which represented clone enrichment and clone

depletion, respectively, were extracted. In the biopanning data, PC1 was primarily composed
of the frequencies in rounds 2, 3, and 4, whereas PC2 was primarily composed of the
frequency in round 0 (Supplementary Fig. 15). Thus, we defined PC1-major clones as the
predicted clones, by setting constant threshold values on the PC1 value and the ratio between
PC1 and PC2 (Supplementary Table 7). Subsequently, 94.74% of the RBD-binding clones
were successfully mapped to the predicted clones (Supplementary Fig. 15).

Construction of a human scFv phage-display library and VL shuffled libraries. For the
VH gene, the cDNA prepared for the NGS analysis was used. For the VΚ and Vλ genes, total
RNA was used to synthesize cDNA, using the Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen), with oligo(dT) primers, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the
genes encoding VΚ/Vλ and VH were amplified, from the oligo(dT)-synthesized cDNA and the
cDNA prepared for NGS analysis, respectively, using the primers listed in Supplementary
Table 8 and KAPA Biosystems. The PCR conditions were as follows: preliminary
denaturation at 95°C for 3 min; 4 cycles of 98°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1
min; and 72°C for 10 min. Subsequently, DNA was purified using SPRI beads, as described
above. The purified DNA was amplified using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 8
and KAPA Biosystems. The PCR conditions were as follows: preliminary denaturation, at
95°C for 3 min; 25 cycles of 98°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 90 sec; and 72°C
for 10 min. Then, the VH and VΚ/Vλ fragments were subjected to electrophoresis, on a 1%
agarose gel, and purified, using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA,
USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified VH and VΚ/Vλ fragments
were mixed, at equal ratios at 50 ng, and subjected to overlap extension, to generate scFv
genes, using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 8 and KAPA Biosystems. The PCR

conditions were as follows: preliminary denaturation, at 94°C for 5 min; 25 cycles of 98°C
for 15 sec, 56°C for 15 sec, and 72°C for 2 min; and 72°C for 10 min. The amplified scFv
fragment was purified and cloned into a phagemid vector, as described previously 34.
For the construction of VΚ/Vλ shuffled libraries, gBlocks Gene Fragments (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA), encoding A-11, E-12, A-31, A-32, B-33, E-34, A,B,G42, G-44, D-51, F-53, E-52, and A-54, were synthesized. Synthesized VH and the VΚ/Vλ
genes from Patients A, E, and G were used to synthesize the scFv libraries using PCR, as
described previously 34. Then, the amplified scFv fragments were purified and cloned into the
phagemid vector, as described above.

Biopanning. A phage display of the human scFv libraries was subjected to four rounds of
biopanning against the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD proteins (Sino Biological Inc.,
Beijing, China), fused to mFc or hCκ, as described previously 35. Briefly, 3 µg of the
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was conjugated to 1.0 × 107 magnetic beads
(Dynabeads M-270 epoxy, Invitrogen) and incubated with the scFv phage-display libraries
(approximately 1012 phages), for 2 h at 37°C. During the first round of biopanning, the beads
were washed once with 500 µL 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST). For the other rounds of biopanning, 1.5 µg recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was conjugated to 5.0 × 106 magnetic beads, and the number of
washes was increased to three. After each round of biopanning, the bound phages were eluted
and rescued, as described previously 35.

Phage ELISA. To select SARS-CoV-2 S reactive clones, phage enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed, using recombinant S and RBD protein-coated

microtiter plates, as described previously 36. Reactive scFv clones were subjected to Sanger
sequencing (Cosmogenetech, Seoul, Republic of Korea), to determine their nucleotide
sequences.

Expression of recombinant proteins. A human, codon-optimized, SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(YP_009724390.1, amino acids 306–543) gene was synthesized (Integrated DNA
Technologies). Using a synthesized wild-type RBD gene as a template, RBD mutants (V341I,
F342L, N354D, N354D/D364Y, V367F, R408I, A435S, W436R, G476S, and V483A) were
generated through two-step PCR, using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 8. The
genes encoding wild-type or mutant SARS-CoV-2 RBD were cloned into a modified
mammalian expression vector, containing the hCκ gene 35, and transfected into Expi293F
(Invitrogen) cells. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography, using
KappaSelect Columns (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), as described previously 37. Due to
low expression yields, two RBD mutants (N354D/D364Y, W436R) were excluded from
further studies.
The genes encoding the selected scFv clones were cloned into a modified mammalian
expression vector, containing the hIgG1 Fc regions (hFc) or hCκ at the C-terminus 35,38,
before being transfected and purified by affinity chromatography, as described above.

ELISA. First, 100 ng of each recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S (Sino Biological Inc.), S1 (Sino
Biological Inc.), S2 (Sino Biological Inc.), NP (Sino Biological Inc.), RBD, RBD mutants,
SARS-CoV RBD (Sino Biological Inc.), MERS-CoV S (Sino Biological Inc.), RBD (Sino
Biological Inc.), S2 (Sino Biological Inc.) proteins were added to microtiter plates (Costar),
in coating buffer (0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.6). After incubation at 4°C, overnight, and

blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, for 1 h at 37°C, serially diluted
plasma (5-fold, 6 dilutions, starting from 1:100) or scFv-hFc (5-fold, 12 dilutions, starting
from 1,000 or 500 nM) in blocking buffer was added to individual wells and incubated for 1,
h at 37°C. Then, the plates were washed three times with 0.05% PBST. Horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-human Ig
kappa light chain antibody (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), in blocking buffer (1:5,000),
was added into wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing three times with PBST,
2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA) or 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system (ThermoFisher
Scientific Inc.) was added to the wells. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm or 650 nm,
using a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO; Thermo Scientific).

Flow cytometry. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein (200 nM), fused with a
polyhistidine tag at the C-terminus (Sino Biological Inc.), was incubated with scFv-hFc
fusion proteins at a final concentration of either 200 nM (equimolar) or 600 nM (morlar ratio
of 1:3), in 50 µL of 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS, containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide (FACS
buffer), at 37°C for 1 h. Irrelevant scFv-hFc or scFv-hCκ fusion proteins were used as
negative controls. Vero E6 cells (ACE2+) were seeded into v-bottom 96-well plates (Corning,
Corning, NY, USA), at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well. Then, the mixture was added to
each well and incubated, at 37°C for 1 h. After washing three times with FACS buffer, FITClabeled rabbit anti-HIS Ab (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was incubated, at 37°C for 1 h. Then,
the cells were washed three times with FACS buffer, resuspended in 150 µL of PBS, and
subjected to analysis by flow cytometry, using a FACS Canto II instrument (BD Bioscience,
San Jose, CA, USA). For each sample, 10,000 cells were assessed.

Microneutralization assay. The virus (BetaCoV/Korea/SNU01/2020, accession number
MT039890) was isolated at the Seoul National University Hospital and propagated in Vero
cells (ATCC CCL-81), using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Welgene,
Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) 39. The
cells were grown in T-25 flasks, (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.), inoculated with SARS-CoV2, and incubated at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 environment. Then, 3 days after inoculation, the
viruses were harvested and stored at -80°C. The virus titer was determined via a TCID50
assay 40.
Vero cells were seeded in T-25 flasks and grown for 24 h, at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 environment,
to ensure 80% confluency on the day of inoculation. The recombinant scFv-hCκ fusion
proteins (0.5, 5, or 50 µg/mL) were mixed with 2,500 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2, and the
mixture was incubated for 2 h, at 37°C. Then, the mixture (1 mL) was added to the Vero cells
and incubated for 1 h, at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 environment. After incubation for 1 h, 6 mL of
complete media was added to the flasks and incubated, at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 environment.
After 0, 24, 48, and 72 h of infection, the culture supernatant was collected, to measure the
virus titers. RNA was extracted, using the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA small volume
kit (Roche, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA was detected
using the PowerChek 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR Kit (Kogene Biotech, Seoul, Republic of
Korea), for the amplification of the E gene, and quantified according to a standard curve,
which was constructed using in vitro transcribed RNA, provided by the European Virus
Archive (https://www.european-virus-archive.com).
