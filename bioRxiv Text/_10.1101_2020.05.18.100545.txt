COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. T cells play a key role
in the adaptive antiviral immune response by killing infected cells and facilitating the selection of
virus-specific antibodies. However neither the dynamics and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2specific T cell response nor the diversity of resulting immune memory are well understood. In this
study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to track changes in
the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19. In both donors we identified CD4+
and CD8+ T cell clones with transient clonal expansion after infection. The antigen specificity of
CD8+ TCR sequences to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was confirmed by both MHC tetramer binding and
presence in large database of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCRs. We describe characteristic motifs
in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential occurence of these motifs in
publicly available large dataset of repertoires from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both
donors the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain T cell
clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection timepoint, suggesting participation
of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel
SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus [1]. T cells are crucial for
clearing respiratory viral infections and providing longterm immune memory [2, 3]. Two major subsets of T
cells participate in the immune response to viral infection in different ways: activated CD8+ T cells directly
kill infected cells, while subpopulations of CD4+ T cells
produce signaling molecules that regulate myeloid cell
behaviour, drive and support CD8 response and the formation of long-term CD8 memory, and participate in the
selection and affinity maturation of antigen specific Bcells, ultimately leading to the generation of neutralizing
antibodies. In SARS-1 survivors, antigen-specific memory T cells were detected up to 11 years after the initial infection, when viral-specific antibodies were undetectable [4, 5]. The T cell response was shown to be
critical for protection in SARS-1-infected mice [6]. Pa-

tients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a genetic disorder associated with lack of B cells, have been reported
to recover from symptomatic COVID-19 [7, 8], suggesting
that in some cases T cells are sufficient for viral clearance.
Theravajan et al. showed that activated CD8+HLADR+CD38+ T cells in a mild case of COVID-19 significantly expand following symptom onset, reaching their
peak frequency of 12% of CD8+ T cells on day 9 after symptom onset, and contract thereafter [9]. Given
the average time of 5 days from infection to the onset
of symptoms [10], the dynamics and magnitude of T cell
response to SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that observed after immunization with live vaccines [11]. SARS-CoV-2specific T cells were detected in COVID-19 survivors by
activation following stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 proteins [12], or by viral protein-derived peptide pools [13–
19]. Some of the T cells activated by peptide stimulation
were shown to have a memory phenotype [13, 16, 20], and
some potentially cross-reactive CD4+ T cells were found

in healthy donors [14, 18, 21, 22].
T cells recognise short pathogen-derived peptides presented on the cell surface of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) using hypervariable T cell receptors
(TCR). TCR repertoire sequencing allows for the quantitative tracking of T cell clones in time, as they go through
the expansion and contraction phases of the response. It
was previously shown that quantitative longitudinal TCR
sequencing is able to identify antigen-specific expanding and contracting T cells in response to yellow fever
vaccination with high sensitivity and specificity [23–25].
Not only clonal expansion but also significant contraction
from the peak of the response are distinctive traits of T
cell clones specific to the virus [24].
In this study we use longitudinal TCRalpha and TCRbeta repertoire sequencing to quantitatively track T cell
clones that significantly expand and contract after recovery from a mild COVID-19 infection, and determine
their phenotype. We reveal the dynamics and the phenotype of the memory cells formed after infection, identify pre-existing T cell memory clones participating in
the response, and describe public TCR sequence motifs
of SARS-CoV-2-reactive clones, suggesting a response to
immunodominant epitopes.

RESULTS
Longitudinal tracking of TCR repertoires of
COVID-19 patients

In the middle of March (day 0) donor W female and
donor M (male, both healthy young adults), returned to
their home country from the one of the centers of the
COVID-19 outbreak in Europe at the time. Upon arrival, according to local regulations, they were put into
strict self-quarantine for 14 days. On day 3 of selfisolation both developed low grade fever, fatigue and
myalgia, which lasted 4 days and was followed by a temporary loss of smell for donor M. On days 15, 30, 37,
45 and 85 we collected peripheral blood samples from
both donors (Fig. 1a). The presence of IgG and IgM
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the plasma was measured at all timepoints using SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD domain specific ELISA (Fig. S1). From each blood sample
we isolated PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
in two biological replicates), CD4+, and CD8+ T cells.
Additionally, on days 30, 45 and 85 we isolated four T
cell memory subpopulations (Fig. S2): Effector Memory
(EM: CCR7-CD45RA-), Effector Memory with CD45RA
re-expression (EMRA: CCR7-CD45RA+), Central Memory (CM: CCR7+CD45RA-), and Stem Cell-like Memory
(SCM: CCR7+CD45RA+CD95+). From all samples we
isolated RNA and performed TCRalpha and TCRbeta
repertoire sequencing as previously described [26]. For
both donors, TCRalpha and TCRbeta repertoires were
obtained for other projects one and two years prior to infection. Additionally, TCR repertoires of multiple sam-

ples for donor M – including sorted memory subpopulations – are available from a published longitudinal TCR
sequencing study after yellow fever vaccination (donor
M1 samples in [23]).

Two waves of T-cell clone response

From previously described activated T cell dynamics
for SARS-CoV-2 [9], and immunization with live vaccines [11], the peak of the T cell expansion is expected
around day 15 post-infection, and responding T cells significantly contract afterwards. However, Weiskopf et al.
[13] reports an increase of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells
at later timepoints, peaking in some donors after 30 days
following symptom onset. To identify groups of T cell
clones with similar dynamics in an unbiased way, we used
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the space of T
cell clonal trajectories (Fig. 1b and c). This exploratory
data analysis method allows us to visualize major trends
in the dynamics of abundant TCR clonotypes (occuring
within top 1000 on any post-infection timepoints) between multiple timepoints.
In both donors, and in both TCRalpha and TCRbeta
repertoires, we identified three clusters of clones with distinct dynamics. The first cluster (Fig. 1bc, purple) corresponded to abundant TCR clonotypes which had constant concentrations across timepoints, the second cluster (Fig. 1bc, green) showed contraction dynamics from
day 15 to day 85, and the third cluster (Fig. 1bc, yellow), showed an unexpected clonal expansion from day 15
with a peak on day 37 followed by contraction. The clustering and dynamics are similar in both donors and are
reproduced in TCRbeta (Fig. 1bc) and TCRalpha (Fig.
S3ab) repertoires. We next used edgeR, a software for
differential gene expression analysis [27] and NoisET, a
Bayesian differential expansion model [28], to specifically
detect changes in clonotype concentration between pairs
of timepoints in a statistically reliable way and without
limiting the analysis to the most abundant clonotypes.
Both NoisET and edgeR use biological replicate samples
collected at each timepoint to train a noise model for sequence counts. Results for the two models were similar
(Fig. S4) and we conservatively defined as expanded or
contracted the clonotypes that were called by both models simultaneously. We identified 291 TCRalpha and 295
TCRbeta clonotypes in donor W, and 607 TCRalpha and
616 TCRbeta in donor M significantly contracted from
day 15 to day 85 (largely overlapping with cluster 2 of
clonal trajectories, Fig. S5). 176 TCRalpha and 278
TCRbeta for donor W, and 293 TCRalpha and 427 TCRbeta clonotypes for donor M were significantly expanded
from day 15 to 37 (corresponding to cluster 3 of clonal
trajectories).
Note that, to identify putatively SARS-CoV-2 reactive
clones, we only used post-infection timepoints, so that
our analysis can be reproduced in other patients and
studies where pre-infection timepoints are unavailable.

FIG. 1. Longitudinal tracking of T cell clones after mild COVID-19. a, Study design. Peripheral blood of two donors
was sampled longitudinally on days 15, 30, 37, 45, 85 after arrival in Russia. At each timepoint, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2specific antibodies using ELISA (Fig. S1) and isolated PBMCs in two biological replicates. Additionally, CD4+ and CD8+
cells were isolated from a separate portion of blood, and EM, CM, EMRA, SCM memory subpopulations were FACS sorted on
days 30, 45 and 85. For each sample we sequenced TCRalpha and TCRbeta repertoires. For both donors pre-infection PBMC
repertoires were sampled in 2018 and 2019 for other projects. b,c, PCA of clonal temporal trajectories identifies three
groups of clones with distinctive behaviours. Left: first two principal components of the 1000 most abundant TCRbeta
clonotype frequencies normalized by maximum value for each clonotype in PBMC at post-infection timepoints. Color indicates
hierarchical clustering results of principal components; symbol indicates if clonotype was called as significantly contracted from
day 15 to day 85 (triangles), or expanded from day 15 to day 37 (circles) by both edgeR and NoisET (Fig. S5 shows overlap
between clonal trajectory clusters and edgeR/NoisET hits). Right: each curve shows the average ± 2.96 SE of normalized
clonal frequencies from each cluster. Contracting (d) and expanding (e) clones include both CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells, and are less abundant in pre-infection repertoires. T cell clones significantly contracted from day 15 to day 85
(d) and significantly expanded from day 15 to day 37 (e) were identified in both donors. The fraction of contracting (d)
and expanding (e) TCRbeta clonotypes in the total repertoire (calculated as the sum of frequencies of these clonotypes in the
second PBMC replicate at a given timepoint and corresponding to the fraction of responding cells of all T cells) is plotted in
log-scale for all reactive clones (left), reactive clones with the CD4 (middle) and CD8 (right) phenotypes. Similar dynamics
were observed in TCRalpha repertoires (Fig. S3), and for significantly expanded/contracted clones identified with the NoisET
Bayesian differential expansion statistical model alone (Fig. S4).

However, tracking the identified responding clones back
to pre-infection timepoints reveals strong clonal expansions from pre- to post-infection (Fig. 1de, Fig. S3cd).
For brevity, we further refer to clonotypes significantly
contracted from day 15 to 85 as contracting clones and
clonotypes significantly expanding from day 15 to 37 as
expanding clones. Contracting clones corresponded to
2.5% and 0.9% of T cells on day 15 post-infection, expanding clones reached 1.1% and 0.8% on day 37 for
donors M and W respectively (Fig. 1de, left). This
magnitude of the T cell response is of the same order
of magnitude as previously observed after live yellow

fever vaccine immunization of donor M (6.7% T cells
on day 15 post-vaccination). For each contracting and
expanding clone we determined their CD4/CD8 phenotype using separately sequenced repertoires of CD4+ and
CD8+ subpopulations (see Methods). Both CD4+ and
CD8+ subsets participated actively in the response (Fig.
1de). Interestingly, clonotypes expanding after day 15
were significantly biased towards the CD4+ phenotype,
while contracting clones had balanced CD4/CD8 phenotype fractions in both donors (Fisher exact test, p < 0.01
for both donors).

FIG. 2. Memory phenotypes of responding clonotypes contracting after day 15. a, A large fraction of contracting
clonotypes is identified in T cell memory subsets after infection. Bars show the fraction of contracting CD4+ and
CD8+ TCRbeta clonotypes present in 2-year; 1-year pre-infection PBMC; in at least one of memory subpopulation sampled on
day 30, day 37 and day 85 post infection. b,c Responding clones are found in different memory subsets. Fraction of
CD4+ (left panels) and CD8+ (right panels) contracting clones of donor W (b) and M (c) that were identified in each memory
subpopulation repertoire at each timepoint. For both donors, CD4+ clonotypes were found predominantly in Central Memory
(CM) and Effector Memory (EM), while CD8+ T cells were enriched in EMRA compartment.c, For donor M, CD4+ contracting
clonotypes are also identified in memory subsets 1 year before the infection, with a bias towards the CM subpopulation and a
group of CD8+ clones is found in the pre-infection EM subpopulation.

Memory formation and pre-existing memory

On days 30, 45 and 85 we identified both contracting
(Fig. 2a-c) and expanding (Fig. S6a-c) T cell clones in
the memory subpopulations of peripheral blood. Both
CD4+ and CD8+ responding clones were found in the
CM and EM subsets, however CD4+ were more biased
towards CM (with exception of donor W day 30 timepoint, where a considerable fraction of CD8+ clones were
found in CM), and CD8+ clones more represented in
the EMRA subset. A small number of both CD4+ and
CD8+ responding clonotypes were also identified in the
SCM subpopulation, which was previously shown to be
a long-lived T cell memory subset [29]. Note that we sequenced more cells from PBMC than from the memory
subpopulations (Table S1), so that some low-abundant
responding T cell clones are not sampled in the memory subpopulations. Intriguingly, a number of responding
CD4+ clones, and fewer CD8+ clones, were also represented in the repertoires of both donors 1 and 2 years
before the infection. Pre-existing clones were expanded
after infection, and contracted afterwards for both donors
(Fig. S7). For donor M, for whom we had previously
sequenced memory subpopulations before the infection
[23], we were able to identify pre-existing SARS-CoV-2reactive CD4+ clones in the CM subpopulation 1 year
before the infection and a group of CD8+ clones in the
pre-infection EM subpopulation. Interestingly, on day 30
after infection the majority of pre-infection CM clones
were detected in the EM subpopulation, suggesting recent T cell activation and a switch of the phenotype from
memory to effector. These clones might represent memory T cells cross-reactive for other infections, e.g. other
human coronaviruses.
A search for TCRbeta amino acid sequences of responding clones in VDJdb [30] — a database of TCRs

with known specificities — resulted in essentially no overlap with TCRs not specific for SARS-CoV-2 epitopes:
only two clonotypes matched. One match corresponded
to the CMV (cytomegalovirus) epitope presented by the
HLA-A*03 MHC allele, which is absent in both donors
(Table S2), and a second match was for Influenza A virus
epitope presented by HLA-A*02 allele. The absence of
matches suggests that contracting and expanding clones
are unlikely to be specific for immunodominant epitopes
of common pathogens covered in VDJdb. We next asked
if we could map specificites of our responding clones to
SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

Validation by MHC tetramer-staining assay

On day 25 post-infection donor M participated in
study by Shomuradova et al. [31] (as donor p1434),
where his CD8+ T cells were stained with HLA-A*02:01YLQPRTFLL MHC-I tetramer. TCRalpha and TCRbeta of FACS-sorted tetramer-positive cells were sequenced and deposited to VDJdb (see [31] for the experimental details). We matched these tetramer-specific
TCR sequences to our longitudinal dataset (Fig. 3a for
TCRbeta and Fig. S8 for TCRalpha). We found that
their frequencies were very low on pre-infection timepoints and monotonically decreased from their peak on
day 15 (7.1·10−4 fraction of bulk TCRbeta repertoire) to
day 85 (1.3 · 10−5 fraction), in close analogy to our contracting clone set. Among the tetramer positive clones
that were abundant on day 15 (with bulk frequency
> 10−5 ), 17 out of 18 or TCRbetas and 12 out of 15
TCRalphas were independently identified as contracting
by our method.

FIG. 3. a, SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs are independently identified by clonal contraction. Each dot corresponds to
the frequency of HLA-A*02:01-YLQPRTFLL-tetramer specific TCRbeta clonotype in bulk repertoire of donor M (donor p1434
from [31]) at each timepoint. Green dots correspond to clonotypes independently identified as contracting in our longitudinal
dataset. Blue line shows the cumulative frequency of tetramer specific TCRbeta clonotypes. b, c Analysis of TCR amino
acid sequences of contracting CD8+ clones reveals distinctive motifs. For each set of CD8alpha, and CD8beta
contracted clonotypes, we constructed a separate similarity network. Each vertex in the similarity network corresponds to a
contracting clonotype. An edge indicates 2 or less amino acid mismatches in the CDR3 region, and identical V and J segments.
Networks are plotted separately for CD8alpha (b) and CD8beta (c) contracting clonotypes. Clonotypes without neighbours
are not shown. Sequence logos corresponding to the largest clusters are shown under the corresponding network plots. ‘T’
on vertices indicate TCRbeta clonotypes confirmed by HLA-A*02:01-YLQPRTFLL tetramer staining. Shaded colored circles

[15] (MIRA peptide dataset). Lists of peptides in YLQ and ORF7b peptide pools are shown on the right. d, Sequence

TCR sequence motifs of responding clones

It was previously shown that TCRs recognising the
same antigens frequently have highly similar TCR sequences [32, 33]. To identify motifs in TCR amino acid
sequences, we plotted similarity networks for significantly
contracted (Fig. 3bc, Fig. 4ab) and expanded (Fig.
S9b-e) clonotypes. The number of edges in all similarity networks except CD8+ expanding clones was signif-

icantly larger than would expected by randomly sampling the same number of clonotypes from the corresponding repertoire (Fig. 3d and Fig. S9a). In both
donors we found clusters of highly similar clones in both
CD4+ and CD8+ subsets for expanding and contracting clonotypes. Clusters were largely donor-specific, as
expected, since our donors have dissimilar HLA alleles
(SI Table 1) and thus each is likely to present a nonoverlapping set of T cell antigens. The largest cluster, de-

scribed by the motif TRAV35-CAGXNYGGSQGNLIFTRAJ42, was identified in donor M’s CD4+ contracting alpha chains. Clones from this cluster constituted
16.3% of all of donor M’s CD4+ responding cells on day
15, suggesting a response to an immunodominant CD4+
epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The high similarity of the TCR sequences of responding clones in this
cluster allowed us to independently identify motifs from
donor M’s CD4 alpha contracting clones using the ALICE algorithm [34] (Fig. S10). While the time dependent
methods (Fig. 1) identify abundant clones, the ALICE
approach is complementary to both edgeR and NoisET
as it identifies clusters of T cells with similar sequences
independently of their individual abundances.

Mapping TCR motifs to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes

In CD8+ T cells, 3 clusters of highly similar TCRbeta clonotypes in donor M and one cluster of TCRalpha clonotypes correspond to YLQPRTFLL-tetramerspecific TCR sequences described above. To map additional specificities for CD8+ TCRbetas, we used a
large set of SARS-CoV-2-peptide specific TCRbeta sequences from [15] obtained using Multiplex Identification of Antigen-specific T cell Receptors Assay (MIRA)
with combinatorial peptide pools [36]. For each responding CD8+ TCRbeta we searched for the identical or highly similar (same VJ combination, up to
one mismatch in CDR3aa) TCRbeta sequences specific
for given SARS-CoV-2 peptides. A TCRbeta sequence
from our set was considered mapped to a given peptide if it had at least two highly similar TCRbeta sequences specific for this peptide in the MIRA experiment. This procedure yielded unambiguous matches
for 32 CD8+ TCRbetas — just one clonotype was
paired to two peptide pools (Table S3). The vast majority of matches to MIRA corresponded to groups of
contracting clones. As expected, we found that all
clusters corresponding to HLA-A*02:01-YLQPRTFLL
MHC-I tetramer-specific TCRs were matched to the peptide pool YLQPRTFL,YLQPRTFLL,YYVGYLQPRTF
in the MIRA dataset. Another large group of matches
corresponded to the HLA-B*15:01-restricted [37] NQKLIANQF epitope. Interestingly, clonotypes corresponging to this cluster together made up 21% of the CD8+
immune response on day 15, suggesting immunodominance of this epitope. Two TCRbeta clonotypes mapped
to this epitope were identified in Effector Memory subset one year before the infection, suggesting potential
cross-reactive response. We speculate, that this response
might be initially triggered by NQKLIANAF, a homologous HLA-B*15:01 epitope from HKU1 or OC43, common human betacoronaviruses. To predict potential pairings between TCRalpha and TCRbeta motifs, we used
a method of alpha/beta clonal trajectory matching described in [23] (see Methods for details). We found consistent pairing between one of the motifs in TCRalpha to

the largest motif in TCRbeta T cells, which is associated
to HLA-B*15:01-NQKLIANQF.

Validation of CD4+ COVID-19 HLA-restricted
specificity by cohort association analysis

At the time of writing, no data on TCR sequences
specific to MHC-II class epitopes exist to map specificities of CD4+ T-cells in a similar way as we did
with MIRA-specific TCRs. However, a recently published database of 1414 bulk TCRbeta repertoires from
COVID-19 patients allowed us to confirm the SARSCoV-2 specificity of contracting clones indirectly. Public TCRbeta sequences that can recognize SARS-CoV-2
epitopes are expected to be clonally expanded and thus
sampled more frequently in the repertoires of COVID-19
patients than in control donors. In Fig. 4cd we show
that the total frequency of TCRbeta sequences forming
the largest cluster in donor M (Fig. 4c) and donor W
(Fig. 4d) is significantly larger in the COVID-19 cohort
than in the healthy donor cohort from ref. [35], suggesting antigen-dependent clonal expansion. We hypothesized that the difference between control and COVID-19
donors in motif abundance should be even larger if we
restrict the analysis to donors sharing the HLA allele
that presents the epitope. Unfortunately, HLA-typing
information is not yet available for the COVID-19 cohort. However, using sets of HLA-associated TCRbeta
sequences from ref. [38], we could build a simple classifier to predict the HLA alleles of donors from both the
control and COVID-19 cohorts exploiting the presence
of TCRbeta sequences associated with certain HLA alleles (see Methods for details). We found that the CD4+
TCRbeta motif from donor W occurs preferentially in
donors predicted to have DRB1*07:01 allele, while the
motif from donor M appears to be associated with HLADRB1*03:01-DQB1*02:01 haplotype. The frequency of
sequences corresponding to these motifs can then be used
to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected donors with matching
HLA alleles (Fig. S11).

DISCUSSION

Using longitudinal repertoire sequencing, we identified
a group of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones that contract
after recovery from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our response timelines agree with T cell dynamics reported by
Theravajan et al. [9] for mild COVID-19, as well as with
dynamics of T cell response to live vaccines [11]. We further mapped the specificities of contracting CD8+ T cells
using sequences of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells identified
with tetramer staining in the same donor, and as well as
the large set of SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulated TCRbeta sequences from ref. [15]. For large CD4+ TCRbeta motifs we show strong association with COVID19 by analysing the occurence patterns and frequencies

FIG. 4. a, Analysis of TCR amino acid sequences of CD4+ contracting clones reveal distinctive motifs. Each
vertex in the similarity network corresponds to a contracting clonotype. An edge indicates 2 or less amino acid mismatches
in the CDR3 region (and identical V and J segments). Networks are plotted separately for CD4alpha (a), CD4beta (b),
contracting clonotypes. Clonotypes without neighbours are not shown. Sequence logos corresponding to the largest clusters are
shown under the corresponding network plots. c, d, Clonotypes forming the two largest motifs are significantly more clonally
expanded (p<0.001, one sided t-test) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients [15] than in a cohort of control donors [35]. Each
dot corresponds to the total frequency of clonotypes from motifs shaded on (b) in the TCRbeta repertoire of a given donor.
Colored dots show donors predicted to share HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele with donor W (c), or HLA-DRB1*03:01-DQB1*02:01
haplotype with donor M (d).

of these sequences in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, in both donors we also identified
a group of predominantly CD4+ clonotypes which expanded from day 15 to day 37 after the infection. One
possible explanation for this second wave of expansion is
the priming of CD4+ T cells by antigen-specific B-cells,
but there might be other mechanisms such as the migration of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells from lymphoid organs or bystander activation of non-SARS-CoV-2 specific
T cells. It is also possible that later expanding T cells
are triggered by another infection, simultaneously and
asymptomatically occurring in both donors around day
30. In contrast with the first wave of response identified
by contracting clones, for now we do not have confirmation that this second wave of expansion corresponds to
SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells. Accumulation of TCR sequences for CD4+ SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific T cells
may further address this question. We showed that a
large fraction of putatively SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell
clones are later found in memory subpopulations and
remain there at least 3 months after infection. Impor-

tantly, some of responding clones are found in long-lived
stem cell-like (SCM) memory subset, as also reported
for SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients in ref. [22]. A
subset of CD4+ clones were identified in pre-infection
central memory subsets, and a subset of CD8+ T cells
were found in effector memory. Among these are CD8+
clones recognising NQKLIANQF, an immunodominant
HLA-B*15:01 restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitope, for which
homologous epitope differing by 1 aa mismatch exists
in common human betacoronaviruses.
The presence
of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4+ T cells in healthy
individuals was recently demonstrated [14, 16–19, 21].
Our data further suggests that cross-reactive CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells can participate in the response in vivo. It
is interesting to ask if the presence of cross-reactive T
cells before infection is linked to the mildness of the disease (with predicted HLA-B*15:01 cross-reactive epitope
described above as a good starting point). Larger studies
with cohorts of severe and mild cases with pre-infection
timepoints are needed to address this question.

METHODS
Donors and blood samples

Peripheral blood samples from two young healthy adult
volunteers, donor W (female) and donor M (male) were
collected with written informed consent in a certified diagnostics laboratory. Both donors gave written informed
consent to participate in the study under the declaration of Helsinki. HLA alleles of both donors (Table S2)
were determined by an in-house cDNA high-throughput
sequencing method.

was isolated from each sample using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A universal
primer binding site, sample barcode and unique molecular identifier (UMI) sequences were introduced using
the 5’RACE technology with TCRalpha and TCRbeta
constant segment specific primers for cDNA synthesis.
cDNA libraries were amplified in two PCR steps, with
introduction of the second sample barcode and Illumina
TruSeq adapter sequences at the second PCR step. Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq platform (2x150bp read length).

TCR repertoire data analysis
SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD domain specific ELISA

An ELISA assay kit developed by the National Research Centre for Hematology was used for detection of
anti-S-RBD IgG according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The relative IgG level (OD/CO) was calculated by
dividing the OD (optical density) values by the mean OD
value of the cut-off positive control serum supplied with
the Kit (CO). OD values of d37, d45 and d85 samples
for donor M exceeded the limit of linearity for the Kit.
In order to properly compare the relative IgG levels between d30, d37, d45 and d85, these samples were diluted
1:400 instead of 1:100, the ratios d37:d30 and d45:d30
and d85:d30 were calculated and used to calculate the
relative IgG level of d37, d45 and d85 by multiplying d30
OD/CO value by the corresponding ratio. Relative antiS-RBD IgM level was calculated using the same protocol
with anti-human IgM-HRP conjugated secondary antibody. Since the control cut-off serum for IgM was not
available from the Kit, on Fig. S1b. we show OD values for nine biobanked pre-pandemic serum samples from
healthy donors.
Isolation of PBMCs and T cell subpopulations

PBMCs were isolated with the Ficoll-Paque density
gradient centrifugation protocol. CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells were isolated from PBMCs with Dynabeads CD4+
and CD8+ positive selection kits (Invitrogen) respectively. For isolation of EM, EMRA, CM and SCM
memory subpopulations we stained PBMCs with the following antibody mix: anti-CD3-FITC (UCHT1, eBioscience), anti-CD45RA-eFluor450 (HI100, eBioscience),
anti-CCR7-APC (3D12, eBioscience), anti-CD95-PE
(DX2, eBioscience). Cell sorting was performed on FACS
Aria III, all four isolated subpopulations were lysed with
Trizol reagent immediately after sorting.
TCR library preparation and sequencing

TCRalpha and TCRbeta cDNA libraries preparation
was performed as previously described in [26]. RNA

Raw data preprocessing. Raw sequencing data was
demultiplexed and UMI guided consensuses were built using migec v.1.2.7 [39]. Resulting UMI consensuses were
aligned to V and J genomic templates of the TRA and
TRB locus and assembled into clonotypes with mixcr
v.2.1.11 [40]. See Table S1 for the number of cells, UMIs
and unique clonotypes for each sample.
Identification of clonotypes with active dynamics. Principal component analysis (PCA) of clonal trajectories was performed as described before [23]. First we
selected clones which were present among the top 1000
abundant in any of post-infection PBMC repertoires, including biological replicates, i.e. considered clone abundant if it was found within top 1000 most abundant clonotypes in at least one of the replicate samples at one timepoint. Next, for each such abundant clone we calculated
its frequency at each post-infection timepoint and divided
this frequency by the maximum frequency of this clone
for normalization. Then we performed PCA on the resulting normalized clonal trajectory matrix and identified
three clusters of trajectories with hierarchical clustering
with average linkage, using Euclidean distances between
trajectories. We identify statistically significant contractions and expansions with edgeR as previously described
[24], using FDR adjusted p < 0.01 and log2 fold change
threshold of 1. NoisET implements the Bayesian detection method described in [28]. Briefly, a two-step noise
model accounting for cell sampling and expression noise
is inferred from replicates, and a second model of expansion is learned from the two timepoints to be compared.
The procedure outputs the posterior probability of expansion or contraction, and the median estimated log2
fold change, whose thresholds are set to 0.05 and 1 respectively.
Mapping of COVID-19 associated TCRs to
the MIRA database. TCRbeta sequences from T
cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools MIRA (ImmuneCODE release 2) were downloaded from https:
//clients.adaptivebiotech.com/pub/covid-2020. V
and J genomic templates were aligned to TCR nucleotide
sequences from the MIRA database using mixcr 2.1.11.
We consider a TCRbeta from MIRA matched to a TCRbeta from our data, if it had the same V and J and at

most one mismatch in CDR3 amino acid sequence. We
consider a TCRbeta sequence mapped to an epitope if it
has at least two identical or highly similar (same V, J and
up to one mismatch in CDR3 amino acid sequence) TCRbeta clonotypes reactive for this epitope in the MIRA
database.
Computational alpha/beta pairing by clonal
trajectories. Computational alpha/beta pairing was
performed as described in [23]. For each TCRbeta we determine the TCRalpha with the closest clonal trajectory
(Tables S3 and S5). We observe no stringent pairings
between TCRbeta and TCRbeta motifs with exception
of two contracting CD8 TCRbeta clusters: TRBV72/TRBJ1-2 NQKLIANQF-associated clones from donor
M paired to TRAV21/TRAJ40 alphas from the same
cluster
(CASSLEDTNYGYTF-CAVHSSGTYKYIF
and CASSLEDTIYGYTF-CAALTSGTYKYIF), and
TRBV7-9/TRBJ2-3 beta cluster paired to largest alpha
cluster (CASSPTGRGRTDTQYF-CAYRSGGSEKLVF
and CASSPTGRGGTDTQYF-CAYRRPGGEKLTF).
Computational prediction of HLA-types. To
predict HLA-types from TCR repertoires of COVID-19
cohort we used sets of HLA-associated TCR sequences
from [38]. We use TCRbeta repertoires of 666 donors
from cohort from [35], for which HLA-typing information
is available in ref. [38] as a training set to fit logistic regression model, where presence or absense of given HLAallele is an outcome, and the number of allele-associated
sequences in repertoire, as well as the total number of
unique sequences in the repertoire, are the predictors.

A separate logistic regression model was fitted for each
set of HLA-associated sequences from ref. [38], and then
used to predict the probability p that a donor from the
COVID-19 cohort has this allele. Donors with p < 0.2
were considered negative for a given allele.

FIG. S3. Longitudinal tracking of T cell clones after mild COVID-19 with TCRalpha repertoire sequencing.
a,b, PCA of clonal temporal trajectories identifies three groups of clones with distinctive behaviours. Left:
first two principal components of the 1000 most abundant TCRalpha clonotype frequencies normalized by maximum value for
each clonotype in PBMC at post-infection timepoints. Color indicates hierarchical clustering results of principal components;
symbol indicates if clonotype was called as significantly contracted from day 15 to day 85 (triangles), or expanded from day 15
to day 37 (circles) by both edgeR and NoisET (Fig. S5 shows overlap between clonal trajectory clusters and edgeR/NoisET
hits). Right: each curve shows the average ± 2.96 SE of normalized clonal frequencies from each cluster. Contracting (c) and
expanding (d) clones include both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and are less abundant in pre-infection repertoires.
T cell clones significantly contracted from day 15 to day 85 (c) and significantly expanded from day 15 to day 37 (d) were
identified in both donors. The fraction of contracting (c) and expanding (d) TCRalpha clonotypes in the total repertoire
(calculated as the sum of frequencies of these clonotypes in the second PBMC replicate at a given timepoint and corresponding
to the fraction of responding cells of all T cells) is plotted in log-scale for all reactive clones (left), reactive clones with the CD4
(middle) and CD8 (right) phenotypes.

FIG. S4. Comparison of edgeR and NoisET clonal expansion detection procedures. The fraction (plotted in the
log-scale) of contracting (a) and expanding (d) TCRbeta clonotypes in the total repertoire was estimated using subsets of
expanded and contracted clones called by edgeR (green) and NoisET (purple) models. Overlaps for contracted clones (b,c)
and expanded clones (e,f ) identified by both models are shown on the right.

FIG. S5. The overlap between clusters of clonal trajectories identified by PCA and groups of expanding/contracting clones identified with edgeR/NoisET. For each cluster of clonal trajectories identified on Fig. 1bc.
and Fig. S3ab we show overlap with groups of significantly (called by edgeR and NoisET simultaneously) expanding clonotypes
from day 15 to day 37 in yellow, significantly contracting clonotypes from day 15 to day 85 in green, other clonotypes are
shown in purple (”stable” clonotypes which were not called significant by edgeR and NoisET simultaneously). Bar heights
show fraction of abundant clonotypes in PCA cluster overlapping with expanding/contracting/non-significant groups called by
edgeR/NoisET, raw number of overlapping clonotypes is shown inside bars.

FIG. S6. Memory phenotypes of responding clonotypes expanding from day 15 to day 37. a, A fraction of expanding clonotypes is identified in T cell memory subsets after infection. Bars show the fraction of expanding CD4+
and CD8+ TCRbeta clonotypes present in 2-year; 1-year pre-infection PBMC; and in at least one of memory subpopulation
sampled on day 30 and day 37 post infection. b, Responding clones are found in different memory subsets. For both
W (b) and M (c) donors, CD4+ clonotypes were found predominantly in Central Memory (CM) and Effector Memory (EM),
while CD8+ T cells were also present in EMRA.

FIG. S9. a, Expanding CD4+ (but not CD8+) clonotypes show unexpected TCRalpha and TCRbeta sequence
convergence. For each set of CD4alpha, CD4beta, CD8alpha and CD8beta expanded clonotypes, we constructed separate
similarity networks. Each vertex in the similarity network corresponds to an expanding clonotype. An edge indicates 2 or less
amino acid mismatches in the CDR3 region, and identical V and J segments. The number of edges in each group is shown
by pink dots and is compared to the distribution of that number in 1000 random samples of the same size from the relevant
repertoires at day 37 (blue boxplots). b, c, d, e Analysis of TCR amino acid sequences of expanding clones reveal
distinctive motifs. Networks are plotted separately for CD8alpha (b) and CD8beta (c) CD4alpha (d) and CD4beta (e)
expanding clonotypes. Clonotypes without neighbours are not shown. Sequence logos corresponding to the largest clusters are
shown under the corresponding network plots.

FIG. S10. ALICE algorithm output for TCRalpha PBMC repertoire of donor M on day 15. Similarity network
shows ALICE hits (clones in repertoire with more neighbours than expected by chance), which differ by 2 mismatches or less in
TCRalpha amino acid sequence. Darker colors indicate larger frequency of clone in the repertoire, vertex size indicates degree.
The majority (54%, 99/183) of hits identified by the algorithm correspond to a single large TRAV35/TRAJ42 cluster of CD4+
contracting clones also seen on Fig. 4a.
