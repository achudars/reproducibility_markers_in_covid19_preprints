Abstract

22

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is the core machinery

23

responsible for the viral genome replication and transcription and also a major antiviral

24

target. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a post-translocated

25

SARS-CoV-2 RdRp core complex, comprising one nsp12, one separate nsp8(I) monomer,

26

one nsp7-nsp8(II) subcomplex and a replicating RNA substrate. Compared with the

27

recently reported SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complexes, the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface in this RdRp

28

complex shifts away from the nsp12 polymerase. Further functional characterizations

29

suggest that specific interactions between the nsp8(I) and nsp7, together with the

30

rearrangement of nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, ensure the efficient and processive RNA

31

synthesis by the RdRp complex. Our findings provide a mechanistic insight into how

32

nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors regulate the polymerase activity of nsp12 and suggest a potential

33

new intervention interface, in addition to the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp

34

for antiviral design.

Author summary

38

Since it was first discovered and reported in late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019

39

(COVID-19) pandemic caused by highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is wreaking

40

havoc around the world. Currently, no highly effective and specific antiviral drug is

41

available for clinical treatment. Therefore, the threat of COVID-19 transmission

42

necessitates the discovery of more effective antiviral strategies. Viral RNA-dependent

43

RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important antiviral drug target. Here, our cryo-EM

44

structure of a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/RNA replicating complex reveals a previously

45

uncharacterized overall shift of the cofactor nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, leading to its

46

rearrangement. Through in vitro functional test, we found that the specific interactions on

47

the interface are important to the efficient RNA polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2

48

RdRp. These observations let us to suggest this interface as a potential new drug

49

intervention site, outside of the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp for antiviral

50

design. Our findings would provide new insights into regulatory mechanism of this novel

51

SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, contribute to the design of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and

52

benefit the global public health.

INTRODUCTION

54

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the

55

causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has resulted in a

56

worldwide pandemic with over 15 million infections [1-4]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped,

57

positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. As a new member of Betacoronavirus genus,

58

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more transmissible than other members [5-7]. The threat of

59

COVID-19 pandemic demands a prompt effective antiviral strategy.

60

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is the key machinery

61

responsible for the viral RNA synthesis, and thus has become a promising target for

62

nucleoside analogue inhibitors, such as Remdesivir and EIDD-2801 [8-10]. The RdRp

63

complex of SARS-CoV-2 comprises the core catalytic non-structural protein (nsp) 12,

64

and the cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 that reinforce the RNA template binding and processive

65

RNA synthesis [11, 12]. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the

66

SARS-CoV-2 apo RdRp and RdRp/RNA complexes [13-17] have revealed that their

67

overall architectures are highly similar to that of SARS-CoV RdRp [11]. Here we present

68

the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex in post-translocation state during

69

viral RNA synthesis at near-atomic resolution. The structure reveals a previously

70

uncharacterized overall rearrangement of nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, which is critical to RNA

71

synthesis in in vitro transcription assays, and suggests a potential new antiviral

72

intervention site.

RESULTS

74

Overall architecture of RdRp/RNA complex

75

To obtain the target structure, we incubated the individually purified nsp12, nsp7 and

76

nsp8

77

adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) to allow one nucleotide to be incorporated into the 3′

78

end of the primer chain. The resulting RdRp/RNA complex was used in cryo-EM

79

imaging and structural determination. More than 4 million initial particles were

80

automatically picked from 4,750 micrograph movies and 123,246 particle projections

81

were used to reconstruct the final overall 3.4 Å resolution density map of the complex

82

(S1 Fig and S1 Table).

83

The structure of RdRp/RNA complex contains one nsp12, one nsp7 and two nsp8

84

subunits, nsp8(I) and nsp8(II), and displays similar overall configuration to that observed

85

in the recently reported structures (Fig 1A-1C) [13, 15]. The cryo-EM map contains

86

unambiguous density for most parts of nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 except for the N-terminal 88

87

residues of nsp12, N-terminal 77 residues of nsp8(I), C-terminal 20 residues of nsp7, and

88

167 residues of nsp8(II), which are not modeled in the cryo-EM map due to poor density

89

(Fig 1A-1C and S2A-S2C Fig). The nsp12 protein comprises an N-terminal β-hairpin

90

(residues 29-50) [13] and a nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain

91

(NiRAN, residues 84-249) [18], which is connected by an interface domain (residues

92

250-365) to the polymerase domain (residues 366-918). Like RdRps from other RNA

93

viruses, nsp12 polymerase domain adopts an encircled right hand architecture with

94

fingers (residues 366-581 and 621-679), palm (residues 582-620 and 680-815) and thumb

95

(residues 816-918) subdomains surrounding the active site (Fig 1B and 1C) [19, 20]. The

96

encircled polymerase domains are further stabilized by nsp8(I) subunit and nsp7-nsp8(II)

97

subcomplex. The nsp8(I) sits upon the fingers and interface domains, and nsp7-nsp8(II)

98

subcomplex presses part of the index finger (residues 408-446 of nsp12) against the

99

thumb domain (Fig 1C). The template-primer RNA duplex is held in the RNA exit

100

channel by an extended loop from the fingers domain and an α-helix from the thumb

101

domain (Fig 1C). This RNA-binding mode is also adopted by other positive-sense RNA

102

virus RdRps [21-23].

103

A post-translocated catalytic active site

104

The catalytic core of nsp12 polymerase domain is formed by motifs A-G (Fig 1D and

105

S2D-S2F Fig), which have the conserved spatial arrangement for all viral RdRps [24, 25].

106

Residue D618 of motif A and residues D760 and D761 of motif C are involved in the

107

coordination of catalytic magnesium ions. The observed active site in this RdRp/RNA

108

complex is in a post-translocation state, in which the polymerase active site contains one

109

magnesium ion that is coordinated by carboxyl groups of residues D618 and D761 (Fig

110

2A). The magnesium ion was not built in the recent post-translocated SARS-Cov-2

111

RdRp/RNA complex [17] (Fig 2B). The position of Mg2+ in this study is spatially similar

112

to that in Enterovirus 71 (EV71) RdRp/RNA post-translocated elongation complex (Fig

6

113

2C) [22]. By contrast, two catalytic magnesium ions are coordinated by the three active

114

site aspartate residues in the pre-translocated SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/RNA/Remdesivir

115

complex [15] (Fig 2D) and the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp/RNA/Sofosbuvir complex

116

(Fig 2E) [26], whereas in the apo RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 [13], no divalent cation was

117

identified in the active site (Fig 2F) and three aspartate residues adopt different rotamer

118

conformations compared to those in the RNA-bound complexes. These structures suggest

119

an evolutionarily conserved nucleotide addition mechanism by utilizing two divalent

120

cations for all polymerases, which are important for drug design targeting viral RdRps

121

[27].

122

Structural comparisons reveal rearrangement of nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface

123

Structural comparison between this RdRp/RNA complex and SARS-CoV-2 apo RdRp

124

(PDB 6M71) [13] reveals a relatively stable overall conformation of the polymerase

125

throughout the nucleotide addition cycle (Fig 3A), which was also observed in other viral

126

RdRps [26, 28]. One evident difference in the polymerase structures between the

127

RNA-bound form and the apo form is the outward movement of the thumb subdomain. In

128

particular, the outmost α-helix shifts by ~2.4 Å, slightly widening the RNA exit channel

129

to accommodate the RNA duplex (Fig 3A). Notably, a ~3.1 Å movement of the

130

nsp7-nsp8(II) subcomplex away from RdRp polymerase domain and an accompanying

131

~2.5 Å outward movement of the nsp8(I) C-terminal portion on the interface (Fig 3B) in

132

this post-translocated complex lead to a rearranged interface between nsp8(I) and nsp7

134

complex

135

RdRp/RNA/Remdesivir complex (PDB 7BV2) [15] (Fig 3D). Structural comparisons of

136

the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interfaces among the different SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/RNA complexes [13,

137

15-17] by superimposition on the nsp7 also reveal shifts of nsp8(I) relative to nsp7 by

138

~1-2 Å (S3A-S3D Fig), suggesting the slight opening of the interface in this structure.

139

The nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface plays a critical role in RNA synthesis

140

In the apo RdRp structure (PDB 6M71) [13], residue D163 of nsp8(I) is hydrogen bonded

141

with the main-chain nitrogen atom of S26 in nsp7, and K27 of nsp7 forms a hydrogen

142

bond with the main-chain carbonyl group of P178 in nsp8(I). However, these interactions

143

are abolished by the structural rearrangements of both nsp8(I) subunit and nsp7-nsp8(II)

144

subcomplex in the post-translocated complex (Fig 3C). Further sequence alignment

145

showed that these two residues D163 (nsp8(I)) and K27 (nsp7) are highly conserved in

146

coronaviruses from all four genera (S4 Fig). Alanine substitutions of either D163 (nsp8(I))

147

or K27 (nsp7), which are supposed to weaken the interactions between nsp8(I) and nsp7

148

(Fig 4A) significantly decreased their abilities to activate the polymerase activity of

149

nsp12 on a 5′ U10 RNA hybrid [15] (Fig 4B and 4C). In addition, replacing the alanine

150

residue at 162 position by lysine (A162K) or at 181 position by asparagine (A181N) in

151

nsp8, both of which are supposed to strengthen the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interaction through

152

hydrogen bonds with S26 of nsp7 (Figs 3C and 4A), also showed decreased RNA

153

extension activity (Fig 4D), suggesting an intricate regulation of nsp8(I)/nsp7 interaction

154

to nsp12 activity. Addition of nsp7 and nsp8 proteins strongly increased the binding of

155

RdRp complex to RNA hybrid [12] (S5A Fig), and none of the mutated nsp7 and nsp8

156

cofactors significantly influenced the RNA-binding affinity, as similar concentration of

157

RdRp wild-type or mutated complex was required for shifting RNA (Fig 4E and 4F).

158

Similarly, the decreases in RNA extension activities caused by interfering nsp8(I)/nsp7

159

interactions were also observed in the analyses based on a short RNA substrate (S5B and

160

S5C Fig). Summarily, these results suggest that the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface plays a critical

161

role in stabilizing the polymerase domain and ensuring the processive RNA synthesis.

163

DISCUSSION

164

Since the short RNA duplex used in this study does not make direct contacts with

165

cofactors nsp8 or nsp7 in the complex, the observed rearrangement in nsp8(I)/nsp7

166

interface is likely triggered by the minor conformational change of thumb domain during

167

the polymerization reaction (Fig 3A). In addition, structural comparison of several

168

reported nsp7-nsp8 heterodimers [29, 30] demonstrates that the N-terminal extension of

169

nsp8 is highly flexible (S6 Fig), which may explain its invisibility in most coronavirus

170

RdRp structures [11, 13, 15]. The invisible N-terminal extensions of nsp8 in this complex

171

might contact the polymerase domain and thus allosterically transmit the motion in the

172

polymerase domain to the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface. Two recent studies presented structures

173

of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/RNA replicating complex in which the nsp8 helical extensions

174

stabilize the exiting RNA and act as a ‘sliding poles’ to enable processive elongation of

175

the long genome [16, 17]. As RNA elongates and exits from the channel, the stabilizing

176

‘sliding poles’ likely undergo some periodic movements during the processive RNA

177

synthesis. Such movements could be transmitted to the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface during

178

nucleotide addition cycle. In the pre-translocated RdRp/RNA/Remdesivir complex, the

179

nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface also exhibits similar movement, although to a lesser extent,

180

compared to the apo RdRp [15], suggesting this movement might be necessary during

181

multiple steps of the polymerization cycle.

182

Based on these structural and biochemical data, it is likely that a moderate interface

183

between nsp8(I) and nsp7 may facilitate the formation of a relatively stable polymerase

184

core and concurrently allow for certain flexibility of the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, which are

185

critical for highly efficient and processive RNA synthesis. This nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface

186

rearrangement appears to be translocation-coupled during nucleotide addition cycle and

187

leads to a different interface between nsp8(I) and nsp7 subunits. Thus, we suggest that the

188

nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface is an important regulatory site for RNA polymerase activity of

189

RdRp, and this regulation mechanism might also be applicable to other coronaviruses due

190

to the conservation in sequence and structure. In addition, small-molecule antiviral agents

191

targeting this regulatory site of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex hold advantages in

192

specificity

193

anti-coronavirus potencies are undermined by the 3′ to 5′ proofreading exoribonuclease

194

nsp14 [31]. Therefore, our findings elucidate new aspects of the mechanisms governing

SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and suggest an alternative approach to target the viral

MATERIALS AND METHODS

199

Protein expression and purification

200

The full-length genes of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 (residues 1-83), nsp8 (residues 1-198) and

201

nsp12 (residues 1-932) (GenBank accession number MN908947) were all chemically

202

synthesized with codon optimization (S2 Table) (GENEWIZ). The −1 ribosomal

203

frameshifting that naturally occurs in virus to produce nsp12 was corrected in the

204

synthesized gene to express nsp12 protein. The genes were cloned (S3 Table) into

205

pET21a vector containing a C-terminal 6×His-tag. Mutations in nsp7 and nsp8 coding

206

region in pET21a constructs were introduced following the Quickchange site-directed

207

mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). All constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli

208

BL21(DE3) competent cells. The cells were grown in LB medium with 100 µg/mL

209

ampicillin at 37 °C. After the OD600 reached 0.6, the culture was supplemented with 0.5

210

mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce protein expression at 16 °C

211

for 16-18 h. The bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis

212

buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5% (v/v)

213

glycerol, lysed by ultrasonication and then centrifuged at 80,000 g for 1 h using a

214

T29-8x50 fixed angle rotor (Sorvall LYNX 6000 superspeed centrifuge, Thermo

215

Scientific). The recombinant proteins were purified through 5 mL HisTrap HP column

216

(GE Healthcare), and the eluted protein was further purified through 5 mL HiTrap Q HP

217

column (GE Healthcare). Finally, the protein was applied to a gel filtration column, 120

218

mL HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris

219

pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2. Purified proteins were concentrated to about 5

220

mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C until use.

221

Assembly of RdRp/RNA complex

222

For assembling the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8/RNA complex, 5 µM purified nsp12 was incubated

223

with nsp7, nsp8 and self-annealing RNA (RNA1, S3 Table) at a molar ratio of 1:2.5:2.5:3

224

at 30 °C for 10 minutes and then 4 °C overnight, in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl,

225

pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2, 4 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) and 100 µM ATP.

226

Cryo-EM grid preparation and data acquisition

227

In total, 3.5 µl of the assembled complex was applied on Quantifoil R2/2 200 mesh Cu

228

grids (EM Sciences) glow-discharged at 15 mA for 60 sec. The grid was then blotted for

229

3 sec at 4 °C under the condition of 100% chamber humidity, and plunge-frozen in liquid

230

ethane using a Vitrobot mark IV (FEI). The grids were imaged using a 300 keV Titan

231

Krios microscope (FEI) equipped with a Falcon III direct electron detector (FEI) at The

232

Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota. Data were collected in counted mode with a

233

pixel size of 0.89 Å and a defocus range from −1.0 to −2.4 µm using EPU (FEI). Each

234

micrograph consists of 30 dose-framed fractions and was recorded with a dose rate of 0.8

235

e-/pixel/sec (1 e-/Å2/sec). Each fraction was exposed for 1 sec, resulting in a total

236

exposure time of 30 sec and the total dose of 30 e-/Å2.

238

Cryo-EM data were processed using cryoSPARC v2.15 [32], and the procedure is

239

outlined in S1A Fig. A total of 4,750 movies were collected. Beam-induced motion and

240

physical drift were corrected followed by dose-weighting using the Patch motion

241

correction [33]. The contrast transfer functions (CTFs) of the summed micrographs were

242

determined using Patch CTF estimation [34]. From the summed images, particles were

243

then automatically picked using Blob picker with the parameters: minimum particle

244

diameter (60 Å) and maximum particle diameter (120 Å). In total, 4,052,050 particles

245

were picked with a 216 pixels of box size. Three rounds of 2D classifications were

246

performed to remove junk particles. Particles in good 2D classes (S1B Fig) were selected

247

to generate multiple initial models using Ab-initio Reconstruction with five initial models

248

for one calculation job and three initial ones for another job. The 20 Å low pass filtered

249

initial models were set as the starting references for heterogeneous refinement (3D

250

classification) in cryoSPARC v2.15. Particles in the best 3D classes from the two jobs

251

were selected to perform homogeneous refinement, respectively. Particles from two

252

homogeneous refinements were combined with duplicate particles removed using the

253

Particle Sets Tool in cryoSPARC v2.15, and were subjected to a final non-uniform

254

refinement in cryoSPARC v2.15. Fourier shell correlation (FSC) at the 0.143 cutoff

255

resulted in an overall 3.4 Å resolution for the map (S1C Fig) [35]. Local resolution

256

variation was estimated from the two half-maps in cryoSPARC v2.15 (S1D Fig).

258

The initial model was generated by docking the individual domains of the apo RdRp of

259

SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID 6M71) into the cryo-EM density map using Chimera [36] and

260

COOT [37]. The 3.4 Å cryo-EM density map allowed us to individually dock nsp12, nsp7

261

and nsp8 and manually build RNA duplex, followed by iterative cycles of manual

262

adjustment using COOT. The RNA building was performed using the map at a lower

263

contour than that of protein portion due to a lower occupancy of RNA substrate. Only one

264

base overhang is present on the template RNA strand, therefore we built one nucleotide

265

(ATP) incorporated to the 3′ end of primer on the basis that the assembled RdRp complex

266

is active for in vitro analysis. The two base overhang on the primer RNA strand was not

267

built due to poor density. The intact model was then refined using real_space_refine in

268

Phenix [38]. In the real-space refinement, minimization global, local grid search, and adp

269

were performed with the secondary structure, rotamer, and Ramachandran restrains

270

applied throughout the entire refinement. The final model has good stereochemistry as

271

evaluated by MolProbity [39]. 3DFSC calculation [40] shows the cryo-EM map has a

272

sphericity value of 0.715, suggesting the map did sample majority of the angular space

273

despite the minor preferred orientation problem (S1E Fig). The split cryo-EM maps were

274

generated using color zone with 1.5 Å coloring radius in volume viewer of Chimera [36].

275

Map reconstruction quality was also evaluated by Mtriage [41] in Phenix (S1F Fig). The

276

statistics of cryo-EM data collection, 3D reconstruction and model refinement were

277

shown in S1 Table. All figures were created using ChimeraX [42].

RdRp enzymatic activity assay

279

To anneal the RNA duplex, RNA primer and template were mixed at equimolar ratios (2

280

µM) in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl), which was denatured at

281

95 °C for 5 min and then cooled slowly to 16 °C. The purified nsp12 (1 µM) was mixed

282

with nsp7 and nsp8 proteins at the ratio of 1:1:2 to form RdRp complex, which was

283

incubated with 0.2 µM RNA duplex in Reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10

284

mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT at 30 °C for 5 min. To initiate RNA extension, 200

285

µM ATP was added into the reaction using a 5′ U10 RNA duplex as template and NTP

286

containing 200 µM ATP, 200 µM UTP and 1 µCi of [α-32P]GTP was added into reaction

287

using short RNA duplex. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min,

288

and 10 min, equal volume of Stop buffer (95% formamide, 30 mM EDTA) was added.

289

RNA products were heated at 70 °C for 5 min and then analyzed on denaturing 20%

290

Urea-PAGE. The FAM-labeled products were imaged via Amersham Typhoon scanner

291

(GE

292

phosphorimaging.

293

Gel mobility shift assay

294

For gel shift assay, RdRp complex was assembled as described in enzymatic activity

295

analysis. After that, RdRp complexes at concentrations of 200 nM, 400 nM and 800 nM

296

were incubated with 100 nM of FAM-labeled RNA duplex at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples
