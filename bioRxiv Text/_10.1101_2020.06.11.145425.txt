Abstract
Summary: Manually assessing the scope of the thousands of publications on the COVID-19
(coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is an overwhelming task. Shortcuts through metadata
analysis (e.g., keywords) assume that studies are properly tagged. However, machine learning
approaches can rapidly survey the actual text of coronavirus abstracts to identify research
overlap between COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases, research hotspots, and areas
warranting exploration. We propose a fast, scalable, and reusable framework to parse novel
disease literature. When applied to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19),
dimensionality reduction suggested that COVID-19 studies to date are primarily clinical-,
modeling- or field-based, in contrast to the vast quantity of laboratory-driven research for other
(non-COVID-19) coronavirus diseases. Topic modeling also indicated that COVID-19
publications have thus far focused primarily on public health, outbreak reporting, clinical care,
and testing for coronaviruses, as opposed to the more limited number focused on basic
microbiology, including pathogenesis and transmission.

Introduction
On March 16, 2020, the White House issued a ‘call to action’ for the application of
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to assist with research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) (Robbins, 2020), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), designating machine learning (ML) as a potentially useful tool for gleaning
critical insights from the existing coronavirus literature. Present attempts to examine COVID-19related publications either mine texts to rapidly create study summaries for researchers (Joshi et
al., 2020) or focus on citations, keyword co-occurrences, and other metrics to identify influential
literature (Chahrour et al., 2020; Golinelli et al. 2020; Hossain, 2020). Other large-scale efforts
concentrate on cataloguing peer-reviewed COVID-19 studies, including “LitCOVID”, a
literature hub by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Chen et al., 2020), and
“COVID-19 Data Portal”, a literature search engine from the European Bioinformatics Institute
(EMBL-EBI, 2020). Although these efforts facilitate keyword-based searches to rapidly identify
studies of interest and, in LitCOVID specifically, classify them into broad categories (e.g.,
mechanism, diagnosis, etc.), they do not provide an overview of where research efforts are
directed and whether these efforts have changed over time. This presents an opportunity to
leverage the application of ML methods to survey the ongoing influx of peer-reviewed and preprinted COVID-19 studies – combined with prior publications on severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and other coronaviruses – and develop unique insights for COVID-19
research needs.
A number of biomedical studies have already applied ML techniques in their work on
surveillance, trends, and clinical predictors for the ongoing pandemic (e.g., Alimadadi et al.,
2020; Carrillo-Larco & Castillo-Cara, 2020; Ge et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Kumar et al.,
2020; Rao and Vazquez, 2020; Yan et al., 2020). Our novel application of ML methods to
available coronavirus abstracts, including those about COVID-19, offers insights into the themes
of COVID-19 research that overlap with studies about other coronaviruses. We perform MLaided analysis of research abstracts in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) (Wang
et al. 2020) to automatically categorize ongoing research endeavors into dynamically-generated
categories, enabling us to identify topics that have received limited attention to date. By
understanding the knowledge overlap between recently released abstracts on COVID-19 and
abstracts related to other coronaviruses, we are able to gain insight into potential areas of SARSCoV-2 research warranting further exploration. In addition, we propose a reusable framework for
parsing an existing knowledge base about other emerging pathogens like the highly pathogenic
avian influenza H5N1 (Kilpatrick et al., 2006; Kissler et al., 2019) before they escalate to the
level of a major epidemic or pandemic threat.
Materials and Methods
Without using any pre-existing knowledge about the abstracts’ topics, we employed
unsupervised ML to determine differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 abstracts in
our corpus of documents. A dimensionality reduction approach was used to identify principal
patterns of variation in the abstracts’ text, followed by topic modeling to extract high-level topics
discussed in the abstracts (James et al., 2013). Our data pipeline is available on GitHub1.

Dataset and Preprocessing
We obtained research abstracts from CORD-19 on May 28, 2020. Generated by the Allen
Institute for AI, and in partnership with other research groups, CORD-19 is updated daily with
coronavirus-related literature. Peer-reviewed studies from PubMed/PubMed Central, as well as
pre-prints from bioRxiv and medRxiv, are retrieved using specific coronavirus-related keywords
(“COVID-19" OR "Coronavirus" OR "Corona virus" OR "2019-nCoV"OR "SARS-CoV" OR
"MERS-CoV" OR "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome" OR "Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome"). At time of writing, CORD-19 contained approximately 137,000 articles, including
both full-text and metadata for all coronavirus research articles, with ~40% of the dataset
classified as virology-related (Wang et al. 2020). We focused our analysis on the abstracts of
articles in CORD-19.
As some of the CORD-19 abstracts were neither relevant to SARS-CoV-2 nor other
coronaviruses, we filtered the CORD-19 data to isolate coronavirus-specific abstracts by
searching for abstracts that mentioned relevant terms. These abstracts served as our “documents”
associated with the document-term matrices (DTMs) in our natural language processing (NLP)
pipeline (Supplemental Information 1). We also identified abstracts for only COVID-19-related
studies by filtering for COVID-19-related keywords within this subset (Supplemental
Information 2).
Methodology
Dimensionality Reduction
Principal components analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that
summarizes data by determining linear correlations between variables (Hotelling, 1933). PCA
identifies individual patterns of variance, or principal components (PCs), in DTMs that
differentiate documents from one another, highlighting key trends in the data (Supplemental
Information 3). For example, in a simple corpus with two mutually exclusive topics, like
machine learning and health infrastructure, the terms “machine” and “learning” would be
correlated with one another. PCA would recognize these terms as an important source of
variation, providing a way to differentiate documents about either topic (“machine learning” vs.
“health infrastructure”) by the frequency of these terms.
When PCA is applied to DTMs, PCs represent patterns differentiating different
documents, ordered by their prominence. Each detected pattern reflects both the contextual links
between words and their level of importance within the texts. Words with component values of
the greatest magnitude on each PC most strongly drive the pattern that each individual PC
recognizes. For example, if “machine” and “healthcare” respectively have highly negative and
highly positive values on a particular PC, then that PC detects the pattern that when “machine”
appears in a text, “healthcare” appears less often. Another PC may detect a different pattern of
variance, such as when some documents mention “deep learning” more often than others.
The projection values of the text corpus onto the PCs suggest what concept each
document discusses and to what extent, relative to the average document within the corpus.
Following the previous example, strongly negative projection values on the first PC, which
would capture the data’s most prominent patterns, indicate that the document mentions
“machine” more often than the average and thus, is more likely to focus on machine learning. In
addition, projection values on the second PC could distinguish between machine learning
documents by focus, or lack thereof, on deep learning or other techniques. This approach enables
us to delineate between different groups of abstracts by visualizing differences in their
projections on the top PCs. So in short, after applying PCA to the DTMs of our abstracts, we

identified which PCs successfully separated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 abstracts. We then
used the component values with the largest magnitude on these PCs to interpret them.
Topic Modeling
After establishing high-level trends using PCA, we used latent dirichlet allocation (LDA),
a topic modeling method, to add nuance to observed differences between COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 literature and examine potential topics of interest. LDA is an unsupervised
probabilistic algorithm that extracts hidden topics from large volumes of text (Blei, Ng and
Jordan, 2003). Once trained to discover words that separate documents into a predetermined
number of topics, LDA can estimate the “mixture” of topics associated with each document.
These mixtures suggest the dominant topic for a document that is then used to assign a document
to an overarching topic category. For example, LDA may separate documents into two topics,
one on “machine learning” and another on “healthcare”, and if a particular document’s mixture is
60% “machine learning” and 40% “healthcare”, it would assign that document to a “machine
learning” topic category.
The predetermined number of topics is the most important hyperparameter in an LDA
model, as models with sub-optimal number of topics fail to summarize data in an efficient
manner (Blei, Ng and Jordan, 2003; Zhao et al., 2015). The number of topics can be determined
by (1) identifying a model that has a low perplexity score and high coherence value when applied
to an unseen dataset or (2) conducting a principled, manual assessment of the topics that arise.
Perplexity is a statistical measure of how imperfectly the topic model fits a dataset, and a low
perplexity score is generally considered to provide better results (Zhao et al., 2015). Similarly,
topic models with high coherence values are considered to offer meaningful, interpretable topics
(Aletras et al., 2013; Newman, Bonilla, and Buntine, 2011). Thus, a model with a low perplexity
score and a high coherence value is more desirable when choosing the optimal number of topics.
Our initial implementation of LDA showed no optimal value for the number of topics, even as it
approached ~100, potentially reflecting a relatively shallow yet broad pool of COVID-19
publications. We ultimately identified 30 topics via manual review of topics from topic models
with different numbers of topics to identify which model satisfied two criteria: (1) topics that
were relatively specific, focusing on a single subject matter, and (2) topics that would typically
be non-redundant with one another.
Results
Our initial corpus included 137,326 entries in the CORD-19 dataset (as of May 28, 2020).
107,557 entries had abstracts available, and of those, 35,281 entries (26% of 47,928) had
abstracts mentioning search terms related to coronaviruses. Those that did not mention
coronavirus search terms in their abstracts contained coronavirus-related terms somewhere else
in the text, such as in its citations. Of the latter subset, 18412 publications (~50% of the subset,
or ~13% of the entire CORD-19 dataset) were COVID-19-related publications.
PCA Indicates Limited Number of Laboratory Studies on Viral Mechanisms of SARSCoV-2
While PCA highlighted the abstracts’ most prominent patterns in the first PC, these
patterns were not effective at distinguishing between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 literature.
Figure 1a demonstrates no meaningful difference between the two distributions of projection
values from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 abstracts onto the first PC, indicating a shared

pattern of variance, i.e. both groups appear to discuss similar questions, approaches, and
techniques using similar vocabulary within this pattern.
The patterns that successfully differentiated between the two groups were beneath the first
PC, within the second PC, where the projection value distributions presented distinguishing
patterns (Figure 1b). Our interpretation of this PC relied on identifying terms that had values
with the greatest magnitude (Supplemental Information 4; Supplemental Information 5).
Ultimately, the figures below indicate that while variance among non-COVID-19 abstracts (blue)
stretched over much of the second PC, projection values of COVID-19 abstracts (orange) were
concentrated in a smaller area, reflecting the narrower scope of COVID-19 abstracts considering
that the virus and associated disease have only been studied since December 2019.

Figures 1a, 1b (from left to right). Distribution of COVID-19 (orange) and non-COVID-19 (blue) abstracts along
the top two PCs. Panel A shows PC1, and Panel B – PC2. PC1 does not effectively distinguish between COVID-19
and non-COVID-19 abstracts. PC2 shows distinct distributions between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 abstracts,
indicating distinct vocabularies used in these abstracts.

When we split the studies into subsets for the three human coronaviruses that have
potential for severe infection, we found that the distributions of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
abstracts in the PC projection space were unique to each virus (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 abstracts
appeared to share a space in common with both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, likely reflecting
some shared terminology and possible ongoing attempts to leverage existing knowledge of the
other two viruses to learn about SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 abstracts are much more
concentrated among lower projection values. Notably, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV abstracts
were spread more evenly along the second PC, reflecting greater breadth and variation along
these PCs that can be attributed to a broader range of studies focused on these pathogens as
compared to SARS-CoV-2. This may be in part due to the much longer time that has been spent
studying these viruses.

Figure 2. The second PC provides distinct separation of SARS-CoV-2, as well as mild separation between abstracts
mentioning the two other human CoVs capable of causing severe illness (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV).

To identify terms associated with differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
abstracts on PC2, we examined patterns of lemmatized terms from the respective abstracts
(Figure 3). The projection values of COVID-19 abstracts on PC2 were lower and associated with
emergent COVID-19 clinical-, modeling- or field-based (CMF) research – such as observational,
clinical, and epidemiological studies – exemplified by stem terms “patient”, “pandem”, “estim”,
and “case”. Words in the opposite direction on PC2 – such as “protein”, “cell”, “bind”, and
“express” – can be associated with viral biology and basic disease processes studied in
biomolecular laboratories. COVID-19 abstracts were thus mostly associated with research
conducted outside of laboratories, e.g., in hospitals, likely reflecting the pandemic reality of data
collection alongside (and often secondary to) clinical care.

Figure 3. This bar chart displays the values of key lemmatized words on the second PC. Those with greatest
magnitude were used for interpretation of the text corpus.

The high-level abstraction reflected by PC2 informed our designation of the extent that
COVID-19 research included studies with any CMF design – ranging from epidemiological
studies to retrospective reviews of clinical outcomes, case studies, and randomized clinical trials
– or laboratory-driven research – including observational microscopy, experimentation with
antiviral compounds, derivation of protein structures, and studies of animal or cell culture
models. Overall, COVID-19 abstracts appeared more likely to have terms associated with CMF
research rather than laboratory studies based on comparisons of distributions for key terms in the
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 abstracts (Figure 4; Supplemental Information 4). This partition
along research design for non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 abstracts was also evident in the
abstract texts: 90% of the abstracts in the bottom 1% of projection values along the second PC
were related to COVID-19; conversely, only 1% of the abstracts in the top 1% were related to
COVID-19.

Figure 4. Top 50 key terms are unevenly distributed among the COVID -19 and non-COVID-19 abstracts.

Topic Modeling Suggests Additional Differences in Specific Research Subareas
Topic modeling helped characterize differences between research topics discussed in
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 abstracts. Results from the LDA model suggested that, similar to
the pattern observed in Figure 4, there was clear differentiation between COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 abstracts across 30 topics (Figure 5; Supplemental Information 6). There were five
topics in particular – (1) Topic 14: outbreaks’ impact on healthcare services, (2) Topic 15: testing
for coronaviruses, (3) Topic 17: epidemic cases and modeling (4) Topic 21: clinical care and
therapeutics, and (5) Topic 25: lessons learned for epidemic preparedness – that accounted for
58% of all COVID-19 abstracts and for just 17% of non-COVID-19 abstracts. COVID-19
abstracts were thus disproportionately concentrated in these five topics relative to non-COVID19 abstracts.

Figure 5. COVID-19 literature is distributed unevenly across the 30 topics.

Across the 30 topics, we grouped several topics into topic families based on internal
commonalities (Supplemental Information 6), including (1) updates on the spread of and events
related to coronavirus outbreaks (including two subfamilies: general updates vs. public health
responses); (2) testing for coronaviruses; (3) clinical care, therapeutics, and the need for
vaccinations; and (4) basic microbiological research (which included two subfamilies: a general
catch-all subfamily vs. a subfamily specific to pathogenesis and transmission). When divided by
topic family, the disparity between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 research in the first and
fourth topic families showed that COVID-19 abstracts appeared to be heavily concentrated on
topics that typically included field-based data (the first topic family, on outbreak reporting) and
excluded laboratory-based studies (the fourth topic family, on basic microbiology). However,
one exception was that COVID-19 was overrepresented in studies on testing (especially
diagnostics; the second topic family), which included both the laboratory development of the
tests and their field application. (Supplemental Information 7)
Documents Analyzed Through Machine Learning Highlight Trends Over Time
We also examined the rates of publication and preprint submission for COVID-19
abstracts along PC2 (Figure 6a) and the previously mentioned topic families (Figure 6b). From
the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 abstracts tended to have lower projection values for the
second PC, reflecting the relatively higher number of CMF studies emerging during the early
stages of the pandemic compared to laboratory-based studies.

Figures 6a and 6b. Panel A shows the distribution over time of COVID-19 abstracts with different projection values
on the second PC (i.e, those likely reflecting CMF research versus laboratory research) and the different timelines
for publication between these groups. Panel B shows COVID-19 research is predominantly focused on outbreak
reporting and public health issues.

Likewise, the growth of studies in the different topic families for COVID-19 was
unevenly distributed (Figure 6b). From January 2020 through the end of May 2020, publications
related to COVID-19 were dominated by studies involving (1) outbreak and responses and (2)
patients and healthcare services, similar to the observed faster pace of CMF research in the PCA

results. Publications regarding viral mechanisms and biomolecular processes related to SARSCoV-2 grew at a slower pace.
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate the utility of our novel NLP-driven approach for determining
potential areas of underrepresentation in current research efforts for COVID-19. By applying
unsupervised ML methods to CORD-19, we identified overarching key research topics in
existing coronavirus and COVID-19-specific abstracts, as well as the distribution of abstracts
among topics and over time. Our results support a prior bibliometric study that also found more
frequent appearances of epidemiological keywords in COVID-19 research compared to research
on other coronaviruses (Hossain, 2020). However, our study presents the unique finding that
laboratory-based COVID-19 studies, including those on genetic and biomolecular topics, are
underrepresented relative to studies of epidemiological and clinical issues, particularly when
compared with the distribution of previous research on other coronaviruses. Furthermore, we
developed a framework that improves upon existing studies in two key ways: (1) our method
maps connections between abstracts or publications by relying directly on the abstracts’ text in
comparison to other bibliometric analyses, including those in other fields, that rely on the
analysis of metadata (de Oliveira et al., 2019; Campbell et al., 2010); and (2) our method offers
an unsupervised ML-driven approach to splice the data in multiple ways, including adeptly
measuring the scope of existing literature, its topical changes over time, and differences from
literature on previous pandemics.
The distribution of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 abstracts from our PCA results
suggest that, at the time of writing (CORD-19 dataset release on May 28, 2020), the breadth of
published research for COVID-19 is relatively narrow compared to that of published nonCOVID-19 studies (Figures 1 and 2). As shown in our results, keywords associated with
biomolecular processes (e.g., viral structure, pathogenesis, and host cell interactions) appeared
more frequently in non-COVID-19 abstracts than in COVID-19 abstracts. This finding reflects
the emergent nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the research community’s struggle to understand it at
the molecular level to the same extent as other coronaviruses. Nonetheless, the availability of
laboratory studies for other coronaviruses represents an opportunity for generating hypothesisdriven research questions grounded in empirical research.
It is worth noting that researchers may be working under the assumption that biological
processes of SARS-CoV-2, including life cycle and interactions with the human host, are
comparable to those of SARS-CoV due to their genetic similarity and relatedness (CSG, 2020;
Petrosillo et al., 2020; Zhang and Holmes 2020). For example, several prior SARS-CoV studies
on host cell entry helped identify the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein as a
mediator for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hoffman et al., 2020). Likewise, CD147 and GRP78
proteins have been hypothesized to play a role in cell entry for SARS-CoV-2 based on earlier
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV findings, although additional studies are needed (Wang et al.,
2020b; Chen et al., 2005; Ibrahim et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2018). While building upon assumed
similarities is an important first step, as work progresses, it becomes increasingly important to
identify features that are unique to each virus. However, the scope of literature for biological
processes unique to SARS-CoV-2 is currently quite limited, and perhaps even more limited than
what our PCA results suggest if most SARS-CoV-2 literature relies heavily on other coronavirus
research.

This underrepresentation of studies on biomolecular processes could also be attributed to
the rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 that occurred within mere months of its emergence,
necessitating an unprecedented response from healthcare and public health infrastructures
globally. Our PCA results reflect an overwhelming concern regarding the exponential spread of
the virus and risks for transmission involved with more frequent appearances of stem terms such
as “pandem”, “outbreak”, “estim”, “countri”, “number”, and “risk” in COVID-19 abstracts. This
was also supported by our topic modelling results, which indicated that 58% of COVID-19
abstracts fell into just five of 30 topics, generally related to healthcare services, the pandemic’s
public health issues, and testing for coronaviruses (Figure 6a, 6b). The more rapid growth of
CMF research, relative to laboratory-driven research, mirrors the current response to the
pandemic in the United States, where the initial focus on pressing epidemiological and clinical
concerns is now followed by interest in experimental investigations, including those of structural
mechanisms for host cell entry and possible therapeutic targets.
Overall, our findings reflect a clear divide between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
abstracts based upon research design; unlike CMF research, laboratory-driven SARS-CoV-2
research is either still underway or has only just been initiated. This can be attributed in part to
the fact that laboratory research is often a labor-intensive process within a federally-regulated
infrastructure that depends on the availability of timely, project-based funding as well as longerterm funding. Our findings also suggest that the pace of research on SARS-CoV-2 biomolecular
processes is potentially insufficient given the global threat posed by the virus (Figure 6a, 6b).
This lag may adversely impact the development of antivirals and other therapeutic interventions,
adding strain to already overwhelmed healthcare systems. Furthermore, these trends raise
questions about the readiness of institutions supporting the research community in times of
extraordinary stress. Previous experiences with global pandemics, such as H1N1, have resulted
in various policy recommendations (French et al., 2009) to maintain and enhance readiness in
laboratory-based research, and analysis on the effectiveness of recommendations arising from
these experiences may be worthwhile.
While PCA identified a prominent pattern that differentiated between COVID-19 and
non-COVID-19 literature, the topic families derived from LDA refined our understanding of
knowledge gaps and research needs in COVID-19 literature by delineating specific research
areas. This included an underrepresentation of studies on basic microbiological examination of
SARS-CoV-2, including its pathogenesis and transmission. Research on these issues is published
at a slower pace than CMF studies (e.g., those on clinical topics, outbreak response, and
statistical reporting) and research on testing (Figure 6b). Even when compared with the
distribution of non-COVID-19 research, COVID-19 research was more heavily focused on topics
within the CMF realm (Supplemental Information 7).
We recognize that the number of abstracts in each of these topics does not necessarily
represent scientific progress made in these areas, but they do reflect the pace of research and
potential availability of public knowledge. This indicates either a mismatch between the level of
effort in these issues and the urgency of work or time lags inherent to these fields that constrain
the responsiveness of the scientific community. Increased and consistent funding of emerging
pathogens research, including support of basic research even when there is no immediate threat
of an outbreak, would allow us to maintain a proactive posture in accumulating available
knowledge rather than over-reliance on reactivity.
These conclusions must be caveated by several limitations that must be acknowledged.
First, while CORD-19 includes a vast quantity of coronavirus-related publications, it potentially

omits relevant literature from other databases, such as the Social Science Research Network
(SSRN) or arXiv (a preprint server for studies in mathematics, computer science, and
quantitative biology, among other topics). This may have constrained the representativeness of
our analysis on COVID-19 literature, thus affecting the external validity of our findings. Second,
analyzing abstracts inherently excludes ongoing research efforts because not all relevant studies
are publicly available or have released preprints. Third, the number of publications does not
directly represent progress in research areas. Fourth, the high-level trends we observed through
our unsupervised ML approaches may not completely align with how researchers identify and
process specific research topics. The counts of words in DTMs informing the ML algorithms
may not directly capture the ideas researchers are trying to convey and may therefore gloss over
nuances in the literature.
Yet these four limitations are somewhat mitigated by both the nature of the data sources
and the needs of the research community. For the first, the excluded sources (SSRN and arXiv)
heavily focus on research within the CMF arena, indicating that if anything, our conclusions on
the rapid pace of CMF COVID-19 research (versus lab-based research) are conservative. For the
second, existing research pipelines have been accelerated in the pandemic, especially with the
proliferation of pre-print services. This reduces the lag between the discovery of knowledge and
the availability of an abstract to ingest in our data pipeline. Third, the number of publications in
each area may imply a relative difference in research productivity for different topics, and thus
may still serve as a proxy for indicating such progress or the attention given to specific issues.
And finally, our ML-based method offers the chance to quickly review large quantities of text at
scale and highlight underlying trends. Both this speed and this scale are crucial to informing
time-sensitive decisions on policy and priorities to facilitate the most impactful research.
Complex public health problems like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic require
researchers to maintain robust knowledge on pathogenic threats, including efforts dedicated to
emerging or currently neglected pathogens. Our ML-based study offers insights into potential
areas for future research opportunities and funding investments that build upon what is already
known about coronaviruses. We offer a conceptual framework that can be applied to other
emergent or neglected pathogens that have the potential to become a pandemic threat, such as
highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (Kilpatrick et al., 2006; Kissler et al., 2019), enabling
researchers to maintain a proactive preparedness posture.
