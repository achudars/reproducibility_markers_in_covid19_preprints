Abstract

10

The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic

11

categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae,

12

subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to

13

designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed

14

standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been

15

proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are

16

divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation

17

of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the

18

most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular

19

epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus

20

sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our

21

phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated

22

holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters

23

between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate

24

sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus

25

propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of

26

subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, “MyCoV”, which provides a

27

method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.

Importance Statement:

29

The analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most

30

common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as

31

Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses,

32

however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these

33

methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared

34

to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that

35

will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To

36

assist in this, we also provide the R package ‘MyCoV’ which classifies user generated sequences.

Introduction:

38

Coronaviruses are widely studied for their impact on human and animal health (1) as well as their

39

broad diversity and host/reservoir associations. In recent years, the emergence of Betacoronaviruses

40

in human populations has resulted in widespread morbidity and mortality. The Severe Acute

41

Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus was responsible for 8 096 cases and 774 deaths during the

42

2002-2003 outbreak (World Health Organisation, WHO data). Since 2013, the Middle East

43

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus has infected 2 506 and has led to 862 deaths (WHO data).

44

At the time of writing, the SARS-CoV-2 virus (also known as nCoV-2019 and causing the disease

45

Covid-19) epidemic is ongoing and is regarded as a public health emergency of international

46

concern by the WHO, having resulted in more than 2,500 deaths. Thanks to molecular epidemiology

47

studies, we know that SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 had their origins in wild animal reservoir

48

species before spilling over into humans. Indeed, numerous molecular studies have identified a

49

wealth of Coronavirus diversity harboured by equally diverse animal hosts (1–6), and phylogenetic

50

analysis of sequence data from these studies is helping in our understanding of many aspects of

51

disease ecology and evolution (7–9). This includes the role of reservoir hosts in disease maintenance

52

and transmission (3, 4, 6, 10–12), the evolutionary origins of human-infecting coronaviruses (3, 13),

53

the importance of bats as reservoirs of novel coronaviruses (14, 15), the role of intermediate hosts in

54

human disease emergence (3, 11, 16), and the understanding of risk that might be related to

55

coronavirus diversity and distributions (17, 18).

56

The precise taxonomic classification of all organisms undergoes constant drift as new discoveries are

57

made that inform their evolutionary histories. However, in 2018, the International Committee for

58

the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) introduced a shift in the taxonomic designations of all RNA viruses,

59

introducing the realm Riboviria, grouping “all RNA viruses that use cognate RNA-dependent RNA

60

polymerases (RdRps) for replication” (19). In addition to this basal classification, many new

61

taxonomic classifications were defined, or existing taxa reclassified. This included the separation of

4

62

the family Coronaviridae into two subfamilies – the amphibian-infecting Letovirinae, and

63

Orthocoronavirinae

64

Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus that are classically recognised to infect mammals and birds

65

and have significance in human and livestock diseases. The subgenus level of classification for

66

members of the Orthocoronavirinae was also introduced, providing specific taxa for commonly cited

67

groups of similar viruses such as Betacoronavirus lineages β-A, β-B, β-C and β-D, which were

68

designated Embecovirus, Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus and Nobecovirus, respectively. The

69

nomenclature for the designated subgenera was assigned with respect to known host species for

70

each subgenus (eg. Rhinacoviruses for Alphacoronviruses known to be hosted by bats of the

71

Rhinolophidae family) or based on commonly used disease terminology (eg. Merbecoviruses for

72

Betacoronaviruses related to MERS Coronavirus). Whole genome data from holotype specimens

73

selected to represent an exhaustive spectrum of coronavirus diversity was used to test the

74

phylogenetic repartition and support for each of these taxa (20). Due to the limited diversity of

75

holotype specimens classified into these subgenera, there is currently no method for attributing

76

subgenus to isolates with divergent sequences, and no proposed method for partial sequence data.

77

However, sequence data from the RdRp region of the polymerase gene is one of the most commonly

78

used tools for the purposes of Coronavirus detection, identification and classification in molecular

79

epidemiology.

80

Here, we examine the phylogenetic relationship from all identifiable public partial RdRp sequences

81

of coronaviruses using Bayesian inference in BEAST2 and examine the clade-associations of all

82

defined subgenus holotypes. We use this analysis to explore the range of logical similarity thresholds

83

for the designation of subgenus-level classifications to partial RdRp sequence and predict “most-

84

likely subgenus” classifications for all reference sequences. We cross-validate a sequence-identity-

85

based classification method against phylogenetically inferred classifications showing that alignment

86

identity is >99% specific for the assignment of subgenus-level classifications to partial RdRp

87

sequences. We compiled a database of our assigned classifications and developed the R package

88

“MyCoV” for assignment of user-generated sequences to these taxa.

89

Methods:

90

Sequence data, curation and alignment:

91

Sequence data was obtained from the NCBI nucleotide database on the 5th of July 2019, using the

92

search term “coronavir*”. This resulted in the identification of 30,249 sequences. A preliminary set

93

of representative partial RdRp sequences was compiled with reference to recent publications

94

describing Coronavirus diversity across the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily (21), in order to include

95

starting reference sequences from with the largest possible diversity of coronaviruses. This

96

preliminary list was then used to identify partial RdRp sequences from retrieved NCBI records by

97

annotating regions that had at least 70 % identity to any reference sequence in the Geneious

98

software package (version 9.4.1). Annotated regions and 200 bp of flanking sequence data were

99

then extracted. Data containing incomplete sequences in the form of strings of N’s or significant

100

numbers of ambiguities (>5) were removed. Open reading frames with a minimum length of 300 bp

101

were identified and extracted from the remaining sequences. In the case where the correct reading

102

frame was ambiguous, pairwise alignment to reference sequence data was used to determine

103

reading frame. Remaining sequences were then aligned in-frame using MAFFT, and the resulting

104

alignment was further curated by visual inspection. Retained sequences were then trimmed to

105

include only the most-frequently sequenced partial region of RdRp and so that each sequence

106

contained a minimum of 300 gap free bases. The final alignment was 387 bp in length with 7,544

107

individual sequences, of which 3,155 were unique. The relevant 387 bp region corresponds to

108

nucleotide positions 15287:15673 in Merbecovirus holotype reference sequence JX869059.2.

109

Genetic analyses:

110

Phylogenies were inferred from all unique sequences using the BEAST2 software (22). Parameters

111

were estimated for a GTR substitution model with four gamma categories and an estimated

112

proportion of invariant sites. The Yule population model was used, and a log-normal distribution was

113

specified for birth rate and proportion of invariant site priors. Convergence of estimated parameters

114

was assessed in Tracer v1.7.1 (23). Three independent MCMC chains were run until effective sample

115

sizes were above 200 for all estimated parameters after removing the burn-in. Analyses were run

116

until convergence criteria could be fulfilled whilst providing equal chain lengths after burn-in for all

117

three repeats, meaning that the number of trees in the posterior distributions was the same for each

118

independent repeat.

119

Genetic distance measures were calculated using the ‘ape’ package (24) in RStudio as the proportion

120

of variant sites in pairwise comparisons after removing regions containing gaps in either compared

121

sequence.

122

Taxonomic classification:

123

Sequences originating from known references were used to identify common ancestral nodes for the

124

Orthocoronaviridae genera within each phylogenetic tree. Genus-level subtrees were then extracted

125

and treated independently for subgenus-level analyses.

126

Sequences originating from defining subgenus holotype samples were identified in the genus-level

127

topologies. Clustering thresholds were defined as the highest node positions at which clusters of

128

leaves could be defined without combining holotype specimens from different subgenera into the

129

same clade. Clusters defined at these thresholds that contained no holotype specimens were

130

designated as “Unclassified”. Clustering thresholds were calculated, and subgenera were assigned to

131

all sequences across a random subsample of 453 trees, 151 from each independent repeat of the

132

phylogenetic analyses. The proportion of trees in which each sequence was assigned to a given

133

subgenus was used as the “posterior probability” of that sequence belonging to that subgenus.

134

Sequences with lower than 90% majority posterior probabilities were designated as “Unclassified”.

135

Potential positioning of new subgenus level clades (as indicated by “GroupX” in Figures 2 and 3) was

136

inferred using the maximum clade-credibility consensus tree from all BEAST analyses, identifying

137

monophyletic clades where all descendants were not classified into defined subgenera.

138

Cross-validation:

139

The assignment of sequences to the relevant subgenus using best hit and pairwise identity data from

140

blastn (25) was tested by iteratively removing each sequence from the test database and re-

141

assigning its classification. Sequences that could not be re-assigned to the same subgenus by this

142

method were re-classified as “atypical” members of their respective subgenera.

143

R package for assignment of user-generated sequences:

144

The purpose of the R package MyCoV is to allow users to classify Coronavirus sequence data that

145

includes the relevant portion of the RdRp gene to the taxonomic level of subgenus, and to assess to

146

what extent the classification is optimal based on the criteria presented herein.

147

In order to achieve this, the 3155 unique partial sequences from the phylogenetic analyses were

148

used to establish a reference BLAST database. Metadata pertaining to host organism, country of

149

origin and date of collection were mined from NCBI and standardised by taxonomic grouping of the

150

host and geographical region of origin to generate corresponding metadata for all 7544 NCBI

151

reference sequences from which the unique sequence list was established.

152

MyCoV was written as a basic wrapper script for blastn, which queries sequences of interest against

153

the established database, and summarises subgenus classification, subgenus posterior support of

154

the most similar sequence in the phylogenetic analysis, pairwise distances to the most similar

155

sequence in the database and their metadata using R packages “ggplot2”, “formattable” (available at

156

https://github.com/renkun-ken/formattable) and “ggtree” (26).

157

As the MyCoV database was established prior to the recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2, we

158

used genomic sequence data from this virus as a test case for the utility of the MyCoV package.

159

Outputs from this analysis are shown in Figure 5.

160

MyCoV is available at https://github.com/dw974/MyCoV.

161

Results:

162

Our three independent, randomly-seeded phylogenetic analyses converged on similar estimates for

163

all parameters in BEAST2. The resulting predictions of tree topology had well supported major nodes

164

with narrow posterior distributions around most node heights (Figure 1a). The four known genera

165

associated with these sequences fell into four well-supported clades, divided close to the root of the

166

tree. Genetic distance measures between all members of the four genera had logical thresholds for

167

the distinction between genera except in the case of some betacoronaviruses, which had major

168

clade divisions close to the root of the tree (Figure 1b) and therefore had genetic distances between

169

members of the same genus that overlapped with distances between members of the Alpha- and

170

Betacoronaviruses. In practice, this is likely to mean that identity-based phylogenetic topologies

171

based on this partial region of RdRp may incorrectly infer paraphyly between members of the Alpha-

172

and Betacoronaviruses.

173

At the subgenus level, separation of the inferred tree topologies into monophyletic clades based on

174

the positions of reference holotype sequences produced logical and well-supported groupings that

175

covered the majority of coronavirus diversity explored to date by RdRp sequencing (Figures 2 and 3).

176

In total, 88 % of unique sequences fell into clade groups containing subgenus holotypes with

177

subgenus-assignment posterior probabilities of greater than 90 %. The remaining 12 % of unique

178

sequences fell into 19 separate monophyletic groups, of which 14 were Alphacoronaviruses (Figure

179

2), two were Betacoronaviruses (Figure 2) and three were Deltacoronaviruses (Figure 3). When host

180

and geographical origins of isolates falling within unclassified clades was examined, the majority

181

were associated with regional radiations for which little or no genomic or phenotypic data are

182

available. For example, unclassified Deltacoronaviruses were all from bird species in Oceania, and

183

many unclassified Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses originated in bat species that are exclusively found

184

in Central and South America (Supplementary Figure 1).

185

The Pedacoviruses, for which multiple genome holotypes were supplied for the description of

186

subgenus, were split into multiple clades by the imposition of a common height threshold for cluster

187

definition using the presented methodology. The two holotype-containing clades corresponded to a

188

single group of Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) – related viruses distributed globally but

189

entirely from pigs (Pedacovirus I in Figure 2) and a monophyletic group of viral sequences obtained

190

from Asian Scotophilus bats. The monophyletic group that contained both Pedacovirus holotypes

191

also enclosed other major viral clades (Clades A11, A12 and A13 in Figure 2), which were mainly

192

associated with other bat species of the Vespertillionidae family (Supplementary Figure 1).

193

Cross-validation of sub-genus assignments by best-hit using blastn was successful in more than 99.9

194

% of cases, with a handful of lone sequences that branched at basal positions of each phylogenetic

195

clade group being assigned to different subgenera.

196

For sequence members of each genus, genetic distance measurements between and within

197

sequences attributed to each subgenus displayed logical and discrete threshold boundaries for the

198

distinction of individual subgenus members. The one exception, again, was members of the

199

pedacovirus subgenus which displayed overlapping within-taxon distances with between-taxon

200

distances for other Alphacoronavirus subgenera (Figure 4). The distinct pedacovirus clades displayed

201

in Figure 2 were thus treated as separate subgenera for distance threshold calculation. Optimal

202

thresholds were identified as the midpoint of a fitted binomial probability distribution for intra- and

203

inter- subgenus pairwise distances. The optimal identity thresholds for distinguishing same vs.

204

different subgenera were as follows; i) 77.6 % identity, resulting in 99.7 % precision and 95.3 %

205

accuracy of classification for subgenera of the Alphacoronaviruses. ii) 71.7 % identity, resulting in

206

99.9 % precision and 99.6 % accuracy of classification for subgenera of the Betacoronaviruses. iii)

207

74.9 % identity, resulting in 98.8 % precision and 99.2 % accuracy of classification for subgenera of

208

the Deltacoronaviruses, and iv) 69.9 % identity, resulting in 100 % precision and 100 % accuracy of

209

classification for subgenera of the Gammacoronaviruses.

210

Our R package, MyCoV, successfully identified SARS-CoV-2 as a member of the sarbecovirus

211

subgenus, with the closest match being to reference sequence KP876545.11 (Rhinolophus bat

212

coronavirus BtCov/3990), which showed 92.5 % pairwise identity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RdRp

213

region. This sequence had been assigned 100 % posterior support for being attributed to the

214

sarbecovirus subgenus (Figure 5a). Distributions of pairwise identities within members of the

215

subgenera of the Betacoronaviruses fell between 71 % and 100 %, whereas pairwise distances

216

between Betacoronavirus subgenera were less than or equal to 71%. Thus, the output of MyCoV

217

allows us to state with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to this subgenus (Figure 5b). Positioning

218

of the closest match in the phylogenetic tree shows that the SARS-CoV-2 forms a distinct lineage

219

from SARS coronavirus, and that its closest match belonged to a Rhinolophus bat from China (Figure

220

5c). Interestingly, this sequence came from an abandoned mine in 2013, suggesting that SARS-

221

CoV-2 predecessors circulated in bat communities for a number of years prior to the 2019

222

emergence in human populations. The provided visualisation of host and geographical origins for

223

these partial reference sequences allows for a rapid assessment of the distribution of similar viruses,

224

for example, it highlights the fact that SARS-related and SARS-CoV-2-related viruses have also been

225

identified in bats in Africa (specifically Rhinolophus bats in Kenya), and that they are not just

226

restricted to Asian bat hosts.

227

Discussion:

228

The recent reclassification of the Riboviria is a logical progression in viral taxonomy, as the unique

229

mechanism of replication of all negative-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses results in the

230

conservation of many viral characteristics, including relative sequence conservation of regions of the

231

cognate RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Consequently, such genomic loci lend themselves to the

232

design of primers for virus detection in diagnostics and molecular epidemiology, and to the

233

phylogenetic inference of evolutionary histories. Furthermore, establishing the classification level of

234

subgenus has provided a useful tool for researchers, attributing standardised terminology for many

235

commonly referenced viral lineages that, in general, demonstrate a level of specificity in their host-

236

associations and epidemiological characteristics (Supplementary Figures S1).

237

Our analyses have shown that the phylogenetic interpretation of short sequences of the RdRp locus

238

of members of the Orthocoronaviridae is largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on

239

designated holotype members for each subgenus. The vast majority of known RdRp sequences (88

240

%) can be classified into the defined subgenera, and their classification cross-validated based on

241

simple distance thresholds established from a 387 bp fragment of RdRp. Globally, these distance

242

measures form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can

243

attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both

244

accurately and robustly without the need for complex phylogenetic inference. The provided R

245

package, “MyCoV”, provides a method for achieving this and for the assessment of the reliability of

246

the attribution.

247

An alternative strategy for coronavirus classification from partial sequence data may be using the

248

spike protein-encoding S-gene, which is another commonly sequenced region of coronavirus

249

genomes. However, the use of this region is more common in epidemic outbreak scenarios and thus

250

there are many S gene sequences in public databases that are either identical or extremely closely

251

related. Performing comparative sequence searches by querying the NCBI nucleotide database with

252

the

253

"viruses"[porgn:__txid10239]“ and “((coronavir* RdRp) OR (coronavir* polymerase)) AND

254

"viruses"[porgn:__txid10239]“ shows that there are approximately three times more sequences

255

from the S gene, but that these sequences originate from approximately three times fewer viral

256

taxa. We therefore favour the use of the RdRp region as it provides a more exhaustive

257

representation of known coronavirus diversity.

258

Of course, this form of interpretation is subject to the same caveats as any other that is based on

259

partial sequence data from a short, single genomic locus; Indeed, the effects of potential

260

recombination events cannot be captured, and some uncertainties will exist in the presented

261

phylogenetic trajectories that may be resolvable by the addition of longer sequence data. For these

262

reasons, we do not suggest the definition of new subgenera for unclassified clade groups presented

263

in Figures 2 and 3. The limits of the phylogenetic resolving power of this partial region of RdRp are

264

most clear for members of the Alphacoronavirus genus, where there is an elevated level of mid-

265

distance genetic diversity and a large number of unclassified genetic clade groups associated with

266

regional, likely host-specific radiations. And thus, precise taxonomic delineation of emerging

267

Alphacoronaviruses will require more information than is offered by this RdRp locus. Conversely, the

268

clear genetic distinction and corresponding epidemiological associations that exist between clade

269

groups of the Pedacoviruses does raise the question as to whether the definition of this subgenus

270

should be revisited.

Figure 1: Comparative analysis of 3155 partial RdRp sequences belonging to members of the

350

Orthocoronavirinae. A) Consensus phylogeny from three independent BEAST analyses. Nodes with

351

posterior support greater than 90 % are highlighted with dots and bars display the 95% HPD of the

352

heights of each node. Colours indicate genus-level classification for sequences, clades and pairwise

353

comparisons throughout. B) Histograms of genetic distances, measured as the proportion of variant

354

sites, between sequences belonging to each genus and grouped by the genus of the queried

355

sequence.

356

Figure 2: Phylogenetic subgenus classifications for partial RdRp sequences of Alphacoronaviruses

357

(LEFT) and Betacoronaviruses (RIGHT). Depicted trees are subtrees of consensus phylogeny

358

presented in Figure 1. Dots on leaf tips indicate sequences belonging to holotype reference

359

sequences for each subgenus. Coloured bars show the proportion of trees from the Bayesian

360

analysis where the corresponding leaf was assigned to each subgenus, which is indicated by colour

361

according to the legend. Vertical lines show the distribution of cluster-defining height thresholds

362

that were identified to assign subgenus classifications, with the median of all clustering thresholds

363

displayed in bold, lines are coloured by genus as in Figure 1. Monophyletic groups where all

364

members have posterior probabilities of being assigned to a known subgenus of lower than 90% are

365

highlighted and assigned sequential IDs.

displayed in bold, lines are coloured by genus as in Figure 1. In the case of gamma coronaviruses,

374

both subgenera are consistently separated at the root of the tree, thus all cluster defining heights

375

equate to the root. Monophyletic groups where all members have posterior probabilities of being

376

assigned to a known subgenus of lower than 90% are highlighted and assigned sequential IDs.

378

lines represent the optimal genetic distance cut-offs for the subgenus threshold, calculated as the

379

midpoint of the fitted binomial probability distribution.

Figure 5: MyCoV output plots for the analysis of the 2019nCoV. A) Tabular output of best blastn hit

381

of the query sequence to the reference database. The predicted subgenus and genus of the best-

382

matching hit are displayed, as well as the posterior support for the assignment to the predicted

383

subgenus (see methods). Pairwise identity between the two sequences is shown and is calculated

384

relative to the maximum possible alignment length against the reference sequences (387 bp). B) For

385

each queried sequence, pairwise identity values are mapped to all observations from pairwise

386

comparisons between sequences in the database. The vertical dashed line represents the pairwise

387

dissimilarity of the queried sequence. C) Phylogenetic positioning and metadata from the analysis of

388

the reference sequences are displayed. Reference sequences with blast-hits matching the queried

389

sequence are highlighted on the leaves, and tips are coloured from red to green with increasing

390

pairwise identity. The hit with the best score is highlighted by a large green diamond on the tip.

391

Pairwise identity scores are displayed for all leaves, as well as predicted subgenus. Host genus

392

associations (blue) and geographical region of origin (red) from available metadata are indicated by

393

binary heatmaps. Note that multiple metadata observations are possible for each leaf, as leaves are

394

displayed for unique sequences only. The ID next to each leaf is that of the representative sequence

395

for

that

leaf,

and

other

IDs

are
