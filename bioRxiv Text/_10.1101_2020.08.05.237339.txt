Abstract

The emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has created a global confusing pandemic
health crisis that warrants an accurate and detailed characterization of the rapidly evolving
viral genome for understanding its epidemiology, pathogenesis and containment. We
explored 61,485 sequences of the Nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and
prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in RT-PCR based
diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total
of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%,
n=30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including 3'-end
mismatch to primer-pair of 11 well characterized primer sets. Noteworthy, CDC (USA)
recommended N2 primer set contained lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover,
684 amino acid (aa) substitutions located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions
including 82, 21, and 83 of those in RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region,
and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions
were revealed, mostly (n =10) within the highly flexible linker region, and the rest within the
NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequences of high-frequency
mutations (≥ 20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we
observed that high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) coevolving mutations (R203K
and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. Despite being proposed
as the alternate target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, ongoing nonsynonymous
evolution of the N protein may challenge

the

endeavors, thus need further

immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the
ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic
interventions.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan City,
China (Liu et al., 2020; Mo et al., 2020). Later, the scientists confirmed the etiology as severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and named the disease as COVID19 (Mo et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). The entire world has witnessed the rapid spread of this
virus causing thousands of mortalities each day and creating an unprecedented level of public
health emergency (Gussow et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2020a). Among four structural proteins
of this virus, the N protein is considered as the most important multifunctional RNA binding
protein involved in several aspects of virus life cycle such as ribonucleoprotein helical
structure formation during packaging of the genome, RNA synthesis regulation during
replication, transcription and modulating cellular metabolism of the host (Kang et al., 2020;
Liang et al., 2020). In addition, the N proteins of coronaviruses are highly expressed in the
host cell, and involved in regulating host-pathogen interactions during infection (Liang et al.,
2020). Moreover, this protein has a high immunogenic property enabling it to elicit protective
immune response against SARS-CoV-2 (Kang et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020). However, the
molecular mechanism involving N protein in pathogenesis is yet to be clearly understood.
The N protein is the only structural protein present in the nucleocapsid of the SARSCoV-2 genome which is 419 amino acid (aa) long, and composed of three distinct domains:
N-terminal domain (NTD)/ RNA-binding domain (46-176 aa), a serine/arginine-rich (SRrich) (184-204 aa) linker region (LKR) (182-247 aa), and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (247364 aa) (Kang et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020). The NTD binds to the 3′ -end
of the viral RNA, and is highly divergent. The charged serine and arginine-rich LKR region
can interact directly with RNA, and play a part in cell signaling (Hurst et al., 2009; Liang et

al., 2020). The N-NTD, N-CTD, and SR-rich domain have been found to be associated with
genomic RNA of the virus through electrostatic interactions by the positively charged aa
residues and modulate unwinding after entering into cell by phosphorylation to specific aa. In
addition, several critical residues of N protein have been identified to be involved in genomic
RNA binding, and virus infectivity modulation (Cascarina and Ross, 2020; Zeng et al., 2020).
Interestingly, Lin et al. (2020) has recently investigated the fate of N protein expression in
human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and observed that it abolished pluripotency and
reduced the proliferation rate whereas long-term expression the protein drives iPSC to
fibroblast (Lin et al., 2020). Since this novel virus shows a distinct electrostatic surfaces and
topological variations in the β-hairpin of NTD even though resembles similar structures with
closely related coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020), a detailed analyses on structural dynamics
due to significant mutations can likely answer whether they have any specific adaptive
functions.
Mutations have been found to occur in all regions of the virus, including the open
reading frames (ORFs), the S protein, and the N protein (Islam et al., 2020a; Ozono et al.,
2020). Several types of substitutions in different types of viral proteins have already been
reported within a short period of time that might be involved in modulating viral
transmissibility, replication efficiency as well as virulence properties of the virus in different
parts of the world (Islam et al., 2020a; Jia et al., 2020; Pachetti et al., 2020). The COVID-19
symptoms cannot be used for accurate diagnosis as patients express nonspecific symptoms,
and many of these symptoms could be associated with other respiratory illnesses. Recently
molecular techniques for nucleic acid detection have been used for diagnosing and screening
COVID-19 (Udugama et al., 2020). A number of different primer-probe sets targeting
ORF1ab, S, and N genes have been used in SARS-CoV-2 detection assays, hence COVID-19
detection testing kits have been well developed, and are now available worldwide (Nalla et

al., 2020; Park et al., 2020). However, the test results can be affected by the nucleotide
variations present on the primer binding sites of viral RNA sequences. Mutations in the
primer binding sites of the N gene affects the assay performance since it largely depends on
the sequence matching between primer-probe and SARS-CoV-2 sequences, mismatches of
which can cause the inconsistency or the high false negative rate (FNR) in the test results
(Nalla et al., 2020; Rainer et al., 2004, 2020). Moreover, ongoing mutational evolution of the
virus warrants continuous monitoring and updating of primer-probe sets targeting the
indigenous genome sequences for specific and accurate detection.
In this study, we have pursued an investigation into the synonymous and
nonsynonymous mutations across 61,485 full-length N protein gene trimmed from the SARSCoV-2 genome sequences. Our targets are to observe any nucleotide change that can cause
the mismatching of recommended RT-PCR primer-probe and identify the aa substitutions in
the protein that might cause alteration in the structural configurations and dynamics. The
possible implications of the mutations have also been discussed, which will provide valuable
insights for targeting N protein as an efficient antiviral drug target, vaccine candidate, and
development of a more effective diagnostic assays.
2. Methodology
2.1 Sequence retrieval and processing
To find out the genetic variations of the N protein, we retrieved 67,124 complete (or
near-complete) genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, available at the global initiative on
sharing all influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) up to July 17, 2020. These
sequences belonged to different patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported from 145
countries and/or regions of throughout six continents of the world (Supplementary Data 1).
Sequences were aligned, and nonsynonymous mutations in the N protein were detected with
respect to reference genome from Wuhan (NCBI accession no. NC_045512) using a plug and

play pipeline described in previous literature (Rahman et al., 2020). We found 61,485 cleaned
sequences of N protein in which 30,221 and 28,327 mutated strains in nucleotide- and amino
acid (aa) level, respectively (Supplementary Data 1).
2.2 Wu-Kabat protein variability coefficient
To calculate the aa position variability in regards to evolutionary replacements, we employed
the Wu-Kabat variability coefficient (Garcia-Boronat et al., 2008; Kabat et al., 1977). The
variability coefficient was calculated using the following formula:

N = total number of sequences in the alignment,
k = number of different aa at a given position,
n = frequency of the most common aa at that position.
The details calculation of the variability coefficient has been described in Supplementary
Data 2.
2.3 Tertiary (3D) structure prediction and analyses
(Garcia-Boronat et al., 2008; Kabat et al., 1977)The 3D structure of the N protein of
reference genome (NC_045512) was built in Phyre2 (Kelley et al., 2015), followed by energy
minimization using the GROMOS96 program (van Gunsteren et al., 1996) implemented
within the Swiss-PdbViewer v4.1.0 (Guex and Peitsch, 1997). The 3D structure was validated
using the Ramachandran plot (>90 restudies were allowed region) in PROCHECK v3.5

(Kang et al., 2020; Zinzula et al., 2020) were used for validation of the complete N protein
structure built in Phyre2 and observation of the effect of mutations on the domains. The
structural NTD and CTD domain positions of newly built N protein were cross checked using
the structure of NTD and CTD from protein data bank (Supplementary Fig. 1). The predicted
full-length tertiary structure of N protein of the Wuhan strain was used in molecular
dynamics study and tracking the deleted aa position of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 in this
study.
2.4 Consensus building of NTD, CTD domain and their structural analyses
To explore the effect of high frequency mutations in secondary and tertiary structure,
we also built consensus for NTD-wild (Wuhan reference) and CTD-wild (Wuhan reference)
of the N protein using the top 20 or more mutational frequency. For NTD-cons, we changed
14 aa (A55S, E62V, P67T, D81Y, D103Y, A119S, P122L, D128Y, L139F, D144Y, A152S,
A156S, L161F, P168S) while that for CTD-cons, we also changed 13 aa (T247I, A252S,
Q289H, I292T, H300Y, T325I, S327L, T334I, D340N, P344S, D348H, T362I, P364L) from
the N protein of reference strain. CFSSP (Chou and Fasman secondary structure prediction)
was used to predict the secondary structure of NTD-wild, NTD-cons, CTD-wild, and CTDcons of N protein of the SARS-CoV-2 (Kumar, 2013). Then we built a 3D structure of NTDcons and CTD-cons through Swiss-Model homology modelling using 6M3A and 6YUN as a
template (Waterhouse et al., 2018). Structural differences of NTD-wild and NTD-cons, and
CTD-wild and CTD-cons were visualized in PyMol v2.4.

of the most frequently occurred mutations (NTD- A55S, E62V, P67T, D81Y, D103Y,

D340N, P344S, D348H, T362I, P364L) were predicted. Protein structure stability parameters
such as atomic fluctuations, vibrational entropy, deformation energies, and mutational impact
on protein stability were also predicted by the DynaMut server with a well-established
predictive normal mode approach. We have calculated free energy difference (ΔΔG) and
vibrational entropy energy (ΔΔSVib ENCoM) by using Dynamut which gives us the report
about the impact in protein stability and flexibility in response to mutations in the wild-type
structure. Structural changes, such as changes in cavity volume, packing density, , and
accessible surface area were correlated with the free energy differences (ΔΔG) and that’s why
it is an indicator of the effect of a mutation on protein stability (Eriksson et al., 1992). The

ΔΔG value below zero indicates that the mutation causes destabilization and above zero
means protein stabilization. For two or more mutational effect prediction, we used FoldX
v.5.0 with their default parameters and three times run (Delgado et al., 2019) plugin in
YASARA. Measurement of Gibbs free energy (ΔΔG) between mutant and WT (ΔΔG =

Δ‫ܩ‬mutant − Δ‫ܩ‬WT) in unfolding state, FoldX predicts how much protein mutations get into
the stability. FoldX first repaired the structure and then predict the mutational effect. The
foldX free energy value indicates highly destabilizing (ΔΔG > +1.84 kcal/mol), destabilizing
(+0.92 kcal/mol < ΔΔG ≤ +1.84 kcal/mol), slightly destabilizing (+0.46 kcal/mol < ΔΔG ≤
+0.92 kcal/mol), neutral (−0.46 kcal/mol < ΔΔG ≤ +0.46 kcal/mol), slightly stabilizing
(−0.92 kcal/mol ≤ ΔΔG < −0.46 kcal/mol), stabilizing (−1.84 kcal/mol ≤ ΔΔG < −0.92
kcal/mol), highly stabilizing (ΔΔG < −1.84 kcal/mol) (Buß et al., 2018; Studer et al., 2014).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in N protein gene implicates a
continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2
A total of 61,485 cleaned full-length N protein gene sequences were obtained through
trimming of the low quality, ambiguous, and non-human host sequences from 67,124
complete (or near-complete) genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available in GISAID
reported from 145 countries and/or regions of the six continents of the world till 17 July,
2020 (Supplementary Data 1). Compared to the reference genome of the SARS-CoV-2
(Wuhan-Hu-1 strain: Accession NC_045512.2), mutational analyses revealed 49.15 % (n =
30,221) nucleotide-level mutant strains, and 93.73 % (n = 28,327) of the mutant strains
carrying at least one aa substitutions in their N protein sequences (Supplementary data 2).
Interestingly, 64.60% (n = 17,205) sequences carrying two aa mutations throughout the N
protein, whereas a maximum five aa substitutions found in strains of England, USA, and
India (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Data 2). Moreover, country or region-specific aa mutation
patterns revealed the highest percent of N protein mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains in Wales
(68.69%) followed by India (68.28 %), England (67.70 %), Scotland (51.29 %), Spain (42.95
%), Australia (37.51 %), and USA (17.87 %) (Supplementary Data 1). However, we did not
find any aa substitution in the full-length N protein sequences of 29 countries and/or regions
(Supplementary Data 1).
In this study, we found 1034 nucleotide substitutions in 745 unique positions of the N
protein gene. Of the nucleotide mutated strains, 53.21% (n = 16,081) sequences carried three
nucleotide mutations throughout the N gene while 12 strains from England, India, and USA
showed the highest number (n = 7) of nucleotide mutations (Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 2).
Overall, these nucleotide changes resulted in 684 nonsynonymous aa substitutions distributed

across 317 unique positions of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Supplementary Data 2).
Therefore, considering the total length of N protein (419 aa), our analysis identified 75.66 %
aa positions undergoing evolutionary changes in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid globally.
Simultaneously, 59.27% positions of the nucleotide primary structure (n = 1,257) encoding
N-protein showed evolutionary changes (Supplementary Data 2). We also found 391 codon
mutation at nucleotide level, of those 81.07% mutations were nonsynonymous. A recent
study based on a set of 38,318 genome sequences reported a total of 10,983 instances of aa
substitutions and observed change in ~60% aa positions (250 out of 419 aa residues) in N
protein (Ye et al., 2020). These results are implying the continuous evolution of the N protein
of SARS-CoV-2.
The two largest domains of N protein, NTD (RNA binding Domain) and CTD
(Dimerization domain), had 82 and 83 aa positions substitutions, respectively, on the other
hand 21 aa substitutions found within the highly flexible SR-rich domain of the linker region
(Fig. 1B). Amino acid group transformation among polar, nonpolar, positively charged, and
negatively charged across the NTD and CTD regions may alter the interaction of N protein
and viral RNA, and thus affect viral replication, pathogenicity, RNA stability, and disease
severity (Surjit and Lal, 2010; Wang et al., 2010). Noteworthy, our previous study found
47.57 % aa positions (606 out of 1274 aa) of the S protein undergoing aa-level evolution
worldwide till June 12, 2020 (Rahman et al., 2020). However, some previous reports claimed
the N gene more conserved and fewer mutations over time (Dutta et al., 2020; Grifoni et al.,
2020). In contrast with these reports, our findings reveal more evolutionary nature with
frequent mutations of the N gene compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, which reflects the
fragility of the N protein as an alternative vaccine target to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.
The aa position 180 of the N protein was found to be hypervariable showing 6 aa
variations in this particular position. We found 9 sites (aa positions: 13, 80, 185, 191, 195,

203, 216, 378, 385) exhibiting 5 types of aa variations, and 30, 72, 92, and 113 unique sites
showed 4, 3, 2, and 1 aa variability, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). One aa position
(80) of the NTD showed 5 types aa variations while two aa positions (128, 144) of the NTD
showed 4 types of aa variations, followed by 15 and 23 sites showing 3 and 2 types of aa
variations, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, the CTD region of the N protein possessed 4, 15
and 27 sites showing 4, 3, and 2 aa variations, respectively (Table 2). The aa variabilities
across these domains included the non-polar, polar, positively, or negatively charged groups
(Table 1, Table 2). Furthermore, of the five aa variations at position 203 (R203K/M/S/I/G)
within the SR-rich domain, the substitution R203K occurred most frequently in 68.09% of
the mutated strains globally followed by the substitution G204R found in 67.94% mutated
strains of the SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2). Zhou et al. (2020) reported a
distinctive polymorphism in SR-rich fragment of SARS-CoV-2 N protein with an extra
SRXX repeat and divided this variable segment into 23 different types based on 3233
sequences that alarms of a constant evolution of the SR-rich region (Zhou et al., 2020).
It is noteworthy that the NTD and CTD regions are predicted to encompass major
antigenic sites of the N protein of the SARS-CoV (Surjit and Lal, 2009). Antibodies against
the N protein could persist for a longer period, and may occur in greater abundance in SARSCoV patients than antibodies against other structural proteins such as the membrane, spike, ,
and envelope proteins (Wang et al., 2010). This could be due to the expression of higher
levels of N protein, compared with other viral proteins, after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 N protein is strongly antigenic, and thus could play a significant role
in the of the host immune response generation, and preventing the immunopathological
damage (Dutta et al., 2020). Thus, aa variations in the antigenically critical domains of N
protein may alter immunopathogenicity of the virus, which needs to be considered before the
therapeutic interventions of the N protein.

The Wu-Kabat protein variability plot showed the position-specific aa variations with
respect to their frequency (Fig. 3). The current variability analysis identified 41 positions
showing Wu-Kabat variability coefficient 5, where coefficient 1 indicates no variability
compared to the reference strain. The maximum coefficient found for position 203
(coefficient, 8.75) followed by positions 180 (7.01), 13 (6.11), 195 (6.01), 185 (6.01), 191
(6.01), 378 (6.01), 80 (6.00), 216 (6.00), and 385 (6.00) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 2). Of
the structural aa (n = 419) of the N protein, 24.10 % of positions had protein variability
coefficient 1 indicating the conservancy of these positions.
3.2 Frequent nonsynonymous mutations impact upon N protein structure and stability
To observe the possible impact on secondary and tertiary structure of the NTD and
CTD domain of N protein of these frequent nonsynonymous mutations, secondary and
tertiary structures were analyzed. It revealed changes in helix, sheet, and turn composition in
the secondary structure of the consensus (Fig. 4). These findings indicated the significant
impact of the high –frequency nonsynonymous substitutions on the secondary structure of
NTD and CTD domains of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, and changing the secondary
structure may alter the function of these domains. Furthermore, the homology consensus
modeling of this study revealed that the substitutions causing aa group transversions affected
the overall tertiary structure of the domains (Fig. 5, Table 1, Table 2). Group changing aa
may significantly affect the ultimate functions of the N protein including virus replication,
pathogenesis, and disease severity (Islam et al., 2020b). Furthermore, the higher mutation
rates of this protein in India, Wales, and European countries warrants the effect of the geoclimatic conditions, and ethnic groups. The current evolutionary findings offer important and
timely insight relevant to the SARS–CoV-2 N protein heterogeneity throughout the world

The ΔΔG values for the two high frequency aa substitutions R203K and G204R in
the SR-rich region, were 0.460 kcal/mol and 1.361 kcal/mol, respectively implicating these
changes stabilize the N structure (modelled in Phyre2). We also closely inspected the changes
in the intramolecular interactions due to these two mutations (R203K and G204R) in N
protein and found significant variation ((Fig. 6A-D). An average of the configurational
entropies of the protein is revealed by vibrational entropy within single minima of the energy
landscape (Goethe et al., 2015). For both mutations (R203K, and G204R), the vibrational
entropy energy (ΔΔSVib ENCoM) between the wild-type, and the mutant, ΔΔSVib ENCoM
values were -0.137 kcal.mol-1.K-1, and -1.497 kcal.mol-1.K-1 respectively, which indicate the
decrease of molecular flexibility in the N protein.

The overall decrease in the flexibility due to substitution R203K conferred the
rigidification of the protein structure at aa positions (201-209, 254-261) whereas that
mutation moved to flexibility at aa positions (362-404) (Fig. 6E). The G204R mutation also
influenced the overall decrease of flexibility, and thus aa positions (21-46, 202-206,215-226,
240-248) gained rigidification. However, the 200-202 aa positions of the N protein showed
optimum flexibility due to G204R mutation (Fig. 6F). Therefore, only the R203K mutation
affected the CTD (dimerization domain) at 254-261 aa positions which decreased the
flexibility of the domain (Fig. 6E). In our study, we found total strains 19,246 where both
R203K and G204R mutation observed throughout the 89 countries or region (Supplementary
Data 2).

We have also observed the effect of the double mutations in FoldX (Schymkowitz et
al., 2005). For the paired mutations, we found ΔΔG = 3.42262 kcal/mol which indicates
highly destabilizing the structure. We also found deletion at the same position in the N
protein of SARS-Cov-2 (Table 5). For NTD and CTD structural effect analyses, we

considered original structures from RCSB Protein Data Bank 6M3A and 6YUN, respectively.
The effects of different high frequency mutation on NTD and CTD are described in Table 3.
A55S, P67T, D81Y, A119V, P122L, D128Y, L139F, D144Y substitutions increase the
stability of NTD structure whereas E62V, D103Y, A119S, A152S, A156S, L161F, P168S
substitutions decrease the stability of that same structure. Again, E62V, P67T, D144Y, P168S
substitutions increase the molecular flexibility but A55S, D81Y, D103Y, A119S, A119V,
P122L, D128Y, L139F, A152S, A156S, L161F decrease the molecular flexibility of RNA
binding domain (Table 3).

For CTD domain, H300Y, T325I, S327L, T334I, D340N, T362I, P364L changes
increased stability, on the other hand, A252S, Q289H, I292T, P344S, D348H changes
decrease molecular stability. T362I, P364L, Q289H, I292T substitutions increase flexibility
but A252S, H300Y, T325I, S327L, T334I, D340N, P344S, D348H decrease molecular
flexibility (Table 3). We also found that coevolving nonsynonymous mutations (A55S,
D103Y) at England (35 strains) and Wales (1 strain); (R93L, D103Y) at England (8 strains);
(D103Y, A119P) at England (4 strains); (D103Y, T165I) at England (2 strains); (G97S,
N140T) at Russia (4 strains) in NTD region and (271I, T325I) at England (5 strains); (A252S,
S310C) at wales (3 strains) in CTD domain of SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Supplementary Data
2). We analyzed the impact of these coevolving nonsynonymous mutations on NTD structure
(6M3A) and CTD structure (6YUN) by using FoldX. Coevolving mutations (D103Y, T165I)
have stabilizing (ΔΔG = -1.083 kcal/mol) effect, whereas (G97S, N140T) and (R93L,
D103Y) substitutions (ΔΔG = -0.739 kcal/mol; ΔΔG = -0.706 kcal/mol) showed slightly
stabilizing impact. On the other hand, (D103Y, A119P) mutation have neutral effect (ΔΔG =
-0.046 kcal/mol), whereas (A55S, D103Y) substitutions destabilize (ΔΔG = 1.171 kcal/mol)
the RNA binding domain.

In dimerization domain (CTD), (T271I, T325I) change have neutral effect (ΔΔG = 0.268 kcal/mol) but A252S and S310C substitutions highly destabilized (ΔΔG = -2.149
kcal/mol) the original CTD structure. Ye at al. 2020 identified RNA-binding domain residues
by NMR peak shifts (A50, T57, H59, R92, I94, S105, R107, R149, and Y172). Our analyses
observed aa substitutions in RNA-binding domain (6 residues A50E (Wuhan), A50V
(England and India), H59P (Morocco), R92S (India), I94V (England), S105N (USA).
Noteworthy, a previous study reported only one mutation (A50E) in the putative RNA
binding surface (Ye et al., 2020). From these findings, it can be conclusively stated that the
high-frequency aa substitutions are changing the stability, and intramolecular interactions of
N protein with in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA implicating a critical functional consequence.

3.3 Mutations in the primer binding sites might hamper the efficiency of RT-PCR
In our present study, we observed mutational changes in the regions of 11 primer-probe sets
recommended for nucleic acid-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 4). We found a total
of 367 mutations within the primer binding regions for all the well characterized primer sets
of the studied here (Table 4). The dynamics of mutations in the primer binding region
revealed a total of 367 mutations within the primer binding sites of the primer sets studied
(Table 4). The primers sets carried 11-31 mutations within forward/reverse primer binding
sites. Minimum mismatch (n=11) in forward and reverse primers of CDC (USA)
recommended set N2 and forward primers of Hong Kong University and Park et al. (2020),
whereas maximum (n=31) mismatches were found in the forward primer binding sites of
China, CDC primer set (Table 4). The CDC, USA recommended 3 primer sets showing
comparatively fewer mutations than many of the other primer sets (Table 4). Remarkably, no
strains found to have 3’ end mismatch with the N1 forward primer (CDC, US), whereas
reverse primer of this set showed 27 mutations worldwide including 3´-end mismatch with
some strains from Netherlands. SARS-CoV-2 strains from Finland contained 3´-end

mismatch with the N2 forward primer (USA, CDC) and the 3´-end of this reverse primer
mismatched with some viruses from USA and England. Strains of Senegal and India were
found to have 3´-end mismatches with the forward and reverse primers, respectively, in
reference to the CDC (USA) recommended N3 primer set. However, taking only 180 strains
into consideration, Nalla et al. (2020) found no mismatch within CDC (USA) recommended
N2 primer set showing more sensitivity than N1 and N3. In our study, we found
comparatively lower mutations (11 mutations individually in forward and reverse primer) in
the N2 set, supporting its superiority for COVID-19 detection (Table 4). The Chinese CDC
recommended primer set had 3´-end mismatch with the SARS-Cov-2 strains of Luxembourg
(forward primer), and India, Canada, Wales, England (reverse primer). Again, forward
primers of Hong Kong University and P1 set of Park et al. (2020) had no 3´-end mismatch
with the global sequence dataset used in this study (Table 4). However, mutations in the
primer binding sites, importantly at 3’ end, may affect the RT-PCR-based COVID-19
detection resulting in false negative results (Nalla et al., 2020; Rana and Pokhrel, 2020).
Moreover, we found notable sequence variations (n = 140) at probe recognition sites of the
primers studied here in the virus strains from different countries and/or regions (Table 4,
Supplementary data 2). Remarkably, CDC (China) recommended probe showed lowest
mismatch (n = 10), whereas probe of CDC (USA) designed N1 primer exhibited maximum
variations (n = 29). Other primer-probes carried 12-24 mismatches along the probe
recognition site in the virus globally. Noteworthy, Park et al. (2020) designed primers were
implemented for traditional PCR and SYBR Green dye-based real-time RT-PCR, which
methods required no probes. However, besides primer mismatch, sequence variations in
probe recognition sites might also affect the efficiency of RT-PCR-based detection of
COVID-19 providing false negative (unable to bind) or false positive (non-specific binding)
results (Kamau et al., 2017; Nalla et al., 2020).

Analyzing only 180 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, Nalla et al. (2020) also reported primer-probe
mismatches in strains of different countries with lower PCR sensitivity. But their
investigation could not represent the global scenario due to limited sequences they
considered. Strikingly, our study provides a global insight of N protein evolution and its
consequences on primer-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR method. Overall,
global evolutionary insights on the primer-probe binding sites explore the undetected fragility
of N gene-based nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2, which warrant continuous
monitoring and redesign of primer-probe sequences for efficient and accurate detection of
COVID-19.
3.4 Amino acid deletions within the flexible SR-rich domain impact negatively c
Besides the synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, our analysis explored 11 inframe deletions of different ranged nucleotides across the N nucleocapsid sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 originated from different countries worldwide (Table 5). The deleted
nucleotide sequences distributed from 492 to 717 which fall into 3 major regions of N protein
i.e. nt-positon ranges 492-494 (aa: 165), 578-633 (aa: 193-211) and 715-717 (aa: 239) (Table
5). Amino acid deletion at position 165 in the NTD RNA binding domain is not in the surface
exposed region. Deletions of aa positioned 194-211 are in or close to the SR-rich linker
region, and aa of position 239 is close to CTD domain and surface exposed (Fig 7). Surface
exposed deletions near the CTD region may have a significant impact on nucleocapsid-RNA
interaction and virus pathogenesis (Islam et al., 2020). Among the deletions, nucleotide
deletion positioned 578-633 (aa: 193-211) found in multiple strains of multiple countries
including Turkey, Bosnia, Australia, Malaysia, Germany, Scotland, England, Wales, and
USA (Table 5, Supplementary Data 1). However, previously we explored 12 deletion-sites of
ranged nucleotides in polyprotein (n = 9; NSP1:6, NSP2:1, NSP8:1, NSP15:1), ORF10 (n=1)

and 3´-UTR (n=2) and 4 major deletion-sites in S protein while no deletions found among
strains globally (Islam et al., 2020a; Rahman et al., 2020).

These deletions may affect the virus-host interactions, immune-modulations,
attenuation, and pathogenicity, by potentially influencing the tertiary structures and functions
of the proteins (Islam et al., 2020b; Phan, 2020). Though, possible consequences of the
deletions need to be observed to explore the immuno-pathogenic functions of the proteins and
further implication in the development of effective therapeutics and prophylactics for SARSCoV-2.

4. Conclusion
This study comprehensively explored the global evolution of SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid till 17 July, 2020. Our mutational analyses revealed 49.15 % nucleotide-level
mutant strains, and 46.07 % of the mutant strains undergoing aa substitutions in their N
protein sequences. We found mutational mismatches within primer binding sites particularly
at 3’ end of the primer sets targeting N gene, which may result in inconsistent or higher false
negative rates in detection tests of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, this study found significant
impact of the amino acid group transversions along with deletion mutations on the tertiary
structure and functions of the nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2. As N protein variation is high
compared to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, vaccine candidate targeting N will be
challenging. Overall, this study warrants continuous monitoring of the ongoing evolution of
the SARS-CoV-2 N protein for prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.
